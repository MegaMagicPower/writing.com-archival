Taking a sip from her extra large soft drink, she let out a belch and focused back on her TV special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming Ramona dearest!\" a voice yelled from the kitchen. That voice belonged to non other than Scott Pilgrim, all around average boy. Well that wasn't entirely true. While he looked average with his unkempt hair, green shirt and jeans ensemble, he had more fighting experience than you can shake a stick at. He had managed to defeat Ramona's seven evil exes, including the extremely tough Gideon Graves. Now Ramona was his and he had been doing something... somewhat unusual with his new found girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Scott was in to larger women. While he enjoyed Ramona at her current size, he had always wondered what she would look like with some extra weight. Opening a huge bag of Cheetos, Scott proceeded to head to Ramona's living room to grace her with the snack food, doing everything in his power to keep her from being too active. As he entered the room housing Ramona's television, he took in the site in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona had to be at least 20 pounds heavier than she had been before dating Scott. He had been working the past month to add calories to her food and thus fat to her body and his handiwork showed! Ramona now had a cute double chin whenever she would look down. Soon enough it would be a permanent fixture, or at least Scott hoped so. Further down Ramona's breasts had stolen a fair amount of the fat she had gained, blowing up another cup size. They strained her black tanktop, cleavage welling slightly over the top of the material due to their size. Under her breasts rested a pudgy little belly. While it was nothing too big, it definitely was soft and rolled over the waistband of her shorts, a nice starter belly that was a sign of more weight to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of shorts, the shorts she had on may as well have been considered underwear, they were so small and tight. While it was hard to tell currently as Ramona was sitting down, her chunky ass had started to eat the material of the shorts, exposing her butt crack at the top and the bottom of her buttcheeks below. Ramona turned as she heard Scott come in, a smile gracing her face. Her hair, an odd style that was short all over except for two giant strands of hair that ran down the side towards her shoulders, was a bright aqua blue today. Ramona had a habit of changing her hair color on a regular basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally I've been starving!\" Ramona said as she took the bag from Scott, digging in to the Cheetos with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry hun, went as quick as I could. That trip from the kitchen was a real killer. So much distance!\" Scott said jokingly as Ramona giggled between bites of Cheetos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how is the new promotion at Amazon treating you?\" Scott said curiously, genuinely wondering if Ramona enjoyed her new position at the online shopping giant.</span></div></div>",

Returning to Ramona, he handed it to her and the American ninja dove right in, practically cramming the entire loaf down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott watched and noticed her stomach actually expanding, her butt as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajor Poundage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, he could saw a digital counter over Ramona's head as continued to count up, stopping at...</span></div></div>",

He was incredibly turned on by Ramona's gain. He pictured his girlfriend just sitting there, eating and getting curvier than ever. Scott had an idea: \"How about going to this new fastfood restaurant that opened last week?\" \"You're serious? I already feel like I'm about to pop\", answered Ramona, looking down at her bloated belly. \"Oh, I thought you could afford more than that\", said Scott a little disappointed. \"I mean I defeated seven superman-like exes of your's for you, and you can't even eat a little for me.\" \"OK, fine. We'll go to the restaurant\", said Ramona. She had no idea how she would manage to eat even more, but she would deal with this problem when they arrived. </span></div></div>",

They entered the restaurant, which was rather a fast-food store. The two of them headed straight to the front. \"Hey Julie\", said Scott, when he saw the black haired girl that stood behind the bar. \"Hi *** Pilgrim\", she responded. Her eyes said, that she wasn't really happy to see him. When she greeted him, her mouth was censored. \"She's gently as ever. How does she manage to work at so many places at the same time\", thought Ramona, reminding herself of several other shops were she had seen Julie. \"Anything you could recommend to us?\", asked Scott. \"We got something new. It's called the seven deadly meals. If a person manages to eat them all, the person will get them for free\", she said. Before Scott could answer anything, Ramona said: \"Sounds great. We'll take one of these and a hamburger and chips.\" She went of to a seat, and Scott followed her. \"She already ate so much, how will she manage that?\", thought Scott, when he saw the first huge burger and chips arrive at their place. Ramona dug in instantly. To Scott's total surprise, she managed to eat the first meal within two minutes. Her belly pushed down her shorts. </span></div></div>",

At the sight of all this, ramona's stomach started to growl at her.<br>\r\n\"Scott, baby, im starting to feel a little hungry. Can you cook me just a small meal?\"<br>\r\nWithout hesitation scott rushed into the kitchen and made more of his legendary garlic bread. He could imagine ramona, sitting on the table eating away as she grew bigger and bigger. After he was finished he prented the bread to ramona. He watched her devour her meal instantly. an 8-bit counter displayed over her head resulting in more weight gain. \"Twenty pounds\" read the counter above ramonas head. Scott watched as her breasts grew a little larger and her butt plumper as well as a little flab on her belly.<br>\r\n\"Scott, that was the best garlic bread ive ever eaten in my entire life!\" <br>\r\nScott got a little cocky and replied \"wait until you try dessert.\"<br>\r\n\"Bring it on pligrim, i can eat anything you put in front of me!\" Ramona said excitedly.<br>\r\nScott baked everything from cakes to cookies carmel apples, fudge, and brownies. One plate after another scott handed to ramona was sure to be quickly eaten.  She ate and ate and ate becoming larger fatter and more voluminous than ever. The poundage meter grew from twenty to thirty to forty to fifty and on and on until... nothing... ramona sat back on her chair, inhaled, and streched.<br>\r\n\"Babe...

They were circular and at shoulder level to ramona and scott And wide enough for a regular sized adult to fit through. But due to ramona's now excess weight,  she was clearly larger. Her boobs now Almost bursting out of her top and her shirt now unable to cover her gained belly. But now her shorts now squeezed her now massive plump butt as it struggled to cover its thickness. a panty line was visible and retained against her fat voluptious booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey out This way.\" Ramona said as she opened one of the windows.

Next she halted around her belly as it refused to move forward with her.<br>\r\n\"Scott, honey can i get some help?<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, ramona.\" Answered scott.<br>\r\nScott pusher on her belly and instantly became aroused.  The feeling of her bloated belly turned him on. He began to play with it, grabbing it in his hands. Until he heard a suction noise.<br>\r\n\"Thanks babe.\" Ramona said as her belly slipped through. <br>\r\n\"Now i just need to...\" her voice trailed off... \"i... need.. too..\" she strained.  She pulled herself from the sided of the window but instantly came back.<br>\r\n\"Why.. c-cant..i... move...\" struggled ramona.<br>\r\nScott watched with delight as he watched his sexy plump girlfriend struggle with her fat jiggling slightly with every movement.<br>\r\n\"Scott, i... i need a push.\"<br>\r\nScott placed his hands on ramonas now plump butt. His hands sinked into her flesh as he pushed. He was playing more than pushing and it turned on ramona as well as scott. She then decided to tease him. She tried to move back in but her belly and breasts blocked her from returning. She groaned as she struggled<br>\r\n\"Scott push harder, i think im stuck...\"<br>\r\n\"there's no way.\" Said scott \" how are you stuck?\"<br>\r\n\"This window is too small and all that eating made me so fat, babe.

I need you to push on my fat butt im so helpless .\"<br>\r\nScott was turned on and began to shove more and more. Pressing his face into ramonas fleshy behind. With every shove ramona let out a soft moan. <br>\r\nit was no use she was truly stuck, Unable to budge. Her massive butt clogged up the window and was causing stress marks to show On her behind. Scott then exits through the window beside her and r<br>\r\nReaches to her.<br>\r\n\"Give me your hands.\" Scott pulled and pulled. Watching her struggle more and more jiggling more and more.

Scott went back around to Ramona's massive backside and saw that her butt was way too big to fit through due to its growth from eating too much. Scott began to push on ramonas humongous booty with great force. Dispite all of the pushing, Ramona's plump butt would squish around the sides of the hole with her fat folding and bunching up from the pressure. <br>\r\n\"It all comes... From eating too much!\" Said Scott <br>\r\n\"No... It's because... Ugh! This stupid hole..

Scott couldn't help but stare in awe at the sight of her glorious gut, which had grown greatly from her gluttony. Her arms, normally lean, now looked thicker as her sleeves tightened around them. Her shorts began to pop at the front as a button shot past his head, causing him to nearly jump from fright. But as soon as he'd done so his eyes rested once more on Ramona's corpulent form. He could hear the narrator even now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel up!<br>\r\n+4 Fat<br>\r\n+4 Fetish<br>\r\n-2 Speed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm...

Scott could hardly keep his eyes off of her, wondering briefly what it must feel like to rub those extra pounds. Of course, unlike Scott, Ramona wasn't the kind to daydream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Scott, if you keep staring you'll look like a creep,\" Ramona remarked dryly, causing Scott to suddenly snap from his thoughts and rejoin reality. His reaction was almost exactly what Ramona expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Uh... You... Ah...\" Scott failed to be in any way coherent. He wasn't known for making good comebacks. Ramona's plump lips curled into a smirk however as she began to laugh. Pushing herself up from her seat, revealing a deep imprint of her rather shapely behind, the blue-haired American girl stood face to face with Scott, wrapping her arms around his neck as she planted a kiss on his lips. Struggling to contain himself as her curvaceous form was pressed up against him, Scott made do with simply embracing her in a hug for a moment before they released one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's the plan Scott?\" Ramona asked with her hands on her hips, resting her (admittedly heavy) weight on one foot as she raised her brow curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking...\"</span></div></div>",

All these new people in a new place that she didn't know, the pressure that comes with new room mates you don't know, and the difficulty of balancing college lectures with a fledgeling social life. In the end it got all a bit too much for her and her mind just sort of shut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnives found that life got alot easier and less stressful if you stopped worrying about it all, and so that is what she did. So what started out as a period of 'rest' to get everything back together pretty much never stopped, days were spent simply lounging around her student accomodation in her pyjamas whilst watching tv, and snacking. Occasionally her room mates dragged her outside but she always made them pick somewhere to go that was both close by and had seating, for frankly she couldn't be bothered with the walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks of this had resulted in a small gain in Knives, a little belly had started to form but she didn't care, she just chose to lay on the couch snacking all day long, until....</span></div></div>",

To fall in love for the first time in her life and then to be broken up less than a minute after confessing it to him....Knives is truely devistated and heart broken.<br>\r\nShe has no idea why she came here, only that she could not go home like this, her father would freak out and maybe go insane. So she just sits there, alone in her booth crying her eyes out until she is told by an overly unforgiving waitress that she has to order something or leave. Without thinking she orders the usual pizza she would have with Scott as a force of habit and then cries some more.<br>\r\nShe is eventually brought the pizza, it is the largest size the resteraunt has and given that she only ever ate 1/4 of it, she knew she could not manage the entire thing by herself. Looking at it she cries some more and begins to eat, not wanting to waste food.<br>\r\nAnd so she begins to eat the first slice, still crying over what has transpired.<br>\r\nBy the time she begins to eat the third slice, her crying has moved to sobbing, and by the time she begins to eat the forth slice, her sobbing has stopped as her focus is now on the food.<br>\r\nThe other slices pass by unnoticed until she finds she has finished the entire thing. Her stomach distored and bloated as she ate 4 times as much pizza as she could handle and is therefore in pain...but not the same kind of pain as her broken heart felt. No this pain was much more tolerable as she just groans and rubs her swollen stomach, her mind taken off of Scott Pilgrim as the eating proved to be a fantastic distraction for her.<br>\r\nAfter letting her stomach settle for a bit she pays the bill and heads to the bus stop, her mind still full of Scott, yet she does not feel quite so sad. Only after passing the doughnut shop does she think that perhaps eating all that pizza is what brought her some comfort during her suffering. Placing her hand on her swollen and painful stomach she comes to the conclusion that this must be the case and immediately goes back to the doughnut shop she just passed to buy two dozen doughnuts to take home. Hopeing not to need them but deciding it's better to have them and not need them than need them and not have them.<br>\r\nLater at home....</span></div></div>",
