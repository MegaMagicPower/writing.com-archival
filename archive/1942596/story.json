She'd had the oddest dream last night, one in which the fattest woman she'd ever seen had said something about... eating people? Odd, to be sure, but something in the back of her mind said that it wasn't just an odd thought that had occurred last night. Her thoughts left the dream as she went about choosing the day's wardrobe. After putting on her underwear, she slid a pair of denim shorts over her wide hips, and a blue button-up shirt covered her modest bust and round belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby possessed a most unusual body, in that she was probably the fittest fat person on the campus of Metro University. Ever since she was little, she'd dreamed of being a hero, and of course heroes were strong. So, she trained however she could; lifting weights, running, and anything else she could think of. At the same time, Abby had something of a sweet tooth, which had left more then a few extra pounds on her belly, hips, and thighs. And while she had become pretty strong, she had also become pretty chubby, and the fat didn't seem to go away no matter what she did. It had caused her some distress at first, but Abby had grown to accept that she'd always be huskier than most other women. At least she had the muscle buried under the fat to help move her wider frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone dressing herself, Abby's thoughts returned to the dream as she poured herself a bowl of cereal. As has been mentioned, she'd always wanted to be a hero. And, if she really did have this power, Abby now had to ability to fulfill that dream. But first, she'd have to test this power. More than that, she'd have to test it on someone who deserved it. After all, heroes didn't go around devouring just anyone! As she thought, Abby finished off her cereal before she knew it, and found herself still hungry. And, wouldn't you know it, there was no more cereal now either. Or really, any food in her dorm room - Abby had meant to go shopping for more of it today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got up to go, Abby finally decided who to test the power on. Sure, she might get a free meal out of doing this, but this was mainly to serve the cause of justice! The first person Abby was going to devour was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today was a Saturday, which meant no classes. Abby usually spent an hour of Saturday mornings in the Metro University gym. Sure, the workouts never burned off any fat, but Abby liked shocking people who assumed that just because she was round she was out of shape. The jiggling her flesh made as she worked out was also oddly pleasurable. And so, Abby found herself on a treadmill, her belly bouncing up and down as she jogged in place. Her eyes were drawn to a television that the gym had set up above the treadmills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the television, Abby could see a local news report about Connie Calvin, a convicted criminal who had recently broken out of police custody during her trial. \"Cutter Connie\" was a mugger who mostly targeted young women. The report talked about how dangerous Connie was, and about rewards for any information leading to the criminal's arrest. There was, of course, images shown of Connie; it was a little hard to believe that the blonde, slightly overweight woman being shown was really as dangerous as the report was saying. The orange jumpsuit that she was wearing in the picture shown on TV didn't entirely disguise her thick body, and Connie's face was slightly puffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Abby long to decide that such a criminal was a good place to start her superhero career. People like Connie had to be taken care of for the good of society, after all! On her way back to her room to prepare for her debut, Abby bought a roast beef sandwich at the campus cafeteria. It was delicious, but it didn't eliminate the hunger that had been growing all day. A hunger, that Abby decided, was her hunger for JUSTICE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby arrived at her room soon enough, and out of a drawer at the bottom of her dresser, she pulled out some clothes. Specifically, some black spandex pants, a black spandex top, and a mask. It took a little effort to put them on, but the spandex fit pretty well. I mean, sure, they really didn't disguise how round Abby's belly and butt were, but Abby had learned long ago to accept her body for what it was. People would just have to accept that not all superheroines were not the extreme hourglasses that most comic artists drew them as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby spent most of the afternoon alternately doing some homework for her classes and waiting impatiently for night to come. Dinner was two cups of instant ramen noodles, which didn't really fill her up at all. However, finally, the sun went down, and it was time for justice! Abby put on some black boots which complemented the black spandex that she had on, and put the mask on. It had a hole in the top that let her hair out, and a slight mesh over the eyes that let her see through it, but kept them disguised for the most part. Her mouth was uncovered, fortunately enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby moved quickly off of campus and into the neighborhoods where Connie had robbed people before she had been arrested. It was probably the best place to start looking for the mugger, Abby figured. She patted her belly as she felt another hunger pang. She was hungry for JUSTICE, and hoped that tonight that hunger would be assuaged.</span></div></div>",

Either that, or people were just ignoring the fat girl in the spandex, but Abby liked to think it was her unexpected skills. She stopped thinking about that, though, when she heard a cry for help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the speed she could muster, Abby sprinted towards the shout, her entire body bouncing rhythmically up and down with the movement of her legs. Fortunately, Abby wasn't too late, and arrived just in time to see Connie pull a knife on an overweight young woman who was wearing glasses. Connie had apparently ditched her prison jumpsuit, and had robbed a clothing store before attempting her latest crime. The clothing store also hadn't seemed to carry any clothes in Connie's size; the chubby criminal had stuffed her body into a tube top and shorts that left her cleavage of display and gave her a severe case of muffin top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby paused, assumed a pose, and shouted, \"STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie turned to look at the would-be hero, a look of confusion on her face. \"Who are you supposed to be, fatso?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby had spent most of today thinking of a name, and now proudly yelled, \"I am Gastrowoman, and your reign of terror ends today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer piece said, Abby rushed at Connie, prepared to do her first real rescue.</span></div></div>",

By the time she had pulled her knife, a chubby fist had slammed into her chest, and sent her dropping to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof...\" she sputtered as she hit the dirt. This girl hit a lot harder than expected, too. Abby stood over her down opponent and grinned.<br>\r\n\"Give up?\"<br>\r\nThe escapee coughed and lurched, clearly too winded to say anything. The heroine simply stood there, awkwardly as she waited for a response. She knew she was strong, but she'd expected Connie to be tougher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stop now, finish her!\" yelled the would be victim.<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Stomp her into jelly before she gets up!\"<br>\r\nConnie tried pulling herself up, but fell flat on her face.<br>\r\n\"Not so sure I need to...\" the plus sized avenger commented.<br>\r\n\"It's a trick! She's a bloodthirsty animal!\"<br>\r\n\"L-look, I'm not about to kill someone!\"<br>\r\n\"She's reaching for her knife!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, the villain could barely stand, but she was still trying to retrieve her weapon. \"Just...gimme...gimme two seconds...give me a minute an I'll...I'll cut you up good for that...\"<br>\r\nThe bespectacled girl held her arm out to reiterate the point.<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay! She's obviously too dangerous to keep around...\"<br>\r\n\"Should I look away? Is this gonna be messy?\"<br>\r\n\"Not so much...\" Gastrowoman laughed slightly and waddled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching down, she carefully yanked  the knife from Connie's hand and tossed it to the side The criminal scowled at her before her attacker began to open her mouth wide. In the dark, her throat resembled some dark abyss.<br>\r\n\"Uh...okay, I surrender...\" she said weakly, before two meaty hands grabbed her arms and pulled her close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl watched on as her rescuer devoured her mugger, staring in utter shock.She couldn't tell if this was better or worse than just flat out killing her. Stepping around to see the show, she saw Gastrowoman's fat cheek balloon out as she stuffed the villain deeper and deeper into her throat. Her lips lurched over more and more of the woman's body and pulled it in further. It was not unlike watching a python swallow an antelope...but seeing a human do it was an entirely different experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gawd! <i><b>UurRAAARRRP!</b></i> D-damn it! Holy hell!\" The engorged heroine dropped onto her fat backside as the last of her meal fell into her stomach. This wasn't anything like she was expecting. It was like eating every meal for the whole year all at once, and not entirely in a good way. She was beyond full, beyond stuffed, she had never felt anything like it. As satisfied as she may have been, it was painful and exhausting. She could hardly breathe, and had the strangest stomach ache from Connie's kicking and squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was really hoping it'd get easier with practice..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-BRAHP! 'Scuse me. You're safe now, ma'\u00e1m. Justice is served, and so was dinner!\" she quipped, sounding nowhere near as smooth and confident as she'd have hoped.</span></div></div>",

Last year, Sal had been indicted in the sexual assault of a sixteen year old girl. Despite her testimony and the discovery of his DNA at the scene, Sal managed to escape prosecution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had escaped justice for far too long. But before the bastard could wind up in her belly, she had another decision to make. She had three options for getting at Sal. Firstly, she could attack him at the daily councilman's meeting and devour him in public, though that would require a disguise. Alternatively she could approach him at his private office or even stalk him throughout the day for the perfect opportunity to strike.</span></div></div>",

As a fan of superheros, she had amassed a diverse collection of costumes themed around those very heroes she'd idolized since her youth. Most had been left at home but she had managed to pack a few. The three she had packed all those months ago were costumes of Power Girl, Black Canary, and Red Sonja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, she decided to go with...</span></div></div>",

A much more modest option that either the corset and fishnets or the barbaric chain-mail bikini. Ripping off her denim shorts and blue button up, Abby started to slip her pudgy body into the small costume. Her wide hips and pot-belly struggled to squeeze into the fabric, but with a few tugs she managed to get the uniform unstuck. Her moderate, C-cup bosom slipped snugly into the leotard's bust. Finally, she spent a few minutes lathering her face in make-up, distorting her features beyond base recognition.  It was an odd look, but it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half an hour passed before Abby managed to reach the town hall. It had been an entertaining walk, with the freshman catching more than a few stares for her choice in attire. While a small minority seemed disgusted that a girl her size would wear something so degenerate, the vast majority could not keep their lecherous eyes from her exposed cleavage. She had never felt as sexy as she did in that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEncouraged by the positive feedback, Abby pushed the grand double-doors of the town hall open in an energetic motion. It was a public forum, so no one really noticed, but she liked to think that it was a rather dramatic entrance. With a fire in her heart she marched down the aisle, passing the few people who cared enough to attend. As she approached the stairs to the debate stage, Abby was finally stopped by a plainclothes security officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss,\" he said, stepping in front of her, \"I'm sorry, but this area's off limits. Councilmen only.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Abby tensed her muscles and lunged forward, wrapping the man in a headlock. The stunned guard couldn't fight back as she slammed the poor man to the floor, knocking him out in an instant. Gasps escaped from the audience and stage as they noticed the spectacle at the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but what the hell are you doing?\" a balding, middle-aged man said as he rose from his desk. It was Sal Smith himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here for you, actually,\" Abby said as she ascended the stairs. \"Sal Smith, you're a rapist pig who deserves punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, and what are you going to do?\" he laughed. \"Kill me? Good luck getting out before the cops show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby realized the truth in his statement. She would have to act quickly if she were to escape the police. Swallowing her lingering doubts, Abby dashed forward, gripping the councilman's shoulders before she slammed her head down. Surprisingly, rather than collide heads in a painful headbutt, her mouth expanded like a snake's, easily engulfing Sal up to his shoulders. Utterly shocked, Sal remained limp as Abby worked he way down further, speedily swallowing the man up to his thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that the nearly devoured man realized that he should try and fight back. His legs began to kick widly, landing squarely in Abby's chest, but it wasn't enough. Shrugging off the pain, Abby tilted her head back, sending the rest of Sal into her waiting belly. Abby's knees nearly buckled as the 150 pound man settled in her massively distended stomach. To onlookers, it appeared as if she had an exercise ball plastered beneath her costume. A costume that, thanks to the magic of spandex, had yet to rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining her composure, Abby turned back to the crowd. Their mouths hung agape, utterly shocked and horrified at what they had just witnessed. Taking advantage of their inaction, she hopped off the platform and dashed once again down the aisle, her belly swinging violently with each stride. Nobody lifted a finger to stop her as she burst through the double doors a final time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby collapsed against the hard, brick wall. After running for a few blocks she had ducked into a fairly isolated back alley. Her stomach and legs were on fire. The former from the constant kicks and punches being thrown by her prey while the latter was due to the excruciating pain from running with such all that weight. Had it not been for her workout regime, she doubted she could have even walked from the hall, let alone run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, an escape was an escape. Sal was churning away in her belly and it wouldn't be long before he was reduced to a nutritional mush. What now, though? Did she risk walking back to her dorm with her meal or did she stay in the safety of the alley until the deed was done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But Abby didn\u2019t know her, all she saw was some ditzy girl constantly walking with a posse of admirers getting her way without any effort. And with an annoying laugh.<br>\r\nAnd because she didn\u2019t like her, she found herself believing every little rumour about her. That she\u2019d invite boys to her dorm just so her clique could laugh at them. That she sabotaged her competition for Prom Queen every year. That she\u2019d turn on one of her friends and cast them to the bottom of the social food chain just for the fun of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, had she not had that particular dream this morning, Abby would\u2019ve talked with Janine and found out what a nice person she really was.<br>\r\nBut Janine was not that lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, neat! Where\u2019d you learn to do that?\u201d Janine smiled as Abby popped her jaw and opened wide\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby slammed the door behind her just in time. \"BRAAAAAAHP!\"<br>\r\nHer chunky middle squirmed and thrashed as Janine kicked and screamed for freedom.<br>\r\n\"It worked! Omigosh it actually worked!\"<br>\r\nA sobbing, crying voice escaped her lips with every word.<br>\r\n\"After all this time...so many years, so many nights spent dreaming...I'm going to be a hero!\"<br>\r\nShe posed heroically in front of her mirror and smiled, imagining all the good she could do, as her engorged stomach churned a poor girl into mush.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first day of Vanessa's senior year didn't look like it was going to be that good. Not that the last three years had been great, but at least they hadn't started off with a cryptic dream about eating people followed by waking up with a pain in her stomach so great it nearly caused her to pass out. Eating breakfast dulled the pain, but she didn't feel full. So she ate some more, until her chubby belly peeked out from underneath her pajama shirt. As has been mentioned, Vanessa didn't exactly enjoy her last three years of high school, and often turned to food for comfort. This had resulted in her gaining some weight, which only seemed to add to her torment. Her belly was deemed to be too round, her hips too wide, her thighs too thick, her ass too big, her breasts not big enough (it seemed that Vanessa's chest was always the last place where extra fat was deposited on her body, something which aggravated her to no end).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast being finished, Vanessa stomped upstairs, rifling through her wardrobe for something to wear. She was getting worried, since she'd tried on most of her clothes yesterday, and found that most of them were getting kind of tight. Of course, she'd only thought to do this the night before school started, and so she wouldn't have the chance to get new clothes before heading to class. After some deliberation, Vanessa picked out a t-shirt that covered her torso (though it didn't leave the shape of said torso to the imagination), and a pair of shorts that she had to suck her gut in to button properly (though the shorts basically left her thick legs on full display). Not perfect, but they'd have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vanessa looked through her backpack on final time, she thought back on the dream. It was pretty weird, sure, but the ability the eat people? She'd actually be perfectly fine with a power like that, especially if it let her get back at <b>them</b>. Even now, thinking about the people who had made high school a living hell for her caused Vanessa to grind her teeth in anger. Yeah, swallowing and digesting one of them actually sounded pretty satisfying. Anything to get even with...</span></div></div>",

This wasn't the usual, \"stuff a stack of pancakes or two omelets in her belly\" kind of hungry that had characterized her mornings for the past few months. No, this hunger was much larger and much more insistent than that. This hunger demanded that Gabby get out of bed immediately to assuage it. Which was rather annoying, since she like to lay around in bed for an hour or so after she woke up. It helped remind her of how good her life was; after graduating high school, Gabby had won the lottery. She had then invested those winnings wisely, meaning she basically didn't have to work for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she now had to work to get up out of bed without having adequate \"laze under the covers\" time. Her chunky body certainly didn't help things along. Gabby had loved her hefty self for as long as she could remember, and always would, but right now it was more of a hassle than anything else. Finally, after much (jiggly) effort, Gabriella managed to get out of bed, the sheets revealing her to be naked as the day she was born. It seemed she had fat wherever it was possible for someone to have fat; her cheeks were round, she had a double chin, her breasts lay heavily on top of her belly which was separated into two rolls, her belly lay on hips as wide as a barrel, her ass jutted from her hips like two jiggly basketballs, her thighs rippled, and even her toes looked like sausages. Gabby's body was a work of love, based on a foundation of genes that stored every calorie she didn't use, years of fast food as her family was never that rich, and now a few months of unchecked hedonism as Gabby celebrated her good fortune with feast after feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby loved herself, and wanted there to be more of herself. She desired to be the fattest person in the world, and now had the time and means to do so. This thought led her to thinking about her dream last night. The woman she'd seen in it had been fat beyond belief, immobile under all the layers of her flab. The thought of being that fat motivated Gabby to head down to the kitchen after pulling on a robe that barely went around her fat belly and left her cleavage on display. The serving staff had already set out breakfast, and as Gabby tore into the food, she thought about what the woman had said. Something about eating people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea sounded absurd, but Gabby was willing to give any food at least one chance. And who knows? People might end up putting the pounds on her to break some records. The only problem was deciding who to eat first...</span></div></div>",

In one meal, she was devouring enough to feed her entire staff for two days and leave their bellies bulging. And breakfast was usually the smallest of her eight daily meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d she scoffed a buttery loaf of toast into her chubby cheeks and pondered the possibilities. She reached over and rang a bell.<br>\r\nMoments later, she was met by her head maid, Francine. \u201cLady Gabrielle, how can I help you today?\u201d<br>\r\nGabrielle held up a hand, asking her to wait a second while she finished eating. She sat there for almost three minutes, shovelling every bite into her hungry maw. There was no shortage of fat admirers in the world, but few of them worked for Gabrielle. Most of her staff had to look away while she was eating, lest they feel sick. Francine was no exception, only tolerating her employer\u2019s appetite because her paycheque was as fat as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm...\u201d the blimp of a woman belched, wiping syrup and grease off her plump lips with a napkin before tossing it in her mouth. \u201cI swear, I should just marry Pauline. Then maybe she\u2019d work for free, and I could order bigger portions\u2026\u201d She drooled at the idea of eating a single bite more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019\u00e1m?\u201d Francine asked, trying to hide her annoyance.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, very sorry, Fran.\u201d She patted her belly invitingly, and the maid quickly stepped over and began rubbing it. While repulsed by the massive, churning melting pot of food, Gabrielle was quite enormous, so she had to be rough on her gut. Basically, she was getting paid to punch and pummel her boss! Perfect stress relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFran, have you ever had an incredibly silly dream that managed to\u2026inspire you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I have, ma\u2019am,\u201d she replied, slamming her dainty fists into the fleshy stomach.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I-<i><b>URRAP!</b></i> Last night, I saw this woman\u2026and she was even bigger than me.\u201d Fran stopped for a second and imagined the horrific site before shuddering and getting back to work. \u201cI was feeling a bit too peckish to really pay much attention, however\u2026she said something about eating people.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t surprise me, the way you eat, ma\u2019am. But I suppose if you ate people, there wouldn\u2019t be any left!\u201d She could also openly insult her about her enormous figure, and have it mistaken for a compliment.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I see you and I are on the same wavelength again! Oh, I always like you the best, Fran. I\u2019m going to miss you so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-miss me?\u201d she froze.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease keep rubbing.\u201d<br>\r\nFran immediately obeyed, but was no less horrified. \u201cBut ma\u2019am! You can\u2019t fire me, what have I done?! Please!\u201d Her enormous employer just laughed.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Fran! I\u2019d never fire such an excellent maid such as yourself! I\u2019m just going to eat you to see if that dream really meant anything.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c<b>M\u00e1\u2019am, no</b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFran didn\u2019t believe that Gabrielle could eat people, but still, when clutched by two meaty hands by a woman more than four times her weight, she found it startling. Her fear was quite justified, however, when the woman\u2019s mouth widened and dropped on top of her.<br>\r\nFrancine began to scream and shove, hitting Gabby in the side of the head with all her might, but to no avail. Her fat cheeks were too padded to do any real damage, and soon her shoulders were inside her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTexture is a bit bland\u2026\u201d Gabrielle thought to herself, licking furiously across her maid\u2019s face, and then down to her breasts. \u201cBut the struggle adds a very exciting quality to it! And so juicy\u2026this isn\u2019t just a meal, this is an experience!\u201d<br>\r\nShe began to gnaw on her victim\u2019s flat belly. She bit hard, but didn\u2019t break the skin; Francine flinched, either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serving staff watched in absolute horror. Their boss was tremendously overbearing, but she\u2019d never done anything like this! One of them dropped to their knees and began to curl up, refusing with all his might to pretend this wasn\u2019t happening.<br>\r\n\u201cSpit her out! My lady, spit her out right now, I beg you!\u201d Gabby revelled in their shock, and only ended up slurping her down quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of shoes dropped onto the floor and Gabrielle unleashed a satisfied belch. \u201c<i><b>BrrrrUUUUHP!</b></i> And\u2026Oh, and so satisfying! <i>Yes, yes, yes!</i> This is beyond words!\u201d she giggled like a child as she felt at her gargantuan girth. At her impressive size, Fran\u2019s pounding at her stomach walls could barely be seen. Only up close could you see her flesh push and kick for freedom.<br>\r\nGabrielle had never felt so aroused in her entire life.<br>\r\n\u201cThis changes everything\u2026oh, happy day!\u201d she groaned, saliva dripping down her second chin and into her colossal cleavage. \u201cI must have\u2026more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nAnd it was said that all across the planet, a billion people shivered in fear, but weren\u2019t entirely sure why\u2026</span></div></div>",

She swore out loud as she got out of bed, heading to the kitchen in the small apartment that she lived in. It didn't take her long to find the sugary chocolate-puff cereal that she liked to eat for breakfast. Without bothering to prepare a bowl of milk, she instead just held the box up and let the contents of the half-full box pour into her mouth. It wasn't nearly enough to sate her, but it did allow her to think of something other than food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarilyn found her mind wandering to the dream she had last night. Eat anyone she wanted to? That sounded... interesting. Marilyn had always wondered what it was like to kill someone. She'd practiced on small animals that she found in the part, but was always careful to hide the evidence. Not that it would have mattered if she had hid it or not; her Dad didn't really seem to care much what she did, not since Mom ran out on them both. Of course, Marilyn acted \"normal\" for the people around her; it wouldn't do to let her classmates know what <b>really</b> went through her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what was going through her head was eating people. It certainly wouldn't leave any physical evidence behind.

He was also pretty handsome too, for an older man at least, he had short black hair, white skin, broad shoulders, around 6'5'' in height, a foot taller than her. She have met him before, every time something broke he was there fixing it so they have met a lot of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marilyn could you do me a favor ?

You can look around while I go for the ladder\" he say, making her glance around and understand why he needed help. The place was ENORMOUS! It looked more like a warehouse with crates all around and badly illuminated  giving it a mystery ambient. It didn't help that the lights were really high like 3 almost 4ft tall. Hearing footsteps she turn around to see Zack carrying the largest ladder she have ever seen yet it looked like it was barely holding together by what looked like adhesive tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're thinking but there's nothing I can do about it. This ladder have been here for years and Mr. Thornstone don't want to change it until it's completely useless\" he say with her nodding knowing that Mr. Thornstone was cheap as hell. Putting the ladder in position he ask her to grab the ladder firmly while he go up and change the light bull. Repeating the process four times more while she, bored, looked at the items of one of the crates that was open, when he start to go down to change the last light bull *CRACK* a rung broke making him lose balance, sending him plummeting face first downward. Hearing a sound Marilyn turned her face up with her mouth open to say something only to see Zack falling, his head inches from her. He fell straight into Marilyn open mouth and slid into her stomach without so much as a gulp.  Her belly grew rounder in every direction, ripping her shirt at the sides. Falling on her butt she coughed violently, her throat not used to the rapid expansion... yet. After recuperating of the coughing fit she looked down at her belly and smiled wryly as it bulged furiously.

He was so distracted with the music he was hearing that he didn't saw her there. Taking advantage of his distraction she slipped slowly until she was positioned under him when something fell on her head.

She could feel herself expand as he entered her warm body. He stuck his arms around in the air, only to have Marilyn push them down as she smirked. Her tongue ran around Matt face and with a backwards throw of her head she swallowed the rest of his body. Marilyn pursed her lips and then released with a sigh as she ran her tongue across them with a smack. Struggling to continue standing she moved her head backwards in pleasure, enjoying the movements of the two guys trapped in her hit it.\"BUUUURRUUUURRPP!\" Marilyn  belched, pleased, Her belly began to churn and moan loudly as she rubbed it with both hands. \"Ooooh, stop moving, you're giving me a stomach-ache.
