She watched as each time he breathed in, as even in his sleeping form, he seemed to wince in pain. He could feel the burning tears begin to prickle her eyes, but she wiped them away, and began to heal the wound Aang had suffered just a day ago. It was a very ugly wound, and it would make an even more ugly scar, both on his back, and on his toe where the lightning entered and exited his body, but that bothered her little, what did bother he was the fact that she was there, she watched him fall, and she was useless. She should have attempted to stop Azula, saw her even, but at the moment she was completely enraptured by the powerful aura that Aang created, and watched in awe as he ascended into the air, power seeping for every part of his body. Then the unthinkable happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara shook her head, getting the memory away as she focused on healing the wound, and watched as Aang's face began to relax. At least now, she was of some help, but she would never forgive her inability to save Aang, and she would do anything in her power to save him. Oddly enough, when Aang began to relax, she felt relaxed as well, as if healing his body was helping her as well, but she shook the thought off and looked at the one porthole in the room that they kept closed just in case. It was late, she concluded, and she knew she had to get to bed soon, but watching Aang being so vulnerable was what kept her awake. She was at fault, and she was the one who was going to fix him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined, she continued to heal him, but soon, her eyes began to droop, and an almost unnatural sleepiness began to overcome her. Feeling dizzy, and more than confused, she shook her head, and put the water back into the pouch - she would have to replace it with the ocean water later, but for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawned, and leaned forward from her kneeling position next to Aang, content to sleep next to Aang for the moment. She didn't want to leave him, not if he had the chance to wake up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, she fell asleep, and he head dropped forward.</span></div></div>",

He was floating in an abyss, a void of darkness, surrounding all around him. He looked around fearfully, \"A- am I dead?\" He finally wondered at last, as the darkness never let up. He prayed to the spirits that it was all a deception, and he was really fine, but nothing ever changed. He tried to remember back to what had happened, but it was all so fuzzy, it was so... His eyes widened, \"Oh no... I did die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he didn't know what to think. He figured death would be instant, but this... This was not what came to mind when the word instant was brought up. \"No... No. No no no no!\" He screamed out in the darkness, \"I can't be dead! I failed the world once! What will people think of me this time?\" He cried out, freely letting his tears fall, \"I don't want to fail the world... my friends... Katara...\" There was nothing in response, not even his past selves to save him. He began to weep, then, he truly was alone. Forever to be in this darkness that was death, but suddenly, he coughed violently, and at that moment he realized that up until this moment, he hadn't had to breathe, but now he was forced to, but the darkness around him seem lacking air. He coughed again, but each one lost him more air. So this was real death? He thought to himself, he cried as he realized that suffocation was going to be his last bit of consciousness, and soon nothing else would matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was dying, again. Once was enough, the intensive pain he had felt before had to be enough, but no, he had to get the next worst possible death as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he was so absorbed in his self-pitying thoughts, that he failed to see the light appear. It was a small dot at first, and it was easy to miss in the vast darkness, but soon it was growing in size, the light penetrating all corners of the void. At this Aang's eyes widened as he watched the light begin to form some figure, and to his surprise, the figure of Katara appeared. She watched him for a little bit in shock, but soon she cried out, \"Aang?!\" She saw that his face was turning a horribly dark shade of blue, and she let out a scream as she reached over to him. When she touched him, Aang felt air come back into his lungs, and he coughed as he breathed in the sweet air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katara?\" He looked up at her, \"I thought I died... Where did you come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know.\" She admitted, looking around the place, \"I was healing you once, and then this.\" She waved her hands around the room of light, the light that was all coming from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang cried as he took in the sight of her, \"I thought I would never see you again.\" He confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought the same thing.\" She cried as she held him closer, \"I used the spirit water to heal you, but even then you were slipping... I stayed near you since it happened a day ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two held onto each other tightly, until finally they let go and looked around the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang could safely let go of her now, and breathe fine on his own, but he asked the obvious question, \"Where are we?\"</span></div></div>",

They were in awe of it all, the ground beneath them became a big stone pedestal, and around beyond the pedestal was what looked like some sort of swampland. Trees sprang up to the sky, which had a strange yellow and orange tint to it. Strange balls of light floated around, and most amazing of all, there in front of the both of them was Avatar Roku, atop his flying dragon. The olden Avatar had an extremely relieved look on his face, which seemed almost out of place on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avatar Roku?\" Aang gasped, he looked around the room, \"The Spirit World?\" He was at a loss of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in the spirit world?\" Katara gasped, \"I can't believe it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand though, I don't remember coming here... I thought I had died.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is what we needed to direly talk about young Avatar.\" Roku said, climbing off his dragon, \"I will take a page out of the Earthbenders book with this Aang: The Spirits were not happy. With your most recent failure - death - they wanted to outcast you from where you belonged in the afterlife, namely here.\" He watched Aang look away dejectedly, \"They unanimously decided to destroy you, deeming you unworthy of ever having the title of Avatar, and they wished to erase you permanently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why am I still here?\" He asked quietly, unaware that Katara was at that moment the equivalent of a ticking time bomb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a theory,\" He said looking at Katara, \"And it has everything to do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara gave him a sharp look, \"What did I do? I hope I didn't do anything to make the spirit angry at me as well!\" She said, restraining herself from lashing out further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary Katara, no. They are amazed at what you've done, something that hasn't been thought possible. You brought back Aang, from his demise. Furthermore, you successfully entered the spirit world to do so. Something that has never been done in over a thousand years, young girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She said, speechless, her previous anger forgotten for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to you Aang, to welcome you back. I was one of the few of your reincarnation cycle who stood up for you. I also came so Katara here could explain just what she did to come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I don't know!\" She cried out, \"I healed Aang with-\" She paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could it be the spirit water? Master Pakku gave me some in the North Pole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoku shook his head, \"The water is powerful, but to bring back the dead? No, it was something more. I do have a theory, but if I am proven correct, then you may not like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could I possibly not like? I saved Aang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true, but the consequences of such an action are severe.\" He let out a sigh, \"I think in order to bring him back, you have given him a piece of yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A piece of your soul. It has happened a few times before, when a person loves another very much, and refuses to let them leave, they can imbue their soul into that person. Of course, it has to be done with spiritual energies, which I suspect is what the water was, a conduit for your love and soul to pass over and save Aang, allowing you to come in here to save him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara was blushing like mad and sputtering, \"A- As a brother!\" She claimed hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoku raised an eyebrow at her quick denial of her true feelings, but sighed. He remembered the trials of young love, and if these two wanted to face the challenges that came with it, who was he to spoil it for them? He smiled lightly, \"If you say so.\" He watched Aang look disappointed, and he tried to cover up a laugh with a cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying,\" He began, regaining his composure, \"This has severe consequences. If the one who dies doesn't wish to come back it will kill the person giving up a piece of their soul. Since Katara is here and well, we can say Aang didn't wish to die. Secondly, because of this,\" He actually smiled widely at this, eager to see their terror, \"You are soul bonded to one another, forever to feel what each other feels, be together forever, and maybe more.\" He finish dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoku got the show he was expecting. Katara looked wide eyed at the man, unable to complete a simple sentence, her mouth was moving, but no sounds were coming out. Aang meanwhile was blushing furiously, he looked at Katara, and again blushed. At that moment Katara collapsed in shock, and that is when Roku let out a roar of laughter, he watched as Aang gave him the oddest look, but the old man didn't care. Their reactions were priceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D- Does that mean you were joking about the bond thing?\" He asked in a tiny whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. I was serious about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is something very important you two should know though,\" He looked gravely at both of them, Aang helping Katara back up as she still was in visible shock. \"The bond does have a consequence - every other day, you will not be yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Aang asked, because Katara was still in too much shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoku looked down at the two children. Their reactions so far had been utterly hilarious, but this time, he wasn't sure if they would be fine if they heard this part. He let out a sigh, better now than never he supposed. \"I don't want you to die from shock Katara, so please refrain from doing so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not going to like this.\" She muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, better get out with it. If what I believe to be true is correct, then every other day you will be switching bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoku glanced up at the terror struck face of the children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-w-wha...\" Aang tried to form words. Katara had again fell down, foam was coming from her mouth and it seemed her eyes were rolling around in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoku looked at her in concern, \"I hope that's not a seizure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang still was speechless, and it was obvious Katara was out of it as well, so Roku sat down and waited. His dragon came by and sat by Roku as well. Several hours passed in the spirit world, and Roku sighed, thankfully time passed slowly in this world. Another few hours, Aang was looking into outer space, and Katara finally was able to sit up. She took quick glances at Aang before blushing like mad and mumbling to herself again. Roku watched, his amusement was at its end. So he finally stood up, allowing his dragon to fly away. He watched the two kids, acting as if they were crazy, and boomed out, \"There is a reason it happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both gave him a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because Katara's soul is what is keeping both of you alive now. Both fragments of her soul still want to be in her body, even if she is willingly giving it away to you Aang. There's no way to fix it I am afraid,\" He sighed, \"Her soul will be in a constant rotation between your bodies.\" He looked at their gloomy faces, \"Don't worry,\" He said trying to lighten the mood, \"Since Aang's lifespan will be longer than yours naturally Katara, your soul is strengthened to match his powerful state, which also means your waterbending will be more powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I am in my body.\" She pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, you'll both have to adapt to that.\" He admitted, \"Aang will also have to teach you how to use all the elements too now, since in essence, you are also the Avatar now.\" He thought aloud, \"I wonder though, does that mean she can bend all the elements in her own body as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you knew all about this!\" Aang shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, it's all just a theory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth kids eyes twitched, \"So it's all a joke right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't say that.\" Roku sighed, \"The probability of me being right is pretty high.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not a hundred percent?\" Katara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara didn't look at ease, but was holding onto that thread, \"Ok, maybe I am having a bad dream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang looked hurt at her unwillingness to be with him, and it angered him, but he quashed it down, not wanting Katara to feel it if what the old Avatar in front of him was saying was true. He also was an air nomad, and letting things like that get to him was not what he was supposed to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly for Aang, the world began to dim, \"What's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awakening.\" Roku said, and Katara looked happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great Aang!\" She said, \"I am sitting next to you, so wake me up when you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoku winced, but shrugged, he would let the kids have this adventure on their own. \"With that, I will be going. Be careful you two, this is new territory for you both, as well as us spirits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will keep that in mind Roku, thank you for helping me, and thank you for supporting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Aang dimmed out of the spirit world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so glad he is waking up,\" She sighed, temporarily forgetting what she was told, \"I hope he wakes me up soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoku coughed, \"I doubt that will be possible, considering the body you're currently in is in a comatose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara looked up at him, \"Oh, you've got to be kidding me...\"</span></div></div>",

He was given a second chance by the one he loved, even if she didn't return his affection, he knew it was there, and the knowledge took forefront in his head and he lifted his head up and cracked her neck. For some reason, it was really sore. Also, he began to notice a few strands of hair covering his face. \"That's odd.\" He muttered, but immediately stopped, that voice... It definitely belonged to Katara. He sat up ridged, and looked around, and then in a moment that seemed to transcend time and space, he looked down at the body lying next to him. His own face was lying down in a peaceful sleep. \"Oh spirits.\" Aang gasped, unable to complete the connection to what happened, even if he knew what had happened. He stood to his feet, and stumbled around a bit, not used to the new body, and attempted to move, but only succeeded in falling back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not good.\" He decided, or was that she now? Aang chose not to think of it as he got back up and used the wall as support. Shakily he took one step, and then another, and a few more. Feeling more confident, he slowly pushed away from the wall, and held his arms out at his sides like she was a child playing airplane, or a more perfect analogy would be that he felt like he was on a tight rope. His balance was off, way off. His center of gravity was different now, he was a little taller, and in an unfamiliar body. Of course it was going to be tough for him, and for him to even come across the though of being in his loves body... He blushed furiously, and again pushed those thoughts away as he tried to get one of the basics of life down - walking. After that, he would concern himself with other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took nearly an hour, and by the end of it he really wished that he was comatose again, maybe even facing the black void again... no. No, he would rather not face that again, that was terrifying. Deciding upon that, he looked back towards himself, or rather Katara, maybe. He shook his head, of course it was Katara, who else could it be? He reasoned with himself as he walked over to her. He then knelt down and looked over himself... er, her. As he looked on, foreign memories entered his mind, those of Katara's he decided instantly. He remembered how it felt like for Katara holding Aang, the sense of loss she had when he wouldn't wake up. He remembered Sokka telling Katara to prepare for the worse, he remembered Katara sitting in this very room for over ten hours taking care of him, and in all of those, he saw Katara's feelings for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang was confused. Katara liked him, so why didn't she admit it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be a girl thing.\" He decided aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you are a girl, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka entered the room, looking a little concerned, \"I am guessing you haven't gotten a lot a sleep. You are probably a little delusional.\" He reflexively held up his arms, expecting Aang to hit him. When nothing came but silence he looked up, \"Uh, aren't you going to hit me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that?\" Aang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you must really be losing a lot of sleep if that is your reaction.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang laughed, \"Please, don't worry about me, I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka watched as his sister rubbed the back of her head while laughing nervously, \"Now you're copying Aang's mannerism?\" Sokka couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, \"Now you're REALLY concerning me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" Aang thought fast, what would Katara say if she wanted to be alone with him? Well, actually, the better question was what would Katara say if she wanted to be alone, considering she never exactly asked to be alone with him before. He mood darkened, and he frowned slightly, \"Sokka, you can't force me to go anywhere.\" He finally said, crossing his arms, \"And, um, that is final!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am only concerned for you Katara, you're acting really weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Weird? Since when? I am perfectly fine!\" Aang said, doing his best not to do his nervous laugh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, you need to get away from Aang for a while, I think you're starting to break down.\" He said seriously, looking his sister straight in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang looked straight into his eyes, and a thought occurred to him, should he tell Sokka?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Furthermore, he would be doing it without Katara's permission, and to him, that was unthinkable. He looked down to the ground, but stopped, trying to recall how Katara usually acts, and looked her brother in the eye instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Sokka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I am.\" He said a little louder, with more confidence in his voice, \"Sokka, thank you for worrying, but I need to deal with this on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked away and sighed, \"if that is what you really believe Katara, then I won't force you to go away, but try to get some sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I all ready have.\" Aang said, putting a reassuring hand on Sokka's shoulder to squeeze, hoping to the spirits that it was not too out of character for Katara to be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka hugged his sister tightly, and then walked out of the room, leaving Aang alone once more. He looked around the room, and noted the Fire Nation insignia for the first time, and nearly had a heart attack, but his breathing calmed as memories of the Water Tribe Warriors took the ship over, along with Katara, Sokka, and Toph. It was a quick battle, ended only a few minutes after it began. Aang looked over the room and nodded, so they had stolen a Fire Nation ship, that is smart. He decided, and he again attempted to get used to his body for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment came when he began to think about his body, a girls body, he said to himself in his mind, and he blushed. He could feel a lot of differences, but how was he supposed to go to the bathroom like this? Or even run? He could barely walk right without tripping, but to run? He shuddered at the though, everyone would think Katara was going nuts if that happened, and Aang did not want that to happen. He refrained from feeling himself, even if his curiosity was bursting at the seams. That would be violating Katara, and there was no way he was going to do that to her. He then felt the hair, it was silky smooth, he figured she wouldn't mind too much if he only messed around with her hair, he decided and he held the ponytail in front of his face, and messed with the hair loopies as he liked to call them. Unfortunately, the loops came undone, \"Oh crap!\" He muttered, \"I have no clue how to fix that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the decidedly much more messier than before ponytail back behind his head before he messed it up too much more as well. He then sat down next to his old body and crossed his arms in his lap sitting up straight. He refused to move, he didn't want to cause any trouble for Katara in this body, and he didn't know what else to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually his eyes began to droop, and he leaned forward.</span></div></div>",

So, he took of azula's pant, feeling a little embarassed, then, her top, and stod on her bed trying to meditate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello azula\"<br>\r\n\"Huh, who's there?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry if i scared you, fire princess, said roku, emerging from the carpet, so, how is fire nation business going?\"<br>\r\n\"Roku, it's me! aang\"<br>\r\n\"Some people told me airbenders used to have a sense of humor, man, were that hte good days\"<br>\r\nAang stayed silent, not sure wether or not if he appreciated roku's joke, roku himself realized how bad of a joke it was<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, i didn't...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, anyway, what is up with all the, y'know, me switching bodies with my 2nd worst enemy?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a long story, it started 7 000 years ago, when avatar Tohne, said roku, showing a beatiful fire nation girl in the mirror, when avatar Tohne met koh\"<br>\r\n\"The face stealer?\"<br>\r\n\"do i tell the story or not?\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, keep going\", whatever, said aang, who started to look more &amp; more like azula in terms of mood<br>\r\n\"Well, koh had been angered by humans creating theater, and using masks to protect themselves, as the first avatar, wan, did once, he then decided to avenge himself by creating faces, out of every face he stole, and started taking a human form to steal faces, then, the avatar had to interfere<br>\r\nAnd by interfering, i mean kick some serious spirit ass, and so, a fight began, short &amp; decisive, i'll show you one day when you have time\"<br>\r\n\"....\"<br>\r\n\"Anyway, koh proposed a deal, if he could link a part of himself to the avatar, as some spirits do, he would never come back if he had not been offended, avatar tohne agreed, and the pact was sealed, koh stayed in the spirit world and did not seek fighting, but he created himself thousands of faces, until he could make each face that ever existed in a mere seconds<br>\r\n\"Then came a dumbass, avatar kuruk, powerful &amp; all, he goes to koh's spirit house, beats him, and leaves drunk, taking all of his faces as a trophy, now koh avenges himself by kidnapping kuruk's wife, the pact is broken, koh is free\"<br>\r\n\"Then, after a drunk night and the sadness of losing the woman he loved, kuruk died, leaving kyoshi to seal with koh\"<br>\r\n\"Ouch\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, at 13 years old, kyoshi beat koh, who was 16000 years old, but kyoshi, as the avatar she was, proposed a pact to koh, he could put another part of himself into the avatar, and he could make two decisions as the avatar in an avatar's life<br>\r\nThen, koh came back to the spirit world, and waited 215 years for kyoshi to die, then, in my years, he surprisingly did nothing to me, i thougt at the time he was saving energy for something, and now, i guess we know what\"<br>\r\n\"But what did he do exactly?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, as you know, azula is my great grand daughter, it means she also had koh in herself, koh simply switched you around, by transferring each of you in the spirit world, then, switching your bodies\"<br>\r\n\"But why would he do that, it doesn't make sense!\"<br>\r\n\"Aang, he did this because of what happened during the siege of the north, for the first time, a spirit died, and it was the moon, one of the most powerful, all of it because of the fire nation<br>\r\nBecause of me...<br>\r\nNow, koh wants you to stop the war without involving the spirit, he fears that on the day of the comet, the spirit portal of the north pole would open, and leave the spirits dead, this is your chance aang... take it...\"<br>\r\nAs he said his final words, roku vanished into thin air, leaving aangzula to deal with her problems</span></div></div>",

He was walking back to his room when he ran into a very happy, Ty Lee. When she saw Aang she ran to him and gave him a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azula! It's great seeing you up again, I was really worried\" She said. Aang still felt a ping in his stomach everytime someone refered to his as \"Azula\". But, he might as well try and get used to it until he finds a way to end the war in this body. He hadn't realized that Ty Lee was still waiting for a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um Ty Lee, thanks...\" He replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I figured your dad must have told you about the whole Ember Island thing again\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he did. Are you going to\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am! Although Mai isn't, so I guess it's just you and me!\" she ended with a huge smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang continued to try and pass as Azula when he looked out the window to fin that it was starting to get dark outside when Ty Lee told him that he should go back to bed and rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got back to his room, he removed his robes and sat on the edge of his bed in front of a full- length mirror, looking at himself. He never really had the chance considering what happened after he woke up. He began by looking up and down his pale hair-less legs. His skin tone paled from his normal body. He kept gliding his hands up and down his legs, realizing how nice they felt. Speaking of his hands, he looked at his well manicured nails. He figured that those would become a problem later on with things like writing and doing basic things with his hands. But, for now, he thought that they were pretty. In the mirror, he looked up from his legs to his crotch to find an absence of his former equipment and in it's place was a new female replacement covered by a pair of red lace panties. His eyes then wandered passed his hourglass waist and to another reminder of his new female equipment, his breasts. While they weren't the biggest, they were very noticeable with only a bra on, like the one he has on at the moment. He reach with his small, feminine hand to grab, a wave of pleasure hit him as he removed his hand as quickly as he could.\"I'm not ready for that yet\" Aang thought aloud. Finally, his eyes reached his face. HIS face. At least for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at his reflection to see bright golden eyes, instead of his usual storm cloud grey eyes. That's what Katara said they looked like that. A shock goes through his body, Katara. It was the first time he thought of her specifically for the first time since his swap. What would she think of him now. \"Figures, after I finally have the guts to kiss her, I get turned into a girl\" Aang thought. Wait, Katara wouldn't want me to sit around mopping, she would want me to do something. He thought. Aang then decided that while at Ember Island, he would try and get any intelligence about Ozai's schedule and then find a way to remove him from power before the comet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang finally fell asleep and was ready for what ever challenge he may face.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Nobody will take me seriously as long as I'm stuck as this clown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a rustling caught her attention.  She peered through the bushes to see Mai and Ty Lee... and herself!  Or at least, her body.  And... that Kyoshi Island Warrior?!  Her clothes seemed different, though, as instead of the green hakamashita, she wore a red one.  What was this idiot up to, she wondered.  Suddenly, an idea struck Azula: using this idiot's body, she could inform the rest of his friends (and her turncoat brother) that \"Azula\" and \"her\" gang were coming for them, getting both sides to destroy each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that plan in mind, she set back towards the camp...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ =====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sokka and his group arrived near the camp, he motioned for them to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go on ahead and scout things out myself.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Azula...\" Ty Lee said, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry yourself, Ty Lee.\" Sokka argued, \"I can take care of these weaklings all on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he ran forward into the camp.  About a half-minute later, he was tossed through the air, soaking wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW DARE YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the group turned towards the voice to see an angry Katara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You try and kill my brother, then come back to finish us all off?!\" she yelled, \"I'll make sure you don't get the chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she hurled water from a nearby stream at Sokka's direction.  Using Azula's agility, he managed to dodge it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ka-Katara, wait!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara, however, kept up the pressure, soon causing the rest of the group to get involved on Sokka's behalf followed soon after by the rest of Katara's friends.  The fighting was intense: things were going so fast.  Sokka didn't know what to do... he had no clue how to use Azula's firebending to defend himself!  He dodged and attacked as best he could but it didn't seem to be enough.  Finally, overcome... something happened: as Azula came at him with his own sword, he managed to release a blast of lightning... a rather large one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the sword as a conduit, the lightning arced out hitting EVERYBODY.  This was too much and soon, Sokka blacked out.</span></div></div>",

He knew all of ty lee's moves, the earth nation snake,  azulon's tie, the firespitter, and many more with ridiculous names, why?

So, he traveled through what he felt was a link between the six of them, and quickly landed himself in azula's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to feel powerful\" he meant to say, rising up as ty lee's body fell on the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So good to be powerful\" was what he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the same thing as he did before with ty lee, the assimilation of memories, the friendship with mai &amp; ty lee, the cold distance with her dad, how she liked her brother, then suddenly, she pitied him, then hated him, in a sibling-ey way, she thought. Sokka also saw what he thought he'd understood from zuko, how their mother disappeared, without leaving a trace, the hurt, their dad not seeming to care that much about it, working as usual, or more? she couldn't tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka sat in front of azula, who was still face down in mai's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gathered his basic fire knowledge, then azula's, and made a blue flame appear in his hand, he played with it, weaving it into intricate designs, azula watching with rage in her look, he finally looked at her.  He took her limpless body, and left her against a nearby tree, facing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not so different, you and i\" he said, meaning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Go suck a turtleduck. Said azula, in what she knew would be offensive to her body's host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I know too, what is loss, what it is to expect someone to love you, what is it to feel disappointed with yourself, even with all the power in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-But you don't know how to suck a turtleduck? Taunted azula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka breathed deeply, innerved by azula's thickness to what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- As i know you must have understood, tactically, you are beaten, i can master ty lee's chi-blocking, mai's knife throwing, your firebending and acrobatics, my sister's waterbending, my girlfriend's kyoshi techniques, and in all cases, i have also perfect (he thought pretty good, but neither he or azula was one to undersale themselves) mastery of my sword, boomerang, and i am on par with you on tactical genius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused for a moment, thinking, azula didn't interrupt him, and seemed lost in thought, looking sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I can also swap bodies between the six of us, it seems, i could use that to my advantage to put you in situations where you couldn't react, while my girlfriend and sister would do what ty lee would call \"Whooping your butt\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- What's your point? said azula, with venom in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You have no need to fight, your dad's not here to watch you fight, it won't bring back your mom, at best you endanger yourself, at worst, you endanger you AND your friends, with no chance of winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-So?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Simply put, i'd like you to surrender, as it is more profitable to all of us, but, as a long term goal, i'd like you to join us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-What? are you out of your mind, on top of being out of your body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Hear me out for a minute, and it will all become clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Make it a short one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Ok, here goes: sozin's comet's here in barely a month, and it will be the day of the final assault, but what happens if the fire nation princess starts a civil war by killing her father and sitting on the throne? Bad stuff, dead people in all of the fire nation, colonies or not, three years of war at best, at worst... Now, imagine a better outcome, the fire lord is defeated by the avatar, helped by the fire lord's own daughter, while the prince and a ragtag team of children stop the blimp invasion. You get the crown, you get recognition, if your mom's alive, we go search for her, if not, your father is beaten anyway, serves him right, your friends are hailed as national heroes, and you can even get to keep some of the colonies, if you play good, and<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<b> I do play good</b> said both of them at the same time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka smiled a bit, while azula was looking at her defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time of pondering, azula smiled widely, something that looked quite horrible on mai's face, but made sokka feel good nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Very convincing offer, i admit, power, love, admiration, riches, i can have it all, that is true, and this without any risk, oh, maybe there would be one or two people contesting the legitimity of my power, but they would not be as strong as i am. I do think my friends here would accept, even though mai doesn't admit it, she'd like to be reunited with zuko, ty lee kind of loves me enough to do what i ask of her, and i do know of a few people that could help us further<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I feel a but coming, said sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-But i will ______________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only Katara was at the camp site when he got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Katara!\" shouted Sokka exitedly.

Katara was completely on offense while Sokka was just defending himself. With Azula's body, Katara was no match for him. He had his sword and fire bending while Katara just had her water bending. At one point, Sokka trips Katara to the ground and has his sword to her neck. Katara closes her eyes and braces for the end to come, but Sokka throws down his sword.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a quiet morning.  Katara was running through her waterbending drills by the pond.  She lifted a globe of water, warped it, formed it into a ring, sent smaller globes through it -- it was nothing she hadn't done before a million times, but it was good to keep up with the basics.  It would be easy to get lazy, in this peaceful, postwar world -- Toph certainly had, the little earthbender was off somewhere napping.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I need to practice when I'm already the strongest Earthbender of all time?\" she'd scoffed when Katara had pointed out that daily drills were just as important as a healthy diet, regular baths, and brushing your teeth.   Katara had to admit -- Toph was probably right.   Still, Aang was the <i>Avatar</i>, and <i>he</i> practiced every day, discovering new secrets and subtleties in the interplay of earth, water, fire, air, and spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, well.  Toph would never change.   Sighing, Katara lifted another globe of water --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the world went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisoriented, Katara's eyes strained against the blackness.  She picked herself up -- she'd fallen over somehow -- and put her hands to her face, expecting to find something covering her eyes.  There was nothing.  Had darkness fallen so quickly and so totally?  No -- that was impossible, it was almost noon!  She could<i> feel </i>the sun on her face and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was wrong with her eyes.  She placed her hands over them, calling upon her powers of healing, and that's when she received an even greater shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bending was gone!  She couldn't sense the water.   She reached out for the pond, couldn't find it, reached for her waterskin, it was gone -- what on earth was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting one foot carefully in front of the other, holding her arms out in front of herself, she tried to make it back to the house.  After some time and several stumbles, her fingers found a row a posts which she remembered seeing.  Somehow, she'd ended up on the other side of the house entirely!  She worked her way to the front stoop and crawled inside.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, she found a jug of water and attempted to lift it, to take it in her hands and mold the liquid.  She felt nothing.  The connection had been severed completely.  The water was as lifeless as stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara felt tears -- horrible, dead, <i>wrong</i> tears -- rolling down her cheeks.  She couldn't remember the last time she'd felt this frightened and helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!\" she cried out.  \"Sokka?  Aang?  Anyone?  <i>Please</i>, help me!\"  She managed to choke out a final word.  \"<i>Please</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy footsteps came running, and in seconds she heard the welcome sound of Sokka's voice, accompanied by the grate of metal on hide as he drew his sword from its scabbard.  \"What's going on?  Where are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's.. it's not that,\" Katara sobbed.  \"Sokka... Sokka... there's something wrong with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"  His voice was sharp and worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara groped her way across the room to him.  She gulped.  \"I'm blind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her astonished dismay, he burst out <i>laughing</i>.   \"Oh my god -- good one!  Okay, I'll admit it, you got me.  I seriously thought Azula was hiding in the cupboard or someth--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not funny!\"  Katara wailed.   \"And it's not a joke.  I can't... can't see <i>anything!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, okay, that's true... and that's a problem?\"  He paused.  \"Wait, you don't mean there's something wrong with your bending?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too!  I can't sense the connection.  I can't sense anything anymore.  I don't know what's wrong with me or--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh.  Calm down, Toph, it'll be okay.  Uh, guess we should find Aang, or maybe an experienced earthbender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just call me Toph?\" Katara snapped.  \"Because I don't think that's funny <i>at all</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it supposed to be?\"  Sokka sounded puzzled.  \"Look, Toph, I don't know what to tell you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Stop calling me Toph!</i>\" she screeched.  \"Your own sister is crippled, and all you can do is crack jokes about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Toph, joke's over.  You're kinda freaking me out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm Katara!</i>\"   But even as she said this, a horrible suspicion came over her.  She ran her hands over her hair, her clothes, her figure -- he was telling the truth.   Her body wasn't <i>hers</i> anymore -- it was Toph's.</span></div></div>",
