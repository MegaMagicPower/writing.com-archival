Glancing over to the doors you see the usual bottleneck of people forcing their way back to afternoon registration and you had no desire to join that mob. You decide to give it a few minutes for the crowd to die down, you still had to pack some work away which you'd been doing while eating and take the tray back over to the rack. Groaning as you get to your feet, you stagger over with your empty dishes to where the stacks of trays were. With a \"Sploosh\", the cutlery were submerged and a \"Crash\" accompanied the tray hitting the others. Normally you wouldn't hear these sounds but as you turn around, it becomes apparent why. The whole room was silent, everyone had gone, the people by the door had somehow managed to free themselves and escape leaving you all alone, or at least you thought you were...</span></div></div>",

A shriek from Rachel reminded you of her presence and your haste of getting out of there but in light of this lockdown, you decide to go back. Rounding the corner for a second time, you again see Rachel, spoon in hand paused halfway between pudding and mouth with staring transfixed at the window which was now bordered up with metal. \"Hey, do you know what's happening?\", you ask innocently, after all, you hadn't done anything.<br>\r\n \"YOU!\", she yells, \"What have you done!?\", she demanded. \"I saw you a minute ago when everybody left, looking at me!\".<br>\r\n \"Me?\", you reply, feeling blood fill your cheeks, \"I came round the corner to see what a noise was I heard, and besides, how on earth could I have caused this to happen? I was trying to get to registration when this metal sheet blocked the door!\"<br>\r\n \"Well it certainly wasn't me!\", she retorts, \"Wait, it's blocking the door? And the windows? So we're trapped?\".<br>\r\n \"Looks that way\", you sigh, \"For now at least\".<br>\r\n \"You don't have to look so happy about it mister!\" she half-yelled, \"Now let me eat my pie in peace and if we're still trapped we'll have a look around I suppose.\"<br>\r\n \"Alright.\", you say, \"And for the record, I'm no happier about it than yo...\"<br>\r\n \"Shhh\", Rachel interjects.<br>\r\n \"You don't have to be mean about it, I'll be quiet!\"<br>\r\n \"No you fool, shut up and look\", Rachel says, pointing at a table behind you.

She then put her finger down, \"What do you think it is though, it's creeping me out.\". You have no idea so shake your head and walk carefully up to it. As you approach, you think you hear \"Be careful...\" from behind but it was so quiet you couldn't be sure. <br>\r\n Standing next to the box, a further examination showed that although it looked just like polished metal from a way away, there were intricate ingraved designs which distorted the reflections on its surface. You look back to see that Rachel had also picked herself up from the table and was making her way over to where you were. You wait until she is standing nearly next to you then reach out your hand towards the box. A look of wonder and worriment filled Rachel's face as she too reached over to the box.

It wasn't a powerful voice but neither masculine nor feminine which gave it an eerie vibe. You and Rachel remain rooted to the spot, too terrified by this voice to move even if you wanted to. The box had split from its centre into three parts, two smaller ones on top of a central large block, with a bright white light pouring out of the newly opened core. A small metal pole rose silently up out of the middle of the block, stopping once it was about a meter from the top. A pinprick of light was to be found at the top of the pole, peering into it, you notice it seems to be glinting but the rate at which it did so was getting faster. The light was also getting brighter and now it was like somebody switching on and off a torch really quickly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n After a minute, the pole randomly decided to retreat back into the box, the dissappearance of which was accompanied by the voice. \"SCANNING COMPLETED, SUBJECTS: HUMANOID. PROCEED TO NEXT STAGE.\" You and Rachel are still too scared to move at being trapped in the lunch room, seemingly by this box, and then apparently subjected to some sort of scan. Managing to tear your gaze away from the box, you slowly turn your head to see Rachel, whose eyes flickered towards you, a look of terror in them \"What do you suppose 'the next stage' is?\", she asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"I'm not sure, and I don't know if I want to find out\", you reply, turning back towards the box. The metal on the box seemed to have acquired a purple hue while you weren't looking, and the designs which adorned its surface looked to be twisting round forming ever more complex shapes. Like the flashing light had done before it, the speed at which the patterns rotated and intertwined increaced to a break-neck pace before stopping suddenly. The box went back to its silvery self and yet again the voice boomed \"PSYCHIC LINK ESTABLISHED. SPECIES IDENTIFIED: HUMAN - SENTIENT. LOCATION IDENTIFIED: PLANET - EARTH. REQUIREMENTS MET. SUBJECTS IDENTIFIED: ADAM OF THE BANKS FAMILY. RACHEL OF THE YATES FAMILY. SUBJECTS LOCKED. SUBJECTS BOUND. DNA NUCLEOTIDES REWRITTEN. GIFTS RELINQUISHED. EXPERIMENT HAS BEGUN.\" The box then started to fade away, a loud creaking suggested that the iron pannelling was retreating away from the windows and doors. Just as the image of the box was just a ghost, the voice returned \"HAVE A NICE DAY.\", it then promptly disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Turning to Rachel, you try to say \"Well, that wasn't weird...\", but as soon as you see her eyes, which are also looking at yours, a burning sensation in your forehead dropped you to the floor, Rachel had also fallen clutching her head. Unable to stand the pain any more, you black out.</span></div></div>",

Wracking your brain trying to remember why you came to be face down on the floor in the lunch hall, you remember hearing some sort of informercial while you were out for the count, could what it said be true? Come to think of it, had anything made sense since you were trapped in here with Rachel? Rachel! You suddenly remember, and turn around to see her picking herself off the floor shaking her head. ' <i> Whoa, that was strange... </i> ', comes a voice from inside your head. \"Tell me about it\", you say out loud then stop as you realise you just responded to a voice inside your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rachel had also frozen halfway between getting up and standing up, she turned her head to look at you, \"Please say you didn't say what I thought you just said!\", she half groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm not sure I followed that but I think I said what you thought I said if you thought I said it\", you give her a puzzled look which she returns. <i> 'That did nothing to help my headache!' </i> , you think to yourself, or at least you thought it was to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How did you do that!?\", Rachel demanded. In reply to your still bemused look, she continued \"How did you do that? Speaking, without moving your mouth?\". <i> 'Must be crazy' </i> , you think, <i> 'I never spoke' </i>. \"You did! See! You did it again!\", Rachel persists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She continues to stare at you for a while until she suddenly intakes a breath. <i> 'If you can hear this then I must be right' </i> , you hear the voice in your head again but this time it's unmistakeably Rachel's. \"Yeah, I heard that, does that mean that you had the dream commercial as well? The box? That was real!?\", you ask. <i> 'Must have been' </i> , Rachel's voice fills your head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You both just stare at each other until you hear what must be Rachel's laugh in your ears, and although she was smiling, she wasn't laughing. \"In that case...\", she said, pausing for effect, she clenched a fist and held it up to her chest. Then, in one swift movement, she moved her arm away and unfurled her hand towards you. A fireball the same size as her fist came out of her palm and hurtled towards your face. In a panic, not sure what to do, it's not everyday you have to dodge a ball of fire, you stand there stunned as it smacks you bang in the middle of your face. A warm feeling spreads across your nose and cheeks but it quickly passes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What the frig!?\", you exclaim, pointing your index finger on your right hand at her and loosing a bolt of lightning which strikes her right in the chest. Finding it quite satisfying to launch some lightning into the body of someone who'd embarassed you many times before, you start to chuckle. Rachel was already laughing. \"Everything!\", you manage to say in between laughs, \"It was all true!\", stopping the laugh you look at Rachel seriously. \"Rachel, you realise what this means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rachel had also stopped laughing and had met your gaze \"We can do anything...\", holding the silence for a moment so the reality could sink in you hear her voice again <i> 'We need to talk about this, meet me outside the school gates at the end of the day' </i> ,she winked then pointed her hands at the floor making a cloud of smoke appear around her. You could make out her shape running towards the exit but faster than anyone you knew could possibly run and heard her voice again <i> 'Always wanted to try that' </i></span></div></div>",

You could do anything you wanted, just by thinking about it! \"Hmmm\", you think to yourself, \"Anything...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Taking a detour from the main corridor, you turn down one of the side passageways towards the boy's toilets. Once inside, you head to one of the cubicles, sliding the latch across behind you, so as to lock yourself in. \"Okay...\", you wonder aloud, \"This is just an experiment, yeah.\". Closing your eyes, you recall a picture of Rachel as you'd seen her earlier in the lunch room, which was easier than you thought it would be. You also find yourself visualising an image of yourself as you'd seen in the mirror this morning. Concentrating harder, you get the two images to overlap in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A clenching sensation gripped you in the stomach, sucking you inwards. The sensation spread over the surface of your whole body, looking down at your arms at the end of your rolled up shirt sleeves, you could see the hairs sinking inwards but at the same time you could see your nails growing outwards from the ends of your fingers which looked smaller. The hair was disappearing in a sort of wave from your wrists up your arms, when the wave went under your shirt you could still feel it rippling under your shirt. The sucking sensation in your stomach grew stronger, so much so that it felt like you whole body was being sucked downwards towards it, getting smaller. However, you could also feel that something was being sucked upwards. From your crotch, you could feel something being pulled upwards. When it met the feeling in the pit of your stomach, it split in two and carried on upwards for a short while before stopping. During this time, your hair had also felt like it was being sucked downwards and as you were looking at your arms again, a tuft of hair fell over your eyes, causing you to reach up and brush it behind your ears. While looking at your arms, you became aware that your rolled up cuffs had melted into the arms of the shirt and were extending of their own accord towards your hands. When it reached the end, the loose cuffs secured themselves with a white button. A sudden chill hit your legs and you looked down to see that they were now semi-transparent, still black, but now clinging to your legs tightly. The sucking feeling in your gut had now reversed and was sucking outwards, like how it feels if you put your hand over a hoover. The feeling had split in two, one moving up and one moving down. The first stopped when it reached your waist and grew more powerful, sucking your hips out and dragging your skin and what was the top of your trousers with it creating a thick black band of material. The feeling faded, and the material, no longer being held up, tumbled down and out, forming a pencil dress. The other of the feelings which moved upwards reached a standstill when it got to your chest, and like the other one before it, the sensation grew stronger. You could feel your chest being pulled outwards, in two places at once. Looking down, holding your hair out of your eyes, you could see two peaks forming, as they were pushing outwards, you felt your shirt cling to them although it still looked quite loose from the top. The sucking sensation stopped completely and the two peaks moved up and out slightly as you felt a secure constriction bind around the top half of your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You could no longer feel anything happening but couldn't really see what had happened. Undoing the latch on the cubicle, you poke your head round the door, before retreating back inside, it was clear. A quick look at your watch told you that you had only been in the cubicle for a little under a minute. Picking up the courage, you open the cubicle door wide and stride out into the main part of the toilets, almost falling over as your shoes had also changed to give you raised heels. Hardly believing your now green eyes, you come face to face with an image of Rachel in the mirror. After poking your cheek a little to make sure it was you, you return to the cubicle. An idea hit you and you slowly undo the top buttons on the shirt. <i> 'Hey!' </i> ,you hear, which almost sends you through the roof. The voice is also accompanied by a feeling of mild annoyance and worry. <i> 'Adam, I don't know what you're doing but I'm feeling really bad vibes here so stop it now, you're putting me off my maths test!' </i> , feeling Rachel's essence within your body mixed with a little bit of your own guilt, you send back a 'Sorry!' and pause for a moment coming to a realisation. After the events earlier today, Rachel was essentially a part of you, she could feel you and you could feel her presense constantly, probably thanks in part to what the box had called the 'psychic link'. Can you continue? With Rachel's body at least?</span></div></div>",

Trust me I won't be happy.\" You shuddered for a moment, then sighed in relief when you didn't hear anymore of her nagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I am sure I can make some design changes, probably going to look awkward, but heck I am a  superhuman now, I will do what I want.\" With that your hair became a lighter shade of blonde, shorter, and with a messy spiky look that looked both cool and cute at the same time. A pair of pink-tined goggles appeared on your head, they had white bands. A large white coat with blue rims formed around you, it's design left your shoulders bare. Two long white gloves formed around you, as your sneakers morphed into stylish, long white boots. Your socks became thinner, and began riding up your leg just past your knees. Your shirt twisted and changed color until it became a white tube top that covered only your chest. Your skirt became very small and very loose, and your panties changed into a pair of small, tight, biker shorts. You squirmed as you felt two piercings form in your ears and heart shaped earrings form in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a few moments to admire yourself in the mirror, but not long as you heard gunshots coming from down the hall. You peered outside for a few moments to see your peers all kneeling behind the ground, hands behind their heads. You could see masked arm men walking don the hall holding assault rifles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess, I should expect this to happen after getting superpowers. Bad guys to fight, should I take them out quickly and toy with them? And should I really go fight out there like this?\"</span></div></div>",

However, you were sure that she could tell if she saw you. This meant that you had to do what had to be done quickly and get out of there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pulling the large pink goggles down over your eyes, pulling the hood up on the coat and holding it round your shoulders, you burst out of the corridor to the source of the commotion. Thinking while on the run \"Quickly...can't really take them out... immobilising them will have to do...\", rounding the corner you meet two large muscley men in black tank tops and cargo shorts with buzz cuts striding down the corridor pushing people out of the way, heading towards the trophy cabinet. Without stopping, you run up behind them and send a blast of air which knocks them both off their feet, sending their guns flying out of reach. Not making a sound, you point one hand at where one had fallen with the other hand pointed at the other. Without really thinking about it, you feel a freezing sensation rise up from the floor, chanelling it through the palms of your hands, you release an ice-cold wind. Within seconds, thick ice had formed where the men were touching the floor, sticking them to it. Out of the corner of your eye you see your chemistry teacher hurtling down the corridor behind you, checking if everyone is OK, a complete tank, nobody could stop him if he thought the school was in danger, \"Time to get out of here\", you say to yourself, again hearing Rachel's voice leave your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Running again towards the doors into the school yard, you try to remember what the dream had said about your powers. \"I think now would be a good time to test the invisibility...\", you wonder. Concentrating hard, you will yourself to disappear. Looking down at your gloved hands, you see the colour leave them until eventually you see the blue floor. Taking a swerve before the yard, you launch into the toilets at this end of the school, into another cubicle locking the door again behind you. <i> \"Adam! What's happening, you feel petrified!\" </i> , you hear Rachel ask from within. \"Oh it's nothing\", you reply, \"Just had to deal with some men with guns...\" <i> \"OMG, are you OK!?\" </i>, you sense her panic tingling around your body. \"Yeah I'm fine, I think I might go to class now, for a sit down\". You visualise your normal self in your mind's eye and feel the change vibrating round your skin. <i> \"Just be careful! And I don't want you to try any more powers until we talk after school, especially not the transformation or flying!\" </i> , you feel Rachel's excitement in the pit of your stomach, \"Don't worry, I won't\", you say, knowing full well that you already had tried transforming. You open the cubicle and take a peek in the mirror to check everything was back to normal, fortunately it was as upon opening the door back into school, the fire bell goes off. You see your chemistry teacher hurtling down the halls once more, he shouts to you, \"Come on, you know the drill! Everybody in the yard now! There's been a situation and there's going to be an emergency address from the head!\". Following him as part of the crowd of pupils who were bursting out of classrooms, you make your way to the yard.</span></div></div>",

First I knocked them over with this sort of air blast then froze them to the floor and ran out of there as fast as I could!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rachel stopped in a clearing and looked around furtively, \"There, I don't think people should be able to see or hear us here.\", she then directed her attention back to you, \"So did anyone recognise you?\". There was a touch of panic in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Not wanting to tell her about how you'd disguised yourself you say, \"I don't think they did, I didn't stop as I was doing it and I was moving pretty fast\".<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Breathing a sigh of relief, Rachel says \"Thank goodness for that. I don't know about you but I think it would be best if we kept these powers as a secret between ourselves. It would save us a lot of bother and if we do something that turns out bad, we won't get the blame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nodding, you agree \"I like the sound of that.\" You then look at her puzzledly \"But what's the point of having these powers if we aren't going to use them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I never said we weren't going to use them!\", Rachel replies, \"I just said that people aren't going to know that <i>we</i> used them!\", she says with a little wink. \"We just need to be careful about when we use them and what we look like at the time. We'll have to sort that out later though, my bus leaves in half an hour so we can't stay here for long and I've been dieing to try out flying ever since lunch! Do you want to come over to mine for dinner and we can sort it out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nodding again you say \"Yeah, sure, I can do that. Now... flying? I can't remember the dream saying anything about that\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Yeah I don't think that dream said anything <i>specifically</i> about flying but I've come up with a way around that that should work I think!\", lowering her voice even though there was no one around to hear it, she continues, \"You said so yourself a minute or so ago, you knocked the men over with an air blast, now imagine if you could sustain that blast but use it to move you instead of someone else... worth a try don't you think?\". Without waiting for a reply Rachel stepped back away from you into the middle of the clearing and stood with her palms pointing towards the floor. \"Wish me luck\", she says as she screws her face up, bracing herself for the blast. In seconds, Rachel rocketed up about 100m but then began to fall, \"Ahhhh,\" she screamed, taking longer to come down than it took to get up there. Springing into action, you ready yourself underneath her shadow arms spread out. With a 'thud' Rachel dropped on top of you, the force flattening you both to the ground. Strangely it didn't hurt and both of you were back on your feet in moments. Shaking her head viciously, hair flying everywhere, she says \"Too fast.\", and stares up into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How about instead of moving yourself through the air, you move the air around you?\", you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rachel snaps her head round to look at you, eyes glinting, \"You know what? That might work!\". Hurtling back over to her spot in the middle of the clearing with a grin, she froze \"and how am I supposed to do that?\", she demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Walking over next to her, you say \"I don't know, maybe if you push the air up above you you'll get sucked up after it?\", watching as Rachel stands there, eyes closed willing the air to rise and succeeding only in whipping up a cyclone of leaves off the floor, you get another idea. \"Hey, have you noticed if you look hard you can see sort of purple lines curving around the ground and in the air? Try and pull them under your feet, see what happens.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Oh yeah I hadn't really noticed them before, do you think they're like gravity waves or some magnetic field or something?\", without wanting an answer to this question, you could see Rachel had already started manipulating these lines around and had created a pile of lines underneath her which had left a gap around her. \"It's not work... whoa!\", Rachel interrupted herself as she noticed herself levitating off the floor. You could see she was trying something else as the purple lines started to move upwards, pushing her along with them. After about a minute or so, with Rachel getting faster at both ascending and descending in a straight line, she stops on the floor and you see the purple lines go back to their usual places. \"Well it's definately more controlled\", she says, \"with a little bit more practice I'm sure we'd be able to fly around, not just up and down! Great idea\", Rachel jumps forwards flinging her arms around you. Bouncing backwards, she cries \"Crumbs! Look at the time! We've got 5 minutes until the bus leaves!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was a bus organised by the school to bring students in on the morning and home on the afternoon so was free to pupils with a bus card, fortunately even though this wasn't your bus, the cards worked on any. \"Well let's get going then\", you say, \"You'd better lead the way, I don't know which stop yours is at\", and start walking back through the forest the way you came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You feel Rachel grab your wrist, \"Adam!\", she half-yells then quietens down, \"I've just thought, if people see you with me, at my stop, on the bus, and walking towards my house, they're going to think something's going on. I mean we haven't exactly got the best history and all. And there'll be rumours and stuff going around which will be weird, you know how it is when people have an 'unofficial' relationship. I don't think there's a story that'll cut it. I've got a solution but you might not like it... I think it'd be best if you pretended to be Sophie, at least until we get to my house. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Taken aback a little at being told to impersonate her best friend, you say \"I suppose it <i>would</i> stop awkward questions, but what if the real one sees?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry about that\", Rachel reassures, \"her bus picks the people in her area up 15 minutes ago and from the other side of school, she'll already be miles away by now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With mixed emotions, you say \"OK then, I'll try\", remembering that you'd told Rachel you hadn't tried transforming before. Closing your eyes, you are greated once again with the full body picture of you in the clothes you have on now. Concentrating on Sophie's name, an image of her appears next to the one of yours and starts to move towards it. You're surprised at the level of detail you can see on her clothes and makeup, having not seen her for any length of time before, definately not paying much attention to her clothes. Overlapping the two images in your mind's eye, you bring the one of Sophie to the front and feel a tingling sensation shiver round your whole body. You feel your spine get compressed and all the bones in your body constricting. Feeling a sort of rotating circle submerge part way into your body from your crotch to your chest, you can feel a current of energy pulling your groin upwards and pushing your breasts outwards. Not long after, the circle of energy departs and you feel the same restricting feeling around your chest telling you that a bra had formed. Opening your eyes one at a time, you see Rachel staring open-mouthed at you. \"Did it not work?\", you ask hearing Sophie's voice come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, no, no, it did, it definately worked, I mean, wow! I don't know what I was expecting but that was surreal!\". If you could see yourself now, you would see that Rachel was talking to a girl a little shorter than she was, with medium length brown hair in a messy style in a white blouse with the top buttons unfastened, an open black cardigan, the same skirt as Rachel and tan coloured tights with shiny black plimpsoles. Snapping herself out of her daze Rachel seizes the arm of your new body and drags you along the path saying \"Come on Soph we'll miss the bus!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Just as Rachel had predicted, there were no weird questions or looks on the bus. However, there was one thing she hadn't counted on, her 15 year old younger brother. Ever since you'd reached the bus stop he'd just been hanging around and had sat behind you on the bus which meant you and Rachel couldn't talk about anything that you want to talk about. Fortunately you'd been able to have an in depth discussion about episodes of Gilmore Girls, which was apparently Sophie's favourite show, thanks to raiding the mind of Willhemina Laurence for information, a girl in your class who was sitting towards the back of the bus. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n Off the bus, Rachel's brother was talking about what he was doing for his technology project, what he got in his maths test, and just about everything school related. He was even walking between you and was the same height as Sophie so you couldn't see Rachel's exasperated expression. Luckily, thanks to your new 'psychic link' Rachel could still communicate with you despite the barrier. <i>\"Sorry, I forgot!\"</i>, her voice rings in your head <i>\"He usually has an after school club tonight but it must have been cancelled when everyone was sent home. It looks like you're going to have to be Sophie a little while longer, Jeremy has a habit of coming into my room unannounced...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rachel turns and walks across the lawn infront of a house which you assume to be hers, you and Jeremy follow in single file towards the door. You realise that although you had never been here before, chances are Sophie had, so you have to be careful not to give the game away. Opening the front door and stomping her feet off on the doormat, Rachel enters the house, again followed by Jeremy then you. Closing the door behind you, you take off your new shoes placing them to one side and feel the thick carpet through your tights as obviously Sophie hadn't worn socks that day. \"Oh thank goodness!\", came a screeching from the kitchen as a middle-aged skinny woman with curly blonde hair bustled out of the kitchen towards you all. Wrapping herself around Rachel she says, \"I heard about what happened at school today, are you all OK?\", she moved on to Jeremy, without even waiting for a reply she continues \"I heard it on the news as I was having a bite to eat, I tried calling you but <i>you</i> young lady, had your phone switched off! Typical! You're never off it but when I call it's always switched off!\". Rachel's mum wrapped herself around you, \"Hello Sophie, does your mum know? Do you want to give her a ring? You'll be staying for dinner I guess will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Bamboozled by this assault of questions you stammer in Sophie's voice, \"Yes I've already told her, I'll only stay if you have me Mrs Yates...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh nonsense, you're always welcome here Sophie. Bit formal today aren't we? Mrs Yates... makes me feel old does that! You haven't forgotten your old Auntie Clair's name have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You beam back at her, \"No, not at all Clair, I'm just a bit shaken that's all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And well you would be after a scare like you girls have had today! Now I can get Gary to take you back home at around 8ish, is that too late? I know how much homework you'll have this year.\" You shake your head. \"Oh, spendid. Now you girls don't cause too much fuss OK? Dinner will be around 6.\", and with that she hurtled back into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Following Rachel's lead up the stairs, you think to her <i>\"Auntie Clair? Are you and Sophie related?\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At the top of the stairs you walk two abreast towards where you think Rachel's room will be, <i>\"No we're not it's just your, I mean, Sophie's mum and mine have known each other since kindergarten\"</i>, she turned her head to one side to look at you <i>\"You know, it's weird, you look like Sophie and you sound like Sophie, you've got her walk and you even have Sophie's aura around you, but when you think-talk, it's still your voice, if it hadn't been for that, I might have forgotten it was you!\"</i>. You both enter Rachel's room and she closes the door behind you.</span></div></div>",

Rachel zips around, drawing heavy purple fabric curtains over the bay window which overlooks the street, the curtains were in stark contrast with the walls which were painted yolk yellow. \"There. That'll stop people in the street accidentally seeing what we're doing but we'd better still keep our voices down, Jeremy's room is next door.\", you nod and stand looking around the room, Rachel gestures at a bean bag chair the same shade of purple as the curtains next to the desk, \"Sophie always sits there\", she says and you make your way over, jumping the last meter and turning in mid air to sit down facing the computer. \"Hahaha, that's how she always gets on as well!\", Rachel exclaims, \"What made you do it that way?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know\", you reply in Sophie's chirpy voice, \"Just felt like doing it!.\". Rachel turns on the computer and sits down next to you in a desk chair. From your seat on the bean bag you were only as high as Rachel's elbow but you still had a perfect view of the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's just as well we're here really\", Rachel states matter-of-factly, \"Like I said earlier, I think it would be best if people didn't know it was us when we used our powers so I think it's be best if we had some sort of disguise or alias. You know how I do textiles right?\", you shake your head, \"Well I do, and Sophie does too so mum might ask you questions about it. Anyway, this term's task is to design a coat and they've given us all design software to finalize the ideas before we start with the materials. Sooo, I thought we could maybe use that and look for some pictures as inspiration? Not that we need to make the clothes or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sounds like a plan! I'm stumped for ideas!\", you reply although really you already have a good idea of what you want Rachel's costume to be. \"Good thinking Ray Ray\", you say then fling one hand over your mouth triggering a laugh from Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wow this transformation power is really good!\", she laughs, \"Only Sophie ever calls me that!\".</span></div></div>",

You guessed that Rachel was right about you needing to remain disguised as Sophie, as it would have been a bit confusing to have to explain how you got there. Rachel turned around to face her brother. \"What is it bro?\" Rachel asked her brother, looking a bit bothered. \"You've gotta come into my room, I have something I want to show you.\" With that Rachel and you followed him to his room, his room was pretty messy, with papers and food wrappers everywhere, his room seemed smaller than Rachel's or maybe that was the clutter. Probably the most interesting, or shocking, feature of his room was the array of posters he had in his room. Some looked like giant robo-mechas, but the others were high quality animesque girls in compromising situations all with ridiculous proportions and embarassed expressions. You decided not to comment as this was something Rachel seemed to be comfortable with so chances were Sophie was as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I drew a picture of the girl who saved our school today...\" Jeremy said with excitement. \"Are you sure you didn't see someone else?\" Rachel questioned. \"Nope, I am sure it was a girl, she looked like you sis.\" She smirked and gave you an annoyed glare, You gulped and tried to hide your nervousness. \"Hmm, that sounds quite interesting and I am sure that I probably whoever HE, err, she is. I am pretty popular in school you know.\" Rachel said, intentionally making the mistake to show that she realized you were lying to her earlier. \"Could you just show us the picture already?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy showed an animesque drawing of the remodeled Rachel you changed into when you fought the badguys at the school. \"Wow, this is pretty cool!\" You said, stopping yourself from mentioning anything about her attractiveness. \"Yup! I even thought of a name for her already, the White Witch.\" Before he could make the situation any more uncomfortable, Rachel made an excuse, \"Sophie and I are really busy working on a textile design for a local business, you can tell us more about it during dinner.\" With that Rachel motioned you to head back into her room, and you followed her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked a bit embarassed and upset with you, and let out a sigh. \"Sorry about that, my brother is autistic and tends to spend lots of his time drawing or doing some technical modification with his computer, so he tends to spend much of his time in his room working on something. You can tell he is good, he drew all the posters in his room, though my mother is a little uncomfortable with his sexual tastes. He tends to consider me his best friend so I am always seeing whatever artwork he creates. Now about what I think you did today at school. I'll bet you changed into me for your own amusement, even after I told you not to. Good costume choice, but please don't tell me that you actually fought those bad guys in it.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rachel was staring at you nodding from time to time. \"You were the first person that came to mind so that's who I decided to try to turn into. It worked and my heart skipped a beat I was so excited!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That must have been what I sensed in my maths class then...\", Rachel mused, \"So did you use that costume or not?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I did...\", you say and see Rachel's eyes flash with annoyance. \"But!\", you quickly say, thinking up an excuse on the fly. \"I heard those people in the hall and knew I had to do something fast. I didn't think there was any time to change back so I had to disguise myself as best I could so people wouldn't think it was you. There were massive pink goggles covering half my face so I'm amazed your brother recoginsed me, or rather you. He's really got an eye for detail!\", you stop, not knowing what else to say and looking for Rachel's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was still a flicker of anger in her eyes as Rachel stood there taking it all in. \"So... let me just go over this again\", she said heavily. \"You went out in the middle of school as a scantily clad version of me in order to stop some guys single-handedly using strange powers right in the main corridor?\". You nod, she'd summarised the situation rather well. Rachel took another deep breath \"I would rather that you hadn't done that, but, considering what you said, it was better than it could have been. However...\", she sighed, a look of betrayal now replacing the anger in her eyes, \" Although I believe you're telling me the truth <i>now</i> , why did you lie to me earlier?\". You stammer, formulating an excuse but are interrupted, \"You know what, it doesn't matter, no one was hurt and I can understand why you wanted to test these powers out.\", she paused, \"Just don't ever lie to me again, OK? We need each other now and despite what's happened in the past, I want our new relationship to be built on trust.\". Rachel sighed again, walking back into her room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rachel was already sitting at her desk chair on the computer again, you go and stand beside her, placing one of Sophie's hands on her shoulder. <i>\"I'm sorry\"</i>, you think at her in your voice so she doesn't hear it as Sophie's voice, <i>\"I promise I won't lie to you again\"</i>. Rachel says nothing but puts one of her hands on top of yours on her shoulder. \"Friends Ray Ray?\", you say out loud as Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course Sophe\", she replies turning her head to smile at you, \"Now come and help me choose some colours will you?\". You take your seat on the bean bag once more and lean across to get a closer view at the screen. Suddenly Rachel stops moving the mouse, breathes out somewhat frustratedly and swivels the desk chair round to look at you. \"You know what Sophie?\", she says exasperated, \"It doesn't matter how many swatches we look at, how many comic book strip characters we research or how many designer's websites we browse, we're never going to find a 'perfect' costume. Even if we do eventually come up with one that looks brilliant for each one of us, do we really want to look the same all the time? We can look like whatever we want whenever we want, why decide just one superhero? You know what I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think I do\", you mutter \"You mean that instead of having just one set look, we should be able to look like whoever and whatever depending on what we feel like at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Exactly!\", Rachel shouts, \"It'd be so much more fun if each time we need to disguise ourselves it was different, well it doesn't have to be <i>each</i> time but surprises are always the best!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You feel Rachel's enthusiasm flooding across the psychic link sending your heart racing like you assume hers was and the Sophie part of you gave off a squeal. At that moment, Rachel's door opened again and in came Jeremy once more. \"What're you both talking about? I could hear Sophie squealing in my room, what's so good?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rachel flashes you a worried look, \"Oh it's nothing, we just decided on a pattern for textiles. Exciting stuff!\" she said cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jeremy just nodded \"Oh, alright, I thought I heard something about superheroes or something...\", he turned to leave then whipped back around \"Hey, you know if you need anything drawing for like a presentation or something... I can do a rough sketch in 5, a pencil drawing in 10 and watercolour or oil it in a half hour... you know where to find me\", and with that he sidled back out of the room closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rachel breathes a sigh of relief and collapses head first on to her bed. \"I've just had an idea Ray Ray\", you use Sophie's nickname for her again as you speak, \"Your brother is really good at art. If we're both going to have different costumes and be different people underneath those costumes then we could recruit him as an artist so we don't forget all our different styles. Of course I don't mean tell him about us, but if there was a way to implant the idea into his head... he enjoys it so we wouldn't be <i>using</i> him, it'd just be useful maybe? Who knows, if for some reason pictures of us are needed on the news, wouldn't it be good to have an accurate description rather than a blurry photo? He might even eventually get a job somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rachel springs up from the bed, turning on her side, \"That might not be such a bad idea... it <i>would</i> be interesting to see what we look like to other people. We'd have to be sly about it though, he's pretty sharp and I think he already suspects something.\"</span></div></div>",

Jeremy's door was slightly ajar and you could see he was still in there. \"Did you hear mum Jeremy?\", Rachel calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, I just need to... check out some things and then I'll be down.\", came the reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Following Rachel down the stairs, your heart started racing, it seemed like Sophie and Rachel's familys were really close, somebody was bound to realise you weren't the person you look like. Rachel turned whispering \"It's alright, just relax. Nobody will be able to tell. I know and I still have to keep reminding myself!\". Her words seemed to calm you down a bit as relaxed vibes flowed from her across your link. You follow her into the kitchen where she picked up a reasonably full bowl of what looked like a meat stew, you do the same and she leads you into the other room where her mum was already sitting at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come along girls, eat up before it gets cold!\", Rachel's mum says chirpily. There was a large tv pinned strategically to the wall in the corner of the room so everybody at the table could see it without having to turn much, the local segment of the news was on. \"Ooh, look!\", she piped up again, \"It's your headteacher, I wonder if he's going to say anything about today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...fortunately no one was hurt and although nobody managed to get a clear view of the girl who stopped these men, I think I speak for all of us here at Bridge Moor Comprehensive when I say 'thank you'. The school will be up and running again tomorr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I got a clear view\", Jeremy entered the dining room, bowl in one hand, picture in the other. \"Look mum, don't you think it looks a lot like Rache?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jeremy whizzed around the table and thrust his picture, which was now in colour, towards his mother. \"Very nice dear\", his mum commented and almost did a double take on the page, then in a more suspicious voice she said \"You know Rachel, this here picture does look a lot like you, you wouldn't happen to know anything about that would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rachel gulped down a mouthful of stew and gave off a nervous laugh, \"N-n-no, hahaha, why would I? Let me see, ahh yes, I can see why you think it looks a bit like me but this person's hair is too short and too light for mine, and do you think I'd wear that fruity getup during school time? Hahaha of course not, and what's this person supposed to have done? Frozen them to the floor? How am I supposed to have done that? I don't have superpowers or anything like that, that'd be ridiculous! Hahaha!\", she then gulped down some air and quickly resumed eating the stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You can sense the panic both across your link and in Rachel's voice, clearing your throat, you say \"I think what Rachel is trying to say Auntie C is that she was safely tucked away in maths with me on the other side of the school, we didn't even know this had happened until the fire bell went off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"YES! I mean, yeah, you see, it can't have been me. Ahaha ahaha *groan*.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you Sophie! At least one of you is speaking some sense, are you alright Rachel?\", her mum inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, mum, its just, yeah.\", she sighed. You notice Jeremy was glaring right at Rachel, as if trying to work something out and you could feel this was starting to annoy her. \"What is it? Stop looking at me like that you little squirt!\", Rachel had gone red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Rachel Penelope Yates!\", her mother half-yelled, \"Ever since you've sat down at this table you've been acting very strangely! I think you need to go into the other room for a minute to cool down!\". She stared Rachel out of the room then returned to her pleasant demeanor, turning to Jeremy \"Sit down petal and eat your dinner\", she then focused on you, \"I'm sorry had to sit through that Sophie dear, do you know what's gotten into her today?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Couldn't tell you Clair\", you reply, \"I think its just that those people who came into school today have got her scared. I mean, if that person hadn't stopped them then somebody could have gotten really hurt, and what with Jeremy saying he saw the whole thing I think she's just glad that he wasn't involved in it\", you then stop and laugh, scanning Rachel's mum's mind for any past memories where Rachel had snapped, \"But of course it could just be like last New Year's Eve, if someone looks at her funnily she's off like a rocket!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rachel's mum laughed \"Yes you've got that right Sophie! Some wise words there as well, sounds like you know Rachel like your mum knew me!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At that point Rachel returned to the room and sidled over to where her bowl was, quickly taking her seat. The colour of her face had returned to normal but she didn't raise her eyes to look at anyone. Murmuring to nobody but everybody at the same time she said \"Sorry Jeremy\", and started eating her now half full bowl of stew again. She ate the rest of the meal in silence and apart from Jeremy telling his mother about school today, everyone else was quiet too.</span></div></div>",

We've developed the staff of robots to produce the most delicious dishes possible. Thanks to our large amounts of space, expert chef bots, and our enormous supply of only the freshest ingredients we've got the largest buffet in the entire world.

You tried reading her mind to figure out what was happening, but you only heard repeats of what the man just said. You turned to Rachel and realized that she was worried about her mother's current state. Jeremy had a look of awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's-\" Jeremy stopped and continued staring. \"That's what?\" Rachel said. \"That's Dr. Eggman, but what's he doing here, he a fictional character from the Sonic games and the Sonic X show...don't you guys remember?\" You sorta remembered the games, granted you spent most of your free time watching classical movies or playing sports. \"Yeah I think I know what he is talking about, but how is this possible...I mean, well then again-\" You smartly cut yourself off before you could go any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You think there might be a connection?\"</i> Rachel's voice said in your head. <i>\"Maybe, but in any case do you think we can stand up to him? I mean we just got these powers today.\" </i> <i>\"Of course, we're probably more powerful than Sonic was ever capable of...so I think we should go and investigate what he is up to. I'm sure that there is more involved here than getting a quick buck.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's mother snapped out of the trance and turned to face you all with a big grin. \"I hope you all have room for more, we're all going to a special buffet tonight.\"</span></div></div>",

We've just eaten and I'm tired now as well, why don't we go tomorrow instead? It is a Saturday after all. What about Sophie? Her mum will be worried if she doesn't tell her where she's going!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rachel's mum turned to face her almost mechanically, still with a big grin \"Nonsense deary, you can't be tired, a young girl like you. It was only last week when you stayed out until 2 in the morning, I remember because I had to pick you up! Sure we've eaten but this is an all you can eat buffet for only ten dollars and the man said he was expecting us so it'd be rude not to show up.\", she paused for breath and clapped her hands \"Right, everybody in the car now! You can leave your plates on the table I'll clear them up tonight! We're going to swing by Sophie's on the way, tell them where Sophie is, and ask if her mum and Sarah want to come with us.\" Panic shot through you as you realise that your cover might be about to be blown, but you couldn't focus on a solution for long. \"Come along everybody!\", Rachel's mum was literally pushing you all towards the door, grabbing coats and bags on the way as if she had an extra set of hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before long, you, Rachel, and Jeremy were all in the back seat of the car with Clair driving. Backing out of the driveway onto the road in one clean, swift movement, the gears squealed as they were quickly changed from reverse to forwards. <i>\"What're we going to do?\"</i>, you hear Rachel's voice, <i>\"As soon as we get to your, I mean, to Sophie's house, things are going to fall apart. There can't be two Sophies!\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>\"Don't worry about it, I think I have a plan. At least I hope I do...\"</i>, you look across to Rachel over the top of Jeremy's head who was sitting in the middle of you and give her a smile. \"Hey Clair, when we get to my house how about just I go in and tell them about it and you leave the car running?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's nice of you sweetie, tell them to be quick as well! Can you imagine? Any food you want? It's amazing!\", and with that Clair switched on the radio '...Only ten dollars per person so come today!...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jeremy perked up in the middle of you and Rachel saying \"He's on the radio too? That definately sounds like Dr Eggman from sonic, if this wasn't real life I'd be thinking that this restaurant thing was only a front for some evil scheme! Hahaha...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, imagine that!\", you say exchanging worried glances with Rachel. Suddenly you get an idea, \"Hey Jeremy do you think you could quickly sketch this Eggman for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I reckon I could... but I don't have any... wait! Rache can you look in that pocket at the back of the seat infront of you please?\", Rachel nodded and stuck her hand into the seat pocket, fumbling around without watching. After a minute, she pulled out a slim pad of crumpled paper and an old pencil that looked like it had tooth marks on it and handed it to Jeremy. \"I knew it! I always used to keep drawing stuff in the car in case I saw anything!\", he flattened out the paper and began to draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While that had been going on, Clair had been racing the car through streets and country roads towards Sophie's house which was just at the end of this next street. Coming to a stop after skidding the last 10m, she said \"Go on then now Sophie, be quick!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You give her a smile and Rachel a nod as you open the car door and say, \"I'll do my best!\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Taking a deep breath to steady your nerves, you walk across the front lawn to the front door. You couldn't mess around out here as both Clair and Jeremy would know something was up. Readying yourself you stretch out a hand to the front door, turning the handle. Without hesitation, you step inside into the warm glow of the house lights from the darkness of the night sky. Closing the door behind you, it makes a sound bigger than you would have hoped. From deep inside the house you hear a woman's voice \"Sophie dear can you go see who's at the door?\", followed by a reluctant moan from upstairs. The stairs led directly down to the door so you hide behind the first door you see, one to the left which turns out to conceale a small cloakroom with a toilet and sink in it. Keeping the door open a crack, you can see the real Sophie making her way down the stairs. She was wearing a large brown shirt dress with some long patterned knee socks of a darker shade of brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Dress: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;catalogId=33057&amp;storeId=12556&amp;productId=2059317&amp;langId=-1&amp;sort_field=Relevance&amp;categoryId=208523&amp;parent_categoryId=203984&amp;sort_field=Relevance&amp;pageSize=20\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores...</a><br>\r\n Socks: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;catalogId=33057&amp;storeId=12556&amp;productId=2138296&amp;langId=-1&amp;sort_field=Relevance&amp;categoryId=208532&amp;parent_categoryId=203984&amp;sort_field=Relevance&amp;pageSize=20\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores...</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sophie had left the stairs and was making her way towards the door, you knew you had to do something to stop her from opening the door. Slipping out from behind the door you were hiding, you raise your hands to face Sophie and mutter \"Sleep\". The real Sophie heard that and turned around quickly but was confronted by a thick cloud of some sort of dust which was coming out of your hands. Staggering from side to side, eyes half closed, she eventually toppled over sideways, landing on her arm and then rolling onto her back. Surprised by the effectiveness of your technique you furtively look around for a place to hide her body. You didn't know where anything was and you couldn't use the bathroom you'd hidden in because chances were that someone would either need to get their coat or use the toilet. \"I wonder if I can transform other things like I can transform myself?\", you wonder to yourself, \"There's only one way to find out...\". Kneeling on the floor beside Sophie's limp body you stretch your hands over the top, \"Into what though?\", you ask thin air. Deciding on an idea, you watch as from your hands an energy envelopes Sophie. Firstly her body and clothes change from flesh and material into crystal, then her legs and head start to retreat towards her body, leaving two strands of hair poking out the top which instantaneously turned to a gold colour. Her head and legs had disappeared into her body now leaving a crystalline lump with the semblance of her dress. The lump then preceded to shrink, becoming flatter on the top and smoother around the edges. By now, nothing could determine what the lump had originally been as it shrank to the size of your palm, the surface of the stone now looked like it had been chizelled by an expert craftsman. The two strands of gold hair thickened and became linked together forming a chain-like structure. The edges of the stone glowed and changed into the same gold as the hair had done, surrounding the crystal on a bed of gold. Astonished at what you had just done, you stare at the piece of jewellry on the floor. The gem glowed with a light from within. \"I'm going to have to keep this safe\", you say out loud, slipping the gold chain over your head and round your neck flicking your long brown hair out of the way. You catch a glimpse of yourself in the hall mirror, \"My clothes!\", you were still wearing Sophie's school uniform, if anyone saw you now they'd know something was up. Darting back into the cloakroom-bathroom, you close your eyes and are faced with an image of yourself as you are now, Sophie in a school uniform. Concentrating hard, another image appears beside you, this one of Sophie in what you'd seen her in a moment ago. You overlap these two images in your head, bringing the last one to the front and open your eyes. You were standing infront of the mirror in this room and sure enough you saw everything you were wearing turn to brown. Your black cardigan, white blouse and black skirt all merged into one, turning a tan colour. They became more baggy as you watched the sleeves recede up your arms a little way and felt a tightening around your waist as the rim of your skirt had turned into two ties. You watched your tan coloured tights darken and holes open up in them, feeling them slip smoothly down your legs to just below your knees. You peered at your new altered image in the mirror, sure that you could see two dark green lines of eyeshadow that hadn't been there before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tearing yourself away from the mirror, you return to the task in hand. Upon emerging from the room, feeling the weight of your new pendant aroung your neck, bouncing off your chest, you hear the same woman as before who you assume must be Sophie's mum shout \"Sophie! Who was it?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You follow the sound of the voice, leading you into a lounge room where a woman with tawny hair and brilliant blue eyes was staring at you intently, on the sofa opposite was a girl smaller than the one you are now with brown hair tied in a ponytail wearing a red t-shirt and jean miniskirt. \"It was Clair and Rachel, they want to know if we want to go with them to this new restaurant downtown, Eggman's Incredible Buffet I think they said it was called...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well it's just as well I didn't cook anything tonight, your dad was just going to bring back pizzas from the shop. I'll give him a ring and tell him just to get one for himself. Sarah! Get yourself ready, we're going out for a meal. Tell them we'll be out in a minute sweetie\", Sophie's mum says directed at you. You go to the door, sticking your hand out waving to the car, you signal by holding up a finger that you'd be a minute then close the door again.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Breathing a sigh of relief, you rest for a moment behind the door as you hear various lights being turned off and Sophie's mum complaining at Sarah for being slow. A thought stikes you, \"I'm going to need a coat, and if Sophie's like any normal girl she'll have a bag filled with junk and a phone to carry around, where am I supposed to find all this?\". A wry smile spread across your face as you take the necklace out from under your shirt and gaze into the gem in the middle. You could still feel Sophie's consciousness inside so you try to get inside her mind. Fortunately it worked and you were able to glean the information as to the whereabouts of Sophie's stuff, which coat and shoes Sophie would wear with this outfit and that Sophie had entered a deep sleep state of mind and couldn't see or hear anything even if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You race up the stairs two at a time straight towards where you knew Sophie's room would be. You snatch up Sophie's phone off her bedside table, stashing it into one of the pockets in your dress. You then go to the wardrobe, flinging open the door and seize a dark green fake crocodile-skin handbag and a pair of brown boots. Closing the wardrobe again, you scoop up Sophie's purse from her desk, placing it in the bag alongside some random reciets and a couple of hygiene products you hoped Sophie would have no need of tonight. Hurtling back down the stairs, passing 'your' mum and Sarah putting their shoes on, you go back into the small cloakroom and grab a beige coat off the rack, forcing your arms down the sleeves and fastening it up like you had done it hundreds of time before. The coat reached just down to the bottom of your dress, leaving part of your legs between the socks and dress exposed. Sitting on a step, you squeeze your feet into the shoes, doing the buckle up, then follow Sophie's mum and sister outside and into their car. Giving Rachel a wave, you sit down in the back of another car. Sarah had claimed the front seat and for some reason this annoyed you. \"Muuum!\",you complain as she starts up the car, \"How come Sarah always gets in the front? My legs are longer she should give it to me!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Bag: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.eluxuryon.com/product_images/h/598/hermes_bags_2008__hermes_handbags_2009__32248_zoom.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.eluxuryon.com/product_images/...</a><br>\r\n Boots: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;catalogId=33057&amp;storeId=12556&amp;productId=2181518&amp;langId=-1&amp;sort_field=Relevance&amp;categoryId=208544&amp;parent_categoryId=208492&amp;sort_field=Relevance&amp;pageSize=20\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores...</a><br>\r\n Coat: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=12556&amp;catalogId=33057&amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;categoryId=226021&amp;productId=2167322\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores...</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Calm down Sophie, she got there first!\", she then turned to Sarah \"She's right though dear, you should let her sit up front or at least move your seat forward more.\". Sarah just groaned and slid the seat forward giving you more leg room. All the while you were sitting there bemused as to why you'd said anything in the first place.</span></div></div>",

It seemed like Clair inherrantly knew where she was going, turning down streets without hesitation. You could hear a faint 'boop' sound which you see is Sarah on her phone, it gave off a blueish light which cast an eerie shadow on the side of her face. Suddenly the mobile in the pocket of your dress vibrated violently causing you to jolt upright and breathe sharply. Sliding you hand through the buttons on your coat, you reach downwards until it comes into contact with a smooth rounded object which you grasp. It's a folded phone and you can see a green light coming from round the sides. Snapping it open you see the words 'New Message' in the middle of the screen. A few clicks later and you were in. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Jeremy's finished the drawing\", the message said \"I'm not sure if you have the phone so if you don't reply in a minute I'll assume you don't and I'll try to send a mental picture.\". An image file was attached to the text, a black and white sketch of a man who looked slightly different to the one who'd been on the commercial. It showed a tall man with long spindly legs attached to a large round body. The man's neck couldn't be seen but a large moustache was in clear sight underneath some beady black glasses, he looked a bit like the Pringles man's evil brother.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Selecting various choices from a number of scroll down menus, you eventually reach the reply function and an empty message screen opens up. \"Got the phone and the drawing, maybe we should keep an eye out for him when we get there? xx\", you send. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n Unsure as to why you sent the x's at the end, you never usually do, you get a message of a different kind from Rachel \u201cGlad you got the phone, Jeremy was bugging me to send the picture, now you can delete it though before the real Sophie sees it. Speaking of which, what did you do with her?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry about her\", you reply, \"She's perfectly safe and will actually be joining us at the restaurant\". You get a sense of puzzlement from Rachel but she doesn't ask any more questions on the matter. Turning your attention back to the phone, you select the message again and scroll through the menus to 'delete', seeing the message shrink down to the bottom corner and disappear. Just as you were opening your bag to stash the phone away, it vibrated again in your hand. There was another new message, this one wasn't from Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Heya gorguss, just seen this place on the tv. They say they do every food on the planet. Wanna come check it out with me and some others tomorra lunch? xxxx\", the sender was apparently someone called Hannah. You think you knew who it was as there was someone who hung round with Sophie and Rachel's group at school with the same name. Before you think about what you are going to reply, or indeed whether to reply or not, your fingers open the return message screen \"Sounds great baybee xx\", you instictively type, reading the message over, approving of it, then sending it. Sitting back and looking out the window, you think about the message you'd just sent, relieved that somehow in a nanosecond you'd managed to craft the perfect reply to keep your cover secret. The phone buzzed again, another message from Hannah, \"Great hun, we'll pick you up from yours at 11 xxxx\". Eyes flitting over the message, you reach a sudden realisation, the real Sophie won't know a thing about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You don't have time to think about this however as you turn to look back out the window and as the car pulled around one final corner, you were greeted by the sight of a humungous silver and red dome in the centre of acres of parking spaces, which had filled about half the way up with more arriving all the time.</span></div></div>",

Jeremy looked hesitant to go in, but Rachel's assuring tap pushed him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked in and you were amazed at what you saw. It looked like spotless chrome around the area, and it wasn't packed at all, probably because you arrived early for dinner. There were really robotic servers, they looked like a red egg with blue beady eyes, and a row of white lights that looked like a smile. There was another robot that looked like an octopus with 16 tentacles, each holding a makeshift hand or knife or spatula, that was making and serving sushi at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, he wasn't kidding, this place is special.\" Rachel said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed a man who had the same similar appearance of the robots working there, and the same person who appeared in the ad, that must be the legendary \"Chef Eggman\", he seemed to stare at you for a awhile with what looked like great interest, and then he turned and walked away. \"Do you think he is onto us?\" you spoke to Rachel through your psychic link. \"We can't just run off now, that would look suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all walked up to the robot host, it was by now that you realized that it was only you three that somehow managed to be unaffected by the mind control he had in the area. You motioned to your two comrades and gave them a silent gesture, reminding them not to irritate the \"Head Chef\". The robot then told you that your table number and you were on your way. You moved in and out through the crowd of people who were also in the restaurant constantly coming up or bringing back food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you sat at your table, Rachel's mother was already on her way up and gorge herself with food. \"Don't eat anything here, it could be poisonous.\" Rachel said. You and Jeremy both nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please feel free to rush as quickly as you want, after all,  you wouldn't want to WAIT for your next meal would you? We even have a SPECIAL offer for those who run the fastest.\" said Eggman's voice over the intercom. Clair seemed to be up for a long time, probably not wanting to waste time heading back to her table. Of course this was quickly removed from your mind as Eggman began to approach your table, had he caught onto your powers? Rachel thought quickly and grabbed Jeremy's hand giving him the gesture of zipping a mouth shut, she had a stern look on her face before she put on a smile to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman approached your table gave a quick bow. \"Hello I am founder and Executive Manager Doctor Ivo Robotnik, better known by my stage name as Doctor Eggman. It seems that you all aren't eating, not to mention you weren't looking too happy moments ago. I have taken great efforts to try and provide the greatest experience possible, but for some reason you three aren't interested in it.\" He said to you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all ate before we came here...we weren't too hungry or thrilled when we found out that we were being taken to ANOTHER place to eat. I hope you understand.\" You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then if you find anything that can make your experience better let me know. We don't let unsatisfied customers leave the store.\" He said with a pretty harsh tone in his voice, then he proceeded to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were conflicted, should you somehow find a way to get out of here without a fight, or grab his attention and fight him now.</span></div></div>",

I've been invited back here tomorrow with some of the girls so I can sort something out then\"</i>. Assuming that this was the same invite Sophie had just agreed to, and deciding not to tell Rachel, you give her a nonchalant nod then signal to one of the robots which came whizzing over to the table \"Can I help miss? I am happy to serve\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Can we get three normal sized plates and one big one for the table?\", you ask, winking to Rachel who was busy reassuring Jeremy. Jeremy didn't look at all pleased at what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Certainly miss\", the robot said, procuring the plates from a hatch in its body, \"Please enjoy your dining, I am happy to serve\". You watch the robot scoot off into the crowd and hand on plate to Rachel and another to Jeremy, putting the big one in the centre of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Take the plates, fill them up, bring them back, then put all the food in the middle and we'll take what we want OK?\", you whisper to the other two. Rachel nods, leaving the table, Jeremy still had a worried look on his face but follows his sister nevertheless. Glancing across, you see Clair and 'your' mum and sister with plates piled high. Leaving the table with your plate, you head over to a bright flashing sign that said 'Mexican' with a chili pepper holding two maracas, grabbing handfuls of tortilla wraps as you progress along the buffet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n At the end of the table you almost bump into 'Chef Eggman', with a wide grin he says \"So, decided to eat at last have we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Looking almost through him, you reply in a half-monotone \"Yes sir, I could not resist any longer, it looks so delicious and special. I'm bringing my friends back tomorrow for lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Nodding, the man laughs \"Ho ho ho, excellent! Now eat as much as you want, we wouldn't want all this to go to waste would we? Ho ho ho\". Leaving you standing there, he turns and walks off down a corridor behind the buffet table, you see his shoulders heaving as he chortles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n You scan the room for any sign of the others, seeing Jeremy following Rachel back to the table, their plates full of slices of pizza and pies, foods that were easy to share out. However, as you were looking, another family catches your eye. Just entering the restaurant were your real parents and brother, <i>\"Harumph, good to see they're not missing me\"</i>, you think to yourself grumpily. Walking briskly over towards them, keeping your tortilla-laden plate away from harm, you keep pace with your family as they walk towards an empty table. You scan their minds, all of which were thinking mostly about the words in the advert you'd seen for this place. Digging your way into their recent memories, you make them believe that you came home that day and were spending the night and the rest of the weekend away at Robert's house. Content, or at least as content as you could be seeing them here, you make your way back over to your table, piling the contents of your plate onto the central one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now what Sophe?\", Rachel says out loud, Jeremy eying the plate of food suspiciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now?\", you reply, \"Now we <i>eat</i>\", you say, putting particular emphasis on 'eat' so as to let them know not to do that. You signal to Rachel with your eyes off to the side where Eggman had reappeared and was watching your table from afar with interest. <i>\"Use your transformation powers to disconnect your stomach from your mouth, make a seperate bag thing to catch all the food you put in your mouth.\"</i>, you think over to Rachel.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n You see a glint in her eyes as she catches on. <i>\"But I've never done it before, what do I do? And what about Jeremy? We can't let him eat it!\"</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <i>\"Don't worry about him, I've already done it to him. Just imagine what you want and you'll feel yourself changing.\"</i>, you think-reply. You see Rachel close her eyes them open them suddenly, clutching her gut. \"That was weird!\", she says out loud, turning to Jeremy who was staring at her she continues \"What're you waiting for, eat! Trust me!\". Rachel leaned over, getting several slices of pizza and slopping them down on her plate. Jeremy followed suit. You also started to refill your plate, and before long started shovelling the food into your mouth. Out of the corner of your eye you see Eggman laugh again and walk off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a while, the centre plate had been emptied \"It's strange\", Jeremy piped up, \"I feel just as full as I did when I came in but I know I ate something else!\". Rachel whipped around, placing her finger over her mouth to signal him to be quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eggman reappeared at Clair and Sophie's mum's side of the table \"I trust you <i>all</i> had an enjoyable experience at Eggman's Incredible Buffet, come again soon!\", Rachel and Sophie's mum silently stood up and followed him over to the door. You all follow them, passing Eggman at the door, hearing him laughing quietly to himself as if relieved. </span></div></div>",

You then start to think of a way you could use this to your advantage. You could make the world a better place, you could end world hunger, or even you could meet aliens. Or better yet, you could take this to a whole new level. You instantly run into a broom closet, making sure no one would see what you were doing. You smirk as you snap your fingers creating a floating full body mirror to show your reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's see what would make this school flip?\" You thought aloud, before an actual light bulb appears overhead. \"I've always wanted to do that. Now to focus on my plan. First, a change is in order.\" You snap your fingers, causing your body to be engulfed in a plume of smoke. The smoke cleared, revealing a fine woman in the reflection instead of your normal appearance. She had long blonde hair, that went past her shoulders, wearing these lovely smokey blue earrings. She had tan skin, wearing a blue bikini top with a floral print on the nips, along with a matching bikini bottom. \"Oh man, I look hot. I wonder how much attention I'd get.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out of the closet, slamming the door wide open as everyone turns to you with shocked expressions. You smirk flipping your hair back as you began to take a walk down the hall, all eyes on you. A nearby guy was walking staring at you, only to trip over a trash can causing you to snicker a bit. Another guy was skating in the hall, he soon caught sight of you causing him to not look ahead and crash into the corner. You laugh as you kept seeing guy after guy trip over themselves, as well as earning a few glares from girls. <i>'I guess not all of my lookers can be happy.'</i> You thought as you saw a few nearby nerds in larping gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boys, wanna take a look at these twenty sided dies.\" You offered causing the nerds to faint against the lockers. <i>'This is just way too easy. Not only that, no one knows its me. I could do this all day.'</i> You thought as you started to turn a corner, only to accidentally bump into Rachel. \"Oh, hey Rachel.\" You smile innocently, as she stares at you weirdly before she realized who you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't.\" She deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did.\" You smile widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me.\"  She grabs you, as you and her were instantly teleported to the empty gymnasium. \"I can't believe you used your power to parade around the school like a random bimbo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! For your information, the guys of this school liked this body.\" You defended yourself, causing Rachel to roll her eyes at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they do, they're guys!\" Rachel remarked, as she pouts at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. I'm just having a little fun, Ms. Fireball.\" You joked at the little power thing from this morning. \"Hey, transform into something. You should try it, its awesome as heck. Plus it feels painless.\" She looks to you for a second, but then thought about it for a while. She was soon engulfed in a plume of blue smoke, before it cleared revealing a different girl in her place. She had sky blue hair, along with blue snowflake like earrings with matching blue lipstick, her eyes a night sky blue. She was wearing a snowflake like dress with white fuzz all over the end of it, wearing dark blue gloves with the same white fuzz at the end along with two beads hanging on each end. She was wearing blue platform boots, along with white knee high socks. You smirk snapping your fingers, causing a mirror to appear in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, I look good.\" Rachel poses in the mirror like a runway model. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure do, now if you need me. I am going to walk into the library and make every nerd in there faint.\" You smile as you start to walk through the gymnasium doors, going into the library. <i>'Oh man, I will never get tired of my powers.'</i> You smirk as you see everyone look at you, nearly every nerd in there was watching you. You then started to think what would be the best way to get them to faint. You then think smugly, as you then undo your top and drop it on the ground causing all the men in the room to faint from the sudden bra drop. <i>'I love having the power of everything!'</i> You thought proudly.

A thick gold chain necklace was secured inside, a pale blue glow surrounded its edge and filled the space between the links. You stare at the chain which looked way too big for the box it was in, feeling a strange power emanating from it. Another quick look confirmed that you were still alone, <i>\"I'd better get this to the lost and found or something...\"</i>, you decide and were just about to close the case again when without thinking, you stroke the side of the chain with one of your finger knuckles. It was ice cold to the touch, but on the instant that you did, the blue glow disappeared from the chain. Pulling your hand back, you jump at the realization of this subtle difference. You pluck up the courage to reach out another finger to touch its surface. Reaching out, you let out a small shout as you see that the glow that was on the chain was now on your knuckle in the place where you touched it. Astounded, you watch the circular glowing region as it moves up your finger, spreading out across the back of your hand and then up your arm, illuminating your white shirt from within as it went. Once it reached your shoulder, you could no longer see it but it it didn't go down so you could only assume it was going up your neck. Dashing towards the first reflective surface you can find, which happens to be a window in the door of the food hall, you can make out your worried face, the glowing dot moving its way steadily upwards. You watch it reach the centre of your forehead where it paused. You look back down to the box in your hand, the chain had disappeared <i>\"Oh yeah, that'd be about right wouldn't it?\"</i>, you think to yourself, returning your attention to the glowing dot on your forehead. It had started pulsating, sending waves of light across your body. The frequency of the waves increaced until you couldn't tell if it was still pulsating or if your whole body was now just glowing constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You bring your hands to your face, examining them in the window, noticing that the box had followed the chain and disappeared, but this was the least of your worries, \"I'm frickin' blue!\", you exclaim down the empty hallway. Looking down the corridor into the school, half hoping nobody would see you and half hoping somebody would come and help, you become aware that your shadow cast against the wall had gone. Turning back to the window, you pull your hands back up to your face, puzzled and even more frightened now that the glow had left your body and everything seemed normal. A glint caught your eye and you examine yourself in the reflective window. Pulling your collar down out of the way, you see that the gold chain had somehow found itself around your neck. It didn't feel cold like it did before, in fact it didn't even feel like it was there. You move your hand as if to touch it, when the burning cold like before ignited again on your finger and you saw only black </span></div></div>",

You still had a headache, probably from collapsing earlier but you had no idea what had brought it on. <i>'Wait! That chain thing!'</i> , reaching up to your neck, you can feel the chain still there but it seemed thicker and bigger than when you'd last felt it. You try to take it off so your mom won't see but it clings stubbernly to your neck moving over your skin but never away from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In a whirlwind, your mom re-entered the room brandishing a mug of hot honey and lemon. \"Here, this ought to help whatever it is that you've got\", she said, giving you the mug and settling on the sofa by your feet. After a moment of careful watching to make sure that you'd taken a sip she continued \"Now, I've got to go back into school, not your school obviously, my one. You're lucky I could come and get you, any later and I wouldn't have been able to leave my class. Make sure you're OK and ring me if anything happens, love you!\", and with that she pecked you on the forehead and bustled out of the room. Your mom taught some of the lower years at a local school, you'd been there several times when you were younger and ill so you were glad she decided not to take you this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Still puzzled about earlier, you put down your drink and start thinking about the chain again. Even though you'd blacked out earlier, you feel fine now, like nothing had happened but still you couldn't pull this chain off your neck. While you were thinking, your dog Baxter came padding in from the kitchen, he was allowed free roam around the house when everyone was out which your dad didn't like in the slightest. \"Hey Bax\", you say while stroking him, \"I'm really confused about today, could you help me?\", the dog just sat there waiting to be petted again, \"I'll take that as a yes. OK. Let's think, I was in the cafeteria, I found this box with some jewellry inside it, I touched this chain and it disappeared into me, then the box disappeared, then the chain reappeared, I fainted and now I can't get this damn thing off me!\" The dog panted and wagged its tail \"Ahh it's no use, the more I think about it the stranger it gets.\", Baxter then seemed to nod his head before running back off into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You stand up and head up the stairs to your room. Passing the mirror in the hallway you stop to examine the chain, the collar on your white shirt covered most of it up but you could still see it glinting where you'd taken your tie off. It was a thick chainlinked gold chain that went right the way around your neck (like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.tnsdiamonds.com/MonsterGold/DSCN9468.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tnsdiamonds.com/MonsterGold/D...</a> ) but you couldn't feel any weight coming from it. You undo the top few buttons of your shirt to get a better view of it. Events were still racing through your mind <i> 'I fainted then someone slapped me, I woke up, Rachel...' </i> you pause, transfixed on the gold glare the chain was giving and repeat in your head <i> 'Rachel...' </i></span></div></div>",
