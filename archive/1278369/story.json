It maybe was a little tight but it would hold. She also grabbed a white T-shirt with short sleeves and looked at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n\"Do i look cute or what?\"<br>\r\nHer mother walked in. <br>\r\n\"You look fantastic honey.

I will. But i would liked it if she did't lived so far. Can't she move?\"<br>\r\n\"You know your grandmother don't want to.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, he failed to notice the fact that his glasses were slipping, so engrossed was he in his pursuit. The eyepiece, nonetheless, slid further and further away from his ears, and further and further down his muzzle, unused to such speeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he did not notice his glasses slipping, the wolf did not register the tiny rock jutting out of the ground in front of him\u2026that is, until one of his front paws slammed directly on top of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEEEEOWW!\" the wolf's pained yelp rang through the air, and he tumbled forward, the momentum propelling him forward a good few feet. At the same time, his glasses were violently dislodged from the bridge of his snout; they, too, flew through the air, landing on the forest floor a few feet in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf grunted as he hit the ground belly-first, wincing as his muzzle smacked upon the ground. \"Ooh, that'll leave a mark\u2026\" the wolf mumbled, staggering to his hind feet/paws. He winced again, noticing the ache in his muzzle. Reaching up with his hands/front paws, he gently massaged his snout, letting out a sigh of relief after a few seconds. \"Nope, nothing's fractured. Still hurts like heck, though,\" he grimaced, continuing to massage his muzzle. \"Geez, what did I step on? A stick, or a rock, or something like\u2026\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped abruptly, his eyes focusing on his hands, still on his muzzle. Only problem: they seemed a bit more blurry than usual. \"Crap! Where're my glasses?\" He felt around his ears, hoping that he might at least find them dangling from one of the pointed appendages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck; they were nowhere to be found. The wolf felt a brief surge of panic; those glasses hadn't been easy to come across, and he couldn't see a thing without them. Long story short: if they were lost or worse, broken, he was out of luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilling himself to stay calm, the wolf dropped to all fours, tail held high in the air. He scuttled about, sniffing wildly, as his tail waved to and fro, bristling with nervous energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, crap, crap,\" the wolf hissed, exposing his teeth in a worried grimace after several seconds of searching had passed, with no results. \"Where are they, where are they, where are\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf stopped dead as he felt one of his back paws fall upon something hard, flimsy, and very breakable. Slowly-very slowly-he moved his back paw up off the ground, at the same time turning himself around to get a better look at the unfortunate object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, please, please don't let that be my glasses,\" the wolf muttered, trying to fight back the sense of panic growing within his chest. \"Please, please, please don't let those be my glasses,\" he said again, repeating it as though it were the most sacred of mantras. \"Please, please, please\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like minutes (but was, in reality, only a few seconds,) he was finally staring directly at the destroyed object. His vision was still blurry, so he couldn't make it out exactly, but he could make out the color: namely, a light brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap, he thought to himself, anxious. That was the same color as his glasses rims! Anxiety churning at an even greater intensity than before, he squinted his eyes as hard as he could\u2026and promptly let out a huge sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he had stepped on was not a pair of glasses, but rather a couple of small sticks. The broken twigs were hard and brittle, which readily explained the unpleasant crunching noise they had produced when trampled upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf let loose another relieved sigh. \"Heh\u2026heh heh,\" he chuckled nervously, slowly backing away from the offending twigs. \"Freakin' sticks\u2026.\" He turned around, glancing left and right as he did so. \"Now,  I've just gotta keep looking around, and hope I don't actually step on-eh?\" His lupine ears perked up as one of his front paws brushed across something. Puzzled, he glanced downwards. There, right in front of him, sat his glasses, a bit dirty but otherwise unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another sigh of relief escaped the wolf's muzzle. \"Oh, good,\" he breathed, quickly scooping them up in his paw and standing back up on his hind paws as he did so. \"Good thing I wasn't searching like that the whole time; otherwise, I'd be crap outta luck!\" Chuckling from relief, he stuck out his tongue and wet a couple of his fingers before using the padded digits to wipe the dirt and leaves off the lenses. Smiling, he blew on the lenses a bit to dry them before placing them back on his face. \"Ah, that's better\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep whiff. \"Ah, that smells really nice\u2026\" Ears perking, he sniffed the air some more. \"\u2026and whatever it is, it's really close by!\" He took stock of his surroundings; forest floor all around him, a few trees in back of him, a line of trees at his front, what looked like a dirt road in front of that tree line\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" he exclaimed suddenly, his tail swishing about in frenzied excitement. \"That's where its coming from!\" With his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his nose lost in that wondrous smell, he dropped back to all fours, tensed his limbs, and leapt forward.  He grinned as he sailed towards his destination. HereIcomehereIcomehereIcomehereIcome\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd just about reached the dirt road, and he thought he might even make a perfect landing, four paws and all. Incidentally, no sooner had this thought flitted through his head than a frightened scream rang through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a startled yelp of his own, the wolf lost his concentration and tumbled, quite un-gracefully, the rest of the way, smashing into the ground back-first and raising a cloud of dust. \"GAH! That's the second time today!\" he grumbled, hoisting himself up on his hands. He winced suddenly, massaging the area between his neck and shoulder with a padded hand. \"Geez, at this rate, I'll end up with arthritis or something\u2026\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears perked up, and, on impulse, he glanced to the side. As soon as he did  so, his eyes widened, as he saw what could only have been the source of the scream\u2026and it wasn't quite what he'd expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, standing only a few feet away from him on the dirt road, was a young girl, about twelve or thirteen years old. Her attire was simple, yet tasteful: an earthy-brown homespun dress, well-worn leather shoes, and, most striking of all, a red cowl that terminated in a short cape. She carried a simple, handwoven basket in her hands, which quivered along with her arms. From beneath that hood, her light blue eyes stared at the wolf, widened in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf turned to the girl, blinking in surprise. Still rubbing the back of his neck, he ventured an uncertain greeting. \"Um\u2026hi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi\u2026\" the girl stammered, the basket still shaking in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf groaned quietly; out of all the things he could of said, he had to go and say 'hi'? It certainly wasn't doing the poor girl any favors. The wolf shook his head, taking a deep breath through his nostrils\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026and immediately straightening, ears shooting up. That wonderful smell was back, and it was really close by! The wolf's eyes flitted about, trying to see where the smell might be coming from, before they finally settled on the basket the girl was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEngrossed in the delectable scent, the wolf practically lunged in the girl's direction, barely noticing the girl's terrified yelp. Dropping further to the ground, the human-like wolf put his snout to the basket, taking a deep whiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe practically moaned as his nose was overpowered by the sweet smell. \"Ohhh, that's good\u2026\" He took another deep whiff, helpless to prevent another moan from escaping his muzzle. Whatever was in that basket, he wanted it, and wanted it bad. Unable to help himself, he took a third whiff, this time opening his muzzle a bit. He paid little heed to the tiny amount of saliva, which had pooled over the last few seconds in his mouth, dripping out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, at this point, was even more nervous than before. What was he doing? Getting really close to her, sniffing at her, drooling near her? It was almost like he was\u2026 the girl paled, not wanting to think any further on the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the wolf, oblivious to this reaction, finally decided he'd had enough. Backing up and standing up to his full height, he wiped a hand across his mouth, wiping away the saliva and wondering, offhand, just how long he'd been producing it. \"Man, that smells awesome,\" he mumbled, a goofy grin forming across his muzzle. \"Whatcha got in there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here?\" The girl blinked in confusion. \"Oh! You mean in the basket!\" She glanced down at it, now feeling more confused than frightened. \"Um, a batch of cookies I made for my grandma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made those?\" the wolf exclaimed. \"Musta done a good job, if the smell's anything to go by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of herself, the girl smiled. \"Nah; it's her recipe, but she makes them the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf shrugged. \"Hey, a cookie's a cookie; so long as they're not rock hard and tasteless, it's all good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl blinked. \"Um, thanks, I guess. Still, I hope they make her feel a little better<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" The wolf's eyes widened, his curiosity piqued. \"Is something the matter with her?\" Great; freak the girl out some more, why don't you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl straightened, a bit of firmness coming into her expression. \"W-why do you want to know? You're not planning to do anything to her, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" The wolf couldn't believe what he was hearing. \"Of course not! Why would you think something like that?\" He knew wolves weren't exactly the most popular critters around these parts, but still\u2026 \"Look, I'm just curious; there's no reason to jump to conclusions or anything.\"  </span></div></div>",

Besides that, who are you? Why aren't you wearing any clothes? And why do you have glasses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf laughed nervously, holding up both of his hands. \"Whoa, kid, one question at a time.\" He thought for a second. \"Then again, I probably could have explained a few things.\" Clearing his throat, he began answering her questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, my name's Janus. Pleased to meetcha.\" He held out a hand. \"And yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl eyed his hand suspiciously for a few seconds, only reaching out once she'd stared at it for a bit. \"My name's Red. I\u2026guess it's nice to meet you, Janus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanus grinned, exposing his sharp teeth and causing Red to flinch a bit. \"That wasn't so hard, was it?\" Without waiting for her to answer, he immediately picked up on her second question. \"Why aren't I wearing clothes? Um, please note\u2026\" he gestured to his body. \"Notice the fur. Notice the paws. Notice the tail and ears. Notice the freaking muzzle. I'm  a wolf; why would I bother with clothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed shrugged. \"Well, I wouldn't have a problem if you walked like a normal wolf, but you're standing up like a person. Wouldn't people see\u2026certain things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanus groaned. \"Oh, c'mon! It's not that bad! Seriously, I don't get what it is with you humans and your obsession with covering up your bodies. I mean, yeah, clothes do look snazzy, but the minute they come off, you're running and ducking for cover.\" He grunted, folding his arms. \"And anyway, you can't see anything; if you can take your eyes off my handsome mug for a second, you could plainly see that I'm decent, so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising her eyebrows skeptically, Red nonetheless slowly moved her eyes from Janus's face all the way down to\u2026 a certain point on his body. A jolt of dread slinked up her spine. He'd better not be lying about this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, he wasn't, and Red breathed a quiet sigh of relief; true to Janus's words, his fur covered his body in such a way that specific sights were hidden from curious (or insane) eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanus smiled. \"See? Didn't I tell ya? Nothing to see here.\" He chuckled, scratching the back of his head. \"And before we get too off-subject here\u2026you wanted to know about my glasses, right?\" The girl nodded, now more curious than anything. \"Well, it's simple, really; I can't see a damn thing without 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed blinked, confused. \"Don't wolves smell their way around most of the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanus shrugged. \"Well, admittedly, I do use my nose a lot, too, but there are some things that are best experienced with these.\" He pointed to both his eyes. \"Besides, if I just used my nose, chances are I'd come across a few too many\u2026unpleasant\u2026 smells, if you catch my drift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl grimaced. \"I'm not sure I want to\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humanoid wolf waved a dismissive paw. \"Eh, I don't blame ya; some things you just don't wanna hear about.\" He chuckled, but quickly froze as he took in another whiff of the cookies. \"Oh man, those smell so good. How'd you make them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl opened her mouth, but quickly shut it. \"I-I'm sorry, but I don't know if my grandma would appreciate me sharing her recipe with a stranger. She's had it for years, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMust be a heckuva recipe, Janus mused, brow furrowed in thought. Still, it makes sense she wouldn't wanna share it. But man oh man, I want those cookies so bad\u2026ah! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin slowly spread across Janus's muzzle as a light bulb flashed in his mind. \"Say, kid,\" he began, his smile slowly widening. \"If I asked her nicely, you think she'd be willing to share her recipe with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh?\" Red snapped to attention, instantly on guard. \"Well, I dunno; I mean, it's not like it's a jealously guarded secret or anything, but I don't know if she'd want to share it with someone who\u2026erm\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might wanna eat her?\" Janus spoke up, finishing her sentence. \"Relax, I don't plan on eating anyone today; I'll just make myself a bit more presentable, head off, and hope she doesn't mind me dropping in.\" His ears twitched. \"Oh, that reminds me: where did you say her house was again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed narrowed her eyes. \"I didn't, and honestly, I don't know if I feel like telling you. I mean, you seem nice enough, but I don't wanna take the chance that\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just keep following this road until I come across a little cottage, right?\" Janus butted in, startling the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes\u2026how did you know..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bipedal wolf shrugged. \"Eh, I've passed by it a couple of times in the past; never really gave it much thought, though.\" Upon catching her wary look, Janus sighed. \"Look, kid, I give you my word; I'm not gonna hurt your grandma, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed glared at him, but nonetheless nodded. \"Alright, if you say so. You'd better not be lying, though\u2026\" Keeping her eyes on Janus, she slowly strolled past him, heading on her way down the dirt road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched her go, blinking. \"Well, she didn't seem too happy; maybe I should stay off the road.\" He rubbed his hand-paws together, a smile quickly forming on his muzzle. \"Anyway, first things first; gotta find me some clothes, first.\" Tail wagging, he darted back into the trees, peering out at the road from behind a large pine tree. \"Should be easy enough; just gotta wait for an unsuspecting passerby to stroll by, and then I can jump 'em, take their clothes, and be on my merry way.\" He grimaced. \"They're probably not gonna be too happy, though....\" he shrugged. \"Ah, I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. Besides, it wouldn't be the first time I've gotten humans pissed at me\u2026\" He winced as he remembered the sight of an angry lumberjack, axe in hand, chasing him through the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of his trepidation, Janus snorted. \"Hey, it was his fault for making such delicious-smelling flapjacks\u2026\" He grinned, rubbing his stomach. \"And man, were those worth the effort!\" He could almost taste it as he thought back to it: the fluffy pancake, the butter and syrup slathered across it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears perked up suddenly. \"Eh?\" Snapping out of his reverie, he looked up\u2026and grinned as he spotted exactly what he'd been looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothin' personal, stranger,\"  Janus muttered as he tensed, ready to pounce on the young man that strolled, unsuspecting, across the dirt road. \"But I need me some duds\u2026and you've got exactly what I need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Licking his lips at the sight of the chubby girl kneeling on the floor in front of him, he walked over to her and helped her pick up the cookies and the basket from the floor. <br>\r\n  \"I'm so sorry, little girl,\" the wolf simpered, handing her back the basket. Red took it from him looking deeply annoyed. <br>\r\n  \"And so you should be! I was taking those cookies to my grandmother's house. Now they aren't good for anything! Granny will be most upset!\" Red exploded, unable to keep her annoyance back.<br>\r\n  \"I don't think she will be quite as upset as you are. I expect you were planning to keep the cookies you didn't eat earlier for the remainder of the journey!\" the wolf said accusingly, feeling rather smug. <br>\r\n  \"I...how did you...well, I'm hungry and I need to keep my strength up. I'm a growing girl!\" Red replied, defiantly. <br>\r\n  \"You certainly are!\" the wolf grinned, taking in Red's tight skirt and the pot belly that was making it so uncomfortable. \"I tell you what, I have some more cookies in my cave not far from here. If we walk there, I can give you some more cookies to take to your grandmother and you can be on your way.\" <br>\r\n  Red hesitated. </span></div></div>",

Red agreed and sat outside and waited. While she waited she ate the rest of the treats in the basket causing her clothes to rip a little. After ten minutes she grew tired of waiting so she went into the wolf's cave asked when he was coming out. He just said,\" I a minute\". Red grew more and more impatient so she went deeper into the cave to find the wolf. When she found him he had a big pot out, a cutting knife, chopped vegetables, and a fire going under the pot. \"Uh, I can explain!\" \"You were getting ready to eat me!\" \"Well...yeah so what if I was!?!\" \"You can't eat me!\" \"I've eaten bigger things than you my dear\" Red was shocked to hear this still said, \"So?\" Now the wolf was shocked then it turned to fear. \"P-P-P-P-P-PLEASE DON'T HURT MEEEEEE!!!!!!!\" Red was surprised at the wolf's response, she finally decided to...</span></div></div>",

Her thighs and ass were so fat, they were close to spilling over the edge of the chair she was sitting in.  They jiggled and bounced everytime she readjusted herself in her seat. Her belly rested perfectly in her lap, filled with delectable desserts.  A nice roll had formed at her side.  Her arms had grown wider, and vigorously jiggled while she stuffed her pudgy face.  A double chin was beginning to form, moving with the motion of her jaw when she chewed.<br>\r\nGrandma just stood over to the side, watching Red get fatter and fatter, replacing the empty plates of food with even bigger ones.</span></div></div>",

I've got a big chocolate cake that should tide you over until I get back,\" Grandma said as she disappeared into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she returned, she was wheeling what had to have been the LARGEST cake Red had ever seen into the room.  Red's eyes lit up as she gazed upon the master piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The table is a third of the size of this cake, so you'll have to sit on the floor to eat it,\" Grandma said, but Red was already digging into the side of the cake, lard icing dripping down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma walked out the door, giving Red one last look and smile as she closed the door.  Red didn't notice, however, because her mind was set on eating the cake.  From the looks of it, Red didn't even seem to be tasting the cake.  It was more like she was breathing it in.  You could definitely tell she was eating it, though.  It was showing on every inch of her body.  Her pot belly had turned into well-formed rolls, resting at her knees and spreading out 6 inches on both sides.  Her ass and thighs surpassed her belly by another 6 inches, taking on most of the weight.  Her ankles had become hidden under a roll of fat.  Her fingers had become little sausages, becoming engulfed by small rolls, and her wrists had also gotten covered by fat.  Her face had become quite plump, making it look like she was squinting.  Her double chin had completely formed and was now creating another chin.  But this weight gain only made her want more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plowed through the cake in no time and sat back in the chair to rest.  That lasted all of 5 seconds until the chair splinted under her weight. She fell to the floor with a loud ~THUD~, causing ever inch of her body to jiggle.  She loved the feeling.  She grabbed under belly and shook it vigorously.  The sensation became to much for her and she fell backwards, moaning with pleasure as she orgasm'd.  She breathed heavily, whcih made her belly jiggle even more causing another orgasm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 30 minutes of the repeating cycle, she grew tired and just laid there, thinking of how fat she could become.  Then it hit her.  She didn't know how fat she actually was.  She tried to get up, but her weight pinned her down.  This made her laugh and she began to think of ways to get up.  She finally decided to grab the edge of the table and pull herself up.  After about 5 minutes of failed attempts and struggles, she eventually got up.  There was a body mirror on the wall, whcih she used to look at her body.  She smiled with glee as she saw her belly hanging and swaying down at her knees.  She turned sideways and looked at her ass, which was jutting out about a foot behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked down the hallway to the bathroom, where the scale was and stepped on it.  After a few minutes of sucking in and pushing on her belly, she was finally able to read the numbers.  The numbers shocked her and made her smile bigger than she has ever smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"395 pounds,\" She read aloud. She couldn't believe she had gone from 185 to 395 pounds in less than a day.  Surprisingly enough, she wanted to get fatter.  But was there anything left?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked (rather, she waddled) to the kitchen and opened the pantry.  Inside, she saw...</span></div></div>",

She didn't hesitate for one minute and immediately snatched the jug out of the pantry and waddled to the table.  She didn't even want to mix it with anything.  She cracked it open and immediately began swallowing it as best she could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must have been the good stuff because it didn't even take the time to digest.  It immediately turned into layers upon layers of fat, making her expand at a rapid rate.  Her belly eventually touched the floor and began to spread out across it.  Her feet disappeared inside her massively fat legs and her ass was become even more globular.  Her upper arms were slowly disappearing into her huge side rolls.  Eventually, she was unable to stand and she fell to the floor.  She fell with such force, the ground shook at an earthquake level and crushed the foundation of the house.  The house fell to the ground and all that remained was the table and Red, who didn't pay any mind to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RED! What did you do?\" A voice said from where the door use to stand.  It was Grandma, who was standing there with a shocked expression on her face,\" That weight gain powder is only to be used in mixtures.  It's much too powerful in pure form!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha...\" a high-pitched laugh carried across the wood,\" Thank you old woman! Your work is done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.  I'm too late,\" Grandma said, horrow stricken in her voice,\" Red, I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden, a fat figure appeared behind Grandma and, with one gulp, ate her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed looked over to see a rather obese girl about her own age.  The girl was licking her lips as she rubbed her belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there...It'll be over soon,\" The girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed began to get worried.  She had no idea what just happened, but began to worry because she had an idea of what could have just happened. \"Who are you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"I'm the 'Big Bad Wolf' that has become legend in your village,\" The girl replied,\" People are to chicken to say they are afraid of a girl walking around the woods, eating lost hikers.  They have their god-forsaken pride to look after.  After awhile, the people who have met me and lived erased my picture from their mind and actually believed there was a wolf.  It's fine by me, but the people that I do catch are never enough to satisfy my hunger.  So I made a deal with your Grandma.  I was to spare her life if she gave me a fat person to feast on.  Come to find out, she was willing to give up her own grand child to stay alive.  And apparently she wanted to stay alive REALLY bad because, damn, she fattened you up to be the best feast I've ever had.  But don't worry, you still have another two hours to live.  <br>\r\nYou see, that powder you have just completely chugged has prolonging effects.  In it's purest form it will keep adding weight to your frame long after you finish it.  And from the looks of it, your head will be the only thing visible above your massively fat belly after this is done.\"<br>\r\nRed looked down at her belly and saw that it was true.  She actually saw her belly expanding with layers and layers of fat and rolls.  She could feel her ass, which was already lifting her 6 feet off of the ground, was continuing to lift her farther and farther into the air.  Her entire body jiggled with ever miniscule movement and breath, swaying ever so nicely.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't even open her eyes anymore because the fat had sealed them shut.  Her body had become more of a belly, with hints of other parts inside.  Her voice had become very muffled, so she stopped because it was pointless.  The only thing she could think about was how her own grandmother had given her up to the girl.  She was glad the girl had eaten her Grandmother because if the girl hadn't done it, Red would have.  She was feeling hngry right about now. An extremely loud growl came from Red's belly, which made the girl smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...Is someone hungry?\" The girl said as she pulled a piece of red bread from her side pouch and walked over to Red.  She held it in front of Red's nose and let her smell it.  Drool started running down her many chins as she smelled the delicious bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah! This isn't for you\" The girl said as she pulled away from Red,\" You are big enough already.  This is for me.  I was saving this for a time when I'd have to feast on a fatty like yourself.\"  She took a bite of the bread and immediately began to get taller,  She reached 200 feet and stopped.  Amazingly, she was still hidden by the thick trees.  She reached down and lifted Red into the air.  \"Are you scared?\" She asked Red. Red whimpered which the girl took as a yes,\" I thought so, as you should be because the last thing you are going to feel is the feeling of my teeth crushing you.  But I'll make it nice and slow for you because I want you to REALLY feel it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth and shoved Red inside.  She rolled her around on her tongue, savouring her taste.  She sat down because she didn't feel like being knocked over by an orgasm.  After 5 minutes of sucking on Red, she rolled her onto her molars and commensed to closing her teeth slowly.  At first, Red wasn't hurt by it.  It was just a small amount of pressure.  But then it changed.  The pressure of the teeth crushing her started to cut into her skin and crush her bones.  She cried as hard as she could, but being inside of a 200 foot tall person's mouth after her voice was already muffled made it impossible to hear any of her screams.  After a few seconds, the girl quit crushing and rolled Red over to her front teeth, pointing Red's head towards the back of her throat.  Without any other regards, the girl bit down hard and split Red into, releasing her fat and letting it run down her throat.  She finished chewing what was left of Red and swallowed her remains.  After licking her lips, she pulled out a blue mushroom from her side pouch and ate it.  This made her shrink down to her normal size.  When she reached normal size, her belly was extremely distended, full of Red's fatty remains.  So she pulled out the red bread again and took a very small bite.  This brough her up to 20 feet tall, which was perfect.  She began rubbing her belly to aid in the digestion process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~4 hours later~<br>\r\nThe clothing the girl was wearing didn't fit anymore and had shredded to pieces.  She grabbed pieces of vine and leaves and made make-shift clothing.<br>\r\n\"I love this new body, but I need a new wardrobe.  Maybe I'll raid the village and take a few clothes....and have a snack or ten while I'm there\" The girl said as she waddled off towards town, breaking the ground with her every step.  Bad for the town, but good for us right? HaHa</span></div></div>",

A reddish-pink-haired girl trotted behind him, her clothing consisting of a blue and gold bodysuit and matching sleeves, ending in huge cuffs. Tights covered her legs, ending in blue-and-black boots. Ram-like horns twirled from her head, giving her an odd appearance. But that wasn't the only thing. She had a large belly, one roll, a cute double-chin, enormous, basketball breasts, a butt that could crush a bench, and thighs that could cause the earth to shake. She looked over 400 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understand, demon child, you are cursed, nothing but a horrible beast in a human form. You eat lives as if they were nothing but morsels. Now you have tricked or frightened this old woman into fattening up her granddaughter without second thought. But she is as much to blame as you are,\" the blond in the black flightsuit said, addressing the two cohorts. His wild hair was held in place by goggles resting on his forehead. Blue eyes pierced through Miriam's own glare, causing a chill to run up her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She only wanted to live. She would sacrifice her own grandchild to a beast such as yourself just so she could live a few years longer. And now look at the helpless little girl before you,\" he continued, pointing at Red's massive, 2-ton body. She smiled slightly, tears streaming down her cheeks as she continued to grow, fattening up larger and larger. She knew what was going to happen if the girl, who was quite large, called Miriam, had her way. She would be consumed without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That arrow is no arrow; it's a special armor-piercing, liquid nitrogen filled, finned stake. It's made of iron, and inflicts pain upon those who have done wrong. Right now, your entire body is turning cold, right? That's the bullet taking its toll on the wicked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriam felt her body grow tense, then fall below minus thirty degrees, her blood icing up, her fat body being encased in glistening blue-white ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I will not be denied my meal!\" she screamed, desperately trying to get free to the red bread she kept in her pocket. But Stockholm seemed to be one step ahead of her, and vaporized the bread with one shot from the enormous rifle. Miriam simply looked on in horror as her body finally gave up trying to fight and the ice took over, freezing her body over completely. Red smiled happily now as she realized she could grow without a second thought. </span></div></div>",

Her butt began swelling even larger as well, raising her up even futher from the ground. It collapsed the wall behind her, giving her even more room to grow. Breasts fattened up even more as they became the size of wrecking balls. She gained more rolls, but they only melded into much larger ones dominating her figure. She giggled as her body jiggled from every breath, causing cracks to appear in the wood floor of her Grandmother's house. Red quickly surpassed 6 tons, her weight still growing intensely as her limbs thickened so much she could hardly move. She kept giggling as she grew, eventually filling every room in the house with her gorgeous fat, and causing the walls to crumble. She could speak, just barely, but her brown eyes showed unconcealable glee as she rose higher and higher, growing into a mountain of a little girl. The growth slowed to a crawl, and she sighed as she fell asleep atop her massive body. The trio below left Red to continue growing, inches still adding to her body. She continued to grow until she was over 11 tons, by then she had covered her grandmother's property, but even then her growth was unhindered. She kept expanding all year, her mother coming to periodically feed her. By December of next year, she weighed over 50 tons, and she slept peacefully atop her mountainous body. Only 12 and she was the fattest, most beautiful girl in the world.</span></div></div>",

Is that a new skirt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Red said, blushing, \u201cI ripped my old one at Granny\u2019s. I might have ate a little too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d her mother said, \u201cyou\u2019re a growing girl. I\u2019ll just have to pay attention to how quickly you grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed seemed satisfied with this answer. \u201cOh, grandma sent me home with a basket of her famous cookies.

While her mother was not nearly as big a cook as her grandmother, her mother saw to it that she ate plenty to keep up her strength. She was proud of her good, little eater. However, her mother was worried about how Red was treated in the village. The other local girls had started making fun of Red\u2019s weight, especially that woodcutter\u2019s daughter. She thought she was so hot with all her muscles from being out on the job with her father all the time. It sickened her that her poor little Red was being tormented so.

I\u2019ve loaded up the basket with ingredients for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww,\u201d Red started to whine.

Yes, Red really needed to get away from the negative influence of those other girls who were so mean to her. \u201cYes, she\u2019s needing some company and could use some help around the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of help?\u201d Red asked. She hated doing chores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, after your visit last time, she\u2019s been inspired to open her bakery again. She\u2019s going to need a taste-tester. Think you can handle that?\u201d her mother laughed, giving Red a playful poke in the belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed giggled back. \u201cYeah, I think so. So, when\u2019s breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother was already scooting her out the door. \u201cNot today, Red. Granny says she wants you to bring a big appetite when you get there. She\u2019s making all your favorites to celebrate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth was already watering with the thought. She was soon out the door and walking down the path, or rather waddling as best she could. Red had certainly gained more than a few pounds since her last visit, and her cute, little potbelly had turned into a massive ball of fat that was in the way of her walking. Her hips had widened too, her bottom jiggling with every step. The wolf, who had finally taken his wife\u2019s advice and woken up early, was greeted by this delightful sight coming up the way. Little Red Riding Hood was not so little anymore. More like a tub of lard, he thought to himself. Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about that shortcut now?\u201d the wolf said, striding up beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Wolf,\u201d Red said, a bit startled. She thought about it. Though he was a wolf, she was getting pretty winded. A shortcut sure would help. \u201cThat\u2019s fine I suppose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf decided to make conversation with her as they walked, trying to put her at ease for when he struck. \u201cSo, you seem to go to your grandmother\u2019s an awful lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s the best. I\u2019m staying there for a whole year. She\u2019s a great cook, and lets me eat however much I want. Plus, she likes her granddaughter a little chubby, so it\u2019s perfect for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was still eyeing her. \u201cYes, I can see that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly an idea struck him. Why rush this little morsel? Why not let nature run its course? Nature\u2019s feeder would spend the whole year fattening up this delicious butterball anyway, why not take advantage of it? He would keep his eye on her progress throughout the year, and then snatch her up when she least expected it. Oh, he would practically have to roll her to his cave by the end of a year, he thought. It would be a long year, but it was worth the \u201cweight.\u201d Oh, he made himself laugh sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led Red to her grandmother\u2019s house and bid her farewell. He would be watching closely, though. As Red entered her grandmother\u2019s house, the aroma of so many good things filled her nostrils. Her grandmother was waiting and greeted her. \u201cWell, I hope you\u2019re hungry for\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Red easily polished off the brownies, ate a huge slice of pie from each of the different varieties, sampled at least twenty different kinds of cookies, tasted so many different icings for cinnamon rolls, and finished off with eating from four different cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed was rubbing her belly, trying to ease the strain after a full day of work, or at least work for her. She finally dropped her fork when her grandmother set down a plate loaded with lunch foods. \u201cGood work, Red,\u201d her grandmother said, \u201cI should be able to have enough baked for you to try more by this evening. Now you can have your lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach tried to protest, but it smelled so good. With a new-found second wind, she wolfed down the first plate and easily pounded down second and third helpings before she finally threw in the towel. Her grandmother led her to the comfy sitting room and got her in the soft recliner for a nap, though Red seemed wedged pretty tight in the wide seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a few hours later when she woke up to find another plate of treats resting on her shelf of a belly. \u201cI took your advice and added more icing to the brownies,\u201d Granny said. \u201cTell me what you think about it. I\u2019ll have more to whet your appetite before dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed already knew this was going to be the best year ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was never far from Granny\u2019s house and would occasionally peek in to see how his little porker was doing. After only a couple weeks, he was looking through the window. Red had easily doubled her size since then. Her only movement was pretty much the short waddle between the living room and the kitchen, and from the looks of it, it would not be long before she would not be able to accomplish that. There was just one problem, the wolf realized.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So they met outside,  and she was as pleasantly plump as always thanks to her skill at finding fatties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe told her of his diobolical and delicious plot, and she smiled, then laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wolfie, your mind is bigger than your mouth! By the time it gets to be a whole year Red will be ginlrmous, not to mention every predator in the woods, from rival wolves to those three bears to even giants at that plint will want it, ajd thats not taking into account that rolling her home will be like rolling a boulder. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf sighed. \"Hence why I came to you. You eat these fatties a lot lately. So I wondered if perhaps we can.... make a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch tapped her finger on her cheek and gave a smile. \"Alright.  What's your offer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you help me get Red home you get an equal share of the feast. But leave me the ham. You knlw, wolf and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch pondered this. It would be so easy to just turn the wolf into gingerbread amd eat him, then go cook up red and her granny. On the other hand she had a steady flow of fatties already and this was jist an extra treat she had not expected. And besides, a meal that big was meant to be shared.

And greeting the three travellers, or rather two travelers and the feast to be, was a big bad she wolf and three little wolves, the former wearing an apron and a big chefs hat. The witch awwwwed as one of the pups batted at Red, makjng her giggle when he licked her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow dear, your right she is a fat piggy!\" The wolf said, embracing hrr husband. Red went wide eyed as she realized what she meant.... and whwt THAT meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that means.... your gonna...\" but she said no more as the witch shoved an apple in her mouth. The witch then spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, but as big as she is we may need a bit more than a rotisserie to cook her. Now I can conjure up a nice big wood oven for a big roasting, worthy of such a feast. But if you rather we could try your fire pit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady wolf hmmmed. \"Welll it has been awhile since a big oven roast... and this is a special occasion.

Nervously she looked down to see what it was, what scared her so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe her eye's as she saw that a little cuddly gnome lay in front of her. She knew it have to be a gnome, because it looked exactly like her grandmother told her. A little magical being wearing a colourfully romper suit and a funny duncecap with little bells on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! That hurts!\" the little gnome swore and hold his head.</span></div></div>",

Never seen a gnome before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest no. I have seen a lot of living animals in the forest but never a gnome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Animals! Listen i'm a gnome and i'm nowhere near an animal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I did't want to insult you. But you said you just wanted to play what do you mean by that. Why with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you are so beautiful. You have such a big body with a lot of flesh. We gnomes love big girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So gnomes love humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not big in the way height. big in the way fat. We gnomes like it when girls are fat. Can you blame us. Did you look in the mirror lately. You look beautiful. And let nobody tell you otherwise. we know where we talk about. We live on this planet when you humans still wore fur. We lived in the forests for century's. So we know or a woman looks beautiful or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all very nice of you but i'm just a kid. I don't want to start a relation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said anything about a relation. I just wanna have some fun. Playing with your love handles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed suddenly got an idea and grabbed the little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up i'm lost and very hungry.

The're not that many people who live in the forest. Of course you have the hunter and i also heard about seven dwarfs who live... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you take me to my grand mothers house. Please. I will do anything for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can i play with your love handles on the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well okay but i hope you don't trick me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a gnome. Gnome's can't lie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go. Can you find the way in the dark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. No problem. We gnomes try to keep a secret for humans. So we only come out at night. In all those years we evolved a night vision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnome seemed to tell the truth sine he seemed perfectly to know where he was going. The whole way he was pushing and kneading red's fat and watching it jiggle. Finally she could see the shape of a house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is: Tree Bark. And your's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey call me: Red.

Listen... i would like it if you keep it a secret for most people we live here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So i can't tell anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i guess you can tell your grandmother. And maybe your children and grand children. But Don't tell everyone you met a gnome. Maybe i see you again beautiful young lady.\"<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"Bye Tree Bark!\"</span></div></div>",

And except for the cookie she had't eaten anything for some time now since her mother send her to bed without dinner. She could't remember before being so hungry. She tried to get up but noticed something was pinning her down. When she looked she noticed that it was her belly. It was bigger then before. She lifted her shoulders. She did't care about it right now. The only thing she cared about now was food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need to find something to eat. Grandma always has a lot of food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to the kitchen and went straight to the refrigerator and looked inside. She saw a large tasty roast, some greasy gravy, some baked potatoes and a large pie. She took all the things out and placed them on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the next moment she started to eat. Well she was more devouring all the food. She looked like a animal that had almost died from hunger. So fast she was eating the food. She did't bother to use a fork or knife she just grabbed the food with her hands and stuffed it in her mouth. In a few minutes the entire roast was in Red's belly. She then poured the half of all the gravy over the potatoes. The poured the other half just in her throat. And after that she shoved the potatoes in her mouth so fast she had nearly time to chew them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now for dessert.\" She said and looked at the large pie<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just buried her head in the pie. It looked more like she was inhaling it. She ate so fast. When the pie was halfway gone to Red's huge belly The door suddenly opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandmother was standing in the doorway with a broomstick in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right mister burglar. Let's see... Oh Red it's you. Sorry. I heard some noise and i thought you were a burglar. What are you doing here a this time of night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\" Red said taking a huge bite of cake. \"My mom did't liked it that i would gain any more weight. So she put me on a diet.

The magical cookie made her fat belly even bigger. Also her arms and legs plumped up a bit. But red did't put any attention to it because the delicious smell. She wanted to taste it whatever it was. Did't mind what it looked like. She ran in the living room. Her eyes almost popped out of her head. The entire table was filled with tasty stuff. Pancakes (with syrup), waffles, hamburgers, boiled eggs, chicken wings, pizza, cupcakes, muffins, cake and even some pies. and a few bottles of soda to was it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope your hungry because this is all for you.\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All for me. All of it. But grandma do you really think i can eat all this? I mean it's a lot of food for one little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to hurt you grandmothers feelings by not eating the food she worked so hard for to make it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. I just don't think i be able to finish it all. But i am really hungry. And maybe i can't finish it but i can try right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my granddaughter. Go ahead. Eat as much if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the pancakes with her hands stuffing it in her mouth and ripping pieces of like a wild beast. She stuffed her mouth so full that she almost was't able to chew her food. After the pancakes were gone she started on the waffles and wolfed them also down really fast<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead Red. Eat all you wan't today. You're a growing girl after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burgers were next on her list. She could open her little mouth just wide enough to take bites out of the burger. And bite after bite the burgers disappeared in her tummy that seemed bottomless. She covered her eggs whit salt and pushed them one by one entirely in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the eggs were first. Then came the chicken. I believe. What does it matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the chicken wings covered with ketchup. She licked the bones completely clean.  and belched loud. Grandma did't mind but just smiled while Red Started on the next food. The Pizza. She took two slices. place them on each other and started to eat them this way. She also did with the rest. And still she did't feel full. But there was still some more food. She grabbed the tray of muffins and pushed the in her mouth and after that the tray of cupcakes and they went down the girls belly just as fast. She then took the cakes breaking lumps of it and stuffing it in her mouth. The only food left were three pies. She took the first one. Taking bite after bite until the pie was in her tummy. And the second pie also disappeared that way. Red took the last pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So maybe i can eat all that. Just one more pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n and she started to stuff in in her mouth so fast she did't had anytime to chew pie. She just swallowed the pieces of the pie with a few mighty: Gulps! until the pie was completely gone.         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job Red. I'm proud of you.\" Her grandmother said and clapped loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment The chair broke under Red's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Sorry grandma. I did't mean to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry honey. It was an old chair anyway. I have more chairs. Also chairs that can hold your weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed used the table to get up her feet. Her belly hung to her knees. It was a great blob of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh see how cute she looks. That little gnome was right when he said she was beautiful. I can't believe my daughter wanted to put her on a diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed waddled to a bigger chair and placed her wide butt in it. The chair was making cracking noises but hold. For now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma i'm really stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that honey. Now just relax and i will read you a story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma took a big book full off tales. Red liked it if her grandmother read her stories. Her grandmother placed on hand on Red's belly and rubbed it. Red wanted to ask why but it felt good so she did't asked.

Looking up from the book, Grandma saw that her grandaughter looked as though she would drop off to sleep at any moment and decided to go get her a bed time snack before she dozed off. <br>\r\n  \"Red? I'm gonna go get you a snack before you go to sleep. You'll like that won't you?\" <br>\r\nAt the sound of the word 'snack', Red awoke faster than the flick of a lightswitch. She nodded and rubbed her fat belly in delight. More food! What could be better? <br>\r\n  Grandma smiled and left the room. Red could hear her bustling about in the kitchen, no doubt whipping up something nice and tasty for her to eat. Ten minutes ago, she couldn't have managed another crumb, but suddenly she felt diifferently. <br>\r\n  Five long minutes later, Grandma emerged from the kitchen wheeling a large trolley on which was piled what looked like at least ten different platefuls of rich, fattening food. Red licked her lips, longing to get a load of this delicious looking food, but she was already too bloated to move.<br>\r\n  \"Grandma, I'd love to eat all that lovely food you've cooked up especially for me, but I can't seem to sit up. Maybe I could eat it in the morning?\" It pained Red to say this, but she was still exhausted from her last binge and though she was hungry enough to eat every crumb on that trolley, she just couldn't find the energy! <br>\r\n  \"Nonsense!\" Grandma smiled. \"The trolley was only so I could bring it in. I shall set all the plates down on the bed beside you and you can just reach for the food with your cute, plump little hands!\"<br>\r\n  Red murmured in assent.

Her grand mother knew that if she kept eating like this then someone needed to feed her. Her granmother smiled. She would like it to feed red again. Just like when she was a plump little baby.<br>\r\nRed already started on her fourth pie took it in both hands and took big bites from it and rubbed her big belly the best she could. Red saw and heard nothing. The only thing she cared about now was eating more and more while she reached for her fifth pie that she wolfed down so fast that grandma almost thought that she would choke. But she swallowed it all without a problem.<br>\r\nHer whole face was covered in diffrent pie stuffings. Chocolate, cherry, raspberry, strawberry and blueberry. She did't cared and maybe even did't notice. The only thing that cared now was getting food in her greedy mouth.<br>\r\nGranma looked happy that her granddaughter loved to stuff herself fat and round. Something her daughter (Red's mother) never did.<br>\r\nRed reached for the sixth pie and stuffed in in her mouth while another pie stuffing this time apricot was smeared over her face. This did't stop her from stuffing her face and her plump hand reached for the seventh pie. Then a loud: RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP! was heard while her clothes finally gave up holding in the fat girls body. The only things left were her underwear, socks and red hood with cloak. But since her hood with cloak was tied under her chin it could become a problem since a roll fat started to melt her head to her chest. Her grand mother slowly removed it. It would be a shame if it would rip.<br>\r\nRed opened her mouth to let out a large belch. Her grandmother did't cared about it while Red reached for the eight pie making her underwear go further lost in her fat rolls. Some apple pie stuffing covered more of her face. Some of the stuffing on her face started to drip off her chubby, round, pink cheeks forming little pools of pie stuffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Red. Only two pies left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed was still in an eating trance and reached for the ninth pie. again using her hands to stufff it in caused that her face also got covered in plum pie stuffing. Red started to feel very sleepy slowly her eyes started to become heavy. But not heavy enough to take the last pie and taking big bites covering her face in red berries stuffing. After the last bite was swallowed and a loud belch was out her mouth the young girl was out like a light only wearing her underwear and socks.<br>\r\nGrand mother took some napkins to wipe the girls face and after that she took a blanket used for a two persons bed too cover her huge grand daughter.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

But lately there had been practically nothing in the cottage for her to eat other than the three carrots a day her mom would allow her.  Wandering around the house, Red\u2019s belly was gurgling loudly and the tubby girl was constantly distracted by the ravenous hunger she\u2019d been feeling ever since being put on her diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Mom, give me some more food!

With that big belly you couldn\u2019t do more than waddle a few feet before collapsing!\u201d  \u201cNuh-uh!\u201d said Red, although she knew that it was probably true \u2013 she hadn\u2019t tried to run in years and hated any kind of exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorming out of the kitchen, Red went into her own room and slammed the door.  After a week of dieting she was feeling very angry and out of sorts.  The only good thing that had happened was that her clothes were feeling a little more comfortable.  For the first time in ages, she was actually able to button up her red cloak.  Still, she didn\u2019t care about clothes when her favourite pastime was threatened.  \u201cOh, if only I could go to Grandma!  She\u2019d feed me properly,\u201d said Red, speaking to herself.  \u201cI bet she\u2019s probably baking a big pie right now\u201d she muttered with a dreamy look on her chubby face.  Red\u2019s stomach gave a powerful rumble and brought her back from her daydreaming about pies.  \u201cSo what if I\u2019m getting fat?  I don\u2019t care so long as I can eat all I want!  Besides, I can still do all the things I did when I was skinny!  I\u2019m still cute!\u201d said Red, stamping her pretty foot for emphasis and sending ripples through her quivering blubber.  It was a comforting thought, even though it wasn\u2019t strictly true.  After all, Red\u2019s main job seemed to be to carry food to her old Grandmother, and she wasn\u2019t very good at this anymore.  When she\u2019d been younger, Red had skipped all the way to Grandma\u2019s house in the morning and never taken a single crumb of the food for herself.  But as she\u2019d got older, she\u2019d got greedier, and had started to eat some of the treats on the way.  As her appetite grew, and as she became plumper, Red had stopped skipping and would walk slowly, eating large portions of the food her mother had made for her grandmother.  Before long, Red was eating almost all of the food herself, leaving only a tiny amount for her Grandmother, and she had grown so fat that she could only waddle slowly along the path, taking almost all day to get to her Grandma\u2019s cottage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFolding her pudgy arms over her large belly, Red cursed her mother under her breath and tried to ignore her ravening hunger.  \u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here.  If I don\u2019t feed myself up soon, I\u2019ll die!\u201d moaned Red, stroking her bulging tummy gently to try and ease the hunger pains.  \u201cBut how can I get out?  Mom would notice if I tried to sneak out the front.  Even at night it would make so much noise she\u2019d wake up...\u201d  Red pondered what to do.  Looking around, her eyes fell upon the small square-framed window that was on the wall next to her bed.  \u201cI wonder...\u201d she whispered, staring at the small opening.  When Red had been younger and slimmer, she\u2019d often climbed out of the low window and slipped easily over the sill into the garden to play.  It had been long ago, and Red had long since become far too lazy to want to play outside \u2013 not to mention that her greatly increased girth would not have fit easily through the small opening.  Looking down at her round body, Red tried to gauge just how her circumference measured up compared to the window.  It looked pretty close to her, and she must have lost some inches since going on this awful diet.  She\u2019d never normally have attempted it, but desperate times called for desperate measures.  \u201cI\u2019ll have to wait until night, then I\u2019ll sneak out and get to Grandma, she\u2019s sure to give me a stash of food to bring back.  If I\u2019m quick enough, I can go and come back before morning and Mom will never know!\u201d thought Red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan fully formed, Red just had to wait.  She ate her carrot for dinner without complaint and went quickly to bed.  Soon, Red could hear the sounds of her Mom locking the front door \u2013 a sure sign she was about to turn in for the night.  When she heard the familiar click of her Mom\u2019s door closing, Red knew it was time to go.  Carefully, Red pushed the bedclothes off her \u2013 she was still fully dressed and ready to go.  Opening the window, she cautiously peaked outside into the dark garden.  Manoeuvring clumsily on the bed, Red heaved her bulk forward and began to wriggle out of the window head first.  The small window frame was soon plugged by the girl\u2019s rotund form, soft fat squished up against the wood.  Grunting and pushing, Red wriggled to get through and......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slowly she could feel herself slipping further through the window. Suddenly her belly was outside. Now it was easy. Only thing she need to get out where her legs she jumped on the ground with a loud: THUMP!!! <br>\r\nShe looked up at the window of her mothers bedroom but there was still no sound so her mother was probably still asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now how do i get to the house of grandmother? Let's see. It's always so easy in the daylight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she waddled into the dark forest. Red had been many, may times in the forest but only during the day. Never at night. She understood why. Most trees blocked the light of the moon and stars making it even darker. She could hardly see. <br>\r\nSuddenly she remembered that wild animals lived in the forest like the big bad wolf. But like she said the wolf had't eaten anyone in ages. She was't even sure if there still was a wolf. Of course she heard tales but that were just tales. Many times tales got told and everyone who told fantasized something new about  the story. She never had seen the wolf. Sometimes she thought she did from a far distant but it could also have been a dog. Or maybe a rabbit lying on a high rock. At least she never really had 100% proof there really was a wolf. But her mother and grand mother both told her that there was a big bad wolf in the forest and she did't think they would lie. Besides why take the risk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.\" She slowly mumbled. It sounded a lot braver the she felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the day there were always birds singing and many times she saw rabbits, hares, mice some times even a deer. Since she came in the forest since she was a child slowly all animals got to know her and were't scared of her. Sometimes she also met the hunter and his friendly dog who looked for the big bad wolf. The hunter told he many times almost got the wolf but still he escaped at the last moment.<br>\r\nSlowly she walked further. She remembered too always stay on the path. But the path was hardly noticeable in the dark. She did't knew or she was halfway or maybe even a quarter. She did't recognized anything here in the dark. Not even the biggest tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.... i'm lost!\" She cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed's belly rumbled loudly. She was still really hungry since she only got a few carrots the last days. She would give anything for one of her grand mothers nice dinners.<br>\r\nShe decided the best thing she could do was go forward and just hope that she kept on the path since it was impossible to see were it was and did't get lost in the woods.<br>\r\nShe heard everywhere around her noises in the woods. scared she walked further and further with every step a bit more hungrier and a bit more scared. <br>\r\nShe wished the hunter would be here now. But she knew he was at home save and sound with his big dog. <br>\r\nRed's eyes started to get watery. Then she saw between some trees a light. Was it the light of her grandmothers house? Or that from the hunter's house maybe? Or did she got so off track that she found a house she did't even know was there? Or was the light from something else?  </span></div></div>",

What was wrong? Red tried to look back over her shoulder, but she couldn't turn far enough, and anyway, her fat filling the window frame was blocking her view of the room. After a few more tries she realized the problem: her hips and rear end were simply too wide to fit through the window anymore. She couldn't pull them through. Red's gut hung down on one side and her chubby legs dangled on the other, feet kicking helplessly in the air. A few times her toes brushed the ground, but never enough to give her any leverage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" she thought, \"I can't reach the ground to drag myself back into the room, so the only way through is forward.\" With renewed vigor she shoved against the frame, again and again, while the fat in her plump face and arms shook with every strained effort. But she didn't move an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hell. I'm really stuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed lay miserably in the window, getting hungrier every minute, until a little while before dawn, when Red's mother usually woke up and started making breakfast. Red could hear the sounds she made as she moved around the house: opening the kitchen windows, clattering plates and frying pans, and unlocking the front door to go outside. \"Crap!\" Red couldn't stand letting her mother see her like this, but there was nothing she could do. Her mom came around the corner of the house with a basket on her arm, looking for vegetables to pick in the garden, including the carrots that would have been Red's hated breakfast. The woman stopped short when she saw her fat daughter lodged in the side of the house and stared with enormous eyes and an open mouth. It might have been funny, if Red's stomach hadn't ached both from hunger and the pressure of lying in the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RED!\" her mother screeched finally, having gotten over her shock. \"You tried to sneak out last night, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was just--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't lie to me, young lady.

You're not going to be able to leave until your fat ass is smaller than the window frame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with those cruel words, Red's mother picked up the basket that she had unwittingly dropped and went about picking vegetables for breakfast as if her daughter weren't crammed through a window six feet away. As soon as she had gathered up everything she wanted, she went back around the side of the house. Faintly, Red could hear her enter the kitchen and start chopping the vegetables. That could only mean one thing. She was going to make the delicious omelettes she was famous for, and Red wasn't going to get any. Tears filled Red's eyes as she lay against the window, exhausted, sore, and completely ravenous. How could her own mother be this unkind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled all through the morning as she listened to utensils scrape against a plate that undoubtedly held a delectable, savory omelette. She tried begging her mother to bring her breakfast, even if it was only carrots, but either she wasn't yelling loud enough or her mother was positively evil, because there was never a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she heard the sink running and knew breakfast was over. The front door opened and closed, and there were footsteps on the path leading away from the cottage. Her mother was leaving to run errands. Red covered her face with her hands and sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, from the bushes nearby, there was a loud rustling. Red hiccuped and lifted her head. The wolf stepped out into the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well,\" he said with a smirk, \"look at this. Little Red, who isn't so little anymore, has gotten herself stuck. This should be interesting.\"</span></div></div>",

I've been stuck in here for hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf tilted his head and looked like he was considering it. \"I'm not sure you can come through this way,\" he said at last. \"I bet that's why you got stuck in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then go inside and pull me back into my room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" said the wolf, although he wasn't sure he wanted to let Red out of her predicament at all. Unable to run away was just the way he liked his plump prey. Besides, it was rather funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door was locked, but the kitchen windows had been left open, and the wolf was agile enough to jump right through. He padded through the house and nosed open Red's bedroom door. There she was, the whole huge mass of her, two giant cheeks in a tiny pair of shorts and cellulite-rippled thighs  squeezed tight against the wall. He chuckled in delight. No, he didn't think he was going to let her out, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an awfully tight fit, Red,\" he called to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he grabbed the seat of her pants in his teeth and pretended to tug her backwards, to no avail. \"Sorry, Red,\" he said. \"You're well and truly stuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nooooo,\" he heard her wail through the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I have an idea,\" he said. \"Lift up your legs.\" With difficulty, because her muscles weren't that strong, Red lifted her legs until they were almost parallel to the floor. She started to shake with the effort immediately. The wolf nosed the bedside table over to the window until it was right underneath the fat girl and said, \"All right, Red.\" When she let her legs down with a huff of relief, her knees touched the table. She could kneel now, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, that's better!\" she said. Her abdomen felt much better now that the window frame wasn't digging into it, and the alleviation of one pain doubled her awareness of the second. \"I'm sooo hungry!\"</span></div></div>",

Even her feet were fat. \"When was the last time you ate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night! My mom left me here to lose weight and told me the only way I'm getting out is if I get skinny enough to fit.\" Remembering it, Red started getting teary all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't go crying again. I smelled eggs and cheese when I was in the kitchen, freshly cooked. There's probably something in there you can eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Red sniffed. \"My mom must have made me an omelette after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf nosed the plump girl's thighs, checking their texture---nice and jiggly, yes. She was definitely worth fattening up. \"Want me to go get it for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed knew she wouldn't be able to get out of the window if she didn't slim down, but she was way too hungry to turn down food. \"Yes, please!\" Even if she ate the omelette her mother had cooked for her, she was still definitely going to get thinner. One omelette after a whole night of near starvation wasn't enough to keep you from losing weight. \"God yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the wolf trotted back into the kitchen and located the omelette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was sitting on a plate in the middle of the counter, covered with a heat dome. With his forelegs on the counter he could easily remove the dome with his teeth. Hmm... the omelette was cheesy and glistened with grease, but it was awfully small. Surely this wouldn't be enough. He pawed open the door to the pantry and peered inside. The woman must have been a nut! Everything was healthy and low-fat, except for the raw ingredients Red's mother used to make her own dishes. The wolf moved on to the refrigerator, where it was the same story. But he did find a small chocolate cake on the top shelf. What could the woman have been meaning to do with <i>this</i>? The wolf bit the plate and carried it over to the counter, nudged the cake into the same plate as the omelette, and carried them both back out to Red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you, thank you. I owe you one, Wolf,\" said Red as she grabbed the plate from him eagerly. The wolf grinned his toothy, wolfish grin at her. He planned to collect---as soon as Red had gotten a bit bigger, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up,\" he said encouragingly. She didn't need to be told twice. He hadn't brought any utensils, so Red held the plate with one hand and stuffed food into her mouth with the other. She started with the omelette, thinking she would only eat part of it and save the rest for later to keep her from starving, yet still be hungry enough to lose weight and squeeze out of the window. But as soon as she took one bite of the tempting, juicy, cheesy eggs, that plan went out the window (so to speak). It had been so long since she had eaten real food that the delicious taste of it completely overwhelmed her. Not only did she finish the omelette, she devoured the entire cake, too, with a voracious appetite. Within minutes, her cheeks and chin were smeared with grease and streaks of chocolate icing, and she was licking her fingers greedily, still incredibly hungry. The wolf watched in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>starved</i>. Are you sure there isn't anything else in the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out, Red,\" he teased her. \"Eat too much and you're never going to get out of that window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored his taunting. A little more wouldn't hurt. And she was ravenous!</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve got to hide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf turned and vanished soundlessly into the shrubbery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later, Red heard the front door open again and angry footsteps coming around the side of the house. Thinking fast, she wiped her face off on her arms and pitched the empty plate into the forest. Her mother stomped into the garden, holding the silver dome that she\u2019d found empty on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRED! What happened to the omelette I left in the kitchen? And where\u2019s the cake I baked for  your grandmother\u2019s birthday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea what happened to those things. How could I? I\u2019m right were you left me,\u201d snapped Red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed\u2019s mother realized it was true. Her sadly obese daughter could not possibly have escaped from the inadvertent trap and eaten those things. It must have been some thief who saw the kitchen window open from the road. She turned and went back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, Red\u2019s mother came out twice a day with carrots and water to feed her daughter just enough to keep her alive while forcing her to lose weight. Little did she know that the wolf also came to feed her daughter. Since the kitchen window was now kept closed, he went to the nearby villages and raided the houses and shops for anything edible that was left unattended. Carrying a giant sack in his jaws, he collected roasted chickens, entire smoked hams, blocks of cheese, loaves of bread, cakes, pastries, muffins, and jugs of buttery whole milk and sugary apple cider. He brought it all back to his plump stuck piglet and fed it to her in huge batches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed, of course, hated being stuck in the window. Her devious mother\u2019s plan worked---sort of---because Red wanted to lose weight so she could squeeze free. So she decided to self-diet, just at a slower pace than her mother wanted. She only ate as much of the wolf\u2019s delicious food as it took to satisfy her hunger and keep from starving between meals. Well, okay, maybe sometimes she gave in to her constant appetite and ate when she didn\u2019t really need to. And okay, occasionally she stuffed herself a bit ---or a lot--- because it tasted so good she just couldn\u2019t stop. But she was convinced her stomach had shrunk considerably during the last few weeks from getting nothing but carrots. She was hardly eating anything at all these days, certainly not as much as she had before the awful diet. Back then she used to eat constantly. Now the wolf only brought her food three times a day. And the amount was significantly less. Nothing to worry about.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In fact, Red didn\u2019t realize how much she was cramming into her mouth because the wolf brought her so much food that she could never finish it. There was always a huge pile left over, so she thought she was successfully restraining herself from eating as much as she could have. The wolf reinforced this idea by saying every time, \u201cYou hardly ate any of what I gave you. I guess you really want to lose those extra pounds keeping you stuck, don\u2019t you?\u201d So Red never guessed how much she was eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf liked to put that leftover food  to good use. He stored it along with a few extra treats like cookies, chocolates, and donuts in a second bag hidden under the eaves of the house right over Red\u2019s head, to tempt her. He knew her self control wasn\u2019t strong enough for her to resist the extra food for long. Red\u2019s mother couldn\u2019t see the bag when she came out to check on her daughter, but Red could reach it easily. She usually got hungry again about an hour after the wolf left, satisfied with his stuffed piglet, and would reach up and pull down the bag, thinking, \u201cJust a cookie or two between mealtimes won\u2019t hurt. I\u2019m still definitely losing weight.\u201d But two cookies wasn\u2019t enough, so she reached in for another, always thinking, \u201cOne more won\u2019t hurt,\u201d and \u201cThis is to make up for eating hardly anything yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the wolf came back a few hours later, the entire contents of the bag would be gone, straight into Red\u2019s greedy little mouth and down into her growling belly. The gluttonous girl told herself it was nothing more than a small snack, and because she was always ravenous again by the time the wolf brought her the next meal, she still gorged herself full with the new food, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery morning, thinking that she was eating less than ever, Red tried to push free, convinced that today would be the day. She strained and grunted, and her face turned red and her second chin jiggled, but it was no use. \u201cI must be losing weight,\u201d she told herself. \u201cTomorrow, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to get free.\u201d Since she couldn\u2019t see herself, she had no idea that she was not only not losing weight---she was gaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed\u2019s cheeks grew rounder and her arms and hands got plumper. Two chins turned into three. Her belly, which was squeezed up against the outside of the house, slowly but surely began to inch outward, wiggling like a giant bowl of jello when she so much as sneezed. Inside, where no one could see, her thighs got chubbier and chubbier, her hips widened, and her shorts got tighter and tighter. But she never noticed, because the window was already squeezing her so uncomfortably. Eventually the slightest movement ripped her shorts right down the back, but she couldn\u2019t feel it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle by little, the amount of food left over for \u201csnacks\u201d started to decrease. The wolf brought her bigger and bigger helpings to try to keep up. Red ate and ate, adding pound after pound. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon, Red realized she was eating more than she could possibly justify to herself. She noticed one day that her shirt had gotten awfully small on her. This realization came just in time for her mother to come out with a new batch of carrots. She stared at her daughter as if not recognizing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy god, Red! You\u2019re not losing weight, you\u2019re <i>gaining</i>! You look thirty pounds heavier! No breakfast for the fatty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed didn\u2019t mind. As soon as her mother was gone, she took down the sack the wolf had left her and gorged herself on a box of donuts, then guzzled thick, fattening buttermilk and absently rubbed her plump piggy stomach, wondering how soon the wolf would be back. \u201cI\u2019m sure my mother\u2019s overreacted. I must have just gained five pounds or something, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s freaking out.\u201d But as she rubbed her hands over herself, feeling the handfuls of extra flab that jiggled at her every touch, she knew that wasn\u2019t true. \u201cOkay, maybe ten or twenty pounds. Maybe I should go back to my original diet. I\u2019ll just eat a little bit of what Wolf brings me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as soon as her breakfast arrived, she forgot about her resolution and fed herself two-handed, overeating gluttonously. When she had finished a leg of ham and a meat pie, she picked up a chocolate cake, several times the size of the one her mother had baked for Grandma. \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m supposed to be dieting,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDieting?\u201d said the wolf. \u201cWhatever for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m getting fatter,\u201d she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to get out of this window!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said the wolf. \u201cBut doesn\u2019t that cake look good?\u201d He smiled cunningly. \u201cJust a bite won\u2019t hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed struggled with her desire to eat the tempting chocolate, knowing she couldn\u2019t if she ever wanted to free herself. But her willpower wasn\u2019t strong enough. \u201cJust a bite couldn\u2019t possibly hurt,\u201d she agreed, and broke off a huge chunk and crammed it into her mouth, covering her hand and lips with frosting. \u201cMmm... so good...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might as well take another bite,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can diet tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo weak to resist, Red brought the cake up to her mouth and stuck her face in it, taking huge mouthfuls. A little indulgence today wouldn\u2019t hurt. The wolf was right. Her diet would start tomorrow. She was aware that with every bite of that tempting, rich food, she would grow fatter and fatter. Every bite was getting her more and more stuck, farther away from her goal. She just couldn\u2019t help herself. She indulged herself until the cake was gone and her fingers and chin were licked clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about these cookies?\u201d asked the wolf innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time a month had passed, Red had gained so much that...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Red thought it would the best not fight against the man....and not more than three minutes later: the bowl was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent , really excellent my girl!\" praised the man smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReds face was sweaty and she felt stuffed to the brim....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red, you will see, the first days are a bit hard , but than you will see that it will get harder things than to get stuffed !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let us say what your skinny bones are weighing \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReds weight was 194 pounds.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week had gone by, and there was a lot of changes! At this moment in the house, you could hear a crash from outside. Hansel's cage fell and broke. In the house, you could see what was going on. Hansel was huge! He weighed at least a ton now! He was only wearing a very huge white dress shirt. His arms and legs were as huge as tree trunks, being filled with pounds and pounds of fat. His finger and toes were even bigger than before, filled with fat. His cheeks were very puffy, sticking out all of the time. His cheeks were paired off with four chins, which covered up most of his neck. His butt was as wide as a car. He was definitely by now immobile. It was too late to lose weight or to even have hopes of not being eaten. He would need a fork lift to even get out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel kept on feeding her fat, now greedy, brother more food. As much as she was sad about fattening him, she was also jealous that he was getting all of the good food. She even felt conflicting emotions since she liked fatter guys and seeing her brother get fatter made her go insane. She was even being worked to the bone making food and trying to think of a way to get the two of them out of there. But she realized that now, it would probably be too late to save her brother, and maybe even herself. But Gretel noticed that the witch was being nicer to her in the last week. The witch was feeding her a little bit more and better food, but not that much. If anything, Gretel had gained an unnoticeable 5 pounds. This was only because the witch was going to fatten her up next. This led Gretel to think that if anything, maybe she could convince the witch not to eat her. She would do anything. She would be the witch's fat pet if she had to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More!\" Hansel said to his sister, wanting more food. Gretel walked over to Hansel and fed him an apple pie she had just made. He went through it in a minute, tearing apart the pie. After that, Gretel got a rag and cleaned off Hansel's face. All of a sudden, she kissed Hansel, which made Hansel give her a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do anything to save you, Hansel,\" Gretel said. The next moment, the witch came into the room and started to feel Hansel's moobs, making him laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time,\" The witch said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>HARD BY a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife: \"What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?\" \"I'11 tell you what, husband,\" answered the woman, \"early to-morrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them.\" \"No, wife,\" said the man, \"I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest--the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.\" \"0, you fool!\" said she, \"then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our coffins,\" and she left him no peace until he consented. \"But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,\" said the man.<br>\r\n The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel: \"Now all is over with us.\" \"Be quiet, Gretel,\" said Hansel, \"do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way to help us.\" And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel: \"Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,\" and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying: \"Get up, you sluggards! We are going into the forest to fetch wood.\" She gave each a little piece of bread, and said: \"There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.\" Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said: \"Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.\" \"Ah, father,\" said Hansel, \"I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me.\" The wife said: \"Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.\" Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: \"Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.\" Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said: \"Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said: \"How are we to get out of the forest now?\" But Hansel comforted her and said: \"Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.\" And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: \"You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest--we thought you were never coming back at all!\" The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father: \"Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!\" The man's heart was heavy, and he thought: \"It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children.\" The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said: \"Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. \"Hansel, why do you stop and look round \" said the father, \"go on.\" \"I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me,\" answered Hansel. \"Fool!\" said the woman, \"that is not Your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.\" Hansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said: \"Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\" When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: \"Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.\" When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel said to Gretel: \"We shall soon find the way,\" but they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father's house. They began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. \"We will set to work on that,\" said Hansel, \"and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.\" Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the parlor: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nibble, nibble, gnaw,<br>\r\nWho is nibbling at my little house?\" <br>\r\nThe children answered: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wind, the wind,<br>\r\nThe heaven-born wind,\" <br>\r\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let  fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: \"Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here Do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you.\" She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighborhood, she laughed with malice, and said mockingly: \"I have them, they shall not escape me again!\" Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks, she muttered to herself: \"That will be a dainty mouthfull\" Then she seized Gretel. she smiled and said to herself.\"i should fattin you up befor i eat you.\"Then she went to Hansel, shook him till he awoke, and cried: \"Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for your Sister, she  is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat her.\" Hansel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for he was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She kept feeding Gretel.<br>\r\nGretel never got a chance to eat so much food. Since they did't get much to eat by her father she had gotten a big hunger. And finally she could stop her hunger. She was devouring the mashed potatoes with greasy gravy and also the weenies. The Pizza's fries and hamburgers also disappeared in Gretel's hungry belly.<br>\r\nThen the witch gave her a big pie the size of a wedding pie. Gretel had never before pie. But after she took one bite she could't stop. It tasted so good.<br>\r\nAfter Gretel finished the pie she felt finally full what did't happened in a long time. Gretel was so full she fall asleep. <br>\r\nHansel looked a little jealous at his sister. She got so much food. He only got one little piece of bread from the witch. And he needed to do all the work.<br>\r\nHe knew it was't his sisters fault so he was't mad at her but at the witch.<br>\r\nAt the moment Gretel woke up the witch gave her more food.<br>\r\n Whole roasts, chicken nuggets, some more fries, Pasta with a super fattening sauce. Gretel was still a little full from breakfast. but it smelt so good so she started eating, and eating, and eating. <br>\r\nHansel looked at his sister how she cleaned plate after plate. The witch made some milkshakes for her to wash it a all down. Of course she put some weight gain powder in it. But Gretel did't knew and even if she did she would't care because they also tasted good.<br>\r\nShe cleaned every plate the witch gave her. She kept eating not understanding how she could eat so much.<br>\r\nAfter all the food was in her belly she felt her old and many times repaired dress. It felt a little tight.<br>\r\n\"Well i never eat so much before. I guess i gained a few pounds.\"<br>\r\nShe looked at her belly that was notice able bigger then before.<br>\r\nThe witch grinned at her. <br>\r\n\"You're going to be a fat piggy aren't you. You have a good appetite. Except from sleeping all you do is eating. Understand?\"<br>\r\nGretel nodded. She did't knew what else to do.<br>\r\nThe witch looked angry at Hansel.<br>\r\n\"Come on you work. Make some food for your sister. Can't you see she's hungry?\"<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n\"Don't you but! I just said except from sleeping everything she will do is eating right? Is she sleeping now?\"<br>\r\n\"Well no.\"<br>\r\n\"So guess who is going to get stuffed?\"<br>\r\nFor Hansel it was a terrible time. Gretel at the other hand was felt like she was in heaven. She got all the food she liked all day long and after she was done she could sleep and when she woke up  she could eat again. The only thing she did't liked was that she knew she only was fattened up by the witch to become her next meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are definatly fattening up nicely. I've never seen such chubby toes on a girl, another week of candy, cake and cookies and you'll be ready for the roasting pan.\" With that remark the gave gretel's big toe one last pinch, licked her lips and let poor gretel pull her plump drumstick back into her cage.<br>\r\n   Returning to the kitchen to cook some more fattening treats to stuff her chubby little turkey with. </span></div></div>",

She loved the taste. She believed she also taste some butter. The spaghetti was probably drenched in butter. But she kept eating. Gretel did't knew what she could do else.<br>\r\nAfter the spaghetti the witch gave her three roast chickens. Gretel stuffed them in her mouth licking the bones totally clean and belched loudly. <br>\r\nThen she got pudding, She started to push it in her mouth and then she heard a ripping noise and saw her belly had torn through her dress. Her dress had been many times repaired since it was a old dress but never because her belly was too big. he must admit she felt a bit relieved. It was warm inside so it did't mind her belly was bare.<br>\r\nThe witch gave Gretel another huge pie and a big weight gain shake and waited until she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Now i'm going to sleep. I want that my kitchen is clean when i return. and i expect my fat piggy to be hungry again so she can be stuffed.

I think that girl is gonna be my favorite dinner.\" She licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well great mess we ended up in.\" Gretel mumbled after the witch was gone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you complaining about. You get as much food if you like an even more!\" Hansel screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and why. Forget she is doing it too fattening me up to use me for dinner! At least she does't eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you put it that way. How did we end up in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank too the writing of fairy tale writers. I could be a princess that goes to a ball and married by a handsome prince and lived happily ever after but noooo. I need to be the girl kept in a cage until i'm fat enough too be eaten by a bad eye sighted witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad eye sighted?\" Hansel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must be. I mean she need to feel how fat i was so i guess she must be bad eye sighted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can use that too escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Escape? How did you wanna escape? I'm locked in a cage. Even if was out she locked the doors and windows. We can't get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're just gonna wait until she's done fattening you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i like the food i get and i must admit that it feels good to eat some more then just dry bread and i like it too have a bigger belly and finally i can eat until i'm stuffed. That's great.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you want to be eaten by that witch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But i don't know what too do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to rub her belly. It felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to have more time. If you don't eat the food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hansel i can't. The food looks and tasted so delicious. I never have eaten like this before. Besides if i don't the witch will force me too eat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait i have an idea. She is bad sighted. So if you let her feel something else then you body she thinks you're still too skinny and she waits. Hopefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can i use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let her feel your arm or legs when she feels your belly. If she wants you to eat you ask some cow meat then we have a bone for your calf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do we do with the toes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think of something sis.

But of course you still hungry. Give her more food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel could't believe how fast his sister ate the roasted pig and how much she ate while the two of them before only got some bread... if they were lucky.<br>\r\nHe gave his sister some chickens. She grabbed the drumsticks and ripped the meat of them. They all tasted so delicious. She made sure she cleaned every bone.<br>\r\nThe witch slowly turned and walked too a door and looked back at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to rest. You keep feeding her and may god protect you if you don't do a good job at that! I will notice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked in the other room. Both kids let out a sigh of relief. But Hansel kept cooking food. He did't doubt the witch just told the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have some more food. I'm done with those chickens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel angry gave her a huge plate with spaghetti with meatballs, tomato sauce and covered with cheese and a lot of butter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would almost think you like it.\" Hansel said while he saw how his sister acted like a total pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? But Hansel. You know what she said. May god protect you. I don't want anything too happen too you. You're my only brother and i love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really the only reason?\" Hansel asked suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i must admit all the food taste really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel continued cooking and saw how his sister ate all the food. <br>\r\nHis sister really did gain a lot. Just not so long ago she was so skinny. He reminded when they need to wash them selves or went for a swim or got dressed you could count her ribs and see the shape of her bones under her skin. He must admit that she looked a lot better with all that fat but if things would continue she would  become the size of a circus fat lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hansel i'm still hungry. Can i have some more food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Eat yourself fat.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If i don't eat it she will hurt you... if your lucky and force me too eat. So this food comes in my belly anyway so i might as well enjoy it. I never could eat so much and such delicious food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cleaned the plate and pulled of the shreds of her dress. They were't of any use. She only wore her underwear but even if she would lose it what would it matter. Hansel and she had seen the other naked hundred times. They were twins and did most things together like washing, swimming and got dressed. so it would't matter and the witch was only interested in how fat she was. Besides the fat of her belly and thighs hide most of her private parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon they will totally cover it.\" Gretel said softly too herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go queen fatty.\" Hansel said angry while he gave her a plate of burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you angry at me Hansel? That makes no sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Does't it. You get all the food you can dream of and more. All you got too do is sitting on your fat butt stuffing your face and sleeping all day long while i only get a small piece of dry bread while i need to make all the food for you and got just a few hours sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i'm so sorry mister i have it so bad. I of course locked myself in this cage and asked to be fattened up by an evil with who pinches my fat and want to eat my when i'm obese. Of course that's all my fault. I did it. At least she's not planning too eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I guess i'm just... Well being here fattening you up just makes me well... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very unhappy? Angry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too but i'm still as hungry if always eating old dry bread while you get all the food you could ever want that all taste delicious and i'm not supposed to eat even a crumb of it while i need to cook it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand Hansel. But if the witch will notice i give you some of my food who know what she will do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel let out a burp and looked at the empty plate in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Hansel got more food?\" </span></div></div>",

But i never had to worry about it since there was't a way i would be able to gain with all the food we got. Just some old scraps of bread. If we were lucky. But now. If i was't in a cage and at home... i think i would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're on the right way sis.\" Hansel said annoyed and got back too make more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch walked in and Hansel saw the well-fed young woman stuffing her face just before the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that. A friend of you?\" Hansel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that'it's any of your business but no. She was just lost in the forest. Now hurry up with the food. You need to make food for two people. Can't you see your poor sister is starving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was a nice but not the most bright girl. She was also a sweet kid that was easy to fool since she always thought people were nice so she did't thought anything of it when the witch took her food except that she was trying to be nice and if she need to be honest when it was about food she could be a bit greedy. No wonder with a belly like hers. Most of her weight went straight to her belly.<br>\r\nIn the past she sometimes tried too gain some weight for some bigger boobs and they did get bigger but also a lot of it went to her belly.<br>\r\nShe munched in the chicken nuggets she got. She already consumed a entire plate full of pasta with a fattening sauce and four hamburgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it did taste really good miss. I bet you're a cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you're not you really should become one. Your food taste all so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well eat so much if you like.

I'm a pretty big eater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like people with a good appetite.\" The witch said while she gave Lara's potbelly a pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura kept on eating not noticing how fattening the food of the witch was. Not noticing how big her belly got and how tight her clothes got while the pile of cleaned plates got higher.<br>\r\nThe witch started too wonder. Would she first eat Gretel or this girl. Gretel was fattening up pretty good and had eaten any scrap of food but this girl also seemed to be a big eater.

The longer she kept Gretel around, the longer she had to keep Hansel around, and truth be told, he wasn\u2019t worth it. Oh sure, she could have probably fattened him up down the road, but that was before little miss potbelly had just dropped on her doorstep, and the witch had a good feeling that there would be plenty more of her to go around. After all, she was a dim bulb. She didn\u2019t suspect a thing. She\u2019d eat herself round without having to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the witch wasn\u2019t going to reveal her plans just yet. She needed to catch Hansel and Gretel unawares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoy, I\u2019m going to send you to the market to go get me some ingredients,\u201d she said, pulling Hansel aside. She handed him a bit of gold. \u201cNow, you go and fetch the best price you can for a bag of sugar, got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just make some appear?\u201d Hansel asked. \u201cYou\u2019re a witch after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I said so, now get!\u201d She pushed him out the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew Hansel would of course not go to the market. He would try and go get help. Well, let him, she thought. He\u2019d never be able to find this place again. Her magic would keep it well hidden. In the meantime, she had a feast to prepare for.<br>\r\nShe opened Gretel\u2019s cage and rolled her out. \u201cAlright you, up at the table,\u201d she said, pointing a crooked finger at the table in the kitchen loaded down with sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel whimpered. \u201cWhat\u2026what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to eat you, that\u2019s what,\u201d the witch said. \u201cBut first, I want you good and stuffed before I put you in the oven. And don\u2019t you dare think about making a sound, or I\u2019ll eat you right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel nodded sadly and waddled over to the table. The witch grabbed the first dish of a plate of burgers and a heaping mound of fries. \u201cLet\u2019s get started,\u201d she said wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch proceeded to hand-feed everything to Gretel. The poor girl barely got enough time to chew before the witch crammed more into her mouth. Before long, she had finished at least a dozen burgers, and the witch proceeded to plug her mouth with fries. \u201cThat\u2019s right, piggie, eat up,\u201d the witch cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears started to form in Gretel\u2019s eyes. This was technically her last meal, and oh, did it taste so good, but knowing what awaited her at the end made her wish she had never found this house in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the starch of the potatoes was starting to fill her belly, and she could feel the tightness building within. The witch kept stuffing her with more food. \u201cI\u2019m full!\u201d she whined. \u201cPlease stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch took a handful of her belly and squeezed. Gretel groaned. \u201cNot nearly full enough yet!\u201d the witch snapped. \u201cYou keep eating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the witch moved on to all the sweets. She proceeded to fill Gretel\u2019s stomach with a plate of brownies, a couple dozen cupcakes, and an entire cake. By the end of all that, Gretel was huffing and puffing, all the food packed into her stomach squeezing her insides. \u201cNo more,\u201d Gretel cried, trying desperately to rub her taut middle, but finding her hands could not reach all the space they needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch poked and prodded her stomach, enjoying the squish of each pinch. \u201cOh, yes, my little porker. You\u2019re stuffed to the brim,\u201d she said, digging a finger deep in Gretel\u2019s belly button. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could fit another bite in there. You know what that means? Time for the roasting pan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel began to sob again, but the witch would hear none of it as she levitated Gretel into a roasting pan. She let Gretel get one last weigh in before being baked. \u201c467,\u201d the witch said. \u201cYum, yum, you are going to be a fat, juicy, and tasty morsel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to baste Gretel in an oil, chop up some vegetables around her, stuffed an apple in her mouth, and coated a little bit of stuffing around her, putting a fat spoonful in her bowl-like belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm, mm, I can\u2019t wait to eat you,\u201d the witch said. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve had a good, fat, roasted girl like yourself. In you go.\u201d</span></div></div>",

That had been a wonderful feast, she thought to herself as she rubbed her own fat gut, thinking of each and every savory bite. With a bit of magic, Gretel was prepared and eaten fairly quickly, at least long enough for the witch to eat without Laura noticing her absence. She heaved her bloated body around as she placed another helping of sweets on the table for Laura to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you are, sweetie,\u201d the witch said, her voice dripping with honey. \u201cI made far too much in the kitchen and I need your good little appetite to help finish them off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned over to set the last plate of doughnuts on the table, her fat, squishy body pressing against Laura\u2019s. She didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cThanksh,\u201d she said with a mouthful of food that she had already been eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura did do a bit of a double take. Was the old woman always that fat? She must be, she thought. After all, she was such a good cook. It was more than likely she would get fat off of her own cooking. Laura certainly was. She rubbed her belly, feeling its softness against her fingers. She was really making a pig out of herself, but the food was so good, and this woman was so nice. How could she resist? She began digging into the fresh batch of goodies the witch had left for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch plopped down into her biggest chair and let herself digest her own large meal. She hadn\u2019t had a feast that great in ages, and it would be quite a while before she thinned out and was hungry again. Plenty of time for this fat porker to eat herself into a little round ball of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura continued to eat, the witch admired her plump little eater, who seemed to be getting plumper by the day. Her round face got even puffier, her neck being swallowed in a second chin. Her plump arms were starting to look like little pink hams. Her fat drumsticks had thickened and were looking particularly juicy. And the witch smiled when she saw the girl\u2019s fat toes wiggle as she savored every sweet bite. Best of all was her tubby potbelly which was getting wider and thicker with each bite. Oh yes, Laura was filling out nicely. At this rate, by the time the witch was ready to eat her, she\u2019d have to be close to half a ton if not more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the feasting ended and Laura grew tired with all the calories digesting in her system. She yawned sleepily. \u201cOh, I guess I should go to bed,\u201d she said, rising her bulk from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch grinned. \u201cCome give me a kiss before bed, sweetie,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura waddled over and kissed the witch on the cheek as the witch gave her a hug, taking time to squish her fat flanks between her fingers. She could eat her right now, she thought. She was just so fat and delicious looking. True, the witch would be absolutely stuffed by then, but it was tempting. Still, she wanted to enjoy her little pig. After all, she hadn\u2019t told Laura the big secret yet, and the witch always loved that part when they figured out how much danger they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura heaved herself up and went to bed to sleep off her feasting until her stomach roared for food once more.</span></div></div>",

So she decided to play a game.<br>\r\n    The witch grabed Hansel by the arm and drug him over to Gretel's cage. Like a spider, the witch began to weave a trickey web around the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm sure by now the two of you have noticed my pudgy little friend in the livingroom\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both nodded their heads in anticipation to find out who this third little piggy was, eating half of Gretel's sweets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats Laura. She's a suprise thanksgiving dinner guest, who, if you play your cards right, Gretel, could take your place on the serving platter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch smiled and looked into the livingroom at Laura, picking at a chocolate pie, licking icing off of her chubby cream-filled fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I want you to do is go along with anything I tell her, make sure she is happy, feels at home, and stuffs herself like a Christmas goose. If you can do this, I will let you out of your cage to hang out with Laura, AND, you just might be able to keep those plump innerds of yours in your belly. Which I'm sure is where you prefer them\" Said the witch, as she patted Gretel's round tummy. \"And u Hansel, you'll get a bit more food, atleast while you are around Laura. Wouldn't want her catching on, not that she could, she's pretty slow. ohh yeah, don't even think about trying to run away, I put a spell on both of you which will restrict you from leaving my magic forest\" <br>\r\n    <br>\r\nWith that the witch let Gretel out of her cage, admiring her plump, tight midriff as she streched for the first time in weeks. Fattening weeks, that were now fairly obvious now that she was out of her cage, and looking fat and delicious.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"Alright! Let's go meet Little Miss Thanksgiving\". Said the witch.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n    They all three enter the livingroom. Each on either side of the witch. One boney hand on hancels head, the other wraped around gretel, squeezing her soft upper arm.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Hey Laura, I'd like you to meet my plump nei...er... I mean my pretty niece, Gretel and her brother Hansel. They come in every year at this time to prepare to put on a thanksgiving play for my thanksgiving dinner party. It's always fun. Hansel writes and dirrects, Im playing a turkey farmer and if you'll agree to stay with us till thanksgiving and let us plumpen you up a bit, for the roll, you and Gretel will play the farmer's two plump turkeys. So what do you think? Will you stay and be our thanksgiving butterball?\" Said the witch in her sweetest, most cunning tone. Smilling a big toothy grin the whole time. <br>\r\n      <br>\r\nGretel pretended to think about it for a moment but she was a sucker for good food. And, now that Hansel and Gretel were there she would have someone to play with.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"I would love to she yelled\". Jumping up and down, showing off her potbelly and her drumsticks. \"Where do we start, what do we do?\" Laura squeeled<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   \"Well\" said the witch walking over to Laura, putting one hand on the small of her back and the other on her well rounder tummy. \"First we need to get you sized up for both of your costumes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Both of my costumes? How many rolls do I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Taking advantage of the superb timing of Lauras question the witch pinched a little roll of Laura's protruding belly and said: \"Right now, standing up, you have no rolls, just a cute, round little potbelly. Which is why we need to fatten you up for awhile.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Laura blushed, trying suck in her pudgy tummy, but it was no use. She was alreay to stuffed to suck it in and let it plump back into the witch's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you know what I mean. How many characters am I playing that I need two costumes for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"I know what you ment sweety. I'm just teasing ya\". Said the witch, pinching Laura's chubby red cheek. \"You have two costumes because one costume is you as a turkey plumping up for thanksgiving, and the other is of you plump and roasted for thanksgiving. That's why we need to start fattening you up. The later of the two costumes involves you, laying belly up, in a liatard, on a silver platter with an apple in your mouth and little white paper mitten on your hands and feet to keep your plump, juicy fingers and toes from burning.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the witch grabbed Laura' hand and flipped it over, palm up. With her other boney hand the witch started pinching at the chubby cream-filled underbellies of Laura's fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      As the witches mouth begins to water, fondling Lauras sausage link like fingers, Laura announces: \"Great! Let's get me unplucked, stuffed, and ready for the roasting pan\"</span></div></div>",

She saw to it that Hansel kept his sister good and fat while she waited on Laura to plumpen up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of cooking and keeping an eye on Hansel and Gretel, the witch finally went in to check on Laura, who was still devouring food at a rapid pace thanks to the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my, quite an appetite you've got, dear,\" the witch chuckled as she wheeled in another helping for the tubby young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, it's just so good,\" she grunted between bites. \"I can't stop eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Indeed you cant, at least not until I say so,</i> the witch thought, but continued sweetly. \"That's wonderful to hear. After all, I'm going to need a nice, fat turkey this year. Let's just see how you're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch proceeded to grab and knead Laura's soft, fat belly. Though it wasn't so soft anymore. Five solid hours of nothing but eating and she was starting to get incredibly stuffed. The witch would have to stop the spell temporarily, lest Laura bust a gut. That had happened once to a previous meal. It was not exactly tasty, and it was a hassle to clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made sure to take her time grabbing and squeezing Laura's growing love handles. It was like molding wet clay, she was so soft and pliable. The witch's eyes nearly rolled back in her head as she did so. She pinched Laura's chubby cheeks and ham-like arms. Oh, she was growing so well! Her thick thighs and round, juicy bottom were filling out just nicely. The witch was tempted to make her take a walk around the kitchen, just so she could watch it all undulate and jiggle. But, she couldn't risk this perfect dinner from having even a moment of exercise. She was simply stunning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I think you'll make a perfectly fat turkey in no time,\" the witch said, letting her fingers graze across the crest of Laura's belly, stopping just at her deep, thick belly button. Hm, now here was a problem. The poor girl's buttons on her skirt were starting to look strained. \"Here, let me fix this,\" she said, undoing the buttons and letting Laura's pink, fleshy middle spill out. The witch licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn't seem to see the danger in her situation. She puffed her belly out a bit, quite proud of herself. \"Oh, I promise I'll eat well and be the biggest, fattest turkey you've ever had come to a Thanksgiving dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we'll see about that,\" said the witch. She was rather giddy at the prospect. \"You know my last meal...I mean, guest was well over six-hundred pounds by the time Thanksgiving arrived. Think you can beat that in the next month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded her head eagerly. \"I think so. Just make sure you bring all your best cooking. Make it extra fattening if you have to. I've got a lot of catching up to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry about that. You know, let's see what you already weigh, my dear. Just step over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch scooted a scale over for Laura to step on with the minimal amount of activity needed. Laura tried to look over her own belly, but couldn't see past it. The witch laughed, poking her gently in the gut. \"Now, now, don't get too eager. Let me look for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending down, she smiled wickedly. \"284. My, my, you are already quite the little porker. Oh, but we'll have to do so much eating if we're going to be the biggest, fattest turkey, aren't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat Laura back down, who was still quite hungry, thanks to the spell. \"Let's have a little dessert first, and then we'll give you a rest,\" said the witch, pulling a box of glazed, cream-filled doughnuts from her cart. That would be just enough to see to it that Laura was stuffed for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch proceeded to hand-feed Laura the delectible treats one by one, shoving each cream-filled, fried goodie down her throat, and watching it fill her perfect meal to the brim. Laura relished in the extra special attention and ate and ate, savoring each sweet bite, despite how packed her stomach was and telling her to not take another fattening bite. She couldn't help it. The food was just that good, and the thought of being an enormous, fat pig for this woman excited her like she had never felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when the last bite had been pushed past her lips, the witch finally released her from the spell, and Laura was hit with the full feeling of being stuffed to the brim. \"Ooh, I think if I ate anymore, I might pop,\" she groaned before yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably tired from all that excitement,\" the witch said. She snapped her fingers and a bed appeared right by the table. Laura didn't seem to notice. \"You rest here tonight. I don't want my fat little turkey getting any exercise, you hear me? I want you to just eat and sleep, and my dear, I think you'll be quite delicious looking by Thanksgiving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura obeyed, the hypnotic effects of the food not allowing her to see that something was clearly amiss. The witch tucked her in. \"I'll be back in a few hours for some more to eat. I know you'll be good and hungry by then.\" She gave Laura's belly a light jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if I keep eating like this, I'll be hungry all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea. Now, sleep tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch went back to check on Hansel and Gretel before she turned in for the night. Gretel was still finishing her dinner feast that Hansel had cooked up. Gretel looked delicious as well, but not nearly as delectable as that fat morsel in the kitchen. Still, by the time she was done with Gretel, she would be just as tasty-looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you two think for a second you can escape. I've laid a spell on this house that won't allow you out, and I'll know if you try. You keep eating, and you keep cooking. I need my beauty rest.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so it was that for the next several weeks, Laura continued to eat, sleep, and eat some more. Now that the witch had taken some private time to help Laura start catching up, and even greatly surpassing Gretel's size, she allowed Laura a slight bit more freedom. Rather, she allowed Gretel to sit and eat with her while she continued to stuff herself like a Christmas goose at every meal. This at least allowed Laura some companionship, though it wasn't like she noticed all that much. She was too busy eating. And, it gave Gretel a sneaky way to eat more. Sure, Gretel was onto the fact that she was being fattened to be eaten, but she always reasoned that she was safe so long as she ate less than Laura. And since Laura ate plenty, that ensured Gretel ate just a little more each day as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel felt a little sorry for Laura. She was getting fatter by the day and that much closer to the roasting oven. That was a horrible fate for anyone. Yet, at the same time, Gretel knew that the fatter Laura got, the less likely she was going to be eaten. So, she eagerly encouraged Laura to eat more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, you've just got to try this cake,\" Gretel said as they ate their fifth meal of the day. \"It's just perfect, seven layers of chocolate and cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, it is good,\" Laura said, taking a hefty bite. \"Oops, sorry, didn't mean to take so much of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. Here, you finish the rest of that. I'll just eat some of these pies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph, save some for me,\" Laura said, already gobbling down the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch came in with more food. As she had promised Laura, she had made it extra fattening. There was plenty of extra butter, sugar, and anything else she could think of to make the poor girl one of the plumpest dinners she had ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, my little turkeys, you eat up. I'll have plenty more in just a few,\" she said, checking in on her butterballs. She made it a daily habit to pinch and poke at the both of them. \"Oh, Laura, aren't you just coming along nicely. I don't know if I can keep this up with such a good little eater like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura proudly rubbed her taut belly. \"Don't worry, I've still got plenty of room, but I'll slow down so you don't have to go to so much trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not at all. I could just pinch those chubby cheeks all day. Now, you've just got to eat plenty of this nice pasta I made. It'll put some real meat on your bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, uh...my clothes have started getting too tight again,\" Laura said, showing her where the buttons of her latest blouse had burst off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch smiled, giving her belly a good jiggle. \"That's what I like to hear. Don't you worry, I'll make you another soon enough.\" In truth, the witch had several large outfits for the two girls. She had had plenty of delectable meals in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to look over Gretel. She shook her head. \"My, my, child, you're hardly eating. Where's your appetite? You're poor, sweet auntie spent all this time slaving over a hot stove for you. You had better be eating more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I'm too full,\" Gretel whined, knowing that her protests were pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe that for a second, you silly girl, now eat up.\" The witch leaned in closer and whispered in her ear. \"You'd better start eating, little porker, or I'm going to make you eat, and you wouldn't want to see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel swallowed hard and went back to stuffing her face. The witch pretended to smile once more and started to head back to the kitchen. \"Don't forget, Thanksgiving is only a couple of weeks away. I want two very, very fat turkeys I practically have to roll out the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression quickly turned sour as she entered through the kitchen door. \"At least one of them had better be,\" she grumbled. \"What are you up to, boy? I told you to get cooking! You think I can keep those two fed at your snail's pace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel glowered at the witch. \"Well, knowing that you're just fattening up my sister to eat her, why should I go any faster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if you don't, I'll eat her right now,\" the witch spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel only glared at her. Her threats were starting to lose their punch. Hm, she needed a new tactic. A wicked little idea came into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, this whole business with Laura has me thinking. I'll make you a deal. You help me make that delectable creature so fat, she can barely walk by Thanksgiving, and I'll spare your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh, I know that already. You already told us we have to play along and you won't eat her for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch shook her head. \"You're not listening, boy. I said I'd spare her, as in not eat her at all. But, here's the catch. You have to do an excellent job of fattening that Laura girl up, and I mean a damn good job. That'll at least keep me fed for a few months. It will take some time to digest her after all. In the meantime, your job will be to find me another morsel to fatten up in that time because once I get hungry, and you don't have a meal ready for me, I will eat your sister, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel thought about it. \"Does Gretel get to stop eating like a pig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"No, stupid boy. She will continue to fatten because if you fail to get me another one to eat, I need a nice plump meal to satisfy my hunger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, as long as I keep finding you more young women to fatten and eat, you'll leave Gretel alone?\" Hansel wasn't going to lie, that was a tempting offer, but was he willing to put another person on the chopping block just to save his sister?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was hardly a choice. Hansel knew what he would do in a heartbeat. \"Yes, I'll do it,\" he said, grabbing all the goodies he had cooked, and getting ready to take them out to Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch smiled wickedly. Now this was the way to keep a steady supply of food going. Who needed a gingerbread house when she had her own personal minion going around, finding, and fattening all her meals for her. The boy had some potential in him yet. In fact, she had quite a plan cooking up in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Hansel was now the one delivering the food. \"Uh, here you go, guys,\" he said. He went up and whispered in Gretel's ear. \"Just play along. I think I've found our ticket out of this. I'll tell you about it later. You just eat a little bit at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up closer to Laura, sitting beside her. \"Wow, you really are getting fat,\" he said, trying to be nice and charming. \"My aunt was right when she said you'd be the perfect turkey for my play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blushed. \"Oh, well, thank you. I really am trying my hardest. Besides, I love this whole idea. I get to eat everything I want and not have to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed nervously. \"Yeah. Look, I do want to get some measurements in before the show for your costume. Can you get on the scale first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoved the last piece of cake past her lips. \"Of course. It's my favorite part of the day, well, besides the eating that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped over on the scale and waited for Hansel to read off a number for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"455,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura giggled and bounced on the balls of her feet, her fat mass jiggling with each movement. \"Oh, that's just wonderful! I really am turning into quite the butterball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are, now let me measure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel took a tape-measure and wrapped around her waist. In truth, he was hardly paying attention. He just had to play this right. \"Well, it's looking good, but you really have a long way to go. I'm worried you're not going to be big enough for the costume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Laura looked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel smiled. \"Don't worry, I'll help you out. Sit, and I'll make sure you eat so much you can hardly stand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Hansel. You really are a sweetie. Sorry, Gretel, are we embarrassing you too much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, you just worry about all this delicious food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel proceeded to spend the next few hours cramming as much food as he could into Laura's waiting mouth. He hated that he was doing this, but it was to save his sister after all. He helped Laura eat the mountain of pasta the witch had left for her, plenty of fried foods he had just brought out, another whole cake, a plate of brownies, and several dozens of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I'm so stuffed,\" Laura said. \"You really know how to work a girl out. Can we take a break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel knew the key to his sister's survival was keeping Laura fat, and so he started to worry. \"But, we just got started, and you still have to gain another 150 pounds or more in the next couple of weeks. We can't stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hansel, I'm going to pop if I eat anymore. Please, just a little rest?\" She batted her eyelids for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. \"Just a little. Here, let me help.\" He started giving her a soothing belly rub. Hopefully, that would help her digest faster so she could eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, that feels wonderful. Thank you, Hansel,\" she purred, starting to doze off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, she was starting to fall asleep. That wasn't what Hansel was hoping for, but it would have to do until she could eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so tell me, what's all this about because I know you don't have a thing for Miss Too-Fat-to-Move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel sighed and explained to her the whole situation. \"I know it's wrong, but it's the only way I can save you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not saving me, it's just prolonging the inevitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's just it. So long as I keep finding other girls for her to eat, you're safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then what if you can't? Or what if the witch doesn't keep her promise? Hansel this is wrong and you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to rub Laura's belly all the while. \"It's the only way. Look, I'm worried too. I mean, the witch still has me cook and everything, so I don't know how I'm going to find the time to do all this, but I have to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about me? I just have to keep eating and hoping I don't look too delicious enough for that witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll think of something,\" Hansel said. \"Besides, I thought you said you liked being fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel huffed. \"I do, but I don't like the idea of being eaten either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all we got. Just go with it for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura continued to sleep, her taut stomach already rumbling for more food. \"I'd better get cooking for when she wakes up,\" Hansel said. \"You should try and get some rest too.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Indeed, the witch had come up with a grand scheme, one she thought would pay off with great results. She had decided that as part of this plan, she would make Hansel her protege. She taught him a little magic, not enough to make him a threat to stop her, but just enough that he could use all the necessary spells he would need, like making food magically cook itself and spells that would make Laura hungrier. He would shape up to be a decent little warlock, and the best part: he worked for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the effort Hansel put into fattening Laura, she seemed to gain weight faster than ever. He made sure there was hardly a moment where she wasn't eating something. All the while, Gretel continued to eat, as part of her end of the bargain, but the extra pounds she put on were quickly being forgotten as Laura continued to balloon up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of days before Thanksgiving, and the witch was ready for her meal. She and Hansel went to the other end of the kitchen, where Laura was continuing to eat the feast Hansel had left for her the night before. She was enormous. Her perfectly fat belly now dominated her frame, hanging low, almost to the floor and cascading into several rolls. Her puffy arms were each the size of a Christmas ham. Her cushy bottom and wide as tree-trunk thighs were starting to warp the bench she was sitting on. And her puffy cheeks were crammed with food, giving her face a squinted look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost time for the big play, dear,\" the witch said. \"We need to get you weighed one last time for your costume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura hardly said a word, and only stopped eating when Hansel made the food disappear. She grunted in frustration, but tried to stand up, only to be met with a peculiar problem. She heaved and panted as she tried to lift herself, but found she couldn't do it. \"I can't get up,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch smiled. \"Not to worry. We'll help you up.\" So with the help of Hansel, the two of them were able to lift the enormous pig to her feet and get her to stand on the scale, which crunched under her girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"732,\" Hansel read, quite surprised himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch gave her a pat on the belly. \"That's my girl! You really are going to be my fattest turkey ever. Come, come now, let's get you all ready here on the counter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the play's in a couple of days,\" she protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch waved it off with a spell, making Laura forget that the play was happening. \"Nonsense, we need to get you stuffed and all ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them heaved Laura onto the counter. The witch made a bowl of her special Thanksgiving stuffing appear out of nowhere and proceeded to feed Laura spoonful by spoonful. In the meantime, Hansel began helping her get Laura oiled up, have plenty of veggies sprinkled around her, and even stuffed an apple in her cavernous belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tickles,\" Laura said between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ah, you keep eating, my fat little turkey. We'll have you all ready in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for what?\" Laura asked, starting to grow suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, to eat you, of course,\" said the witch. \"You foolish, child, you played right into my trap. You've eaten yourself so round, there's no hope of you getting away now. So, I'd just sit back, get stuffed, and just think about how delicious you'll taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura tried to struggle, but found it useless. The witch was right. She was too fat to run away. She lay there, panting in fear. The witch looked to Hansel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are you waiting for. My dinner's almost ready, which means, you should be out finding my next meal and getting her good and fat. Be gone with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel was glad to leave. He didn't want to see the witch eat Laura. The poor girl continued to grunt and whine, pleading for mercy while the witch plugged her mouth with more stuffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel was meanwhile eating in the living room as Hansel made his way for the door. She had heard the sounds. \"It's happening, isn't it?\" she said worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to find another one, aren't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hansel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back to her, tears in his eyes. \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please save me, Hansel,\" she said. \"I know it's wrong, but I'm glad that's not me in there right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"I'll do my best.\"</span></div></div>",

I will get some food for you.\" Hansel said and run too the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel placed her wide rear on a bench. She was out of breath. She was a lot heavier since she last time she walked and since she was in the cage she had't walked at all what made her leg muscles weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that nice woman is your aunt. I guess you love it to be here in the vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... yeah sure. Sort of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why is your brother so thin. I mean he is't a turkey but i mean he get's also some of the food right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh well... he's on a diet. He does't want to become fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If i look at him i would say he need to gain a few pounds. He's terribly skinny. He should follow a diet that makes you gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go!\" Hansel said with a car full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead. Eat yourself fat turkey!\" Gretel said on a tone like it was all a fun game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura started to eat fast. Gretel also started to eat since all the food she got the past time stretched her tummy so much she had gotten a big hunger. Hansel also could finally eat some good food himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were thin in the past right?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Gretel asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You were thin in the past since your dress is ripping at the sides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel looked and noticed her dress almost completely ripped in half. It just hold by a few threads. Nothing to worry. Laura was a girl and Hansel had seen her naked before. one time more would't matter.<br>\r\nLaura showed that she wanted to be a thanksgiving turkey. She ate like there was no tomorrow. Every kind of food in front of her was gone in a few minutes and she did't seem to stop or get full. <br>\r\nHansel kept bringing food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch saw them and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it. you will fill my tummy up really good. I will have a nice thanksgiving dinner.\" She looked at Gretel. \"I don't forget about you. I will fatten you up until you're immobile an even fatter. You will be  my biggest dinner ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe licked her lips and started to laugh wicked. </span></div></div>",

She seemed too be even fatter then Laura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gretel we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel was interrupted by a loud: RIIIIIIIIIIIP!

She's even fatter then me. Even fatter then you.\" She said and pushed her finger in Gretel's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Maybe you can change that before she arrives. Favorite nephew... can you make some more fattening food for the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course dear aunt.\" Hansel said while he walked too the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make all the food fattening. Not only Laura's food. I will notice.\" She said with a voice that sounded as sharp if a knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... aunt my dress ripped.\" Gretel said a bit shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right. Come with me dear niece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took Gretel by the hand too a room and closed the door.

You know i was planning to eat you for thanksgiving but it seems i have two other girls to feast on first. So i will have plenty more time too fatten you up. By the time you're ready you will be obese and be my best meal ever. But those other two would found it a bit strange if you would walk around in your underwear so here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed Gretel a nice pink dress. It fitted her new body, felt pretty nice and was of much better quality then her old many times repaired dress.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"So all dressed up. Now go back too the room and stuff yourself.

The witch had cast a small spell that made her house easier to spot temporarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed, Laura had lived up to her description of Amber. She was a little taller than Laura, but she was fat as could be. Her beautifully rounded potbelly looked like an overgrown pumpkin, and everything about her was plump and delectable, from her round chubby cheeks, to her fluffy, marshmallow-like arms, to her thick juicy drumsticks, to her fat little toes. The witch was already salivating at the thought of eating this one. And she would have gladly done so right then and there, but the prospect of making this pig even fatter was too tempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy come in, come in, my dear,\u201d the witch said, guiding her into the room, taking a good grasp at her fat arms. \u201cYou must be Amber. Laura has told me so much about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber smiled, easily taken in by the witch\u2019s kindness. \u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d she said. \u201cShe told me you were the kindest woman and the best cook around. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, I can\u2019t resist good cooking.\u201d She rubbed her squishy middle at the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way,\u201d the witch said. \u201cI certainly do love good, fat, little eaters.\u201d She proceeded to knead and poke Amber\u2019s belly, admiring its softness. It practically jiggled like Jell-O in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s just perfect then! She told me you were also putting on a cute little play. She said maybe I could help?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed you could. I could always use some more fat turkeys for my play. Of course, we\u2019ll need to get you good and plump for the role.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puffed out her gut. \u201cWho could say no to that? Let\u2019s get eating!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch smiled. This was just too easy some days. Here, she had three fat little piggies who would eat themselves round just for her. That Big Bad Wolf had nothing on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, ah, ah, first we need to do a little measuring,\u201d the witch said. She was dreadfully curious to know what she was working with here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought Amber into the other room with Laura and Gretel who had both started to slow their feasting frenzy. Their bellies were looking good and stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to do a little bit of a weigh in. I want to see how my chubby turkeys are doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was eager and clapped her hands with excitement. \u201cOh, Amber, you\u2019re here. Just in time too. I want to see how big I\u2019ve gotten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber chuckled and gave her sister\u2019s fat gut a pat. \u201cYou\u2019ve certainly done some growing, sis.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAmber, you first, dear,\u201d the witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped up onto the nearby scale. It whirred for a few seconds before settling on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c350, right on the nose,\u201d the witch said with delight. \u201cYou are a big girl, aren\u2019t you? Well, you\u2019d better have a seat and start filling that beautiful belly of yours. I want to see it twice its size by Thanksgiving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl strutted proudly to the table and began eating on what few bits of food Laura and Gretel hadn\u2019t already eaten. Hansel watched from the kitchen, rolling his eyes as he went to cook more. How could the witch expect him to cook for three fat butterballs now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was next. \u201c276,\u201d the witch read. \u201cGetting pretty chunky.\u201d She pinched Laura\u2019s lovehandles. \u201cBut, you\u2019re going to have to eat quite a bit to be ready to be a good turkey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawned. \u201cCan I take a nap first? I\u2019m awfully tired, and awfully full.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch shooed her off to bed. It would be a perfect time to make sure she wasn\u2019t burning any calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel was last. She winced as she heard the scale creak under her girth. But, eventually, the scales settled on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c253,\u201d the witch said. She gave Gretel a rough pinch. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re eating nearly enough. Trying to trick me, eh? Well, you\u2019d better start filling that gut to the brim, or I\u2019m going to make you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel sighed. \u201cYes\u2026auntie,\u201d she said, using their cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now go back to eating. You\u2019re not nearly full enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch headed back to the kitchen. She needed to get an ultimate feast ready to go for the three girls. Hansel was busy trying to keep up with it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t kill you to help me,\u201d Hansel said. \u201cIf you want Amber and Laura fat enough, you\u2019re going to have to do some of the work yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush, boy, or I\u2019ll make you wish you never uttered a sound. I have a few tricks of my own, don\u2019t you worry.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the end, the witch decided there was really only one way to keep her delicious little fatlings growing steadily. One of her gifts was in potion making. With a little bit of this, and a little bit of that, she had a wonderful addition to put in all the food Hansel was cooking up. It would make all the food incredibly fattening, and even better, it would give each of the girls the sensation of never feeling full. They would just eat, and eat, and eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she made the food itself especially fattening. She added more sugar, more butter, and really, more everything. Any food that was coming out of the oven was incredibly dense, filling, and would add calories like no one had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are, girls, dessert!\u201d the witch said, rolling in a trolley, stacked to the brim with all manner of cakes, pastries, cookies, brownies, pies, and cupcakes. Even the smallest cupcake weighed about two pounds, they were so chocked full of calorie-inducing ingredients and the potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber eagerly took the first bite. Her eyes rolled back in ecstasy. \u201cMmm! These are incredible!\u201d Amber said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re so filling.\u201d She rubbed her overfed tummy. \u201cI think this will do just the trick to make me fat as can be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope so,\u201d said the witch, smiling wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura went to digging into a seven-cake that was all for her. \u201cOh, this is so rich!\u201d she squealed. \u201cI feel like such a pig, but it\u2019s so good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch jiggled Laura\u2019s belly. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel reluctantly took a bite of her pie. She knew what its purpose was. Yet, something felt wrong about this food, more unusual than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, all three girls were devouring the treats left and right, hardly stopping to catch a breath. The food was incredibly addicting, and the potion made it even more so. Plus, as much as they ate, they never felt painfully stuffed. Only Gretel suspected something amiss about that, but she knew she couldn\u2019t do anything about it with the witch watching their every move. And as each heavy treat passed their throats, their stomachs swelled out just that much more. Pretty soon, the fast-acting potion would turn it all to fat to spread around their bodies. Within an hour, the witch could tell that each girl looked a little wider, their hips flared out just that much more, their thighs that much thicker, their faces that much more chocked with fat. Why, Amber, who already had a wobbling double chin was now forming a third one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Hansel was run ragged in the kitchen trying to keep up with all the cooking. With the girls never stopping in their gorging fest, he was stuck cooking night and day. He never felt more exhausted in his life. Yet he knew if he even stopped for a second, the witch would be on him faster than a cheetah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating and eating, the girls looked like fat little pigs at the trough, and the witch was loving every moment of it. Amber swelled up nicely, already fat to begin with. She was easily surpassing the others with how much she could eat. A few times, the witch stopped to feed her herself, just to take a moment to squish and feel every fat inch of her. Laura was the greediest, eating anything she could get her hands on. She wanted to surpass her sister and did look the part of a pig as she practically buried her face in her food. Even Gretel was not resistant to the spell and found herself grabbing more food, even though she knew that the fatter she got, the more delicious she was looking. It was so hard to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch licked her lips at the thought of the three tasty feasts awaiting her.</span></div></div>",

Her gut had gotten so round, and her arms so flabby, she was unable to lean far enough to reach the next fattening treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe\u2026oof\u2026neither,\u201d Laura said, stretching as far as she could. She too, much like her sister, had gotten so round and puffy that her own fat was getting in the way of her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Gretel said, trying with all her might to lift herself from the table so that she might walk over and grab the intended target. But her body resisted and she couldn\u2019t even move herself an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch walked in the room, a devilish smile on her face. Before her was a fantastic sight. Three fat little doughballs with nowhere to go. Each one looked like a fat creampuff with arms and a head. She strode up to them. \u201cMy, my, what do we have here?\u201d she said, poking and kneading Amber first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026can\u2019t\u2026huff\u2026reach\u2026the\u2026food,\u201d Amber said. Her voice was so husky and her multiple chins made it a great effort for her to even talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re too heavy,\u201d Gretel finished. She was the only one of the three who knew how much trouble they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, but that\u2019s a great problem to have, my little turkeys,\u201d she said, taking a pinch of Laura\u2019s pale, soft, wobbling belly. \u201cIt means you\u2019ve gotten so round, and fat, and delicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDelicious?\u201d Laura said, starting to get worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch knew she had them. Time to spring the trap. \u201cOh, my, yes, quite delicious. You see, my dear, I\u2019m a witch, a witch who likes to eat fat little turkeys like yourselves. You three have been some of the best I\u2019ve had. You\u2019ve eaten yourselves so fat, there\u2019s no way you can escape me now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Amber, now becoming aware of the danger looked around them, realizing for the first time all the purposefully fattening food and their now round, stuffed guts which weighed them down from running away. \u201cYou\u2019re going to eat us!\u201d they wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch poked at Gretel for a few seconds. \u201cYes, that\u2019s the idea. I was going to eat you last Thanksgiving, but I was having so much fun with my special potion to make you all eat more and more, that I decided to save you all for a year until the next Thanksgiving. That\u2019s only a couple of weeks away, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe potion had put the girls into such a food-filled haze, they never realized they had been sitting there getting fatter by the day for an entire year. No wonder they couldn\u2019t move. The witch would have to roll them to the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, there\u2019s still time, yet,\u201d the witch said, \u201cand I want the fattest of you three by that time for my feast. So, we\u2019d better get busy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snapped her fingers and the girls had been transported to a barn of some sort. Each had had their fat selves placed in a small sty, lying on their backs, belly up. The witch walked down the aisle of the barn. \u201cNow, my little fatlings, for the next couple of weeks, I\u2019m going to make sure you\u2019re as fat as can be, and by Thanksgiving, I\u2019ll eat one of you. The rest of you, I\u2019ll save for much much longer to keep growing fat. After all, eating just one of you will keep me sated for quite a long time. Let\u2019s begin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another snap of her fingers, three tubes appeared and popped into each of the girls\u2019 mouths. A white, creamy liquid began to flow through it. It was sweet and milky, and tasted so rich. The girls knew they were in trouble, but the liquid, much like their food, was laced with the potion to make them continue to be addicted to it. With each gulp, their bulbous guts swelled out further and further with a shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch came up and rubbed Amber\u2019s creamy, white belly flesh, watching it pump outward further and further with each gulp. \u201cThis will make sure you pack on the pounds by Thanksgiving. Don\u2019t worry, much as I like your delicious little bellies, it isn\u2019t all going to go there. Within a few minutes, it will instantly turn to fat to spread all over. You\u2019ll just lie here, growing and growing. Isn\u2019t that marvelous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber and Laura began to weep bitter tears through their constant slurping of the fattening liquid. They were not prepared for this. If they could have spoken, they would have tried begging for their lives, but it would have been to no avail. Gretel only glared daggers at the witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that reminds me,\u201d the witch said.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>2 weeks until Thanksgiving....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe witch was absolutely famished and decided that a pre-Thanksgiving snack was definitely in order. She wandered into the barn as she did everyday to check on her fattening piggies and was surprised to see Laura had surpassed everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 3 were already past 2000 pounds, but Laura was without a doubt the fattest. Her body had lost all shape except for \"blob\" and jiggled with every slight movement. The witch conjured a measuring tape and began getting her dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butt to belly's end: 9 feet. Thigh to Thigh: 6 feet. Butt to top of head: 5 feet. Circumference of thighs, \"The Witch cast a spell to lift Laura's oceanic belly, \" 7 feet. Circumference of calves: 3 feet. Total circumference of deliciously obese little girl: 28 feet. My my....what to do with you. You simply won't fit in my oven,\" the witch said with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls new full well that the witch could just conjure an oven big enough. This frightened Laura even more than she already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's only one way to handle this blob,\" The witch said as she cast a spell on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoke filled the air and stirring could be heard from within the cloud. From it emerged a giant naga. The witch had transformed into a half-woman, half-snake monster. The sight of it was enough to make Laura faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah...can't have you passing out deary,\" The witch said as she cast an awakening spell on Laura, \"Can't have you missing all of the...excitement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch began wrapping Laura with the bottom of her tail, allowing her to lift up the massive \"little\" girl. Laura began to whimper, but it was all she could muster. Her obesity weighed her down far too much to do anything. She began getting pulled closer to the witch's head, who began opening her mouth. She opened it unnaturally large. An ability granted by her new transformation. It opened just big enough to fit Laura's fat head into and the witch began to swallow. Laura could feel the muscles pulling on her. The saliva lubricating her as she moved inch by inch down the witches throat. the smell was awful, but Laura didn't notice. She was panicking and trying her hardest to get free. This was useless, obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Witch continued to swallow. Laura felt her shoulders being pressed together, the witch opening just enough to let them in. inch by inch, The wet, constricting feeling made it's way to her many arm rolls. Squishing to conform to the witches mouth, her breasts were barely an obstacle. After all, they only looked fully formed because she was so obese. She felt the muscles pull her further and further until the witch stopped. She felt what remained outside being hoisted further up. The Witch needed gravity's help with what was to come. The swallowing commenced and she felt the warm wet touch on her elbows. The Witch swallowed hard and Laura felt the constriction of the mouth on her upper belly. There was some stalling and pressure on her side rolls. The Witch had to push in on Laura's fat to fit it in her mouth. The swallowing was slower from here on, which just added to the torture Laura was enduring. There was a swallow, more shoving, more swallowing, followed by, yet again, more pushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Witch had made it halfway through Laura's mammoth belly when Laura's head finally entered the stomach. It was still wet, but also hot and smelled sour. More constricting, this time tighter and a big swallow. The Witch had obvious gotten to the bigger, more delectable belly rolls. This was enough swallowing to put Laura's head right into the bottom of the stomach. It was very large inside there, but that was obviously so Laura would fit inside whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the swallowing commenced, Laura was forced into the beginnings of a curl. Her belly was beginning to enter the stomach and pushing anything and everything out of the way. She could feel her gigantic ass enter the mouth and was moving in at an accelerated pace. Now that at least 2000 pounds of Laura were inside the stomach, gravity was doing everything for the Witch. Soon, she felt her thighs enter and the witch began slurping her up like spaghetti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one finally push, Laura's feet went down the gullet. There was just enough room for Laura to curl back around and land fat ass down. She didn't have much time to get her senses back before the stomach started moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind, but I really don't need to take 2 weeks to digest all of you. So I thought I'd speed up the process,\" The Witch called out at the meal in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn queue, a few tubes with sharp ends shot out of the walls of the witch's stomach and pierced Laura's skin at multiple points on her body. Another shot right into her mouth. 2 seconds later, a liquid began pouring down her throat and into the pierced areas. It tasted sweet, like icing. She didn't know what was going on, but that didn't matter 5 seconds later. Whatever it was had placed her in a total state of catatonic euphoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't have you squirming about while you digest. Far too painful for me and you don't want me getting sick,\" The Witch said as she leaned back against the barn wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of this, the stomach began churning stomach acid all around Laura. The searing heat went unnoticed by Laura, who hadn't noticed that digestive acid had also replaced the fluid currently pumping into her. She also didn't notice that her skin was being turned into liquid or that she was sinking further down as a result of the internal digestion. She finally lost full consciousness 30 seconds later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll it took was 1 hour. Laura was reduced to hundreds of gallons of fat in a pool of stomach acid, which was finding a new home on the witch's own body. 2 hours went by and the conversion of fat was complete. The Witch was able to use her new body fat in a spell to look 30 years younger. She was once again a beautiful brunette woman who looked to be in her early 30's and about 200 pounds. Of course, the was still left over fat. She didn't want to overdue it on the first go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, what a delicious morsel she was. Tasted of cake and donuts.\" The witch said as she sauntered over to her other fattened piggies, \"Now....who's on the Thanksgiving menu?\"</span></div></div>",

Being a bit more on the chubby side now, like her potbellied sister Amber, she had trouble getting up onto the prep table so the witch boosted Laura up, groaning in approval under her newly developed weight.<br>\r\n   \"well well well, you're quite a bit heavier than you look\" she said, pinching Laura's chubby, red cheek.<br>\r\n\"I probably should have done this along time ago\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Should have done what, along time ago?\" Laura asked, through a mouth full of cupcake she found sitting   next to her on the prep table, icing from her cute little turned up nose, to her plump double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Ohh nothing, Pumpkin\" said the witch as she peeled Laura's sock off for the last time. First pinching and squeezing her fat and plump, round big toe. Then she took out a measuring tape and measured around Laura's long chubby big piggie. After that the witch did the same to Laura's other 9 fat pigglets. All the while smiling and nodding in apparent approval. Occasionally pinching the fat upper part of one of Laura's portly piggies, bringing it to her nose and smelling it, usually licking her lips afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    After she finished with all ten of Laura's long plump toes she gave her a very intense foot and toe massage and said \"very nice piggies Laura, I can't wait to eat them,\" then she did the same to Laura's chubby fingers, paying extra attention to the chubby bottem sections of Laura's fingers. (fingers were her favorite and lauras were perfect).<br>\r\n     After a full inspection and massaging, the witch opened her boney hand as wide as it would go and placed it on the front of Laura's soft round belly, clenching it gently, feeling the plump elasticity of the healthy young girls belly fat push aginst her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Come now, turkey, let's get you out of those cloths so we can get a proper weight reading on you. You know, at 11 minuits a pound, your going to have to be in my oven for along time\" she said, helping Laura off the prep table then patting her on her bulging tummy and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The witch helped Laura out of her cloths. All the while pinching squeezing poking and teasing. \"OOOO, I can't wait to get your fattened drumsticks marinated and roasted\". She'd say, while squeezing the thick meaty part of Laura's calf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Alright, my butterball, hop up here on this scale so I can figure out how much stuffing your going to take and how long your going to have to be in the oven\"<br>\r\n    Laura got up on the scale and the needl rolled all the way over to 160 pounds.<br>\r\n   \"woohoo\"! The witch yelled slapping lauras fat gut. \"your damn near the fattest turkey my coven has had the pleasure of roasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The witch walked Laura back over to the prep table, only this time, before helping her up she placed a large roasting pan in the center.<br>\r\n     \"That is a roasting pan big enough to roast my fat butt in. I'm starting to think that you wernt fattening me up to play the roll of a thanksgiving turkey, you were fattening me up to be a thanksgiving turkey!\" said Laura, with her hands on her widened hips, belly thrust out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With that, the witch cast a spell that immobilized the wellfed entree and also floated her up and into the shallow roasting pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Why are you doing this to me? I don't want to be roasted and eaten!\" sobbed the fatted girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I know you don't, my chubby little dish, but you are easly the plumpest most delicious young women I have ever had the pleasure of fattening up. And if your sister has half the appitite you do I'm going to be one happy witch.\" she said, as she tied Lauras chubby big toes together then pushed Lauras knees up and spread them appart, tying her plump meaty thumbs to her toes, causing her to rest in the roasting pan like a  turkey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Still sobbing lightly Laura now recognized her plump resemblance to a thanksgiving day bird and began to throw a fit. \"you can't eat me, I'm to young to die, eat my friend sherry, she's spoiled rotten and fat and dumb, I'm too pretty, you can't do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    At that the witch stuffed a big red apple in Lauras mouth, excentuating her chubby red cheeks. Then she a large jar of hony and started coating Lauras entire plump swollen body, spending extra time on her bloated belly, fat toes and plump potbellied fingers. When she was done basting Laura she put a sliced ring of onion around each of her fat, meaty fingers and toes. Then she put a green olive between each round toe. After which she placed puffy white paper mittens over each chubby hand and foot to keep them from burning while the rest of her bloated fleshy body roasted. Then the witch placed a pinnapple ring around each nipple and pushed a bright red cherry into Lauras deep bellybutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"My My My, what a nice fat turkey dinner you've made, Laura. You should be proud of yourself, I know I am\" said the witch as she pulled the apple out of Lauras mouth. \"Any last words before u slide you into the oven, my fat little butterball\"? She asked, punching Laura's plump tied up toes. </span></div></div>",

Hansel please open the door. I don't think you want to see this anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel slowly walked too the door before he left he whispered too Laura: \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be mad at those two kids.

You all going to the same place.\" The witch said with an evil grin. \"Now any last words?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel took one look at his sister who was eating the remaining food after the witch took Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did't think about opening the door?\" Hansel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel lifted her shoulders and started to eat a whole chicken while Hansel opened the door. <br>\r\nHis mouth fell open. I the door opening was standing a fat but beautiful girl. She had long dark brown hair and a friendly smile on her chubby face. She seemed to be around Lara's age. She had some nice big boobs and a big belly that stuck out forward hanging over her waistband and a but that looked like two basketballs and big thighs that rubbed while walking. She must weigh around 200 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you two must be Hansel and Gretel right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Gretel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well where is my sister?\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they heard Laura's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the voice was cut of and they heard a sound like a door was closed.<br>\r\nGretel and Hansel closed their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah there she is. I'm gonna say hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked too the door of the kitchen while Hansel looked with open mouth at her wobbling butt and rubbing thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Hansel what's wrong with you? Hee you do like that girl don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No well yes... i mean... Well she looks very  beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and i don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my sister. You can't expect me that i look at you that way. She's so fat and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really well you know what brother. I'm gonna become way fatter then her. I'll start now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words she started to stuff her face.<br>\r\nHansel sighed and looked at his fat sister. He felt bad about that girl Laura. He did't want that girl Amber to be roasted too and he also did't want his sister to be roasted. Even while she was't acting really nice the past time. It was kind of strange. Like brother and sister and a twin and with no other kids around they always shared anything   together. But now she became really lazy and only seem to care about food.</span></div></div>",

Sherry sometimes acted like a spoiled brat. Always asking for more food and to be fed. She could hardly move an inch by now. <br>\r\nHe walked too the kitchen and filled a cart with food and brought it over too the girls who started to stuff their faces. He set up some things right in front of sherry so she only need to bend for over to eat it. <br>\r\nNone of the girls wore clothes anymore. Even the largest piece of elastic clothing and underwear ripped of but the girls did't seem to notice. Hansel took some blankets to cover the girls bodies. He need several blankets for that. <br>\r\nSherry's body was hardly noticeable and seemed to be all rolls of fat. Her arms, legs were totally covered by rolls of fat the size of tires and her belly was in two big rolls with some watermelon sized breasts on top of it and no neck but cheeks that seemed like there was a jawbreaker stuffed in each of them, and a butt that would take up an entire couch.<br>\r\nAmber's body was also slowly starting to get lost but she could still move, however it was getting harder and harder lately. Her arms looked like pillows and her butt like two beach balls With a huge belly that covered most of her tire sized thighs.   <br>\r\nGretel was't far behind but at the other hand she was younger and skinnier then both of the other girl to begin with, and if she was planning to eat Gretel last he knew she would be when it was her time fatter then both other girls. She looked like a smaller version of Amber but the difference of pounds of the two girls seemed to be getting smaller. <br>\r\nHansel walked to another part of the house and saw another door and slowly opened it. It was dark inside. He saw the witch. She was sleeping. He noticed a bugle in the belly of the witch. Probably all what was left of that poor girl Laura. She did't deserved it. Just came at the wrong place. But now thanks to her there were also two other girls. He fast closed the door and looked further through the house.<br>\r\nHe had never bin in this part of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would't mind if she would have cleaned here once in a while. The dust is inches high here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he walked further anyway and walked up the stairs but first checked every stair before he put his feet on it. He wondered what would be upstairs. <br>\r\nHe opened one door but that was just an empty room. <br>\r\nHe opened another room and saw a small table with a crystal boll on it and a set of cards and some other witch stuff. He wondered if she still used it. <br>\r\nHe looked in another room and saw just a lot of junk. Ordinary junk like chairs and beds, (maybe magic) books and other stuff. <br>\r\nThere was one door left and another stair. Suddenly he heard a sound...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With Hansel confused asked why he would do such a thing?<br>\r\nThe skinny witch then explained the whole thing that she was the good part of the witch and that the evil side toke over and banished her here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do i free you then and how can we make the bad one go into the cage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to break the crystal boll after you had placed the tarot card that represents good upon the evil witch her forehead and the evil tarot card on my forehead.\" Said the good witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did as he was told and when he gave the evil tarot card to the good witch did he broke the crystal boll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw then that the good witch spirit went to the body and the evil spirit enter the cage.<br>\r\nthe good witch came to the room and ask Hansel to leave this room while she would use magic to banish the spirit to the other realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hansel was downstairs the girls where still eating.

That the evil witch tricked them so she could fatten them and eat them and at first they got kind of angry hearing that. They also heard the fate of the poor Laura and finally the lucky coincidence Hansel found the good side of the witch. So it was mostly a happy end apart for Laura and the evil side of the witch.<br>\r\nAs for the girls they kept eating. Amber was also immobile and Gretel was't far behind. With effort she could move her hands a bit. Not that they need to move since the good side of the witch made all the food fly right towards their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are fattening them too.\" Hansel said one time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not fattening them i just feed them. That they just keep eating is't my fault but i just can't stand seeing hungry  kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel nodded slowly. The girls seemed slowly starting to talk a bit more and Finally Gretel said: \"Hansel... our father. He must be worried sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he left us because he could't afford it feeding us. I would love too see him again but if we go back it does't change anything he still won't be able to feed us and we would be left probably again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or he could come here.\" The witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll kids looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not. I live here all alone and i have money enough. It would be nice to have a strong man here and some kids. Before you came here and released me i was pretty lonely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Hansel. Go get our dad and bring him here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? All by myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i can't walk anymore and even if i could i won't fit through the door. Besides i'm still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But how do i find the way back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't use breadcrumbs that's for sure.\" Gretel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told me you used rocks the first time. I have enough small white rocks behind my house. Then you can find back the way here.\" The witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel fast walked behind the house with a small bag he filled with white rocks and started to walk the way he thought the house of his father was every now and then dropping a rock so he would be able too find the way back. He walked for hours and just when he thought to give it all up and just get back to the house of the witch he saw a big old tree. He looked better and remembered how he and Gretel played here so many times when they were young. Now he knew the way and soon he found the house.<br>\r\nBefore the house was his father sitting on a bench. He had buried his face in his hands and was crying. He looked a lot older then he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad is that you?\" Hansel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his dad looked up and saw who it was he got so happy and smiled he looked like his old self again. Now tears of joy were running over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy that you're back. I should have never ever have left you in the forest. You two are more important to me then anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More important then our stepmother?\" Hansel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's too bad i did't realized that before. You know i really loved her in the beginning but lately there was no love anymore. She also never gave a sign about love. Not to you and not too me. It does't matter anything. She's dead now. She passed away short after we left you two. You don't know half how i missed you two. I was almost planning to kill myself or wait for my dead. Seems like you got here just in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel hugged his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Hansel were's your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well that's a long story. Don't worry she's safe and she wanted too come but could't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's better if you could see that for yourself. Come i will tell you what happened while we walk too her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way Hansel told him the whole story. About the witch and the other girls but he left out the part how obese the girls must be by now. It was better if his dad saw that for himself. He could't blame them. He left them.<br>\r\nWhen they reached the house his father ran in to see his (he thought little) girl. Hansel wondered how his father would react and fast ran after him. When he reached his father his father looked whit open mouth at what had become of his former little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi dad! It's so good to see you again. I missed you so much.\" Tears appeared in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their father saw her tears he forget about one moment how fat she was and just hugged her as good if he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Gretel. I'm so happy too see you again. You sure have grown. All this time i hoped you two found a good home where they would feed you. I'm glad i see you did. At least I know for sure Gretel got enough food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel grinned happy at her father. He seemed pretty happy with his obese daughter. He could't stay mad since it was his own fault for leaving them in the forest and it was't their own doing the witch was fattening them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the father of Hansel and Gretel. It's so nice to finally meet you. I'm the good side of the witch. Hansel told you about, at least i hope he did. Sorry for what happened to your daughter but... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem. She looks very good. I was always so worried about her low weight. I could count her ribs and saw her bones under her skin by her arms and legs. So fat as now she looks a lot better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But eh... Being so fat is't that unhealthy. You know heat disease and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think i and my bad side thought about that? The food is fattening but how much the people would eat and gain they will stay healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bad side though about that too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I they died they could't gain, anymore and she wanted them so fat if possible. But now something else. I heard you had't enough money too take care of your children but that you still love them. I have enough money for all four of us and more and i would love to have a man around the house and some lovely children. If you want too live here and become a family together with me i would be very happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather scratched his head, thought for a second and started to laugh friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure why not. My kids mean anything to me. If you want too take care of them and me we will be happy too accept your offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sherry an Amber saw how happy the father of Hansel an Gretel was seeing his children they also wanted to see their parents again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know i also like to get back too my parents.\" Sherry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do i. Besides i must tell them what happened too my sister.\" Amber said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all went silent for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i don't think my parents will be happy i the see how fat i am now.\" Sherry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents then. They never where fond of my weight and now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry. I will talk too your parents and i can always use some magic too make them being fine with it.. I also have a spell too transport you back home so you wan't have too walk. Then you can decide if you try to lose the fat our not.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What about me dad. I feel fine this way and i don't want to lose the weight i feel fine so. I feel fantastic. I'm sure the witch won't mind feeding me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you were always so skinny and that you got this size is my own fault for you leaving you in the forest. I don't think exercise would help much too lose so much fat so you can stay this way. But try to not gain as much if before. You don't have to gain anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this story ended. Hansel and Gretel lived together with their father and good side of the witch. Sherry and Amber went back too their parents and the witch made sure their parents were't too angry what was pretty easy since someone forced them too gain so it was't really their own fault. Hansel visit them sometimes and he finally married Sherry and they are very happy together.<br>\r\nTheir father is very happy and the witch also. Gretel. Well she stayed with her father and the witch and continued to gain but not as much if before but she was happy and loved her fat.<br>\r\nSo i can say Hansel, his dad and the witch lived happily ever after, Gretel lived happily AND FAT ever after.   </span></div></div>",

Anything!\"  \"Good boy, I've got just the thing for you.\" She then pushes uses her magic to make the cart of food move over next to Hansel. There was a wide selection of meals to go for. Cakes, pies, Pastries, hot dogs, burgers, ice cream, you name it! \"Dig in my child.\" With that, Hansel dived right into the food. He stuffed a dozen hot dogs down his throat, followed by 10 burgers and not stopping for a second. \"Hey! What am I supposed to eat!\" shouted Sherry. <br>\r\n\"Oh, I think you've had your fill already. In fact, I think you're ready for the oven now!\" With that, the witch used her magic to manoeuvre her into the kitchen. \"I'll be back in a minute my sweet thing.\" With that, she walked into the kitchen and shut the door behind her. Hansel proceeded with his eating, swallowing down chocolate eclairs and cream puffs. \"Wow, these are so good.\" He doesn't even notice a pot belly starting to form as well as softer ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Sherry was getting impatient. \"Why is he having all the food! I'm the one that's hungry here!\" The witch then stuffed a large red apple into Sherry's mouth. She the started sizing her up, squeezing her plump breast and kneading her doughy belly. She then started to give her ass cheeks a slight pinch on each side. \"Perfect. You'll make an amazing pie. I think I'll go for cherry.\" Sherry starts to complain through her apple, but the witch just ignores it. She then lifts her up onto the flour coated worktop using her wand. She lays her flat and ties her arms and legs to her sides using cooking twine. She then opens a jar of cherry paste and brushes it over sherry;'s body. She then massages it into her skin, paying extra attention to her sex,  globular breasts and belly rolls. She then proceeds with the other side, massaging each butt cheek and even inside the asshole. She pushes a small cherry inside it and flips her back over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, no complaining, or I'll start biting now.\" She removes the apple from her mouth and replaces it with a feeding tube. She switches on the machine and cherry filling starts to enter Sherry's gut, expanding it even further. After about 5 minutes of this filling, Sherry starts to resemble the form of an enormously fluffy marshmallow. She the replaced the apple and placed her into a tray, scattering crushed almonds over her. She then opens up the oven and places the pie inside of it. \"Mmmm, Sherry pie, my favourite.\" She then closed the oven door and set the timer. \"Time to check on my main meal.\"</span></div></div>",

His fingers are like sausages, his legs like small chicken drumsticks, his armpits are like wings and he has 3 layers of chin. His buttocks are now a lot fatter and plumper than before as well as firmer. His belly on the other hand has began to droop and grow, forming dozens of rolls. He also now has man boobs, the size of two large melons.  \"You look so much healthier now my dear. I think it's time for dessert.\" The witch once again waves her hands, when all of a sudden a large display of desserts appear, as well as many glasses of milkshakes of different flavours. \"Now, dig in my dear. I want to see you even bigger. Your doing very well.\" In all the eating he does, Hansel doesn't even take notice of his new form of growth. Instead, he presses on with the desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, he starts stuffing some cream buns down his throat. Then he goes on to the fruit tarts, which include peach and apple, with dollops of whipped cream on top. After finishing them off, he goes on with the large bowl of creamy thick chocolate pudding. The chocolate even goes on his clothes. \"Oh, what a messy eater you are. Think it's time for those clothes to come off.\" The witch clicks her fingers, which make the clothes fall off him. Then then reveals a much larger boy than she had imagined. His blobby large form now plainly more visible. He has so many belly rolls that they are hiding his private parts. \"Wow, your even bigger than I had imagined. I think you'll be ready after you finish dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the chocolate, he goes forward to the last remaining bowls of ice cream. He swallows scoop after scoop, the creamy frozen dessert adding to the pounds. After going through all 12 bowls, he finally loses the will of moving his limbs. His arms to heavy to be lifted. \"Oh my, seems like you can't move my dear. Never mind, all you have left is these milkshakes. Here, I'll help you.\" The witch then places a funnel into Hansel's mouth and starts to pour the milkshake down. He swallows them down, his throat bulging as it goes down. After 10 mins, he finishes the drinks and is now 500lbs larger than when he got here. \"Wow, you have grown well my dear. Let me have a look at you though.\" The witch then squeezes his butt cheeks. \"Mmm, like two large jellos, nice and wobbly.\" She then places a tape measure around his tummy. \"Wow, 58, I'm impressed. All that work paid off. Your even bigger than your sister. Time for the final test.\" She then starts pulling at his belly rolls, working her way down them. \"Wow, 12 rolls, a new record. I think you'll be the best meal I've had yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a *ding* comes from the kitchen. \"Wow, that time already. Let's see how it turned out. But first, what to do with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She places them on her hands before opening the oven door, the smell of cherry hitting her directly in the face. \"Mmmm, you smell so good my dear.\" She then takes the massive pie tray out of the oven, placing it on a worktop nearby.

She empties the content of the pie dish onto the plate, the pie landing square on the plate. \"Wow, now that's what I call a pie that I can dig my teeth into.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then heads into the fridge and grabs a pot of clotted cream and spoon, dolloping the cream on top of the pie.

She then lands on page 56 and decides to go with that recipe.</span></div></div>",

Well for thati wont butcher you.\" The witch slid an apple into his mouth and began to slice off his clothes, difficult work considering how fat he had gotten. When he was \"cleaned\" she basted him with a spicy sauce, one that made the boy itch slightly as she coated him. Using her magic she meanwhile prepared a huge pan with potatoes, carrots, and onions, a knife levitated by magic doing the work expertly. Soon he had little paper frills on his hands and feet as was bound up to look like a roasting pig, easily done given his massive girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed the end was upon poor Hansel as the oven opened...</span></div></div>",

And now that she was asleep, he was free to do anything he wanted as long he didn't try to leave her house and garden. So, when she left him in the kitchen, preparing another more food for the almost ceaseless banquet, he was careful to seem subservient and unobtrusive. When he was quite sure that she would have fallen into a deep sleep, he opened the drawer for the kitchen tools. He drew out the iron knife with the really long blade. Then he crept very quietly into the witch's room. And then he slit open her belly, killing her.

Gretal was just very relieved that her heroic brother, Hansel, had slain the witch. When they found out that they could not leave, they felt strangely fine with that, which Hansel thought might be part of the spell. It would make you feel okay about staying here and fattening up. Hansel had found all the witch's magic spellbooks and her enchanted wand.

Of course Laura was going to ask too many questions, making it hard to keep up the ruse, at least long enough to keep Gretel alive. He had to think fast. \u201cUh, well,\u201d he began, \u201cit\u2019s actually kind of about the first Thanksgiving, at least my take on it. The wit- I mean my aunt plays a pilgrim farmer raising livestock, and I play a Native American who brings her a turkey, played by you, as a gift for a harvest feast. The farmer is pretty satisfied with their pig, played by my sister, and she would rather eat her instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I thought your aunt said we were both turkeys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe gets confused sometimes,\u201d Hansel said, really committing to this lie. \u201cAnyway, the pig doesn\u2019t want to get eaten, so they trick the turkey into getting fatter so that the farmer will want to eat the turkey instead of the pig. And uh, that\u2019s why we eat turkey on Thanksgiving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow,\u201d Laura said, not seeing the irony of it all, \u201cthat sound\u2019s great. A little dark twist; I like it. So then, what do I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel shoved a seven-layer, chocolate cake in front of her.  Anything to get her to stop asking questions. \u201cLess talking, more eating,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch was on her way out from the kitchen with two small mountains of pasta, after hearing Hansel\u2019s encouragement.  Hmm, she thought, that boy could be a good warlock if she could just convince him to\u2026no.  She had gotten her fair share of blessings this year.  She already got a two-for-one with Hansel and Gretel, and pre-fattened ones like Laura were not going to just come banging on her door anytime soon. Laura was licking the chocolate off her fingers when the witch came over with the bowls.  She still had one question. \u201cSo, who are we performing this for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel gave the witch a smug little smile. \u201cYou field this one,\u201d he seemed to say silently to her. \u201cIt was your brilliant plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch waved him off. She had already thought of it. \u201cI\u2019m having a group of girls from my coven\u2026I mean bridge club who love to watch the show every year.\u201d<br>\r\nThat\u2019s right, the best lies have a single grain of truth in them. Her coven enjoyed nothing more than a good stuffing party. \u201cThis has been so good,\u201d Laura said, rubbing her full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can tell,\u201d the witch said nodding and joining Laura in rubbing her stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make a nice, sleek, fat turkey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura giggled, and tried to pull her shirt down over her distended middle, but it was no use. The edge barely grazed her cavernous belly button. The witch turned on Gretel. Gretel had been using her new found freedom as a free pass. \u201cLook at you,\u201d the witch scolded. \u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten nearly enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m so-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t give me that!\u201d the witch snapped, but softened when she noticed Laura was watching. \u201cI mean, your dear, old auntie has gone to the trouble of cooking this meal, slaving over a hot stove, and you\u2019ve hardly made a dent. Do you not like it? Do you not love me? I only want you healthy and happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh please, Gretel groaned to herself. She had not made a dent because the witch kept plying them with more. But she had to keep up the act if she was going to live past Thanksgiving. Laura seemed to join in on the guilt trip. \u201cWell I think it\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she said, \u201cand you should treat your aunt with more respect. She only wants to see you go to bed with a full tummy. I would only wish I had an aunt this nice, and who cooked so much for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you sweet,\u201d the witch cooed, tickling her belly, \u201cand such a good little eater, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed again as the witch tickled her, making every inch of her jiggle. The sudden movement of her laughing gut, however, caused the button on her skirt to finally burst. Hansel and Gretel had to both duck to avoid the shrapnel. Laura\u2019s globular gut began to ooze out of the busted seam. She blushed a little, but then said, \u201cWell, that gave me a craving for seconds,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore like fourth\u2019s,\u201d the witch teased, \u201cbut I can imagine. You have more room in your belly without those constricting clothes. Honestly, did your mother not know that you were still a growing girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura only laughed again and began to eat like a mad woman once more. This was too easy, the witch thought. She just needed to get this one on a good pacing to eat throughout the day, rather than eating herself nearly sick three meals a day. All Hansel and Gretel could think was, \u201cPoor, dumb turkey.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, the witch had taken her and Gretel\u2019s measurements a week before the play so as to have time to make them. It was almost guaranteed that their proportions would have changed by then. The buttons on the front were barely clasped together, and her larger stomach created wide gaps in the fabric between buttons. They did not look like they could hold much longer. Her breasts were starting to spill out of the front as well and there were already several runs in her stockings where they had tried to stretch over her meaty thighs. The only thing that seemed to be contained in the costume was her round buttocks, but even that was a struggle as there was quite a gap between the fabric near her upper thigh and her stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel was not much better, but at least she was not nearly as large as Laura. When Laura first arrived, she was only a tad heavier than Gretel, but after two solid weeks of fattening, where Laura easily outmatched her in eating, the difference could be easily seen. Laura had practically eclipsed Gretel, and given how long Gretel had been fattened, that was saying something. Gretel\u2019s pig costume hit a little too close to home for her. She had practically been crammed into the suit only an hour before.<br>\r\nThe members of the witch\u2019s coven had started to arrive, and both Hansel and Gretel had a shiver run up their spine seeing all these women, who looked ready to devour them all on the spot. Laura was just as oblivious as ever, and rather enjoyed all the attention these women gave her. \u201cOh, aren\u2019t you just the cutest, fattest turkey?\u201d one cooed, and began poking her belly. \u201cJust look at that! She\u2019s nothing but an adorable little ball of fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but look at these tender thighs,\u201d said another. \u201cI could just eat you up right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThighs nothing,\u201d snorted another. \u201cThese juicy breasts are where it\u2019s at. Best part of the meal I say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne had come up behind her. \u201cThen you haven\u2019t seen her nice, round bottom. Simply delicious looking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oldest of them was pinching Laura\u2019s cheeks. \u201cBut these chubby little cheeks are the sweetest part, and hers are just ripe for the picking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch (the main witch that is) swatted them all away with her wooden spoon. \u201cNow, now, enough of that,\u201d she said, but then dropping to a whisper. \u201cThis one\u2019s mine. You\u2019re just here to help stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the witches had taken notice of Hansel and Gretel. \u201cWell, what a fine looking pig,\u201d one said to Gretel. \u201cYou watch out, or you\u2019ll be Christmas ham.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d said the witch with a cackle. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fat and ready by then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel swallowed hard. No chance of another fat idiot knocking on the witch\u2019s door by then perhaps? A couple had taken to looking at Hansel. In those two weeks, the witch had kept her promise and Hansel got to eat some nicer food, and it was starting to show. He was looking a little plumper himself, though nowhere near Gretel and Laura\u2019s size. \u201cHmm, where\u2019d you get the runt?\u201d the oldest asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t honestly expect me to believe that you\u2019ll have this one ready by next Halloween for our annual feast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh,\u201d the witch said, \u201cthat was supposed to be a surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witches all sat before the stage/kitchen, ready to watch this little song and dance. Hansel had proven to be a decent playwright and came up with a relatively interesting story. \u201cAfter the Indians had helped the pilgrims that first winter, they were very generous to their English neighbors. It was nearing the next harvest season, and the pilgrims had invited the Indians to a feast to celebrate their survival in the New World. The Indians wanted to be good guests and brought a gift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch actually committed to her part very well. She pretended to be farming as Hansel approached with Laura. \u201cGreetings Englishwoman,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile our feast is several weeks away, I have brought you a gift to prepare for our coming celebration. This is a wild turkey, a proud and meaty creature. Perhaps we shall serve her for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank you, kind Indian,\u201d the witch said. \u201cIt is lovely, but not as fat and delicious as my hog here. I will save this turkey and fatten it up for the next harvest. Here, let me put it in the pen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel and the witch left the \u201cstage.\u201d Gretel rolled her eyes but went into her part. \u201cOh no, that farmer will kill me and eat me for sure by feast day. Curse my good eating this year. Hmm, but that turkey\u2019s not too far off from me. Perhaps, I can convince the farmer that a turkey looks better for a feast. Oh, miss turkey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Laura said, \u201cOh, hello miss pig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see we have a new animal here on the farm,\u201d Gretel said, waggling her eyebrows as she formed her plot. \u201cWelcome, welcome. Oh, but you are beautiful with your colorful tail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy thank you,\u201d Laura said, proudly strutting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel continued, \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful alright, but not beautiful enough to be the farmer\u2019s favorite. I\u2019m more loved than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Laura, acting surprised, \u201cand why\u2019s that? You\u2019re nothing special.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel felt a twinge of embarrassment as she came to this next line. Did Hansel really have to write it so true to life? \u201cBecause I\u2019m fatter,\u201d she said, \u201cand the fattest is always the farmer\u2019s favorite. Just look at these legs, so plump and wide. Just look at these hips, more tender and soft than yours. And have you seen a belly quite like this? I think not. Just look at you, all skin and bones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witches snickered at the humor of the scene. \u201cOh really?\u201d Laura huffed, pretending to be jealous. \u201cI bet I would easily be the farmer\u2019s favorite within the month. You\u2019re not the only one who can get fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWithin the month, ha!\u201d Gretel laughed. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you do it within the next couple of weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch had set out a few \u201cprops\u201d for Laura to snack on as she tried to get fatter than the pig. Though, the witch had warned her not to eat too much, and to save room for the grand finale. In the next scene the witch was looking over her livestock. \u201cWell, don\u2019t that beat all?\u201d she said, following her lines. \u201cThe Indian was right. This turkey does look good enough to eat. Much fatter and juicier than that old pig. I guess that settles it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was excited now, because it was getting closer to the final act. They took a short intermission, just long enough to squeeze Laura into her cooked turkey costume. They opened the scene with Laura lying belly up on a cooking platter, the seams looking ready to burst on her costume. Her legs and hands were tied, as the witch had told her it was only part of the show. The witch was still playing the part of the farmer. \u201cWhew, this turkey sure is going to take a long time to prepare. Hmm, but just by itself, it might seem a little bland. I know, I\u2019ll fill it full of this bread stuffing. Oh, but I\u2019ll need help from all my pilgrim friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witches were eager to get in on the action. The witch had made her famous bread stuffing, made from the same sweet bread that made up the walls of her home. She had found it made an excellent stuffing. Hansel and Gretel stood back and watched as each of the witches took turns shoving spoonful after spoonful of the stuffing into Laura\u2019s wide mouth. They felt sorry for her, but glad it was not Gretel being prepared in such a horrible way. While one witch would be feeding her, the others would rub, pinch, poke, prod, and grab at Laura\u2019s fat mass. At one point, they cheered when the zipper finally burst on Laura\u2019s costume, and her belly came spilling out of the tears. \u201cHere, let\u2019s get you out of that now that it broke,\u201d the witch said, knowing all too well that the costume would not work well in the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura only continued to eat, not having a clue or a care in the world. She rather liked all their kindness and the attention she was getting. But she was starting to feel quite heavy as more and more bread stuffing was shoved in her mouth. It took a while, but they finally got her to a point where she could no longer swallow another bite. She was stuffed to the gills, her belly quivering painfully from the gorging. The witch glared at Laura, and only now did the poor girl realize that something was amiss. \u201cTime for the cooking,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was always the witch\u2019s favorite part. Stuffing her next \u201cturkey\u201d always made her giddy. Hmm, but she wanted to make sure it would be an enjoyable session. She gave Laura\u2019s belly another sharp poke. Just as the girl had said, she was pretty close to stuffed already. This would never do.  She wanted to savor the moment. Plus, there were a couple of days until Thanksgiving, she reasoned. No point in getting too ahead of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her fingers run up and down Laura\u2019s stomach, making the poor thing quiver with fear. Yes, that was what always made it so fun; the fear in their eyes. \u201cGuess what, my little butterball?\u201d she said, still pinching and prodding the girl\u2019s midsection. \u201cThis is your lucky day. I\u2019ll let you live another twenty-four hours. By then, your stomach should be pretty empty, all the better to stuff you until you burst.\u201d She traced a finger roughly around Laura\u2019s belly button, making her whimper. \u201cThat means, no more food until tomorrow. Now, come with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill bound at the wrists, the witch had to help the girl up and forced her to waddle to another cage, right next to Gretel\u2019s. Gretel had been in the middle of her own, latest stuffing session. She looked up from her pile of pastries to see the newest addition locked up, and felt a lot of pity for the frightened looking girl, who was only a little older, though certainly quite fatter than her. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d Hansel asked, as his only job had been to feed Gretel. He had not known about their new \u201cguest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of your business!\u201d the witch snapped. \u201cYou just keep feeding Gretel, understand? And don\u2019t give anything \u2013 I mean a single scrap \u2013 of food to that one.\u201d She pointed at Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel and Gretel exchanged a confused look.  This seemed so off for the witch who could not get enough fat.  The witch sighed, hating to answer questions, but knowing she was getting nowhere.  \u201cLook, Gretel lucks out, for now.  I\u2019ve decided to eat this butterball for Thanksgiving instead of you.  But don\u2019t let that give you any ideas.  I\u2019ll probably make you my Christmas ham.  Anyway, I need her ready for stuffing tomorrow, so don\u2019t feed her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel willingly obliged.  He was already tired of having to cook for his sister, let alone another mouth.  Gretel only thanked her lucky stars that she was off the menu for now, though she did feel sorry for Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the same time tomorrow, the witch had quite a giddy spring in her step as she came downstairs.  She hardly noticed Gretel digging into her breakfast and went straight to Laura\u2019s cage.  \u201cWell, well, my little butterball,\u201d she said, \u201ctoday\u2019s the big day.  Got to get you ready now.  After all, it\u2019ll take you a while to get you cooked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura only began to cry louder.  \u201cOh, we\u2019ll have none of that,\u201d said the witch.  \u201cThe more you cooperate, the more pleasant this will be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dragged Laura out of her cage and led her out of the room.  She took her to the comfy sitting room, which was now empty except for a large, plush chair, a scale, and several carts laden with bars upon bars of fudge.  \u201cFirst, let\u2019s see how much you weigh, dear,\u201d the witch said, nudging her over to the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura could not see past her belly, but she could hear the fast little clicking of the wheel spinning, and began to weep again.  \u201c350,\u201d the witch read, \u201cor pretty close to it anyway.  And that\u2019s only after a few days of eating here.  You must\u2019ve been pretty hefty to start with.\u201d  She gave Laura\u2019s belly a pat, and started poking, pinching, grabbing, and kneading every inch of her, telling her how delicious she would be. \u201cNow, sit down here. You said you liked fudge, hmm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized the irony of the situation, as it had been fudge bars she was selling when she first came to this house of horrors. The witch shoved her into the large chair and bound her wrists to the armrests. The witch grabbed the first fudge bar. \u201cNow open up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura refused. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to do this the hard way,\u201d the witch said. \u201cNow open.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reluctantly obeyed to afraid of the \u201chard way.\u201d At first, it was a wave of pleasure. The fudge tasted so rich and creamy, and thick, oh so thick. It was like a brick hitting her stomach, and she looked on with fear, knowing that this was not a day of pleasure. Over the years of her own overeating and the feedings she had had here over the past few days, Laura and the witch discovered it was going to take a lot of fudge to get her stuffed to her breaking point. The witch was not worried, as she had all day, and magic on her side. She continued to taunt and tease Laura as she forced more fudge down her throat.  There were a few times where she hardly gave her time to chew before she shoved the next one in. By about the third cart she had downed, Laura was starting to feel the strain. She saw her belly bulged out, at least twice the size it was this morning if not three times larger. Her toes practically curled with each painful swallow. \u201cPlease stop,\u201d Laura begged, \u201cI have to be stuffed by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch jabbed her finger roughly into her belly.  \u201cOh, not quite,\u201d the witch cackled. \u201cThere\u2019s still some give in there. Now keep eating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took another cart and a half, but Laura finally reached a point where she could no longer stand it. She was on the verge of throwing up. The witch agreed, finding that her finger could no longer push even the smallest divot in her swollen middle. \u201cAlright, my little butterball,\u201d the witch said, quite satisfied. It had taken several hours, much to her enjoyment. \u201cOr I should say, my big butterball, up you go. Time to get you in the oven.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura began to sob again, though this time there were a few belches in between. She was also pinned down by her own weight and could not move.The witch forced her to her feet, binding her wrists with magic again and began leading her to the kitchen. Oh what a sight to watch that turkey barely able to walk, she thought, admiring the view from behind. This one will roast nicely.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The food was delicious too.  Everything ranging from prime cuts of meat, to 12\" lard-like cheese cakes.  Gretel didn't argue with it either.  She had never eaten like this.<br>\r\n     It was starting to show, however.  A rip had begun to form on the side of her worn-out dress, exposing a layer of fat.  Her face was beginning to fill-out, too.  The witch just grinned with the thought of what Gretel would look and taste like later on.<br>\r\n     \"I'm full, I think I'm going to take a nap,\" Gretel said as she laid down.<br>\r\n     \"What's wrong, Hansel?\" The witch asked, pretending to be concerned.<br>\r\n     \"I'm exhausted and I'm hungry,\" Hansel replied.<br>\r\n     \"Well, have something to eat!\" The witch replied.<br>\r\n     Hansel thought about it for a second and then without another moment of hesitation, he dug into the remaining food.<br>\r\n     The witch walked up behind Hansel and said,\" and I shall have something to eat.\"<br>\r\nShe picked up the small boy, who was covered in icing and, with one gulp, swallowed him,\" Not the best tasting meal I've had, but he'll tide me over.\"<br>\r\n     Gretel woke up with hunger in her eyes two hours later, and immediately asked,\"Where's Hansel?\"<br>\r\n     \"I sent him to my room down the hall.

Her cheeks were so plump, they were forcing her to squint to see.  Her arms had gotten so fat, it was getting hard to lift food to her mouth.  The witch had taken care of that problem by making the food float to her mouth.  This had also allowed Gretel to burn less calories.  Her belly had long since torn her dress to shreds and all that remained were her pansies and bra.  Her belly spread out to her dimpled knees, multiple rolls taking shape at her sides.  Her ass was spreading out a foot in every direction and lifting her off the ground.  Her calves had formed rolls at her ankles and her feet were so fat, it was hard for her to move her toes.  <br>\r\n     Two days ago, the witch had placed a scale in the cage under Gretel that could withstand up to two-tons of pressure.  Gretel had officially reached 631 pounds, but that didn't seem to be enough for the witch.  She wanted the scale to break before she had her meal.<br>\r\n     Gretel hardly slept and seemed to actually become accustomed to the idea of getting eaten after she passed 300 pounds because she didn't want to go on living this fat and she knew she wasn't going to be able to work it off.  This just seemed to fuel her hunger.<br>\r\n     \"Yes, that's right...eat of my fat little truffle,\" the witch said with a grin,\" The fatter you get the more I like you.\"<br>\r\n     \"I'm trying,\" Gretel said in a muffled voice.</span></div></div>",

Eventually, she would lose her grip on conciousness and fall into a food induced slumber, only to awake hungrier than before. The dial of the scale spun in slow motion, the numbers climbing higher and higher as Gretel fleshed out even more, but something began to feel out of place to the witch. It was certainly her tradition to fatten lost children and then gobble them up, but this new morsel, this darling little girl... Try as she might, the witch was becoming attached to her new victim, the role of victim developing into something more akin to the role of a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         The scale had caught up to and just as quickly passed half a ton, and large as the cage was, Gretel was becoming increasingly cramped within the confines of those bars. They would be cold, if not for the warmth of her smooth flesh constantly pressed against them. Her warm flab began to squeeze out sligjtly from it's prison, stacking higher now that room had become scace. Her wide rump easily stretched to either side of the cage, as did her love handles, thick as tires and deep enough to lose a hand in. Her hands had become almost too plump to move by that point, just barely able to wiggle her fingers. Even then, the supple flesh of her arms was much to weighty for her to even lift, elbows burried completly in encroching pudge. Also burried were her thick legs; tree trunk thighs hidden by an immense, albeit often stuffed gut. Plump lips offered passage to all the conjured morsels the witch could think of, the likes of which crammed into her already hefty cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        It had become more common for the witch to rub and knead all that doughy corpulence, but it was on this day, after giving Gretel's billowing rear a playful pinch, that she cleared her throat obviously enough to get the massive girl's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I said alot of things about eating you, and I did swallow up your brother, but I've been thinking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough shocked by the sudden admission to the fate of Hansel, she was willing to pay her captor heed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just too cute to stuff into an oven, you know? I think I'm just going to let it slide this time and keep you here, as my fat little pet. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...\" So lazy and out of shape was she by this point that she had to catch her breath before speaking. \"You're not... going to... eat me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch nodded, smiling affectionately at the little blob, or as affectionately as a witch could display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not all piss and vinegar, you know. I used to live in the same village as you, though long before you were born. But... They exiled me... Anyway, I bet you would like out of that cage, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the cage simply vanished, setting off waves of motion through the girl's great bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, still hungry?\"</span></div></div>",

'Bust' is what it read.  She turned to Gretel and sized her up.  <br>\r\nGretel was looking like food had done her good.  Obviously over a ton, Gretel's body rolled together. The fat on her face was keeping her eye's shut so she had to work to keep her eye's open.  Her double chin had turned into just another roll of fat and covered her neck and melted into her chest.  Her belly had completely covered her fat feet and was actually pushing against the cage bars.  Her belly was pushing out a few inches passed the spaces in between the bars.  This is how the witch was checking on how soft she was becoming.  Her fat arms were lost in her infinitely expanding side rolls.  Ever inch of her body jiggled with each small breath and rippled vigorously when she tried to adjust herself.<br>\r\nThe witch made the cage disappear and let Gretel fall two feet to the ground.

She teleported outside, also, but at a much different size.  She was fifty feet tall and dressed in a stretch suit.  She bent over and scooped up Gretel, licking her lips at the sight of her large, tasty meal.<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to become my meal?\" The witch asked, not caring if Gretel was actually ready.<br>\r\n\"I'm ready.  It was fun while it lasted,\" Gretel responded.<br>\r\nWith that said, the witch lifted her to her mouth and dropped her inside.  She began sucking on Gretel's fat belly, savoring the taste.  After about ten minutes of this, she swallowed Gretel and felt the fat ball of flesh hit the bottom of her stomach.  She teleported back inside and shrank to twenty feet.  Her belly was so HUGE, she had to sit down on the floor and wait to digest her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 hours later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel was completely digested and had become MAAANNNY layers of fat on the witch.<br>\r\n\"I can't wait til my next meal,\" the witch said as she played with her exposed belly fat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>HARD BY a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife: \"What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?\" \"I'11 tell you what, husband,\" answered the woman, \"early to-morrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them.\" \"No, wife,\" said the man, \"I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest--the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.\" \"0, you fool!\" said she, \"then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our coffins,\" and she left him no peace until he consented. \"But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,\" said the man.<br>\r\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel: \"Now all is over with us.\" \"Be quiet, Gretel,\" said Hansel, \"do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way to help us.\" And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel: \"Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,\" and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying: \"Get up, you sluggards! We are going into the forest to fetch wood.\" She gave each a little piece of bread, and said: \"There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.\" Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said: \"Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.\" \"Ah, father,\" said Hansel, \"I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me.\" The wife said: \"Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.\" Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: \"Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.\" Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said: \"Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said: \"How are we to get out of the forest now?\" But Hansel comforted her and said: \"Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.\" And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: \"You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest--we thought you were never coming back at all!\" The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father: \"Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!\" The man's heart was heavy, and he thought: \"It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children.\" The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said: \"Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. \"Hansel, why do you stop and look round \" said the father, \"go on.\" \"I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me,\" answered Hansel. \"Fool!\" said the woman, \"that is not Your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.\" Hansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said: \"Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\" When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: \"Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.\" When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel said to Gretel: \"We shall soon find the way,\" but they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father's house. They began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. \"We will set to work on that,\" said Hansel, \"and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.\" Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the parlor: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nibble, nibble, gnaw,<br>\r\nWho is nibbling at my little house?\" <br>\r\nThe children answered: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wind, the wind,<br>\r\nThe heaven-born wind,\" <br>\r\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: \"Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here Do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you.\" She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then the Witch entered the room. \"I hope you like sleeping here, you where so famished and sleepy that i placed you in bed, after such a long journey i believe you should rest up for a while and enjoy the meals.\" Gretel was really thankful and said so with her mouth still full of the pie.<br>\r\nHansel also said his thanks but was a little bit more suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the witch told them that she needed to get some ingredients for dinner and left them there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day went on with a full table and a lot of napping from Gretel. Hansel on the other hand was more cautious in a way until after a few days.    </span></div></div>",

All this time Gretel was eating and napping and did't move except chewing her food She got very lazy and lay in bed all day long. If she need to be honest it felt good.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen she lived her her father and mother she need to do all kinds of chores like cleaning the house, doing the dishes, do the laundry. Not only she, of course Hansel also needed to do chores or help her. It was always fun doing laundry in the summer. They both end up just as soaked as the laundry. But back then it was't so bad. They knew they need to do chores to help their parents. Their parents always were nice too them and helped them and they also got free time too play and sometimes they even played with them, and after dinner when they got together by the fire place where a big fire was burning and their father told stories. until their mother died and their father married that horrible woman that became their stepmother.<br>\r\nFrom that day the chores became terrible. They need to do more and work harder while she did't moved an inch. Even while they worked she was still screaming at them. This way the chores were much more terrible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she enjoyed doing nothing all the time, and getting all the food she asked for. Growing fatter each day. Whit lying in bed all the time and the food flying towards her mouth she burned almost no calories at all. This increased her weight gain a lot. <br>\r\nShe had become a huge blob. She had a huge belly that formed nice in two rolls and two huge boobs that rested on top of it. Her arms were pillows that swallowed up her under arms with plump hands. Her butt looked like two huge beach balls And her thighs were as big as tires and had rolls of their own. Slowly her feet were disappearing in her fat rolls. A ring of fat melted her head to her chest and she had pink puffy cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch was enjoying how the girl was growing. Her brother was't growing so well. Sure he gained but still he tried to resist. He also did't want to eat like Gretel and he could still move and he did. This way he burned calories maybe without even knowing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That stupid boy. I hoped two kids would become a nice meal. Oh and that girl will sure be a great meal but why that boy doesn't. I thought girls used to watch their figure. Well this girl sure does't.\" She said an looked at the obese Gretel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sleeping her mouth covered with food and a silly grin on her face. She looked so cute when she sleeping. The witch almost drooled seeing all this delicious fat at the beautiful young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will taste so good you bet she does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She poked and massaged the fat. Gretel was so deep asleep she did't even notice. Not even when the witch slapped her fat it making it jiggle for a few seconds. She smiled seeing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why won't that boy eat just like that girl? He's much too smart. Is obvious who of the two got the brains of the family. Not she. But she got the gluttony of the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel made sounds in here sleep and mumbled: \"Hungry! Want food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry you'll get your food. As soon if you wake up you will eat and eat again and become even fatter and even fatter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel smiled in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right fatty keep on sleeping and eating.\" She chuckled evilly.     </span></div></div>",

Now then, hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two siblings looked at each other, pain and desperation in their eyes. They solemnly nodded, and ate what the witch put in front of them.

Chew on that.\" She laughed menacingly as she skipped out, the two of them too full to really think straight. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While neither had liked the idea, they had reluctantly agreed to the witch's proposal. The witch had them both moved to enormous stalls in her barn to keep them separated or from seeing each other and figuring out who would be on the menu. Hansel and Gretel looked at the gigantic proportions of their stalls, realizing just how fat she intended to make them. Even as big as they were now, they hardly took up a quarter of that space. Like fatling pigs, they had no choice but to just lay there and eat whatever the witch provided them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel, being the oldest, knew it was his responsibility to keep his younger sister safe. While it was a scary situation, he knew what he had to do. He would have to make sure he was the fattest by the time the witch was ready to eat one of them. At least then, he would be protecting his sister, even if it was only for a little while. He ate and ate over the course of the next few weeks, doing everything to eat even more than the day before. Some days, he made himself quite sick to his stomach, and tried to avoid overdoing it, while at the same time trying to make sure he was eating more than his sister. That was hard to figure out, since he could not see her, and he knew that meant he was playing into the witch's hands. So be it, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel, at first, was quite sad, and spent most of her time weeping for their plight. This did not suit for the witch, and she often had to force her to eat. But after a while, Gretel realized her brother must be just as frightened, and he had tried to warn her about just barging in on a house made of food. Heck, he had even been suspicious of the witch's food, while she ate greedily. She felt very guilty and selfish. Perhaps there was a way to do something right for once. Perhaps if she made sure she was the fattest, she could save her brother, at least for however longer the witch intended to keep him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel got back on pace and ate like her life depended on it, which it did, in a way. She would stuff herself until she could take it no more, rub her belly as best she could to ease the pain, and eat some more. She had to save her brother, if it was the last thing she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch laughed to herself. This plan worked even better than she had anticipated. With those two selfless idiots eating themselves fat to save each other, they were growing faster than she could have ever expected. Why didn't she think of this idea sooner? Of course, she would stir the pot occasionally as she checked on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, quite delicious looking indeed,\" the witch would tell Hansel as she poked and prodded him every day, \"but I think Gretel might be even meatier. She is a hungry girl after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, coming along quite nicely,\" she told Gretel once, as she measured around her middle, \"but Hansel may be just a couple inches bigger around. He'll roast nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would taunt them this way for several weeks, all the while getting her fill of pinching, poking, kneading, and grabbing every inch of fat on them. They would be delicious indeed. But, she hated the idea of having to share even one of them with the rest of her coven. Why couldn't she have both of them to herself? She sighed, thinking on it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The witch's thoughts were disrupted by a knock at the door. No, not a knock, she realized, but rather very loud crunching noises. A new catch! The witch rushed to the door, eager to see this new morsel. Maybe she would be able to keep Hansel and Gretel to herself. They were fattening so nicely, and she couldn't bear the thought of giving even one up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened the door, she almost squealed with delight. There was a young girl, munching away at the banister of the stairs, a very, very, fat girl. She had to be pushing 300 if not more, the witch estimated. She was already quite the butterball with a nice, protruding round belly, a fine bulbous rump to go with it, and delicious love-handles the witch desired nothing more than to pinch. She was like a fat, little partridge in shape with adorable round, freckled cheeks to match. Her dark-red hair, spilled in waves down to her back, and her amber eyes closed with pleasure as she took each bite. \"Hm, didn't believe in Heaven before,\" the witch muttered, \"but the world works in mysterious ways. Oh, hello, dear!\" She called out to the girl, who gave a startled jump seeing the old woman, making her body jiggle and quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my goodness. I-I didn't think anyone lived her,\" the girl apologized. \"I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be,\" the witch said, wrapping an arm around her soft, doughy shoulder. \"You poor thing, must be lost, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nodded. \"A little. I was out visiting a friend, and I got all turned around. And then I saw this wonderful house, and well...got a little hungry.\" She blushed with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch shrugged. \"Oh, nothing to worry about. Can't have a little thing like you going hungry now. Come in, come in. You can stay a while, get a nice hot meal, and then be on your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl thought a moment. \"I suppose that would be nice. I hope it's not too much trouble. I'm Anna, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch smiled to herself. This would be too easy. \"Well, glad to have you. Despite the appearances, I don't get too many visitors around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, just all by my lonesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna frowned. \"That's sad. A nice old woman like you shouldn't be treated like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"It's what I get for living this far out in the woods. Alright now dear, you just sit down here, and I'll cook us up something good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna rubbed her belly at the thought of it. \"Well, I am really hungry, even after eating some of your house. Sorry again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch laughed, and gave her a playful, but measuring poke in the belly. \"Not to worry. I like having good little eaters like you to cook for. Now, you just get comfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch was already scheming. This one was already pretty fat to begin with, and with only three more months to go before the big feast, she'd be roast-ready, and the witch could keep her tasty morsels in the pens a little longer, make them fatter, and then really have a feast all to herself. Then again, why settle for just two to herself. This one looked so delicious too. She wondered if she could forget about that stupid feast and keep all her prey to herself. No matter, for now, she had to cook to keep her new fattling happy. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course she was going to keep them all to herself. Screw the rest of her coven if they weren't having as fine luck as she. If they wanted meat, they needed to get off their lazy butts and do something about it. Rome wasn't built in a day, and her candy house sure as hell wasn't either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was the perfect little fatling. She did almost nothing but eat and sleep, and that was the way the witch liked it: fat, dumb, and lazy. She'd hit the trifecta. Never once did the girl suspect anything up, nor did she notice the magic in her food was making her forget that she only intended to stay the night. And it didn't take her long to start catching up to nearly the sizes of Hansel and Gretel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was almost too easy. Anna had just finished polishing off a massive dinner that could've fed five people. As the witch walked in, a button popped off the latest outfit Anna had managed to stuff herself into that day. Looking at the floor, she saw that three or four other buttons had met that same fate. The round, pink ball of fat that was her belly started to spill out between the gaps. \"That was delicious,\" Anna huffed, \"better than the last time. I'm stuffed though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch put on her best fake pout. \"Oh, well, that can't be so,\" she said, setting down several trays. \"Surely you've saved some room for dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the witch had set before her a small mountain of all manner of baked goodies. Anna's eyes seemed to light up at the thought of eating them. The witch had learned early on that baked sweets were the girl's weakness. \"All of that for me?\" she asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch nodded. \"Well, it was, but, as you said...\" She poked Anna in the gut. It was certainly hard as a rock, but there was a little give in there. \"You're stuffed. I suppose I'll just have to throw it all away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>5, 4, 3...</i>, the witch thought to herself. \"Wait,\" Anna said, biting her lip, and rubbing her belly with both hands, \"I suppose I could find some more room. I mean, you did go to the trouble and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch smiled wickedly to herself. \"That's my girl. Now here, let me help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch proceeded to open up the rest of Anna's shirt and helped her rub her belly to give her just a little more room. It was warm, soft, and oh so tender to the touch. She would make an excellent meal. If her fat little stomach wasn't enough, there was certainly plenty of rump roast to go around. And those succulent thighs! The witch could already feel her mouth watering at the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna continued to stuff doughy good after doughy good into her mouth, and the witch knew it would only lead to a doughier her. Mm, just thinking about that well-marbled meat was making it hard for the witch to concentrate. Eventually, Anna polished off the last of the desserts and was now fast asleep, crumbs still on her cheek. The witch sighed contently and brushed them off, patted her belly, and watched this prized pig snooze. Before she left, she checked the back of the chair Anna was sitting in. It was rigged with a scale. 452 it read. Right on schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Anna wasn't the soul consumer of the witch's attention. There were still her other delicious morsels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had already lost their will to fight back, and they ceased to be stupid to her plans, so they had become quite boring, but she was able to find her fun somehow. Hansel stuffed himself like a Christmas goose at every meal she offered. He was desperate to save his sister, and so cared little for what he was eating. Just as well, the witch thought. She didn't really bother to put all that much effort into cooking his food. She just gave him an assortment of mashed, fluffy concoctions to insure a steady growth. By now, he filled up half the size of the stall, and the scale installed in the floor told her he was creeping close to the 500 mark. Oh, he wouldn't have much to worry about. When it came to her own personal meals, she preferred them nearly double that size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fun came in taunting him. \"Hm, certainly getting to be a big boy, Hansel,\" she laughed. \"Had enough yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came up for air from his food. \"No, more!\" he called out, pure hatred in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a menacing gleam in hers. \"Just what I like to hear. At this rate, you'll be bigger than Gretel for sure.\" While she had long abandoned the idea of eating them at the coven feast and decided to wait until they each reached half a ton if not more before harvesting them, she still liked to let them think it was still part of the plan. They would have no idea how much time had passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything to keep her from your clutches!\" Hansel spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" the witch teased. \"And just what did you think would happen after I was done eating you? That I would just suddenly let Gretel go? That someone would magically save her? Has all that food gone to your brain, boy? All you're doing is prolonging the inevitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got real quiet, only absent-mindlessly eating his food. She really did love messing with his head. She nodded to herself, satisfied with her work, and left the fat little ball to continue eating. Gretel, on the other hand, was a different matter. Though she knew her fate, and though she knew what danger she was in, she still couldn't deny how good the food was. She savored every bite. The witch put a lot of time into cooking for her, even moreso than Anna. If Gretel wanted to go out with the culinary experience of a lifetime, then who was the witch to deny a last request?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel was really only a few pounds behind her brother, and the two often bounced back and forth between who was growing the biggest. At the moment, Gretel was having the time of her life eating a massive dish of pasta with truffles. That was no small expense on the witch's part. She had to really work to find those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch walked up to her, running her hands up and down Gretel's luscious curves. \"How are we doing, my dear?\" she asked sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel hadn't been angry, so much as sad and scared. \"I'm almost done with this,\" she said, sighing. \"How's Hansel? Please, just tell me he's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he's coming along good,\" the witch muttered, squeezing Gretel's love-handles. \"Very delicious indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop! I don't want to hear you talking about him like meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch strode around her, kneading her soft fat with every word. \"Darling, that's what he is. That's what you are. It's just the cold realities of life. Now, I bet a nice cheesecake will make you feel better about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch snapped her fingers, and a fresh tray wheeled in with the delectable dessert. Gretel's eyes widened, and she began to eat away her feelings. Oh, this had been a lucky few weeks, she thought.</span></div></div>",

Pain au chocolat, almond croissants, bear claws, petit fours - and again, Anna's mouth was watering, and the goodies were barely on the trolley for more than a few minutes. And as Anna snoozed, the witch observed where all of that succulent fat was settling - the belly copping most of it, with a massive hanging roll, but her back being deeply buried in fat too, and those thighs... and of course her calves, and those incredibly plump toes. Her mouth watered - so much meat, with that much fat - so tender...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked the scale afterward - 760 pounds - she'd consumed 10 pounds of pastries.

She measured her belly - but there was no way of getting it over all that lard. She loaded her up in a crane, so as to put her on the tray for garnishing - and she woke up! \"My bed is far too cold, Aunt!\" - \"Oh, don't worry. It'll be hot enough soon. I've got some more treats for you - some fudge to keep you going!\" And that ripe belly took in another 10 pounds of fudge, and as the oven warmed, she went back off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! 900 pounds - I reckon that's probably about 16 hours of cooking.

At least six other children, four girls and two boys, were also in the room. Wait, was this still the same bedroom they had fallen asleep it? After a moment, they realized this was not the same room. It was much bigger, and had at least ten beds, room for two more kids, and had a massive dining table set in the middle of the room. It was also a very tall room with vaulted ceilings and windows that were very high up, not low enough to see out of, but there to give the room some natural lighting. But Hansel and Gretel took note of the other kids in the room. They were close to their own age and looked like they had just escaped the famine of the village too. The kids were already sat around the large dining table, digging in to a hearty breakfast. There were pancakes, dripping with syrup, several dozens of eggs prepared all sorts of ways, bacon, sausage, and ham, fresh from the pan, toast, and thick, fluffy biscuits dripping with butter.  Hansel and Gretel found that their stomachs were already speaking for them. Only now did the other children notice them, so intent on eating the hearty meal. They gave a cheerful, but short greeting and went back to eating. \u201cWh-who are all of you?\u201d Hansel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch, who to the children still seemed like a dear, old woman, had entered and answered his question. \u201cOh, you\u2019re not the first abandoned children I\u2019ve taken in,\u201d she said, \u201cand it seems this famine is leaving more and more of you without homes. Not to worry. I have plenty, and you are all more than welcome to stay.  I can\u2019t stand the thought of sending you back into that harsh wilderness only to go back to a famine-riddled town.  That\u2019s no place for children.\u201d  She put on her most pitiful face as she punctuated that last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel and Gretel looked at each other, seeming to have a silent conversation.  Eventually, Hansel spoke up.  \u201cIt would be wonderful to stay,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it wouldn\u2019t be too much trouble, would it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she replied, \u201cno trouble at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe would miss our father, though,\u201d Gretel added, \u201cbut going home to more famine is probably not wise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is true,\u201d the witch agreed, \u201cand perhaps we may visit him some day, and bring some of our wonderful bounty to him.  Now, dig in.  Enjoy your first day here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel and Gretel got up and properly made the acquaintance of the other inhabitants. There was William and Jacob, two identical twin brothers who hardly said more than \u201cHave a seat\u201d before stuffing their faces again. Cindy, the eldest of all the children was much more prudent and at least took the time to get to know Hansel and Gretel. She was a sweet girl who could at times be very maternal and protective. Martha was shy, but was at least curious about the new guests, and listened intently as they told their story. Ellie was a selfish sort, who was more concerned that there was not going to be enough food for her with two more mouths to feed. And Suzi hardly said a word. She seemed to be in some sort of eating trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the children continued to eat, the food all so irresistible; too irresistible in fact. They had no idea just how long they had been eating, or that they had easily been helping themselves to fourth and fifth servings. They all attributed that to having had so little in their lives that they were just making up for lost time. However, they were reaching a stopping point, all too painfully stuffed to fit another bite in. The witch was only too kind to help them all up and back into bed, sometimes helping one rub their taut middles as she tucked them in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s right, she thought, just eat and sleep for the first few weeks. The actual work, on her part would begin after they had had a few days to be lulled into a sense of security. For now, they would just be fat, dumb, and happy, just like all the others. She was already thinking about the one in the stalls out in the barn she was going to eat tonight. Oh yes, the witch had a rather effective piggy farm going. Once they reached a certain weight, she kept them in a pig sty in the barn until they were ready to eat. It would take several months to get this bunch to that point, but that was why she was so good at what she did. Timing was everything. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hansel had been the first to notice the change over the past couple of weeks when he could no longer get his shirt to cover his stomach. In fact, as he looked around the room, he noticed that many of the other kids were struggling with tight clothes. The witch had already predicted that this would be the outcome after a couple of weeks, and this was quite the joy to her. Of course, what made her the happiest was all the nice, round potbellies they had all started to develop. No surprise there. They had all been stuffing themselves like Christmas geese, and it was, of course, inevitable that they have the round stomachs to prove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, each had had the rest of the weight spread out differently for them. The twins were practically bowling balls. They were pretty much nothing but belly. Gretel and Suzi were both on their way to a spherical shape. Everything seemed to spread out evenly for them from their thick thighs and bottoms, to their juicy round cheeks. Ellie was more on the top-heavy side, having larger breasts to compliment her belly. Hansel had a very even spread, but he was tallest, and it made him look a little thinner. Cindy was practically all hips, accentuating her maternal figure. She was becoming a real <i>Venus of Willendorf</i> that one. And Martha was a rather perfect pear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch was practically drooling looking at all of them. Another six months of this, and they would all be ready for the barn. She had to maintain composure though. \"Oh, it looks like you need some new clothes,\" she cooed. \"Just as well. You really do need something nicer than those old rags anyway. Come over here, and I'll get you all measured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, they were indeed coming along nicely, she thought as she measured each of them, making sure to \"accidentally\" grab and pinch them a couple of times. Or, most of them anyway. With Ellie's greed, she would be ready much sooner than all the others. She would just \"happen\" to disappear one night. Gretel, Suzi, and the twins were not that hard to get to eat. They were much too dumb to know any better. They would fatten right on schedule. It was Hansel, Cindy, and Martha who would be the trouble. They were older, and therefore more suspicious. They were not eating nearly as much as the rest. It would take a lot of coaxing to get them on the same pacing as the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow would come a lot of the hard parts. She would slowly have to increase the amount they ate every day, making sure they did not notice. She would also have to become a little more forceful as well, getting them to eat well past being full so that their stomachs would stretch properly. That was the only way to make sure they ate enough to get fat enough on schedule. Right now, though, she had quite a bit of time. She had only just harvested that 600 pound hog last night, and the meat would last her for quite some time. She had eaten a small roast last night and stored the rest in her smokehouse, hidden in the back of her yard. Plus, she had four others in the barn to give her a well-stocked larder before then. The hardest part was making sure all of them had at least thirty minutes of walking exercise each day. That helped them support their new weight with a little muscle. It also helped to create that well-marbled meat that practically fell off the bone and was so sweet. After two weeks of nothing but eating and sleeping, they would be a little lethargic, and it would take some convincing. She would start them out today, and lure them with the prospect of a large picnic to get them to walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just finished measuring Gretel, gave her a quick pat on the stomach and told her to go finish breakfast while she got the picnic ready.</span></div></div>",

Then to his belly- oh that belly, so soft and fat and round and huge - like a giant marshmallow.  The witch gets slightly aroused - whereby she encircles Hansel's nipple with her tongue and mouth as he slowly stirs awake.  \"oh oh.....my......where am I?.....I'm so hungry....and......horny\" says Hansel, as a tent builds in his shorts.  \"I have just the fix for your hunger my boy\" as the witch takes out a mesmerizing rack full of baby back ribs which were roasting in the same smokehouse as the very thing she did NOT want him to see.  \"Oh THAT is what is in there - I knew it smelled amazing\" sniffed Hansel.  \"Yes, but you musn't go in there by yourself - one boy did and got accidentally roasted when the door shut on him, so I don't permit children to go in there...you leave that to me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch lays out several racks of ribs, some corn bread lathered in melted butter and gallons of mashed potatoes for Hansel to eat.  \"Dig in deary\" cackles the witch.

The witch quickly grabs trays of racks of ribs, more corn bread and boat loads of garlic mashed potatoes slathered in butter as the girls join Hansel in stuffing their faces like pigs.  \"Oh my.....we have some nice, fat pigs here growing bigger and bigger - this is going to be quite fun\".

And her father the king truly loved his only child and gave her anything she wanted. At her age she liked candy a lot. This way made her become a little chubby princess with a nice jelly belly.<br>\r\nShe kept liking candy and other good stuff in her childhood. So she kept to be chubby but she didn't eat enough to become fat. <br>\r\nShe sometimes dreamed about it. Becoming fat. She wondered how it felled. Eating as much if you want and having a big belly. When she was a kid she was always stuffing her clothes with pillows and blankets so see looked fat. But no one really paid attention to it. They thought it was just a little kids game.<br>\r\nSometimes she was liking the idea to become fat but at the other hand a lot of women tried to become slim. She did't really know which way she wanted to go. Become fat like she sometimes thought about or just like everyone else try to stay slim.<br>\r\nBecause she wasn't sure she stayed in the middle and just became chubby.<br>\r\nWhen she was about ten years old her father found a new wife. His daughter did't seemed to be to happy about her new mother. Bur she decided to give her a chance. <br>\r\nBut she noticed her mother didn't liked her to much. It seemed to her that the only thing her step mother cared about was how she looked. That she was the most beautiful women in the kingdom.  <br>\r\nThe little princess did her best to avoid her step mother. But the little princess kept becoming more beautiful every day.<br>\r\nTo avoid her step mother she spend a lot of time in her room with some candy. Eating candy at her room all the time gave her a lot of extra pounds. at the age of seventeen she was having a nice potbelly and was very beautiful.  <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She is plump\". <br>\r\n\"She might be plump Lady, but still much more beautiful than her highness\".<br>\r\n\"Well Mirror, you said it. She is still more beautiful. I'll make you change your mind\".<br>\r\nThe stepmother knows she cannot physically harm the girl, or she would loose the crown. She needs to think of something.<br>\r\nShe devices a plan. She secretly summons the three ugliest spinsters in the Kingdom, and tells them about the plan.<br>\r\nThe stepmother plan is to make snowwhite obese. To force her to eat and gain weight until the mirror changes his mind.<br>\r\nIn order to do this, arrangements were made. One of the spinsters had a house with a big cellar.<br>\r\nThere, in the cellar, a big reinforced bed was built. The bed was reclinable and had cuffs for her wrists and legs. The bed was connected to a scale.<br>\r\nA big kitchen was built, and lots of food were stored.<br>\r\nThe arrangement was that the spinsters were to be payed in gold for every pound Princess Snowwhite gained. But as the Queen dreaded to be humiliated by the Mirror again, she had decided not to ask him for a new answer until the Princess gained the first 400 lbs., and not to pay the spinsters a coin until the Princess has made that initial gain.<br>\r\nThe Princess would be constantly fed, and would not be allowed to leave the bed until the mirror changed the veredict.<br>\r\nSo, one night, at dinner, the Queen put into Snowwhite food a potent sleeping formula. One she was slept, she was taken from the casttle by the spinsters.<br>\r\nShe woke up hours later in the cellar bed. She noticed she was handcuffed, and three ugly women were standing by the bed looking maliciously at her. <br>\r\n\"Hmmm, our beautiful Princess has woken up. Let's get to work\".<br>\r\nOne of the women reclined the bed to get the scared Princess in a sitting position.<br>\r\nShe began to sob, \"who are you?\"<br>\r\n\"No Princess, you cannot talk. Only obbey. You will only answer questions, and you'll do as we tell you. Or else, will fry you in boiling oil\", and made a gesture towards a cauldron.<br>\r\nHaving said this, a sliding table was pushed toward her breast. A napkin was tied around her neck. Two of the spinsters dissappeared thru a door. The sound of wheels was heard. They reappeared pushing a cart with several cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have not done you no harm!\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that treasure, nothing personal.\"<br>\r\nShe continued to rebel, but did not get meaningful answers, why this was happening to her?<br>\r\nAfter one day to continue to plead and complain, the hags returned the following morning with a tool that unceremoniously inserted in the mouth, this thing was holding open the mouth thus preventing it from talking and facilitating their work to stuff her.</span></div></div>",

Cinderella was still the Heir to her deffunct father's fortune.<br>\r\nSo, the prospect of Cinderella marrying anyone (let alone a Prince), was terryfing for mother and daughters. Besides being humiliating, they would loose the fortune.<br>\r\nStill, the stepmother couldn't help but notice that Cinderella's beauty kept increasing. This was really dangerous. But if anything happenned to the girl, the fortune would go to charities. Urgent measures had to be taken so that Cinderella could be kept alive, single, and under the stepmother's control.<br>\r\nThe stepmother thought about it for days. Nothing ocurred to her.<br>\r\nOne day, a Circus came to town. The stepmother and her daughters attended the show. Among the attractions, there was a fat lady. This was a young woman, that must have weight close to 900 lbs.. Clearly unable to walk, she was taken to the stage in a reinforced chair. There, at the table, she was made to eat lots of food.<br>\r\nWatching the scene, the stepmother had the great idea. Cinderella had to be made as obese as that girl (or maybe more). Then she would remain single, and stepmom would be in control.<br>\r\nAfter the show, she went to the caretaker of the fat lady, to found out details. Some gold coins put the caretaker in a talkative mood. <br>\r\nNo, the girl had no always been fat. She was thin as a rail when she was captured by the circus, and she had been forced to eat her way into her present morbid obesity. It had not been easy at first. The girl had to be made to eat by threats. But after the first 400 lbs she had completely surrendered to fattening.<br>\r\nCould this be done again, with another girl?. Yes, of course.<br>\r\nFor some more gold coins, a deal was struck. The caretaker would remain in town for some months, and give the stepmother and daughters all the advice they needed for the fattening of Cinderella.<br>\r\nAt the end of the process, Cinderella would be at least 900 lbs, and unable to leave her bed by her own means.<br>\r\nThis would be a great change. From being the servant, to being taken care of.<br>\r\nThe caretaker began giving his instructions, while Cinderella was unaware of the plot that had her as victim.<br>\r\nThe stepmother and daughters went several times with the caretaker to see the Fat Lady. The stepmother wanted to make sure she was immobile and could not harm the people around her. She was satisfied with what she saw. They watched the girl eat too. And she was made to tell her experience of being fattened against her will.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the stepmother ordered a basement built in another house she had. The basement included a big kitchen. A big reinforced bed, connected to a scale was placed in the main room. The bed had cuffs for hands and legs, to prevent Cinderella's resistance to fattening.<br>\r\nThe basement has a big elevator to. The stepmother had the idea of having the Fat Lady pay some visits to Cinderella (in her reinforced chair, of course), during the fattening, to show her where things were going, and to help her accept her fate.<br>\r\nSo it was, that one day (well, there was no daylight in the basement), Cinderella woke up in a huge bed, handcuffed, surronded by her stepmother and stepsister, and one strange man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Come on. Push those muffins down her throat. doesn't matter if she don't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderella happy opened her mouth. Since her father died she only got scraps to eat. Now to finally eat fatty and tasty food full of fat and sugar was for her almost like a dream came true. and she enjoyed eating the whole box of muffins. This went on until they were halfway to the box of cupcakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear stepmother, dear stepsister. I'm really full now. you can stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't getting it do you sis? You need to keep eating this. You have no choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she started to push the cupcakes in her stepsisters throat. Cinderella decided to eat them. It would't prevent her tummy hurting from an overstuffed feeling but it was better the getting cupcakes pushed in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good sister you're eating again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up with those cupcakes dear. Or you are not finished before that nice man is done cooking for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word cooking would be sounded great to her if her tummy was't so full<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stepmother i'm really stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad! You will eat! And eat! And eat! Do i make myself clear you stupid, lazy, ungrateful, fat brat!\"        <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderella knew she would be forced too eat so could as well enjoy it. Even when her tummy would feel like it was going to explode. No she suddenly thought of it. She never really felt that feeling. Her greedy sister some times did especially in their childhood while eating pie. Her stepsister tried to get the most of the pie and be sure that their little stepsister would't get any. She many times had hunger pains but the pain from being stuffed would be something completely new.   </span></div></div>",

We do not want to hurt her. She is the Heir, and nothing bad must happen to her, remember?. Our goal is to make her morbidly obese. Our goal, your goal, is to make her weight reach, if possible, over 1000 lbs, but in a gentle way. You need to keep this goal in mind.<br>\r\nI turned a very thin girl into a circus Fat Lady, and this is what we are going to do here.<br>\r\nThe goal is not to cram food crazily in her mouth so that it hurts her and make her cry. No. <br>\r\nThe goal is for you, the stepmother, to be in total control of her and her money, and eliminate any possibility of rebellion from her against you.<br>\r\nWhen we are done here, Cinderella will be too fat to leave that bed. She'll have a massive, huge belly that will prevent all her movements. Her arms will be so massive that she will be able to move mostly her forearms, and with great effort.<br>\r\nThen you'll be in control. You'll sit by her side (as close as the belly allows it), to feed her at will. You'll be able to show her pics of the times when she was thin, and tell her about the things you do, like shopping, dancing, running, walking, that she won't be able too.<br>\r\nBut, to get to that point, you'll have to be both patient and thorough.<br>\r\nShe must be forced to eat a bit more everyday, but not more than that bit. Sleep and eat. Sleep and eat. So that she won't burn any calories, and her stomach will get bigger, little by little, everyday. So that everyday it'll take a bit more of food to fill it. This will have to be made firmly but gently.<br>\r\nWe will calculate how much food she'll have to consume everyday. So that we do not hurt her. But it will not be tolerated that she refuses to eat what was alloted for the day.<br>\r\nSome days this will be funny, and some days this will be boring. But this is the way it has to be done.<br>\r\nThe first months are boring. From rail thin to obese. She will be in denial about her fate. The'll be lots of sobbing and begging. She'll began to miss her days of hard work around the house. She'll talk to each of you individually so that you feel pitty for her and let her go. He will promise to give the whole inheritance to one of you, to put one against the other.<br>\r\nAt a certain weight, when we are sure she cannot hurt us or escape, let's say at 670 lbs, we can take the cuffs of, and allow her short walks around the room, assisted by us and a cane. It'll get more difficult to her everyday. Even though she we'll be ansiously expecting the moment of \"the walk\" the whole day, it'll arrive a day when, after much effort and even with assitance, she'll have to admit she cannot do it, and when she'll have to choose to remain in bed. You, the stepmother, will have to be very clear that the day she decides she cannot take the walk, she will not be allowed another one. It'll be the last one in her life. She'll fight to prolong her chance to walk to the last. I've seen it with my Fat Lady. But as you'll keep feeding her more day after day, and her belly will keep getting bigger and heavier, there will inexorably be a day when she herself, will have to admit she cannot get up from bed.<br>\r\nSo, having said this, let's get to work\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We're gonna feed you. Stuff you full with food every day from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how will that be evil. That sounds more like being nice to someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna fatten you up so much that you won't be able to move anymore. Let's see how you like it then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonk! Bonk! Bonk! Bonk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that what they're up too. fattening me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe her stepsisters came in. One wit a plate of burgers and the other one with a plate with fries covered with mayonnaise and ketchup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open your mouth. I said open it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderella did't really want too but the food smelt so good she could't resist. After the first bite of burger she could't stop herself and was thinking: \"Well i can't escape at this moment anyhow i might as well enjoy it. besides it tastes great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And she happy devoured each burger and also every last fry until the last drop of mayonnaise. however the last fries were really hard to swallow and Her tummy hurt again From the great amount of food she was't used too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all what i need to do here is eat. Well i can't break free. And even if i could i need to get past my stepmother, stepsisters and that guy. I don't think i be able to do it. And at least i get good food now.\"   </span></div></div>",

A bedpan was used instead. The idea was for her not to burn any calories. Besides, her muscles would become feeble, and she'll be less of a threat to stepmother and stepsisters.<br>\r\nShe was being given appetite stimulants with the food. When stepmom was sure she was full, she was put to sleep with sleeping pills.<br>\r\nShe was developing a nice tummy.<br>\r\nSome days, stepmom herself did the feeding \"Hmm, this a nice tummy you are growing. Now, open up, have more cake. Now you are almost as fat as my fat daughter. I've seen your smile when my fat daughter tried to run and couldn't do it, and got breathless. Well, don't worry, in no time she'll be a gazelle compared to you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters arrive: \"how is Cindy doin?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is doing great girls. Just about to finish her fifth cake\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat sister caresses Cindy's belly: \"Hi piggy. You seem to have been eatin' a lot lately. Are you still hungry?\".<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm, but I shouldn't be\".<br>\r\n\"Well sis, that is gluttony. And it is a very good thing in you, cause we are still not finished with today's food\".<br>\r\n\"Yes Cindy -said the stepmom-. I wish I could stop. But we have to stick to the schedule\" (Evil grin).<br>\r\nThe stepmom says to the fat sister: \"Keep feeding her. All the cakes in the cart\".<br>\r\nStepmom and thin sister leave for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat sister sits by Cinderella. Places a new cake on the sliding table. \"Cindy, what a mess. Look at you. Chocolate dripping down your chin\". She sweeps it with a napkin. She takes a spoonfull of cake, and motions the spoon into Cindy's mouth, who obediently opens up.<br>\r\n\"Sister, I'm really tired of eating. Could you stop?\"<br>\r\n\"But you always said you were very hungry\".<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you have been feeding me nonstop for a week. I feel very tired. Mom must be putting some medicine in the food, that makes me feel weak and hungry. I'm full, but still hungry. This is the six chocolate cake in a row. I feel full, but I still crave that cake\".<br>\r\n\"Yes, hmm piggy, have some more\".<br>\r\n\"But I feel the weight in my tummy. I may feel hungry, but I know  this is a lot of food. I have been eating it. This needs to stop.\"<br>\r\n\"Open up piggy, less talk, more cake\".<br>\r\nChomp, chomp, chomp, and spoonfull after spoonfull, Cindy finishes the cake.<br>\r\n\"Ufff. So much food. And it feel so delicious, and I feel so hungry. What is mom giving me?\".<br>\r\n\"I guess it must be the appetite stimulant the man sold her. He used it to turn a waif into a hippo. You might meet her soon. Only she is not too, how to put it, too mobile. She would need some help to come see you\".<br>\r\nThe fat sister places another cake on the sliding table.<br>\r\n\"Open up\". Chomp.<br>\r\n\"Sister, I have always been kind to you. Please, let me go. You know I'm the sole heiress to my father fortune. Let me go and I'll give it all to you. I promise.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm, the whole fortune for myself\".<br>\r\n\"Yes. Mom and your sis hate you. I have always been kind. Let me go\".<br>\r\n\"Open up\". Chomp, chomp.<br>\r\n\"Damn it, why does this cake has to taste this good\".<br>\r\n\"I guess it is mom's medicine\". \"You really should see the other girl\". \"She is 22, and weighs 1050 lbs. But a year ago she was thin, very thin. She took the boyfriend from some Princess. The Princess payed the circus to kidnapp her and turn her into the Fat Lady\". \"Now she is much more quiet and thoughtful than she used to be\". \"You should she her in the reclining iron bed. The glorious mountain of her belly. They really made her eat. They said the original Fat Lady, who always resented being fat, took great pleasure in feeding her. And made sure the girl was aware of all the limitations obesity was imposing on her\".<br>\r\n\"You mean...., that is what mom is planning to do to me??\".<br>\r\n\"Let me go sis, pliz, let me go, I'll pay you\".<br>\r\n\"Open up, piggy\".Chomp. \"So piggy, you somehow have the notion that you were kind to me,eh?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You will become so fat this body will look like an anorexia patient compared too you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How fat do you want too make me?\" Cindy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i want too make you immobile so that would be around 600 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"600 pounds! You can't be serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only to make you immobile Cindy. After those 600 pounds we'll just continue. You will become the fattest girl ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee mom! If Cindy really becomes the fattest girl ever we could ask people for money to see her. Then we'll get even more money!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Not a bad idea.

Do you really think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up. Eat some cake.\" Her stepsister said pushing more cake in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i don't want to be the worlds fattest girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said shut up!\" And her stepsister pushed again more cake in Cindy's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my tummy hurts.\" Cindy finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that serves you right for eating seven cakes in a row. Gluttony is one of the seven sins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was forced to eat them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Details details.\"  Her stepsister said and chuckled evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonk! Bonk! Bonk! Bonk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy knew her stepmother left. Her stepsister suddenly started to punch her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Au! Hee what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Teasing my sister. Besides this way your tummy digest food faster so you're able to eat even more food next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she lay on her back on the floor and hit her sisters belly with a few good kicks. After she was done she took the sleeping pills and a weight gain shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is bedtime shake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she poured the shake in her sisters mouth. Cindy swallowed the shake or else she would choke. After the shake her sister put one of the sleeping pills in her mouth and gave her some water to swallow them and Cindy was in 5 minutes in dreamland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sleep for now fat piggy.

You still have something more than us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" answered Cinderella, glowing with hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE FAT!

Now I'm even a bit fatter than her fat daughter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her wand, the fairy broke the cuffs and Cinderella stood up, awkwardly. It was so hard for her to move with her new hanging gut. Her thighs were rubbing and her soft breasts had lost their previous perkiness. Her lazyness made her body all flabby, without a sign of firness remaining. She wasn't that fat, perhaps 160 lbs, but every pound destroyed harshly her once perfect body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can grant you one wish, what would you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transform me into a beatiful girl, thin as a rail, ready for the bal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granted!

She was so beautiful and graceful, the prince almost ran at her to ask her to danse. She gladly accepted, and the pair headed to the center of the danse floor.

Her thighs were slowly coated with their new layer of blubber, hitting each others, transforming her run into a hurried waddle. Her breasts started to jump heavily as she opened the basement door. With the return of her big soft belly, the dress broke and then disappeared. She realized that she had lost one slipper on the road when the remaining one vanished. The spell ended and she was once again tied to the large bed, nody oozing with fat. She sighed : no one surprised her, but she was sad that she would never see her prince again.</span></div></div>",

Well this is the first time i see you, but i'm sure you have grown a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be my mother's old friend. Well you are eh... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old? I know dear. I have seen more things in my life then most other people. I have seen a lot of fat girls. Some circus fat lady's but some just at street. You're not even near as fat but i was told i need to make sure you would look like that. I know how to fatten up girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt in a pocket of her dress and took out some old pictures. On the pictures were some young girls. At each picture they were fatter. At the last picture they were fat girls that were both too fat too fit in their old clothes and had trouble to fit through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That are my cousins. My sister and her husband went on a trip for a few months and i needed to take care of them. I did a good job at them like you can see. They never were hungry. I can tell you that.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Fine so what are going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first we ad lard too your food. So you will fatten up even more and i have this special weight gain powder for you. This will fatten you up good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her other stepsister came in with more boxes of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all for you. Wow how much can see eat. Can she eat all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see. Stop complaining you know why we are doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thin lips of the spinster curled in a evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lets start fattening you up.\" </span></div></div>",

Much better I think that the thing they were giving you. This is going to make you very hungry, and really addicted to my food. You'll see how I will have to force you to stop eating\".<br>\r\n\"Now I have calculated how much you can eat. Of course, it will increase rapidly, very, as your belly expands. You'll eat non-stop, except when I put you to sleep.\"<br>\r\n\"You are not even 200 lbs, and that is a shame. You are handcuffed to bed because you are young and still agile, and you could escape or attack us. So, my first goal is going to be to take you as fast as I can to a weight of 700 lbs, at which weight you will be a much more reasonable and sweet girl than you are now. You will be a little elephant giving fat kisses and asking for feedings. That is gonna take some time, though. And a lot of eating. You will not be allowed to leave this bed until you weigh some 600 lbs.. Then I might let you walk a little.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, good girl, keep eating. I see you like my chocolate dessert. Good girl. Eat, eat, get fat for me. Make that belly of yours grow for me. Make it heavy for your auntie\".<br>\r\n\"Just to give you encouragement, I brought some DVDs of some heavy duty fattening jobs I had to do. Some very thin and beautiful girls I had to fatten. You know, envy. They were filmed, gaining every pound. You'll see bellies growing, double chins appearing, seams bursting, tears running down their cheeks, and chocolate dripping from their lips. Their shirts, ever increasing in size, from one to the next, just to start giving at the seems some days later. At 600 lbs, you'll see their short walks around the room, with my help and a cane, with great effort, sweating. <br>\r\nSome who tried to escape, only to fail pathetically, and receive special feedings.<br>\r\nMy grin of triumph the day they finally can't leave the bed, even while I really try to help them to, and they collapse crying, covering their faces. I dry their tears, kiss their fat cheeks, put a napkin around their fat necks, and give them a good feeding, slowly caressing their huge bellies, and telling them they are know officially too fat to walk again. And I keep feeding them until they calm down and stop crying.<br>\r\nIn some cases, when they are even heavier, they are put, with the help of some device, in reinforced wheel chairs, and taken to visit some people they knew. Sometimes, people who hated them, and payed for their fattening. And you'll see how they are made fun of, and given special feedings\". <br>\r\n\"It is all in the DVDs, lots of cases. Enjoy, and keep eating\".<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She would be taken from us. We would loose her fortune. And when Cindy tells the Prince what was going on in here, we will probably end in a dungeon being fed to immobility.<br>\r\nWhile the stepmom talked, the Spinster kept feeding Cindy nonstop, patting her belly, and telling her \"good girl\". \"Just eat, keep eating. I'll put you to sleep with pills when I'm done. And I'll wake you up for your next feeding\".<br>\r\nNow -the stepmom said-, if when the Prince comes to this house, and when he finds this basement, he finds in here a morbidly obese woman, of over 1000 lbs., with her massive belly occupying all the width of her reinforced fat bed, he will certainly not think she is the mystery girl.<br>\r\nThe Spinster feeding Cindy, was listening to it too. \"Yes, in some months I can take her to 1000 lbs.. My little piggy, hmm -she kisses her cheek-. She is a beauty. I'll bury her in fat. I'll be severe with this beauty. No leaving the bed at all until the dial says 700 lbs.. Then some short walks to test her remaining mobility. And more food\". \"And you eating beauty, no talking, no nothing. Just eating. When I decide you can stop, I'll put you to sleep. I don't talk much with slender girls. In a while, when you are obese, we will have lots to talk about.\"<br>\r\nCindy keeps eating. The food is wonderful. Every spoonful is better. She detests this awful woman with her evil grin, but she wants the spoon to keep coming. It tastes so damn good. Something very deep in her brain wants the woman to fill her with food. She has heard all the conversation. She tries to think. The craving for food and the patting in her belly does not leave much space for reflection. And when the Spinster decides she is full, she'll put her to sleep. She is here, in bed, in a basement, handcuffed and being feed. And this awful people surrounding her only plan to stop, when she is a helpless mass of fat, totally dependent on them. She has a sudden thought: she must escape, she must think of a way of escaping, of fleeing them, while she can still walk. It clearly looks impossible. But she must think of something.

Then she would only gain if she wanted too. But it did't seem like if there was a way to escape. <br>\r\nShe was handcuffed and could't notice were the key was since they never needed the key. She would only knew were the key was if she was so fat she could hardly walk. That was no option. Unless if someone would tell her were the key was. Maybe her stepsisters. They were't that smart. They even did't knew how much 1 + 1 was. But at the other hand her stepmother was't that stupid and was maybe smart enough to not tell her daughters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i can ask them. I can't think of any better idea. If i want to escape i need to do that as long if i can still walk and for that i first need to get this handcuffs off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled at them what of course did't had any effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, heh.

Her now DD cup breasts hung left and right of her body. They also had taken some of the weight. Her belly had taken most of the weight. It was big and round and started to spill to the sides. She could't even see her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh girl i don't know what's wrong with you. I think you look nice so beautiful fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think fat is beautiful?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think. I know. Remember Rubens he painted fat women because they were beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. Start to live in this century! That guy died hundreds of years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But his paintings are still famous. It's such a shame that they only like the paintings and not the girls who look like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this century people like thin girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my fat piggy. You may think that but that's not true. There are people who like fat girls. How fatter how better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the prince one of them?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Good question. I don't know. If he does then we should maybe make you thin. That's not my problem. I'm only here to fatten you up. If the prince like fat girls then your stepmother and sisters have a problem not me. I just enjoy it to make you fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stepsisters came with a cart full of fries and two buckets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is in the buckets?\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"100% pure lard. I'll gonna fatten you up real good. After the fries you eat the lard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fries were delicious but the lard was horrible. The spinster slowly poured the stuff in her mouth. It was sticky and tasteless. After the horrible lard was all in her stomach she looked at her huge belly. She kissed her thin body good bye and feared that she would never be thin again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The dial in front of the bed now read 510 lbs..<br>\r\nCindy had entered the land of obesity. <br>\r\nWhere her belly used to be,there now was a big warm mass of flesh, weighing heavily on the mattress.<br>\r\nWhen awake, she wore a napkin around her neck, and was constantly spoonfed by the spinster. Her thighs had grown huge. Her arms were round and soft. <br>\r\nCinderella was hooked to the Spinster's food and feedings. While aware of what was going on, something deep inside her wanted this awful woman to cram her with food. <br>\r\nWhen she was not thinking of food, and this was becoming rare, she still thought of a way of escaping. She assessed running was well in his past, but she thought she still could walk. But she probably could not fight if The Spinster and Stepmom tried to stop her from escaping.<br>\r\nThe Spinster and her sisters kept changing her shirts, cause she kept outgrowing them. The one she was wearing now, with white and red vertical stripes, had looked as a tent two weeks ago, when they had put it on her. Now it was bursting at the seams. The big mass of her belly putting buttons and seams under heavy strain.<br>\r\nAt this pace of fattening, there better be soon a escape oportunity, or she would become the Stepmom baby hippo, for life.<br>\r\nThen, one night, Cinderella woke up in the night. Everything was silent and dark, and nobody was in sight. This was most curious. Five, ten, fifteen minutes passed. No lights, no noises, no food.<br>\r\nProbably The Spinster had gotten something wrong in the sleeping potion, and she had waked up before planned. Hmm, interesting.<br>\r\nCindy looked around her. Nothing new. <br>\r\nThen, she notice something shining in the Spinster's chair. The keys!!. Yes the keys, over her new shirt. That's it. Her shirt was too tight. They were going to change her shirt while she was still asleep, and they would need to open the handcuffs. Everything was ready.<br>\r\nThe chair was pretty close. Still, she could not reach it with her handcuffed hand. She had to think. \"No, not in food. Please, not in food. Let me concentrate in the keys\". An internal voice was saying: \"bad girl, call the woman. Tell her you are awake. Ask for your feeding. Ask her to fatten you more, so you cannot escape\". She controlled herself. The handcuffed hand could reach the enormous shirt on which the keys were. She had to pull it very carefully towards her, so that the keys wouldn't fall. She concentrated hard. The shirt was coming, and the keys with it. Carefully, on the mattress, acompanying the circunference of her belly. Close. There. The keys were at hand. She moved her head toward them, slowly, caught them with the lips and teeth, moved her wrist toward her us much as she could. Very carefully, using her lips, introduced the key in hole, and with the teeth, turned it. Click, it opened. With the free hand, she opened the other handcuff.<br>\r\nFree, she was free. After several months, and tons of food, she was free. <br>\r\nNow she had to get up, for the first time in months. Walk. Either take the elevator -noisy-, or the stairs -difficult at her weight. Once upstairs, it was some steps to the door, and to freedom. <br>\r\nShe would have to avoid waking anyone. And she would have to resist the internal voice telling her to go straight to The Spinster, and beg her to fatten her until she can no longer stand. Damn it, this was the result of several weeks consuming this damned woman gaining powders.<br>\r\nOk, now Cindy, step one. Let's get up from this bed. Here we go.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly she got an idea and moved her whole body too one side and again and again and she got on her side. Now she let her legs slide of the bed and used one of her hands to push her heavy body up. Men that was hard after not using them for over a month. She almost forget she had them.<br>\r\nFinally she got her body in a sitting position. No get up and walk away. That sounded so simple. Sounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if i let my belly lean forward his weight will pull me up. Or pull me for over and i will not be able to get up. But i don't think i got an other way so lets go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her belly careful lean forward not to much of her belly and ready to lean back if it was too much. Slowly the weight of her belly pulled her up and she got on her feet. It was so hard to stand. She hold the bed for support and slowly moving toward the stairs. Then she saw the stick the Spinster used to get around. She got the stick so it was easier to move and while leaning on the stick she slowly put one step and another toward the stairs. The spinster was the only one down there. Her stepsisters and stepmother were upstairs she supposed. Taking the stairs would be hard but if she used the elevator she would wake up the whole house so that was no option. <br>\r\nShe reached the stairs. Now came the hard part. Slowly she put one feet up.She had't used them for some time and the last time she was a lot thinner but she go her feet up and put him down then the stick and her other feet and after that catching a breath. This would take some time but there was no other option. she maybe would never get a  chance like this again.<br>\r\nSlowly about a half hour she got on the first floor and waddled to the door trying to make not too much noise what is hard if you weigh 510 lbs thats why she shuffled her feet instead of walking. Then she reached the door and tried to open it. It was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! It can't be. I got too far too give up now.But it's locked and the key is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed a nail in the wall and there were hanging the keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door and looked outside.

Trying too escape was so much work that she forget food for a moment. She used all her might to get her mind off food and set her first steps outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally i'm free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fast if she could and that was't very fast she waddled away.<br>\r\n She was very slow but it was in the middle of the night so when the spinster finally woke up when the sun was shining and realized she was missing Cinderella was already a far distance from from the house and the spinster had no clue were she was heading too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She has nowhere to hide, and the Prince is several days from here. I'll cook some cakes, and I'm gonna take a ride around the countryside with my donkey. I she smells the cakes, she will run to me sobbing, asking to be fed.\".<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cinderella was in hiding in a cave a couple of miles from the house. She was resting against a rock. She was starving. The hunger was driving her crazy. She was thinking of coming back, and asking to be fed. No matter what the punishment was, no matter if stepmom tied her to the bed and fed her so much that caused her a food induced comma. The hunger pangs were unbearable. The Prince was several days from here. And there was no way she could walk to his castle at this weight. <br>\r\nShe would give herself up. Sobbing, she got up, and feeling extremely hungry and miserable, she began walking back to the house.<br>\r\nIt was already dark. She was not quite sure she recognized the paths in the woods. She could only think of food. Of the women tying her to the bed and feeding her, and relieving her of this pain in the stomach.<br>\r\nBut where was she now. She did not recognize this path. She was lost. <br>\r\nA very obese and hungry girl lost at night in the woods. She felt she was about to collapse.<br>\r\nThen she saw a light. Yes. She got closer. There was a cottage. A very nice wooden cottage. A delicious smell of pies came from it.<br>\r\nCinderella got closer, and closer. And she knocked at the door. <br>\r\nAnd old woman with a cane opened the door. She looked at her with keen interest. \"Hello dear, how can I help you\".<br>\r\n\"Hello ma'am, I'm Cinderella, and I think I'm lost. I was, ..., I was wondering, if I could have something to eat. I'm very hungry.\"<br>\r\n\"O yes, my dear, please, come in.\"<br>\r\nThe quaint interior was very nice. <br>\r\nThere was a big wood table. On them, there were some couple of dozen apple pies. There were a small chair, and a very big, solid chair.<br>\r\nAt this point, Cinderella was absolutely crazy for food. Still, she could perceive the setting was somewhat suspicious. <br>\r\n\"Ma'am, why is that chair so big, and why are there so many pies\".<br>\r\n\"Well, my dear girl, you see. It is for my daughter. She is extremely obese. I was cooking for her. But she felt to tired to get up, so I'm going to take her dinner to bed.\".<br>\r\n\"So please, do sit at her chair. I'll think she will not notice if you eat a couple of her apple pies\".<br>\r\nCinderella sat in the chair. The chair was big, this girl must be huge. The old lady tied a napkin around Cinderella's neck. It was red, and had a repetitive pattern in it, that Cindy failed to notice. It was a drawing of a very fat girl sitting at a table an eating.<br>\r\nThe woman cut a piece of apple pie and put it in front of Cinderella. Sat by her side, and said, \"Tell me what you think\". She took a spoon, loaded it with a piece of the pie, and motioned it towards the lips of a hungry and confused Cinderella. Cinderella opened her mouth and ate.<br>\r\nA shot of pleasure shook her. Oh my, what was this. Hmm, this was fantastic. She felt the warm pie going down to her belly. Hmm, this was excellent. When she could finally regain some control of herself, she saw with horror that the woman had already fed her six apple pies. But she could not focus for long on that thought, the apple pies were too good to think of anything else.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Would you like to meet her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly they walked to room with a big door. The women opened the door and on a huge bed Cindy saw  a huge girl. Seeing her face with two big bowl pink cheeks she seemed pretty and young. Even younger then Cinderella. This girl was still a kid. Her arms looked like pillows. she was't able to bend them. Her neck was gone and melted to her chest. Her legs and thighs were huge balls of fat her feet buried in them. Her belly was the biggest with two big rolls and big boobs that if the girl would't be fat would't be so big also. But the girl had a big smile on her fat face. She seemed happy when she saw her mother with the food.<br>\r\nCinderella understood why the girl did't want to get up. She was even fatter then her. She got the strange feeling she had seen the girl before. But she did't remember where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that girl mommy?\" The girl asked while her mother tied a napkin around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Cinderella. A big girl just like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... how did you get so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Her mother started. \"My daughter was a little sweet tooth since she was born and had a good appetite. She was maybe a bit chubby or plump but not too much. My man and i want a vacation. A long vacation and in the meantime a spinster wanted to take care of her. I told her she had a big appetite and that she need to feed her. When we came back we found out that she did feed her good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best day's of my life.\" The girl mumbled.\"So much good food the whole time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course this is't what i mend but well the most important thing is that my daughter is happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long if i get food.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A spinster did this to her? Now i know where i saw you before. On one of her DVD's. She had fattened up girls before. Your one of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know her?\" The mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do! My stepmother asked her to fatten me up. Well she first asked a man but later she asked the spinster. Most of this fat is thanks to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh poor girl. So she forced you to become fat? But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my stepmother could get my money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard someone come in. It was a big man. about 80 inches long with big shoulders and very muscled with muscled arms but with a nice friendly face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello. I did't knew we had a guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my dad.\" The girl answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is another victim of that spinster.\" Her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT BITCH!\" In his anger the man hit the wall so hard that there was a hole in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey control your anger or else you wreck the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course. Sorry honey. Sorry for you too girl. I'm normally not like that. Normally i'm very friendly and calm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here and eat with us.

She well knew that Cindy could not resist the scent of her food. <br>\r\nAfter a while, the Spinster found out where Cinderella was.<br>\r\nBut she could not get in the house and get her. The man would kill her. <br>\r\nSo, she waited for the couple to leave the house. And then, she let the scent of her pastries and cakes invade the house. Cinderella was reading a book, but suddenly indentified the scent. A great fear invaded her. She tried to scream, to resist, to stay where she was. But it was too strong an impulse. With a big effort she stood up. She tried to identify where the scent was coming from. It clearly came from outside the house. Cindy walked to the door and opened it. Where was the scent coming from?. It was driving her crazy. She needed those pastries and cakes!. Right now she could think of nothing else. She had to find where the scent was coming from. And then, she saw it. A small and quaint cottage, not very far from the house. She could swear it had not been there yesterday, but well, if those cakes were there, that was all that right now mattered. <br>\r\nShe walked slowly to the cottage (after all, she weighed 510 lbs), with her mouth wattering. The door was ajar, and there were a couple of steps. With effort she climbed the steps, and opened the door. <br>\r\nIt was a single room cottage. There was a table, covered with cakes and pastries, a big chair, a fork and a knife. A flash of fear froze Cinderella. She knew the Spinster had to be behind this. She tried to turn around. But her addiction to the food this woman cook was too strong. With tears running down her cheek, she sat at the table, and began to eat. She eat cake after cake, and pastry after pastry. When there was nothing left, she felt asleep. The spinster had put a powerful sleeping powder in her cakes.<br>\r\nThe door was shut from the outside, and there was a click.<br>\r\nThe cottage turned out not to be a cottage, but a horse-drawn caravan disguised as one. <br>\r\nWith the Spinster at the reins, the caravan began moving. Inside the caravan, an sleeping Cinderella was being taken back to her bed in the basement, where a furious Stepmother was waiting for her.<br>\r\nWhen Cinderella woke up, she was in the basement, in the Stepmother house. Again, she had been handcuffed to the bed. <br>\r\nStanding by the bed were the Stepmother and the Spinster.<br>\r\nThe Stepmother said: \"It looks as if our little gazelle here has been roaming the countryside as of late. Well Spinster, we'll take measures to make this beautifull gazelle a more domesticated animal.\" She grabbed and caressed Cinderella's belly with both hands. \"See spinster, you -with whatever help you need- are to turn this rather smallish belly, into a 1000 lbs mass of jiggling fat that will convince this gazelle here to behave\". Cinderella was sobbing. <br>\r\n\"Make her eat. I want to see her eating. This was the last time this girl left this bed. I want her so fat, that she we'll need my help to raise her hand\".<br>\r\nThen she got her face close to Cinderella's. \"Now beauty, I leave you with the Spinster. Fat and food will be your great comforts and companions from now on. Enjoy them\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No one has ever got that far. Did you do that on purpose, was it just an accident or did you get help?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderella kept her jaws shut.

From now on the only thing you do except sleeping is eating. UNDERSTOOD!

Her other sister was on the ground an took off her shoes and was rubbing cinderella's belly with her feet.<br>\r\nThe spinster walked over to her an grabbed a spoon and started to pushing chocolate cake in her mouth so fast she nearly had time to chew them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to catch up that time when you were gone and all those calories your burned. We need to replace those too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to feed her. All kinds off food. Chocolate cake, pie with whipped cream, pancakes with syrup and icing sugar, hamburgers, fries. <br>\r\nCinderella kept eating and eating. what else could she do? She was addicted to the food. She almost kind of started it to like it to eat all the stuff. She knew it was used to fatten her up and was probably full with weight gain powder but it all tasted really good. She wished the spinster gave her more time to chew between bites.<br>\r\nAfter the last fry went past her lips she got time to cath a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now i have a delicious dessert for you.\" The spinster said on an evil tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a giant bowl filled with some strange white stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's lard. kind of expensive but it's paid with your money anyway. I don't know why you like this stuff so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to laugh like a wicked witch while she fed cinderella the lard. This was even worse then the food. At least the food tasted good this stuff tasted terrible but she knew there was no way to escape. She blew her one chance. She tried not to think about the horrible stuf that was poured in her throath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this food is gone in your huge gut.\" She kicked it hard so her fat started to jiggle for some time. \"I thought i said all you do besides eating is sleeping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the sleeping pills and a glas of water. Put three of the pills in Cinderella's mouth and let her swallow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now have nice dreams. When you wake up. then we continue feeding you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept this promise because every time when Cinderella woke up she was fed all the time the food the others could get. Every day more and every day she gained more and more and with each day she started to become closer to what her stepmother wanted. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know tomorrow it will be harder -she said chuckling- and the day after tomorrow even harder. We are not done feeding you yet. You don't know how many more pounds of spaghetti you'll have to move tomorrow\". The Stepmother chuckled. They very slowly swung at the music. Cindy sobbed and sweat. Moving was really hard. Her belly felt like a huge bag of sand. <br>\r\nThe Stepmother swung slowly by her side, at the music, but watched intently her stepdaughter effort and pain. She smiled an evil grin. \"I remember how fast and agile you were. How much faster than my daughters\". She stroke slowly Cindy's belly. \"Ah, food. It can do wonders to tame a rebel girl\".<br>\r\nThat being said, they helped an exhausted Cindy back to bed.<br>\r\n\"I know you are very tired Cindy -said the Stepmother-. She stroked slowly Cindy's belly. I'm so proud of your fat. I'm so proud of how fat we have made you. And I'll made you fatter. And some day, you'll ask me to spare the daily walk. You'll see. Only, after that they, there'll be no more walks.<br>\r\nThe Stepmother opened her arms wide to hug Cindy's belly.\"Hmm, hmm, fat, delicious fat\". She gave it a kiss. \"All this fat is going to keep your money mine for ever. You'll never leave me, you'll never marry. Ah, fat, glorious fat\".</span></div></div>",

Oh we're gonna make you even fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's unbelieveable what some people do for money.\" Cinderella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy, Cindy, Cindy. Money is the most important thing in the world. Especially if it's much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Money can't buy happyniss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're wrong. From much money i get very happy and even if it could't buy hapiness it's still very handy. Now open up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy opened her mouth while her stepsisters put in one after another cupcake in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like the cupocake's? Don't answer. Just chew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stepsisters chuckeld evilly while they fed cindy the cupcakes.

Because that's what you are.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sucks. I can hardly do an... \" Her words were cut off since her stepsister pushed another cupcake in her mouth.<br>\r\nFinally all the cupcakes were gone and the stepsister went back upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strange. I still feel hungry. I almost feel hungry all the time now but now more then normal. Why do they suddenly feed me less. They made my life even more miserable then it was. It's no fair. I wish i could escape but i can't even stand up on my own and i can hardly walk. It's no use. I wish the prince would come and safe me but i'm afraid he does't come and even if he does he probably won't even recognize me since i weigh about more the six times as heavy as when i saw him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment she remembered the night she and the prince danced. She remembered how they looked each other in the eyes. The wunderfull time they had. She would love to go back to that moment and do it over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonk! Bonk! Bonk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello stepmother.\" Cinderella said polite like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did't even need to turn her head. She knew from the sound of the stick it was her stepmother. <br>\r\nSlowly she bend over the fat girl and smiled at her with an evil smil. Cinderella thought that even the devil would be jealous at such an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet your hungry. You poor thing. Don't worry. Here we have some high fat chocolate cakes for you. Come on open that greedy mouth of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much if she hated it she opened her mouth and let her stepmother stuff her more slowly feeling that she gained more pounds of fat on her huge body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The buttons of her beautiful satin shirt were strained, trying to keep her flabby huge mass of a belly at bay. The stepmother delicataly wiped the chocolate from Cindy's face, kissed her fat cheek, and said, \"you are being a good little elephant\". <br>\r\nShe reclined the bed a bit, so that Cindy could get a bit of rest and digest the cakes. Then gently patted Cinderella's belly. It rose close to a meter from the mattress. The Stepmother was herself admired someone could be forced to become so fat. Tonite she would review the videos from the beginning, to see how much they have forced Cindy to eat, so that she had grown such a huge belly.<br>\r\nThen she retired to talk with the Spinster. She said: \"Spinster, I've been thinking. There is something I'd love to do.  I'd love to give a party. I think that could be on the ocassion of Cindy reaching the 1000 lbs mark. I'd like to invite all my friends. They knew how much I hated this girl. They knew how humiliated I felt by her beauty and her money. So I want a party, and she'll be the center of it. She will be in a reinforced wheelchair. There'll be lots of food. My friends will be able to take turns spoonfeeding her. They will love it. I know how evil they are. They will touch and feel her belly her arms, make comments about her fat. I will be fun\".<br>\r\n\"Yes, I guess, said the Spinster\". \"But wouldn't it be dangerous. What if someone accusses you of fattening your stepdaughter?. What if it attracts the Prince attention?\".<br>\r\n\"Well, you know I control all of Cindy's money. With money you can buy things. I went to a Judge, and bought an order from him. It states that under medical examination it was found that Cinderella was seriously undernourished, because of nervous anorexia that made her refuse food, even agressively, and endanger her own life. So, I got a judicial order to end her undernourishment, by force if necessary, feeding her whatever I think fit, for as long as I think fit. Anyone trying to intervene will be breaking the law, and might be taken to jail for life, for the crime of endangering an anorexic girl's life. (Or might stay free, if I say so, and under my conditions. And my conditions, might include being fattened like Cindy, to stay free. They'll learn not to mess with me).<br>\r\nSo, now, I could feed Cinderella in public if I so wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She gave the girl an evil smile and started to feed her the burgers. Since Cindy was still hungry she just ate and ate and grow fatter and fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next days were the worst days ever for the fat young beauty. Every day being fed to the point of bursting and after that she need to get dressed and stand up and dance while she could hardly move. It were some of the hardest times in her life. She felt less alive after each walk. But she knew it could't go on too long. Before she would reach 1000 lbs she would be immobile. She slowly started to get used being obese. She knew she would never be able to lose all this weight surely not with her stepmother, stepsisters and spinster around her. It all did't matter to her anymore. After each walk she would just eat again and take a nap so the food could change into pure fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're growing quick are't you piggy?\" Her stepsister said evil leaning against cindy's huge belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would never admit it she liked the feeling of sinking into the huge ball of fat that was her stepsister's belly.<br>\r\nShe scooped some more ice cream in Cindy's waiting mouth. After a spoon of ice cream she filled her mouth with whipped cream out of a can.<br>\r\nAfter she finished it was time for her walk. Her stepmother and spinster walked to her. Her stepmother looked at her daughters and said. \"Come on help us! How dare to let your old weak mother and an old spinster lifting this huge blob of fat on their own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth stepsisters and their mother need to give anything they had to lift Cindy enough from the bed. but two seconds after she stood she fell down on her bed. Her legs just could't support her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right she can't stand anymore! Great. Now we're gonna feed her so much fatter that she can't move a inch! Now she don't need to walk anymore we can use that time to feed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy was relieved when she heard this. She knew she was't able too walk anymore but walking was almost impossible the past days. Now she would get more food.<br>\r\nCindy past the 900 lbs mark and the stepmother started too prepare the party. write invitations, order a wheelchair and of course lot's of food and alcoholic beverages. probably most of the guests would be so drunk at the end of the evening they could't even find the doorway anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon Cindy then you'll reach 1000 lbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what then. You're done fattening me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no i wanted too wait till you were at least 1200 lbs. Well i wanted first but this is so much fun. Maybe i continue and make you the fattest person that ever lived and you're still very young. How does that sound? fattest person alive at this age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take it so hard. At least you will be famous then. Now hurry up and eat those hotdog's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderella started to eat while the needle crawled closer and closer to the 1000 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eat, don't reject any food, and don't give excuses.\"<br>\r\n\"We all know you are too fat to walk. But if my friends want you to walk, make your best effort. I know these witches. They'll want to know how helpless you really are. If you can escape, or fight.

She did has this thought many times but it did't seem to bother her stepmother. Keep someone captured in her own body was really evil. She was rather in a cage. At least then she could train all day long finally become strong enough to bend the bars. Then at least she would have a chance to escape. But at the other hand. She tried to image herself strong enough to bend bars. So many muscles would suit a man but not a girl. But now she could hardly bent her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your full yet piggy?\" The spinster asked. \"You cant be. I mean tomorrow is the party. I carefully saw how much you gained each day and i counted out you should reach the thousand pound this day. Else i need to call everyone to  the party has to wait Can't do that right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the elevator came down. Her two stepsisters came out with a huge and wide wheel chair. Big enough for even Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi mom. See what we have. A huge wheel chair. The man who delivered it said in must held 1200 pounds. Hope she doesn't reach that before the party.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No. This little piggy is gaining very well but not so good that she will reach 200 pounds in a day. Not even she can get that fat, that fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i think she comes more close to gain 200 pounds in a day then anyone else.\" Her stepmother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spinster threw her head in her neck and let out a terrible evil laugh that sounded it most like a crow. When she was done laughing she said: \"That's for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it feel Cindy. Being in bed all do. Doesn't even move finger how does that feel?\" Her fat stepsister asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should know. You did that before you started to fatten me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful sis. You know what i can do to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep feed me. There is't much more you can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i can't hurt you physical but i can do this. Just look at you. Once you used too be the most beautiful and charming pretty girl in the whole kingdom. Every boy wanted too dated you and look what you've become. Your now a fat cow. Rolling around in your own dirt. Only eating like the pig you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words hurt Cindy. She knew they were all true. The only thing was that she could't be blamed for was that she did't did this too herself. <br>\r\nIn the afternoon while eating a few roasted pigs suddenly a few bells started to ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Cindy you did it! You did it! You reached thousand pounds. Oh i almost could't believe it.\" One of her sisters said and hugged her fat loving the feeling of it being careful enough not to show her mother and sister how much she loved the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great now the party can go on! You two. Go upstairs and get all stuff down. Tables, chairs, food and all other stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\" Her stepsisters asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you two! Who else? Now where are you waiting for? A invitation. Get those things down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sister walked upstairs to get the tables chairs and other things while the spinster feed her more roasted pigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know. those two are't that smart you know.\" Cindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But i was't asked too fatten them up, but you. I fattened up a lot of girls but you are without a doubt my masterpiece. You must be the fattest, and if your not... well were not done yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Cindy. You know i looked forward to this moment! That you would weigh 100 pounds.\" Her stepmother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad i could help!\" Cinderella said sarcastic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stepsisters came back with tables chairs and lots of food, plates. knifes, forks, spoons and a lot of alcoholic beverages. Everything was made up nice. They even washed up Cindy what was a huge job since they also needed to wash between all her huge love handles and it took more then an hour but finally it was done. Her stepmother looked for Cindy's nicest dress that was probably way too tight on her but she did't care. If her clothes would rip in front of all the guests that would enjoy her even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally all preparations were done. Tomorrow would be the big day.</span></div></div>",

To celebrate health.<br>\r\nAs everybody already knows, my extremely beautiful stepdaughter, Cinderella, became afflicted some time ago, with a rather serious case of anorexia nervosa, which endangered her life. It was frightening. It put her on the verge of death. She refused to take any food. When we tried to help her, she fled our house and her loving family, to avoid the treatement.<br>\r\nWhen we finally found her, I had to get a judicial order, so we could be able to restore her to health, even against her will. She was in such poor health, that I had to ban any calories consuming activities to her. No more sports or dancing. She was to stay at home and regain her health. We had to force fed her -then you'll see the videos- but it was all for her own good.<br>\r\nI can now happily announce that with the help of her sisters, and of a most loving friend, an Spinster, my beautiful Stepdaughter has been restored to health.<br>\r\nAnd after this sad episode, she has become a more obedient and quiet girl. <br>\r\nThose who know us, probably remember how she was all the time dancing or playing some sport, and how much that bothered me. Now, she has become such a sweet creature, that she'd just told me, that I won't have to worry again about her dancing or playing sports. She has decided to stay at home and to obbey me. Ain't she the sweetest girl?.<br>\r\nIn some minutes more, you'll see Cinderella. She looks healthy. But remember, she is a recovering anorexic. So feeding her, even against her will, is an act of kindness.<br>\r\nAnd now, a warning to all of those who have came here with their beautiful thin daughters: beware of anorexia, it is a terrible scourge!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They knew they were thin but not an anorexia patient. They just watched what they eat and did exercise regularly.<br>\r\nEveryone stopped talking when Cinderella came in.<br>\r\nShe was a gigantic blob of fat. You could hardly notice her limbs anymore. She seemed to be totally made out of rolls of fat. Her belly was huge and if the chair would't have a piece of space that was specially made their for her belly to rest on it would have touched the floor. Her upper arms looked like huge pillows who had swallowed most of her underarms. Her thighs looked like tires however it was hard to see since most of them was covered by Cindy's huge belly. Her breasts were as big if basketballs and were pushing against the fabric of her dress just like her belly and every piece of her body where her dress was. Her cheeks were round, bowl and pink. They took up a lot of her face. They were so round it looked like she stuffed a tomato in each of them. Her calves were hanging partly over her feet. Her huge butt was taking up the entire seat of the chair that was pretty wide.<br>\r\nAll guests slowly started to whisper. Some friends of the stepmother praised her and the spinster for what they had done but some of her enemies whispered in disbelief. She could hear some words like 'child abuse' and 'unbelieveable' and 'unhealthy'.<br>\r\nCindy knew that those people would't help her. Not because they did't want too but because they could't. If they did she would buy out the judge. It would't make anyone's life better. Worse maybe. She sighed since she knew some of them would maybe have helped her. Some of her stepmother friends pushed food in her face she was forced to eat. She did't tried to stop them or to not eat it. She knew she was never able to lose this weight. She knew that she would be fat for the rest of her entire life what maybe would't be that long since she thought that it would't take long before she would die of a heart attack or something like that.<br>\r\nWhile she rolled between some guests she suddenly saw a thin long girl with blue eyes and long blond hair. The sun that shined through the window in her hair made it look like gold. She was talking with a small younger chubby girl with red hair and green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. I'm Nicole. And that is Sasha.\" The blond girl said friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" Cinderella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey between you, me and Sasha... What you stepmother just said was a lie right. You're not an anorexia patient, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No i'm not. They just wanted to make me fat so i could't go away from them so they had access to my money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad. I wish we could help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you were anorexia you're now so obese that it's unhealthy no matter how anorexia you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody here who is smart enough to know that can't say anything. But i believe most people here are't that smart.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does't matter she never let me go. I might as well stuff myself anyway. But i can't bend my arms enough to get food to my mouth. I depend on my stepmother, stepsisters and the spinster for... well... anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the spinster appeared and whispered: \"You're not her to have fun and talk too people but too be stuffed by people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the chair and got Cinderella back too the crowd and more people started to stuff her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor girl.\" Sasha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it. She doest deserve this. Since her parents died that girl did't have a moment of happiness in her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha took a piece of cake and said: \"But the food does taste pretty good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you think of that on a time like this when we see that poor girl... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you said yourself that we cant do anything! So we might as well enjoy it. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you put it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one hour of stuffing suddenly there was a ripping noise heard. The next moment her whole dress tore apart right through the middle. This made more guests feed her hoping also her sleeves would rip what they did and an hour later she only wore shreds of her pretty dress and she was at the point of crying.<br>\r\nSome of the girls looked a bit jealous at the huge breasts that were resting on her belly.<br>\r\nSome time later all guest were drinking while feeding the now naked Cinderella in her chair making her even fatter.<br>\r\nNicole and Sasha looked from a distance at Cinderella feeling sorry for her.   </span></div></div>",

She suddenly snapped her fingers and felt in her bag. Sasah always had a small backpack with stuff in it. She also liked the prince and had a book with every article about him in a book. She opened it and looked through several articles until she found where she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Nicole look over here.\" Sasah whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that? An article about the ball. That was months ago. What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well see that lady at the picture? Doesn't she remind you of someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked again at the picture and then looked at Cindy, back at the picture and back at Cindy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh. Is she.

She is't fat enough yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's mother looked at her anger burning in her eyes. But her stepmother was right. She could't do anything.

She read it a few times fast. Slowly she started to shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks just like Cinderella. Except for the fact she weighs about 1000 pounds now. But it was months ago. Can she have gained so much in months?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no one has found the girl and since it was big news that the prince looked for her it's impossible to think she might have missed that news and why would't she come. But if she could't come because she was chained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother looked at Sasha. Sometimes she looked a little sidetracked but later she seemed to know what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can be sure i  will talk to the royal family soon.\" Their mother said.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Ah, this is Nicole, the poor undernourished girl. Hmm, poor thing, she's about to collapse. Officers, I'm taking on from here. Have a good afternoon\".<br>\r\nWhen the door closed, Miss DeVille looked at the terrified Nicole, and grinning an evil grin, said: \"Well my aspiring piglet, welcome to the feedlot\".<br>\r\nNicole was paralized. The Spinster arrived: \"Ah, this is Nicole. Well, Hello Nicole\".<br>\r\nLady DeVille said: \"Say Hello to my friend the Spinster. She'll be a very important part of your life from now on\".<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do to me?\"<br>\r\n\"Well Nicole. I might punish you for asking, but I will answer your question.\"<br>\r\n\"You're mother pissed me off. She threatened me in front of my friends. She accused me of fattening my beloved stepdaughter Cinderella. She seems to think I've done something awful to her. So, well, I will do the same to her beautiful daughter, so she'll learn not to mess with me\".<br>\r\n\"Whattt???\"<br>\r\n\"Listen kid, are you idiot or something?. Ok, I'll make myself clear. We are going to fatten you up. Ok. We are going to force you to eat to your limit day after day, a diet of icecream and desserts. From now on, we will be shoving food into your mouth until you are at the point of fainting.Then we will let you rest and digest, and then more food.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you mad???\"<br>\r\n\"I haven't finished kid. As I said, we will be forcing you to eat and gain against your will. You will be forced to stay in bed and eat. Some days, I might allow you to join as at table. You will obey my every whim. Think of the danger you might put your family in by just refusing a dessert\". \"So, if you ever happen to think that spoon we are holding in front of you is one too many, think of them, and open wide. Just a little bit of discomfort in your tummy to protect them\".<br>\r\n\"Now, as you know, my little stepdaughter is already pretty fat. She has reached the 1000 lbs mark. Still she is very healthy. She is my only key to her father's money, so I would never let her health deteriorate. I just want her to stay with us in the mansion, to be quiet an sweet.<br>\r\nWith her we are exploring the world of extreme obesity, but very carefully. The heaviest woman to live reached the 1600 lbs mark, but we don't want to push things here too far.\"<br>\r\n\"I haven't made up my mind yet, but we could put your bed by Cindy's, so that she can give you advice on the world of obesity. Besides, but watching the size of her belly, and the amount of food we make her eat, you might have an interesting glimpse into your not so distant future\".<br>\r\nNicole started to cry, \"No please, I do not want to be fat. Forgive me, let me go\".<br>\r\nThe Spinster was measuring Nicole's waist with her hands. \"Hmm, such a flat stomach. Say goodbye to it Nicole\".<br>\r\n\"No no\" cried Nicole \"it was all a mistake, a terrible mistake. My mother did not want to offend you. It was probably something Cindy told her. I'm sorry, my mom is sorry. Let me go\".<br>\r\n\"Nicole\" said the Stepmother. \"I'm being extremely patient here. I've been offended, and I'll have my revenge. There's nothing you can do about it. Understand this. You just walked into this Mansion. You will never, ever, walk out of this Mansion\". Lady DeVille's eyes glittered with hate and pleasure. She got closer to the handcuffed Nicole, and grabbed her flat tummy with her hands. \"We will force you to eat so much, we will shove so much food into that pretty mouth of yours, into your perfect 18 years old body, we'll make this inexistent tummy of yours so monstrously obese, that if you ever leave this mansion, it'll be in a reinforced wheel chair or in a bed with wheels\".<br>\r\nNicole was choking while crying \"No please, forgive me, no. Help\".<br>\r\n\"Now Nicole, behave. Think of your family\".<br>\r\nNicole looked at the Stepmother with terror and tried to stop the crying noises, but couldn't stop the tears.<br>\r\n\"That's better, good girl\".<br>\r\n\"Now Nicole, we have prepared a room for you. There is a bed in the room. It is a reinforced bed, for the morbidly obese. And there are handcuffs there to, so that you'll stay quiet while being fed\".<br>\r\n\"The spinster is going to take you there, help you change into your new clothes, and help you get into the bed that will become your new home\".<br>\r\n\"When you are ready, I'll join you. Tonite, you are having the first 'real' meal of your entire life\". And she chuckled.<br>\r\n\"Ah, and you will be wearing a big bib, my little baby. When there is so much food involved, things tend to get a little messy\".<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She is going to turn me in a huge blob of fat. Just like you. I don't want to become fat. I worked out so hard to keep this figure and i did so much my best to be careful with what i eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel sorry for you but i can't do anything to help you.

So trying to escape is useless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe for you but not for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do that they only fatten you up faster. Believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I everyone ready to start eating?\" A voice suddenly broke their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spinster walked forward to Cinderella and pulled at one of her love handles and pushed her finger deep in her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See this. This is what you will look like after some time. You know i fattened up lot's of girls but this one is my master piece.\" She patted on the belly of Cinderella. \"But i think i make you the second best how does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Noooooooo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scream all you want no one is gonna hear you. Or at least no one who is gonna able to save you.

I will start feeding her. After she gained about fifty pounds you can also feed her. But you need to start in a special way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took some super fattening snacks and looked at Nicole with an evil twinkle in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I advice you not too spit it out or else i will force it down your throat in a much more painful way. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nodded and opened her mouth while the spinster started to feed her some special fattening snacks. They tasted delicious and Nicole tried to focus on that instead of the fact that she was fattened up. The snacks were from the outside chocolate then some sweet stuff (she did't knew what) and from the inside a tasty cream. In the start is was fun but after twenty it was't. When number thirty went down her throat she felt like she would pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... please stop now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i will. But not because you ask me. It's only that i know your tummy can't hold much more food and you would throw up all those calories. Tomorrow we feed you more, and the day after that even more until you eat just as much if Cindy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole slowly started to cry and looked at the sealing of her prison were she would be fattened.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lady DeVille was very specific that the handcuffs and legs restraints were never to be removed, under no circumstances, as she was still agile enough and strong enough, to knock them down and escape. The restrains would only be removed in the future, when Lady DeVille had decided obesity had made her helpless).<br>\r\nSo Nicole spent her days in the adjustable reinforced obese bed were the spinster had placed her.There was the TV, and the food, and no much else.<br>\r\nShe didn't see much of Cindy's stepsisters. She guessed they spent most of their time with her.<br>\r\nThe Spinster had brought a sister of hers, to help her with the feeding. Her name was Clara. She was younger than the Spinster. She seemed to have some particular resentment toward young beautiful girls, and seemed to take some particularly perverse pleasure in feeding her. There were several meals during the day, and day after day the meals tended to be longer, and the intervals between them shorter, as her capacity was being constantly challenged by the feeders.<br>\r\nLady DeVille visited her a couple of times during the day. But Nicole spent her days mostly with the Spinster and her sister Clara, and the TV. She feared and despised the Spinsters, but was forced to talk with them. The Spinsters mostly told her how fat she was becoming, and told her about obesity, her effects, their experience with other girls that had been fattened by them, and how huge and helpless she would become.<br>\r\nShe had received no news from the outside world. If her mother had come to see Lady DeVille, she had not been told. Would her mother know that she was being fattened?. Maybe, the Judge had pronounced her officially undernourished, and had placed her in the custody of Lady DeVille, with complete power on her weight. But could her mother imagine something like this?. This nightmare?.<br>\r\nAt this point, having gained 300 lbs, and having been kept immobile for two months, she felt heavy an tired, with a voluminous, warm, and heavy belly were only a couple of month ago her waist was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slowly she took her book of articles of the prince and did again what she had done every day. Look at the picture of Cindy at the ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have been Cindy. She looks exact the same. Except for about 1000 pounds by now. I wonder how Nicole is doing.

She can't be cured since she is't sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed in some tears. She cried about a week long when she first got here. After that she slowly calmed down. The guards were kind of friendly since they knew she was't a criminal and she was just still a young girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never get out.

It's not like i can tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonk! Bonk! Bonk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole knew the bonking sound of the stick of lady DeVille. She always found it a unpleasant sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she was't. She could't have been. We handcuffed her and fattened her up by then. Not as fat like if she is now but still she was fatter then that girl at the party. But i must admit that she looked a lot like that girl. That's also a reason why we fattened her up. So if the prince would see her he would't recognize her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl was never found. So if it was't Cindy then who was. I bet the prince is still looking for her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady DeVille walked out of the room and upstairs and went sitting in an old chair. Thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could't have been Cindy at that party. But if she was't then why was the real girl not found. The prince would never find her here so why am i worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thoughts about this girl and the prince kept nagging on the old lady. She got the feeling she missed something.

Something very familiar was missing. Hmm. Yes, a noise. The warden has not locked the door. How could that be, it was so mechanical of him. How could he have skipped it. Hmm.<br>\r\nShe got up, went to the door, tried. I was open!!!.<br>\r\nSasha stood there thinking. Then she opened very slowly the door, and looked into the aisle. Nobody in sight. The guy had forgotten to lock the door. Could he be this dumb?. In ordinary circumstances, law abiding as she was, Sasha should have stayed put. But she was almost sure that Cinderella was the Beauty that had danced with the Prince, and she had to do something about it.<br>\r\nShe looked down the corridor again. No one in sight. Not a noise. She took her shoes off, and walked quickly, past the other cells, out of the corridor, past the bathroom, past the warden mess, where they were having their lunch, laughing and telling jokes. No policemen were in sight. But there was no way she could leave through the main entrance. She went to the laundry room. It was open. And it had doors that opened to a yard with no walls or fences. Some women were doing the laundry. She moved closed to the ground, hiding behind some crates. Now she was close to the outer door. None was in the yard. Ok. She run fast, very fast, for a couple of blocks. Wow!. She was out, free, and no one had seen her. Still, in a couple of hours they would notice she was missing, she had to act fast. Hmm, what to do. She could go to Palace, but she did not think her case was convincing enough. Sasha decided she would try to rescue Nicole, and both of them would go to the Prince, to tell him about the mistery beauty at the Ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Lady DeVille's basement, Clara was feeding Nicole. Clara was making her to finish eating a big bowl of pasta. Nicole was wearing a big bib, and some tomato sauce was dripping down her chin. Clare said: \"Nicole, your face is so pretty, and your eyes so beautiful. And your golden hair. You must have driven some men crazy. Well, even the Prince could have fallen in love with you. But now your are mine Nicole -she said this with and evil grin, patting her growing belly- you are mine, my pet piglet, and no one is going to take you away from me. Yes, good girl, finish the pasta. All of it. There is some icecream for dessert.\"</span></div></div>",

That was weeks ago. It seemed so long. When she saw the house She looked through the window and saw Lady DeVille. But nowhere the empty headed stepsisters or that evil Spinster.<br>\r\nShe suddenly heard a sound under her and noticed it came from under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. They're holding them in the basement. But how can i defeat two stepsisters and a spinster and Lady DeVille? Wait. They must also sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha hide between some bushes so when they would look for her they would' see her and decided to try to get some sleep. Soon the little girl was out like a light and woke up several hours later. <br>\r\nIt was dark. A half moon was standing at the black sky full of stars. Sasha always liked it to look at a sky full of stars. But now she had more important things too do. She took out her shoes to make less sound. She opened carefully the door. She heard no one. She walked too the basement door and walked downstairs without a noise what was pretty easy for a little girl like her. She saw Cinderella. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow that girl is huge.\" She thought but did't say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked further and then saw her sister and two woman both sleeping in a chair. One was that mean spinster but she did't knew the other one. <br>\r\nThen she took a better look at her sister and had trouble not too burst in laughter. She could't help it but her skinny sister who was always so concerned about her figure must now weigh over 300 pounds. Finally she know too did't laugh but still hold a grin on her face and shook her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole felt someone moving her and thinking it would probably be the spinster or the sister of the spinster she opened her mouth. When she did't get any thing too eat she knew there was something strange. <br>\r\nShe opened her eyes slowly and almost cheered from joy when she saw her little sister who hold a finger against her lips.<br>\r\nNicole understood and nodded towards the spinster. Sasha looked at her and saw the keys. Slowly she took the keys without a sound and opened the handcuffs. The click when they opened sounded to both sisters like a gunshot.<br>\r\nSasha pulled her sisters hand. But her sister did't seemed to be in a hurry. Angry she looked at her sister. She pulled Sasha back and whispered in her ear: \" I did't walked for two months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha understood that two months don't walking together with three hundred pounds of extra fat walking again was a bit hard. After about 10 minutes Nicole did some slowly steps. A bit shaky but who would blame her. Without almost making a sound they were out side and start walking. <br>\r\nWhen they where sure no one would hear them Sasha could finally start laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whahahaha! Men sis you've gotten fat! hahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you can laugh about it.\" She said angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He i did risk something just by saving you!\" Sasha said angry with her arms over each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Thank you sis.\" Nicole said much more friendly. \"I'm glad to see you sis. But how did you get here. They would't let you go until i was cured and i did't think lady DeVille thought i was cured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They left my cell open. So i thought i could safe you... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what now? They're looking for you and as soon they found out i'm gone the will look for me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry sis. Everyday i looked at that article and every day i'm more convinced it's Cinderella. So if we tell the prince he will free Cinderella and i'm sure too thank us we will be set free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True but first we need to get too the  palace and i's almost day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hide in the forest and travel next night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked in the forest. Sasha played in the forest and remembered there one was a hole. She and some friends put some strong shelfs over it and sand over them so on one could see it. They glued some sand and leaves too some smaller shelfs they used to cover the entrance.<br>\r\n Fast she took her sister too it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look sis. Here we can hide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did't you never tell me about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a secret but in this case i think we are allowed to break some rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast they hide however it took a while before they were able to get Nicole's new belly and but through the opening. Sasha hide the entrance and both cuddled up together happy to hold each other again and both fell in a peaceful sleep.         <br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Cindy was fast asleep. They looked intently for Nicole, but she was nowhere to be found. The front door was unlocked. The girl had escaped. <br>\r\nAll the fuss the Spinsters were making woke Lady DeVille. They had to tell her. She was furious, her eyes blazing with hate. \u201cHow on earth, how, a girl who weighs some 400 lbs, who has been in bed for the past two months, who is hundcuffed to that bed, and who is being forcefed all day long, can escape your supervision?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you idiots understand the situation. I hate that girl\u2019s mother. And I was getting some relief by helding her beautiful daughter captive and fattening her into morbidly obesity. And now she is gone\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, she might try to get help for Cindy. She had some weird ideas about Cindy being the Mistery Girl. If the Prince believes that, he might cause me some trouble. All my money and power depends on keeping Cindy single and in my power, very obese in her bed, for life. If Cindy is taken from me, my money is gone. Her obesity, her enormous weight, her huge belly, is my password to her father\u2019s fortune\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cLady DeVille, we can\u2019t understand what happenned, we really can\u2019t\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cListen, in any other circumstances I would have you fed to my hounds, alive. But, I still need you, because there is still some heavy duty fattening to be done\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes, Lady DeVille, of course\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, idiotic sisters, remember this Nicole has a sister, one Sasha.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes, she does\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I had the foresight of having this Sasha kept in jail, just in case. Well, that \u201cjust in case\u201d has just happenned\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this is what I plan to do: I will call my friend the Judge. I\u2019ll have him discover that this Sasha is severely undernourished too, and I\u2019ll have him place her in my custody, with ample powers over her. She will take Nicole place in that bed. And you will feed her. I let it be known what is going on, and that we\u2019ll keep feeding her until Nicole gives herself up. I have to show this woman that my power over her daughters is still intact, or I am nobody\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cYes Lady DeVille said the older Spinster. And besides, remember that we add and addictive powder to the food we feed Nicole. After the situation with Cinderella, we increased the dose. At her present weight, her effect must be pretty powerful. She will need food, but food with the addictive powder. Not other food will do. In 24 hs that fatty will be at your door, begging to be tied to her bed and have food shove into her mouth. While she was here, she was being forcefed, and could think clearly. But as time passes and abstinence continues, she will feel first uneasy, and in a while downwrite desperate. She\u2019ll be here as fast as her weights allows, on her knees, sobbing, and saying \u2018Please Lady DeVille, please, feed me, make me fat, as fat as you want, but feed me. As soon as she eats several spoonfuls, her head will clear and she will understand her awful mistake. We must make sure that by then it be too late for her to react\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t work on Cinderella, though\u201d said Lady DeVille.<br>\r\n\u201cYes Lady DeVille, but it was all my fault. I used the wrong dose for her age and weight. And besides, your stepdaughter had a particularly strong willpower. The provider says it works. Says she has personally seen it work. She says it has seen willpowers of steel melt in front of it, and people leaving everything, love, money, fame, to come and sit meekly as good piggies, to be fed. He has seen people under the power of that powder lie, betray, forsake love, give up money, for a dish of the addictive food. Only to realise, after that first dish, what awful mistake they had made, and to find themselves restrained an on their way to morbid obesity.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk, we\u2019ll see\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd when Nicole gives herself up, I\u2019ll place her and her bed in a cage, and you Clara, are going to live with her in that cage, until you give me hard evidence that Nicole\u2019s weight prevents her from leaving that bed. Clara, you are not leaving that cage, until I\u2019m convinced that that bitch will never leave that bed by her own means. And that she will need a lot, a lot of help from other people to leave that bed Clara. \u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Lady DeVille, understood\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I\u2019ll get you Sasha. And please concentrate on fattening her, just to ease a bit my inner pain\u201d.<br>\r\nClara didn\u2019t say a thing, but she was delighted. Once they had recaptured Nicole, she would spend all day with her, all day, inside the cage. Her sister would help her with the feeding, but she will be inside the cage with the beautiful bitch, feeding her, watching her eat and eat, and becoming more a more obese, day after day. Watching the effects of obesity on her. She will be witness to her tears. This prospect was delightful. When that cage opens, Nicole will be helpless, extremely obese, and completely dependent on her. (And she allowed herself to dream a little: she imagined the cage, and a much fatter Nicole in her obese bed, wearing a bib, and Clara was presenting her with a huge chocolate and caramel dessert: \u201cAh Nicole, I guess you never thought there was in the whole world anyone so obese and greedy as to be able to eat something like this. And now you, sweet Nicole, are going to finish it in one sitting. Now, open up, you freak, lets fatten this huge belly of yours. Yes, that\u2019s it, eat more, elephant, eat. Keep eating. How I hate you Nicole. You had all the good looking guys, everyone admired you. And now, look at you, all 1000 lbs of you. You are obese and helpless. No!, don\u2019t you even try to say something, keep eating. You have to eat Nicole. A lot. Food is your only key to opening this cage.Good elephant, keep eating. Remember Nicole, once your initiative and your thinness almost cost me and my sister our heads. And I swore then to erase any trace of them from you, with food. And I won\u2019t stop shoving food into your mouth and adding pounds to your belly, until I\u2019m convinced you are the most submissive girl on the face of the earth\u201d.)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She already called the judge for the right papers. That would be no problem.<br>\r\nShe leaned heavy on her stick. She was't used to take long walks. She started to get old and have pain in her bones especially when it got cold. <br>\r\nBut she wanted to get Sasha as soon if possible. If the guard would't give her she could call the judge to tell the guard it was all right so there could't go anything wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never should i have left that spinster and her sister watch after Nicole. How is it possible that she escaped. There is't a way how she could get that key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she got a strange feeling like something was very wrong. he did't knew what it was or how it came. Just that she did miss something.<br>\r\nShe tried to ignore it and walked inside the big building right to the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! I'm here to pick up Sasha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Sasha? You're here to pick her up? I did't get any letter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's just decided. Does't matter. If you don't believe me call the judge. Bring me Sasha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasha? That girl. Sorry can't do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want that girl so take her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But miss i can't do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't believe me then call the judge she will tell you to give me Sasha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if i would call then still i could't give you Sasha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face of Lady DeVille slowly turned red.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I WANT THAT GIRL HERE NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you keep standing there for the next century i cant give you her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Lady DeVille started too understand something was wrong. She got calm and looked a the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" She asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well you see that girl Sasha just recently escaped. So i can't bring her too you since she is't here. Of course we're looking for her but it's hard too find just one girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could she have escaped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it could be that... i... accidentally... left... the... cage.... open.\" He said with a guilty grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face of Lady DeVille got red again. Not only because what the guard had done. She understood who had freed Nicole. Now she knew what that feeling was. Nicole could't have taken the key by herself so someone must have helped her. There was another person in play that was what she had missed. In the middle of the night this person broke in their house and freed Nicole. That one was... Sasha!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... That brat! She destroyed my entire plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry she turned around and walked as fast if she could back home. She did't even noticed the pain in her old bones.<br>\r\nShe almost pulled the door out of the house when she opened it and went straight downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Lady DeVille. Where's or new patient?\" The spinster asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could't make it. She escaped recently. So now we know how she escaped. I want both girls here and be fattened up faster then a thanksgiving turkey!\"</span></div></div>",

It would be nice to wait here for that fatty to show up panting and begging for your food. We might even refuse to feed her unless she brings Sasha to the party too. But the risk is too high\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cSo get the dogs ready, get some of the clothes Nicole had on when she was brought here, and put the dogs on her scent. I\u2019ll stay here, just in case. You go and carry some food with you, to use as bait with that fatty\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Lady DeVille\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a cage set up around Nicole\u2019s bed, and I\u2019ll prepare Sasha\u2019s new lodgings\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sasha and Nicole were in their hideout , sleeping. Nicole was having a nightmare. She was back at Lady DeVille\u2019s, handcuffed and being led firmly by Clara, who was taking her to the basement. She put her in the bed, and restrained her, tied the bib around her neck, placed a tray with desserts in front of her, and took a spoonful saying \u201cOpen up, we failed the first time, but not now\u201d. Nicole saw herself parting trembling lips. The worrying part was that something dark, deep in her mind, was craving that food. Then, she woke up covered in sweat. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was really difficult to see even if you knew where it was. hopefully the dogs would't start to dig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's had a war in her head. one side of her wanted to get the food but the other one did't want to betray her sister. Both sides were battling in her head, and the craving for the food from the spinsters were getting bigger and bigger. She did't knew if she could resist much longer.<br>\r\nSasha saw a some drool dripping out of her sisters mouth. She saw Nicole really was addicted too the food and she grabbed her sister tighter. It worked for about one minute before her thoughts slowly wandered of too the food. <br>\r\nThe dogs on top of the hiding place were wondering what they needed too do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My little sister is also taken away from her and I gonna get forced too become fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can count on that. Before I was taken here I used to be a thin girl. Well not so strange. I only got leftovers to eat. You don't get fat from that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I remember. I and my sister saw you sometimes when we were walking through the village until... well I guess it was since you were brought here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's terrible. But at least the food is good. That's the only good thing. A good advice work with her and eat the food. If you don't she will force it in you and that will be much harder. Believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't let her get away with it! We must do something. We need to escape.\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you wanna do that. I can barely move, and I surely can't walk. I'm afraid I can't do anything to help you. I can only give you some good advice so the fattening will be less hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well It does't really make me feel better but I guess it's better then nothing. How can you stay so calm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess you could say I accepted it. I'm addicted to the food. I tried to escape once and she captured me again by the smell of some of her delicious food. I can't escape, I'm unable to lose weight. I might as well accept I'm gonna be a fat girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked at the sealing. Was she right. Was there no escape. I tales the good always defeat evil so there had to be a way. She hoped. Cinderella maybe could't escape but there must be a chance for her. Then she would save Cinderella later. Was there a chance? Maybe her sister. Fine she was put in a cell but maybe she could escape. Maybe. She was pretty smart and sly. She maybe might find a way to escape. Just like climb out of the window and slide down by the drainpipe when she was send to her room. But that was easier then to break out of prison. It was pointless.<br>\r\nSoftly she started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna become fat.\" She said between her tears. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"I'm afraid you don't get much chance.\" Cinderella said. \"Come on. It's gonna  be all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not gonna wait here. I'm gonna escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know how but now I'm thinking of it your still pretty thin. Maybe you can find a way. If I can help you I surely will. I'm too fat too move but you still can. I forget that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked up. Those words made her feel better. he was right.

With that I could go away for ever but my stepmother wanted the money so make sure I can't leave seemed to best way for her. Well she got what she wished I can barely move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooh.\" Nicole moaned and drifted of to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened her eyes she saw two faces looking down at her. The spinster and  Drizella. Both had an evil smile on their face. Nicole saw another cart filled with food behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry my little piggy?\" Asked the spinster on a tone as like speaking against a baby. \"Well don't worry. We will feed you soon, and guess what. Drizella offered to help me fed you. I'd rather do it all by myself but you know... I'm old! I don't have the strenght of you young people have or in your case used to have.\" She said while she turned to Cinderella. \"My old bones and muscles need to rest every now and then. So I decided she could help. Besides there will come endless more feeding times and I will have enough times to feed you. That fattening is the only fun thing in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up my little piggy!\" Drizella shouted happily with a spoon full of chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spinster looked at Drizella with so much anger burning in her eyes that Drizella froze and looked scared at the spinster. She did't knew what she did wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is't your piggy.\" The spinster said on a dangerous whispering tone. \"She's my piggy and only mine. Understood. I know you and your sister hardly have a brain but you better do your best to remember this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrizella still scared slowly nodded and pushed the spoon full with chocolate cake in the mouth of Nicole. Nicole must admit she loved the taste of chocolate cake. She was almost addicted to it. She always wanted to eat the whole cake and now she could. Even more then one. <br>\r\nShe knew she had to eat them one way or another so she tried to enjoy it. Cinderella had been right. Just eating was better then getting it forced down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like feeding my.... Eh... eh I mean: I like feeding you little piggy. That's it.\" Drizella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole knew that she saw something else in Drizella's eyes but she did't knew what it was. She swallowed another spoon full of pie and coughed spitting out a few crumbs. he looked at Drizella one more time but could't find out what it was and decided to start eating again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm not so busy feeding you I can tell you things in the meantime.\" The spinster said. \"Would you like that? What does it matter? I'm gonna tell you anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I already thought you would say that.\" Cinderella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up whale. I'll feed you after I'm done with her. Hmmm or maybe Drizella can do that too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrizella stopped feeding Nicole for a few seconds. She liked Nicole. Not her perfect sister. Who always managed to look prettier then her no matter what she wore. Such a perfect body that there was no dress no matter how filthy could hide it, and now she was a huge ball of fat. There was hardly a human form in all that fat. But she wanted to feed Nicole so bad that if she had to feed Cinderella too she would do it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While the spinster kneaded and rubbed Cinderella\u2019s prized gut she felt a great sadness coming over her for she loved feeding Cinderella until she was stuffed to her gills with her addicted food sure Nicole was a great substituted but she was no true gainer like Cinderella was, By far Cinderella was probably made to eat and be a pig, Nicole has actually only been at Feed-a-lot for about three days and not only has she had no significant gain her will power over the addicting cakes is quite strong.  Even though she has been under the influence of the cake for about three days the only kind of weight that she has gained was boob weight and that was only like 2 pounds. <br>\r\n\t\u201cBut, but mam Nicole hasn\u2019t even had been chubby yet why stop when she isn\u2019t even half full\u201d Drizella complained to the spinster, but what she didn\u2019t know is that the spinster was actually trying to see how long could the little girl hold out without any food in her belly and see how long before she starts begging and oinking toward the spinster to feed her. The cart was pushed in front of Cinderella\u2019s bed as she started to bounce up and down in glee of her feeding time since Cinderella had nothing better to do food was her life. \u201cOh boy chocolate my favorite Cinderella said trying to make the spinster happy so food wasn\u2019t forced into her throat like it was for Nicole, \u201csee Nicole this is what a being my piglet gets you, you\u2019ll learn soon enough even if I have to humiliate you a bit, but don\u2019t worry about it for now you\u2019ll be begging me for pie soon, you\u2019re my greatest creation Nicole you\u2019ll see\u201d the spinster chuckled wile feeding Cinderella some cake while getting kisses from her whale. While the spinster fed her first master piece Drizella begun creeping over to Nicole and wispered in her ear, \"don't worry hunny your my piggy I won't let anything bad happen to you\" as she kneaded her washboard belly sending little moans of pleasure to Nicole.

Maybe she did't got much choice but at least she would't make it easy to them. She had a lot of will power. She always loved chocolate and if she had't had so much will power she was sure she would have a potbelly by now. Always training and dieting to have a tiny waist and a trained body that would attract any guy. Sure she had some boyfriends. But not now. That was to bad or else he might try to save her. While thinking about those things she slowly drifted of to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spinster fed Cinderella in the meantime waiting impatient until Nicole would ask for food.

Just a matter of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feed me?\" Cinderella asked. \"Feed me I'm still so hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was no wonder Cinderella was still hungry. She had been forced to eat huge amounts of food every day. Her stomach was stretched out so much it took a lot of food to fill it. Cinderella did't cared any more. She was so fat she could't walk, she could barely move at all. There was no choice she would ever lose all this fat. She could't move so there was no way she could do any form of exercise. A diet could help but she was fed huge amounts fatty food each day. Even if the spinster now had Nicole and could fatten her up that did't want to say the spinster would stop fattening her up. It all started about her. She needed to become so fat that she could't leave and she knew for sure her stepmother would make sure that that happened and the spinster would't forget that. The eating was the only fun thing in her life. It all tasted good so she could find some joy in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it possible that that girl could resist my food? Well at least I know for sure you can't resist my food. Can you?\" The Spinster said and patted the belly of Cinderella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRP!!! More food! More food!\" Cinderella screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Don't worry fat ass. You'll get more food. Your stepmother wants you to be super obese. So fat you can leave. Fatty, fatty two by four can't fit through the front door. That's it. Well you're too fat too fit through any door now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feed me. I still want more food. I'm already immobile so I don't care. Feed me more. I'm so hungry!\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile the spinster fed Cinderella more. <br>\r\nDrizella looked from a distance to Nicole.

While the girls slept down stairs it was dinner time upstairs, Deville and Spinster was nagging on and on about Nicole which perked up the interest of Drizella, but at the same time worried her for there was some sort of spell upon Drizella that was hard to break for the girl was perfect in every way except her weight, it was so low that it made Drizella cry on the inside, \u201cI don\u2019t know what is wrong with that girl I feed her yet she just fights it like it was nothing I must say Deville you have given me quite a present you know she is a tough cooking but I promise by the time I get done with her she will be like a cute obedient piglet whatever you tell her she will be complied to do it\u201d the spinster chuckled as she was feasting on some slightly mushy green beans and a yam and ham casserole that was made in celebrate the of the capture of Nicole and the restraining order that was made in favor of Deville that if Sasha or Nicole\u2019s mother would come within 200 feet of Nicole before her malnourished body  has been taken care of and she is a healthy young woman, even the newspaper of the prince was still looking for the mysterious woman was nothing that affected Deville\u2019s mood it was just a very happy for her and her very wealthy family. \u201cSo spinster have you made your decision on how big you would like to make your new pet?\u201d asked Deville while stirring the sugar into her tea with a malicious grin upon her face while awaiting the answer to her question to be given. With a similar grin upon her face the spinster came up with the answer acting innocently when giving it to Deville, \u201coh just about twenty-five hundred pounds or maybe twenty-seven hundred pounds somewhere around there\u201d stated the spinster in a giddy tune, the old woman didn\u2019t have any other girl in her life that was going to be as big as Nicole, if only she would stop fighting the old woman \u201cNicole will be the biggest woman in the world almost as big as the three year old I fattened up when I was just a young woman, oh that cutie could just eat and eat\u201d she smiled while eating the last of her beans before retiring to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDrizella tell me, do you like Nicole is she nice to you?\u201d Deville asked her daughter with a keen slurp of her tea while awaiting Drizella\u2019s answer, now if anything Drizella was the prettiest girl out of all three of them she was a thin girl long brown hair, hazel eyes supple bottom and chest now she wasn\u2019t as pretty as Cinderella was but at the same time Deville always wondered why her daughter wasn\u2019t with a husband already she was defiantly pretty enough. \u201coh well she\u2019s always nice to me but she doesn\u2019t like Spinster a lot she thinks that the spinster is just an old had she really response to me, I think I almost got her to oink once or it could be my imagination, but I think that Nicole needs another outfit her old one still fits but I know of a cuter one\u201d Drizella chuckled as she droned on and on about Nicole until Deville couldn\u2019t take anymore and understood why Drizella wasn\u2019t married she was a lesbian, now this didn\u2019t surprise Deville but she wasn\u2019t so easy to accept it, for now she will just leave it as it is and not tell anyone, maybe even let her feed Nicole even more often. Mean while everyone else was fast asleep upstairs Drizella volunteered to make sure that the dishes were clean and everything was tidy, but what she really wanted was to actually tell Nicole how she felt creeping downstairs, Drizella made her way down stair slowly and softly all while peering at or trying to see her sleeping beauty from the stairs. When she finally got down stairs she stopped for a moment to just peer at the young girl who was about sixteen but made Drizella\u2019s mind go crazy for her, peering over to the cart of cakes that was left down here she spotted an chocolate mud pie was left behind like a calling for heaven Drizella picked it up and dipped a silver spoon in the pie retrieving a considerable amount of chocolate. \u201cNicole hunny wake up , Nicole I have something to tell you\u201d Slowly waking up Nicole looked around to see if she was home and yet she wasn\u2019t still at feed a lot Nicole saw that she was staring at Drizella who was red and was biting her lip while looking at Nicole. \u201cYeah what do you want to tell me?\u201d she asked in confusion as this softer Drizella is something that was unheard of from the stories Cindy told her. \u201cumm well I just have to tell you ever since I saw you in the marked when I was 16 and you were 14 I loved you\u201d deep red Drizella kissed Nicole\u2019s cheek and blushed a deeper red. Nicole blushing back said well I like you too I just don\u2019t like what your parent is doing to me can\u2019t you let me go and we can run away together?\u201d Nicole tried to persuade her new girl friend but Drizella responded with no I can\u2019t do that I\u2019m so sorry have some or I\u2019ll let you sleep\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew she wanted it but she also knew what it would do with her and she did't want that. She did't want to become fat but it did't looked like if she had a choice.

The pie tasted to good and while it was hold right in front of her face especially after that first delicious bite. She could try to fight it but she knew she would crack soon with every spoon. So why put any effort in it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you really love me?\" Nicole asked between bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes I do. I just never wanted to admit it. You know I had some dates with boys and sure some of them loved me but for some reason I could never discover feelings for a boy and I noticed I did for girls. Especially you. I figured out I was a lesbian. So who cares. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole thought about this. She had feelings for boys. She figured that out but she found out she also had feelings for girls. She never told anyone except her mother who told her she was bi. She did't really minded it and looked at Drizella who again held a spoon full of pie in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be honest I like girls and boys both. So I'm not really a lesbian. I'm bi!\" She said and wondered if she maybe made a very big mistake saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... You're a bi... Close enough.\" Said Drizella with a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was't so bad. Nicole thought. Drizella was kind of pretty. She never used to hang out so much with Drizella and her sister because they were kind of mean, snobby and spoiled. <br>\r\nNicole did't knew how it could be but for some reason she felt butterflies when she looked at Drizella.<br>\r\nShe took again a bite from the delicious pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sorry. We're out of pie. You ate it all like a good piggy.\" Drizella said and kissed Nicole on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee sweet stuff is't there a way you can free me and maybe Cindy too?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Oh no no no! Sorry can't do that. Besides Cindy already escaped once but it was easy getting her back since she is addicted to the food. But I can't let you escape. If I do that my mother and the spinster will know it was me and they will be furious. Then she will kick me out and I won't get a penny from her and I will live on the street covered in filth begging for a penny to buy food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I said: We can run away. There was was no me. Come on can't you free me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. You know my mother. She'll find us. Even if I would free only you she'll find you, and she will be so mad at me.\" Drizella squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can she be sure it was you?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah come it can never be my perfect sister. Stupid brat. She's so pretty. At least she thinks she is. Besides my mother has the strange ability to know when someone is lying. As kid i could never get away with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you really love me... you would't leave me here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know... there is one thing about you... \" Drizella said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What's that?\" Nicole asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. you weight. It's much to low. You need to fatten up a bit. Get a big round belly full of flab... rubbing thighs and a huge ass, and of course flabby arms and a lot of that fat will give you big tits! I also like a fat face with puffy pink cheeks and a head melted to a chest... The best way to get that is to leave you here. Only question is... how do we get rid of the spinster? I'll think about that tomorrow. It's late and I'm sleepy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrizella walked upstairs leaving Nicole alone with Cinderella.<br>\r\nNicole was wondering what to do now. She had feelings for Drizella. She could't deny that. But she wanted her fatter. If she did gain weight would Drizella maybe help her escape? What did she need to do? Gain weight for Drizella or try to keep her figure?     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>a special addiction cake. Made by the spinster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right little piggy.\" Lady Deville said. \"Now eat the cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole did't moved. She did't want to. But a mean kick from lady Deville made her do a few steps forward. But then she stopped again. Normally she loved cake. She never thought anyone would ever force her to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EAT THAT CAKE!\" Lady Deville screamed and kicked Nicole again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole screamed from pain and crawled to the cake and broke of a piece with her hand and stuffed it in her mouth. The next moment lady Deville slapped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't eat it with your hands! You're a pig! So eat like the pig you are!\" Lady Deville screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole cried big tears were rolling over her cheeks that slowly started to puff out a bit. <br>\r\nDrizella looked from a short distance and felt terrible. It was like she felt every kick or hit her mother gave to Nicole, and she knew she could't stop her. She and her sister always had been spoiled girls. Her mother gave them what they want but there never disagreed on something. It was difficult for her. She hated it to see Nicole cry from pain, humiliation and forced to eat what she did't want to. She wanted to run forward to Nicole and comfort her but she knew her mother would't let her do that. There also was something else. She wanted Nicole to be fat. She maybe was't the smartest girl but she knew that this was the best way to make Nicole fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on little piggy. Eat and eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was still standing on hand and knees. She buried her face in the cake while eating it. She knew she should't but lady Deville could kick very hard. She wondered what she had done to deserve this. She missed her old careless live. With her mother and sister. She would probably never see them again. It was even the question if her mother would see any of her daughters again. <br>\r\nThere must be away out of this. But how. She could't escape now. She promised to behave. Not that she cared so much about that promise but she was also stuck to a lease and Lady Deville, the spinster and Drizilla were around. She knew she had feelings for Drizilla and knew Drizilla had the same feelings for her, but she also knew Drizilla wanted her fatter.<br>\r\nIn the basement she was handcuffed twenty-four -seven. So that would't work. She felt how her dress slowly got tighter and tighter.<br>\r\nThen it hit her. Maybe she could do something if she needed to give her new clothes. Run away would be a lost attempt but stealing the key was that an option? No she realized. To much chance they would look for it. Besides how was she suppose to use the key with both of her hands in a cuff. But the cuff's. She could just close them around her wrists without locking them and act like if she was still captured. Then if everyone was asleep she could sneak away. Maybe it would't work but it was worth a try.<br>\r\nBut men this cake tasted good. To good to not eat it. Soon the entire pie was gone in the belly of the poor Nicole. Her belly was bloated and her face covered in remains of the pie.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does the little piggy say?\" Deville asked on a mean tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sighed and looked up and yelled: \"Oink! Oink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good piggy. Now let's get you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left the bakery but Nicole could clearly see Drizilla seemed sad.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

She's just to powerful.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nodded. She knew how lady DeVille was.

Did her mother betray her to get Sasha back. All right she did't thought that was right but she could partly understand her mother. While she was fattened up Sasha was alone in a cold cell. That would be especially hard for a girl that mostly liked it to play outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm!\" Lady DeVille looked up. \"Oh yeah. Our deal about Sasha. I don't know about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promised... You promised I would get her back. Don't you have any honor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine. I will make sure you get Sasha back.

I guess since you lost one daughter by betray her you have right on the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Deville left leaving the mother of Nicole crying. Happy Sasha would come back but sad she had betray her own daughter. <br>\r\nIn the meantime Nicole was taken to the carriage and take back to Lady DeVille's house and was back in the basement and handcuffed again and Lady DeVille made sure they were tight this time. Then she smiled evil at Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my fat little piggy tried to run away.

Hart seven fits on the clover eight.\" Sasha mumbled looking at her card game. \"Men this is so boring If people can really die of boredom I'm sure I'm close to it. Well it could be worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the guards were nice and friendly to her. They never screamed to her and the food was good but there was just nothing to do here and she missed being outside and most of all her mother and sister.<br>\r\nShe sighed and looked at her game again when suddenly her cell was opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky little girl.

No you better start packing your stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha packed her stuff as fast if she could. She also noticed her book.

All while the ladies were preoccupied with the perdiciment of her weight Nicome was silently sobbing at her perdicament for who in thier right mind would belive that thier life would turn out so horribly twisted as her has become, she was studying to be a seamstress like her mother and this was her dream now all that she had was to look forward to was life of a pig. This was deffiantly not the life that Nicole had imagined for her self she always thought she would be swept of her feet by some one who cared not what she looked like but for what she was like on the inside, all this was in vain for apparently that this life was in the past never to be seen again by prying eyes. Sobing agiain at her  sad perdiciment she was thinking about how her family was now safe although her body will not be so lucky this sacrifice will hopfully not be in vain for if it should be her family will suffer, this is somthing that was she new she could belive in for the saftey of her family was more important to her than her  own self presevation. meanwhile upstairs Drizella, her mother, her sister and the spinster were having dinner while discussing matters of nicole for the progress they made with her within the past month was nothing but a depressing state of affairs \"that girl downstairs is the hardest challege I have ever had\" the spinster chuckled as she ate her steak with the up most delicacy, as they all enjoyed thier dinner drizella couldn't stand how can everyone act so calmly knowing that there ae two girls downstairs in the basment being fed without any choice in the matter as drizella spoke up to her mother \u201cuhh mother how is nicole fairing \u201c shuddered at the thought of what was going to happen to her dear lover,  \u201cnot well my dear daughter, it appears that blasted girl has a metabolisim of a geribl its been a month and she only gained five pounds this was somthing that is unacceptable, so for now  the spinster and I have agreed to stop feeding her for the moment for she needs to learn her piggy edicute for the past month with all this running away, and such has made me relize that her mother hasn't taught her anything about being a good piglet so, spinster has made a special training for her to force her to become more pig like and to get rid of her horrible english, no pig should know gods language.

She ate everything we gave her. She gained a huge amount of weight and I just needed her to become immobile. As for Nicole... she's the pet for the spinster. But who knows. If you ask her you might feed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrizella slowly walked downstairs to the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Nicole.\" The spinster said with an evil grin. \"You're only allowed to make piggy noises. Got that? Piggy noises. I want to hear you grunt. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But come on I... \" Nicole started but a sharp pain cut her of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spinster had hit her with a whip. She smiled evil. Nicole could clearly see a red stripe were the whip had hit her. She looked in disbelief at the spinster. She was serious about this. She really wanted that she acted like a piggy. Grunting and of course especially the eating of course since she knew for sure that going to happen afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make piggy sounds now!\" The spinster said while she raised her whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole made grunting sounds while tears were running down over her cheeks. But the spinster seemed pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See. That was't so bad. Now was it.\" The spinster said friendly. \"So you can be a good piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole wanted more than anything to make this stop from happening but the stripe were the whip had hit her still burned from pain. She was afraid the spinster would use it again. Besides just make piggy sounds was't so bad.  she grunted like a piggy while she felt the pain of humiliation. She cried softly and between her tears she thought she could see the spinster smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come over here!\" The spinster yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole slowly stood but the whip was raised and a sharp pain on her back made her fall on hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it. on hands and knees like a real piggy. Good. was does the piggy say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole grunted. She would do anything as long if the spinster would't use the whip any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.

Nicole was still on her hands and knee, in fear of the spinster's whip, Nicole knew that the spinster was daiobolical, but a whip was just plain evil. \"now my dear piglet, when food is offered to you you I suggest you take it or it shall be forced to you, but overall we shall force you for it is the best way to make you gain my darling piggy\" the spinster stated as she chuckled while taking Nicole and tied her to a radiator by her leash \"now stay\" the spinster said as she went upstairs to check upstairs the only thing nicole could say was \"oink\" as her master finally went upstairs, she wonded what fate had instore with her as her life wasn't suppose to be this way and with the spinster in possesion with that whip she had no say in the matter for her life was her's to toy with, meanwhile when she was upstairs the spinster was yelling at drizella and her sister for the cakes that were being made by them all kinds of chocolate was made for cinderella and Nicole from chocolate to cheese, \"where are the cakes my piggies are getting tiresome and that new one isn't one to be trained without constant authority, \"how is the piggy doing Devil asked as she bonked with her stick as she usually did for the attention of everyone within the room, \"what is going on here is it feeding time already?\" The spinster quickly stated to her employer \"not yet my lady we still need to weigh the good piggy and measure her first\" Devil was not happy about that one bit for she knew from just looking at the young girl that she hasn't grown much since her arrival so in an angered huff she said \"fine but after you measure I want her face in a cake at least three cakes in her stomach\" the spinster agreed and begun to measure and noticed that not much has changed just her stomach was a bit rounder and that was about it, with whip still in hand the spinster stated \"who's a good piggy\" reluctant to answer Nicole said \"oink\" as she was chainged into a full pink outfit that was some what sultry and slightly revealing, blushing a bit at her new outfit, the spinster lead her piggy to her trough and said eat up piggy....</span></div></div>",

Was there really no way out of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah now that's a good piggy. Eat up. You like that don't you piggy. You're gonna be a nice, good, fat little piggy, are't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's eyes burned from the tears but the spinster only seemed to enjoy this. But someone else also was very unhappy. Drizella saw what happened and did't liked it. She must admit she liked the idea of Nicole fat. For some strange reason she even did't understand herself the idea of a obese Nicole turned her on. But why did she needed to be tortured so much. The whip, the outfit, the acting like a piggy and now eat from a trough. It went a bit too far in her eyes.<br>\r\nShe looked at her obese stepsister. She never liked her stepsister so much. partly because she always was so beautiful. She looked always better then she or her sister and that was something she could't forgive her. She never showed her stepsister how jealous she was but she was. Her sister also seemed never to mind it to do chorus. No matter what they asked her to do. So she never mind it to fatten her stepsister up. <br>\r\nBut this girl Nicole was something totally different. She loved her. Besides this was't fattening her up, this was just humiliation. All right she at out of the trough so she was gaining but there was no reason to be so mean. Even her stepsister was treated better than this. Why was she so mean to her?<br>\r\nIt seemed like every painful hit with the whip and every humiliation that hurt Nicole hurt her to. In another way maybe but it did. There was no reason to treat her this bad. But what could she do. She did't dared to free Nicole. Even if she did she would be easily captured again just like last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Hurry up eating little piggy. We have more food for you after this. I hope you eat good or else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let he whip made  sound in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else that.

The spinster was busy talking with lady Deville to really see what was going on with her piggy, when she turned to face her piggy she saw Drizella near her piggy with a hand full of cake, this made the the spinster's blood boil, Nicole was her piggy not Drizella's, \u201cdrop that cake she must learn to eat from her trough\u201d spinster yelled with a fluster upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a turn Drizella saw the spinster, looking like a demon the only thin Drizella could do was drop the cake in fear and run up to her room sobbing all the way there, not knowing what to do other than to hide from the spinster at this moment Drizella sobbed to herself what can I do I'm too scared of mom and spinster to do anything\u201d. Meanwhile downstairs, the spinster was petting her piggy and said that she could not wait until Nicole's flat tummy would touch the ground. As she walked away Nicole begun to sob again for she new that this was her fate with a quivering oink Nicole begun to eat once again, \u201cso back to what I was saying before, I think my piggy needs a custom collar just for her with a name tag and everything, do you think you can do that ms.

It's so nice having a little piggy.\" The spinster said. \"When I was little I always wanted a pet but my parents were against it. I need to do chorus and look pretty. That's ll a girl has to do my parents told me. But I never got a husband. Maybe because I was't so good at doing chorus, and because I did't looked as nice if my sister. She got enough attention from men. She already was pregnant at the age of 19. She already...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How miserable your life is that's not why we're here for.\" Lady De Ville said. \"Besides that I don't care. Were here for a collar for that fat pig of you. Please hurry up. My old bones get easily tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrizella sighed softly. She would like it if Nicole was just handcuffed to the bed and force fed. Just like Cindy, who was still down there and was now really huge just like her appetite. Force feeding was't needed anymore by her. Her spirit was broken long ago. It was almost unbelievable how much that girl could eat at a day. That was all what she did. She was immobile. She could't move her arms. She could't wear clothes. Not that it minded. There were several blankets over her body and even without them Cindy's private parts were covered by her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. Does she really need to humiliate Nicole that much?\" Drizella asked carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's up to the spinster is't it?\" Lady De Ville said with a evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought she just needed to become fat. Just handcuff her to the bed and force feed her is fine. It also worked with Cindy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We needed to keep Cindy Immobile because of her money. As for Nicole I don't mind what happens to her. Nicole is property from the spinster. If you have a problem with Nicole or whit how she's treated, talk with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrizella looked painful. She knew very well that the spinster would't ever let Nicole go or treat her better. But who knew. Maybe she and Nicole could be together one day. If the spinster and her mother died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Finally I have one.\" The spinster said and hold a awfully ugly looking pink collar and pink name tag. \"This is perfect for my little piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrizella sighed again.</span></div></div>",

Cindy was a different story she was always hungry for sweets or anything, always demanding more food for her bottomless gullet, Nicole had to admit she was amazed at how much Cinderella could put away a family of twelve could eat all that she could and be entirely full.

She was afraid what the spinster was gonna do to her. Probably something very humiliating. But she knew if she woud't do it or she would feel the whip again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what we're gonna do piggy? We're gonna watch a movie.\" She said friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole started to shiver. She knew very well how mean the spinster was. If she said something on such a friendly tone she could be sure it would be bad for her. The spinster was't someone who would let her show a movie out of the kindness of her hart. Would it be a movie were limbs got teared of and insides were cut out? She hated those movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Nicole... You're not the first person I fattened up. Sure I fattened up Cinderella but even before her I fattened up children. I like fattening up little girls. They look so cute all fat and bloated. I would never forget my first time about a girl I fattened up. She was such a good piggy. Here something to snack on while watching.\" She said and kicked a bowl with some food in  it over to Nicole. \"I always wanted a daughter... but I never found a husband. No one wanted me. Unbelievable because  I thought I looked pretty good when I was younger. Anyway I once found a girl on the street. She was so skinny you could count her ribs I took her in home. Just look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed a remote at the T.V and pushed in the on button and the play button. The screen flickered a few times and lighted up. Nicole saw  little girl. She was blond and looked very pretty in her light blue dress but she was terribly skinny. A bit too thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look now we skip some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she saw the girl. Bit she looked better now. Like she had eaten a few days what was probably what she had done. She saw how the spinster put a plate full of burgers and started feeding her. <br>\r\nNicole saw how the slowly got fatter and fatter. After some time she felt really sick and thought she would rather see a movie with ripped of limbs or insides who were cut out. Could't be worse then this. a cute little girl that was forced to become fat. The fallen in cheeks turned pink puffy and bowl. Her flat belly was now simply huge forming two big juicy rolls with some boobs on top of them. Boobs made of 100% pure fat. Her butt looked like two beach balls.and her rubbing thighs were the size of small tires. Scenes how she ate and got force fed by the spinster and show how fat she was. Finally the girl even turned immobile. The spinster kept smiling the entire time. Suddenly the film ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then came child welfare and she was taken away. Never heard from her again. I wonder what happened. I just wanted her to be fat a happy. She was some sort of daughter for me.\" She said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven while Nicole hated the spinster she could see she was really sad that she did't knew what happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, now I have you.

Grabbing Nicole's leash the spinster lead her into the memory room where Nicole was tied to a post, and just waiting for the spinster to return from the other room \u201cthings were going through Nicole's head like what was the spinster up to and who was that blond girl in the movie any ways,with all these thoughts buzzing in her head she didn't even realize that the spinster was back from the back room with a portable camera and a tripod. Humming a song from her youth while she set up the camera Nicole could only watch as the wicked woman begun to do the last checks upon her machine to make sure it was all up and running. As the red light was  like as sign as she was good to go there was multiple things that the spinster videotaped, like  breasts, belly, but, thighs, arms, even fingers and toes. Next came to the spinster weighing her piggy to see how much the piggy gained, Nicole didn't gain much this was evident by just looking at her probably at best she gained at least 10 pounds, hopefully, the spinster wondered how this girl was still thin and she just didn't know it was a great mystery to her, bun one she will find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hace a surprise for you piggy the spinster stated as she wheeled out multiple outfits all very girls and sultry outfits out infront of Nicole, \u201coink?\u201d Nicole asked as she was inquisitive about the outfits. \u201cthese are all the outfits your master bought for you so you can be as pretty as can be\u201d the spinster was so happy about her piggy she could just jump.

Feeding you by force can be just as much fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole remembered what Cinderella told her. Eat. It maybe was't fun but it was better then get it forced into your throat.

The spinster was a lot younger back then. How long ago had it been? 10 years? Maybe 20 or more? That girl could be  adult by now. Seeing how fat she was at the end of the DVD probably a very fat adult but maybe she lost most of the weight by now. But then she needed to have a lot of extra skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I won't be able to find that girl but I'm sure i can find a girl just like her. I mean come on! There are hundreds of young blond girls. It would't be too hard to find one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrizella decided to look at the playground. There were some kids over there but not a girl she was looking for. Besides there were also some parents. Slowly she walked further. She looked in the toy store. There were some girls that would do but they were hold by their mother. It would't be  good idea if she took  girl in front of her mother. She looked further by the ice cream store but it was the same story. They were always near a adult. No wonder of course you normally did't let girl that young kids ran of on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is ridiculous!\" She yelled. \"I will never be able to find a girl that's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard someone screaming. There she saw the girl. She was perfect. The same blonde hair like the girl. The cute young body but a bit chubbier. But a woman hold her tight by the wrist. Dragging her while she screamed: \"Mommy I want some food! I want fries! I want hamburgers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" The woman screamed. \"From all that junk food you become fat. You don't want to become fat do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care! I want food! Chocolate! Cake! Chicken nuggets! I want them! I want them all in my tummy!\"   <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDrizella grinned. This girl would be perfect. She wanted food well that was no problem. But she was hold tight by hat woman. Maybe her mother but she was't sure since it did't looked like they had anything in common.

Giddy about how her plan was coming together, she got home and her heart just broke as she saw her love being fed again by that awful woman spinster \"who is a good piggy\" the spinster gleefully said as it was another feeding session with nicole, sobbing at the tragdy that was the spectecal, Drizella sobbed at the fact that her girlfriend wasn't her piggy, that old hag was forcing another slice of pie down Nicole's throat. Not being able to watch Nicole being fed by another woman, it was just painful to Drizella. Hoping that there is somthing in her mothers room that could make it so she could exact her revenge upon the spinster, quietly Drizella went upstairs to her mothers room, it had a vintange feel to the room thank goodness that her mother and sister were getting supplies since they were low on food since cinderella did nothing but eat which required lot of food since cinderella was nothing but an eating machine. \"where is it\" drizella whispered to herself as she searched for the document that her mother used to state that nicole was under nourished, searching high and low for it and finally she found the document, so happy that she found the document, reading the document she found out that it stated that any family member of the deville family can enforce the law. Drizella rushed downstairs and out the door and to the police office, once into town Drizella went straight to the police office, with document in hand Drizella went straight to the chief office, the chief of police was a hefty man of his late fourties, while he was eat a dounut when Drizella bursted through the front door of the office stating \"i have a undernourished girl that needs to be apprehended and taken to feedalot\" gleefully smiling Drizella had one problem she did not know where the child lived, this could be a problem but with the police on her side and revenge in her heart it will all be alright<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oink!\" Nicole answered while she was force fed another piece of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was humiliating for Nicole. The spinster really wanted to fatten her up and she slowly had success. Nicole looked at the bugle in her belly from all the food she consumed today. She knew that once it had been digested it would turn into fat on her body. If the spinster would keep this up she would seen look like a real fat pig. She slowly started to think that it did't matter anymore. She was forced to become fat. She needed to talk and act like a pig. Why bother anymore to think. Just think like a pig who mostly thinks about food. This was her life. The only things she needed to do was eat, sleep and wear girly outfits and act like a piggy in front of the spinster. At least she was't tortured. Since she acted like a good piggy the spinster did't used the whip anymore.<br>\r\nThe spinster grinned wicked while she slowly stroke the bugle in Nicole's belly like if she was stroke a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good. It seems like my piggy finally is putting on a little weight is't she. I'm glad you finally do. I was afraid that if you really would't start gaining I needed to take measurements. Then I... Well lets just say you don't wanna know what I would do. But you would't like it. I still don't understand why you struggled so much. Cinderella did't do it. She ate what we gave her. Like a good girl. Look at her now. A Immobile blob that does nothing except eating and sleeping. Men she eats a lot. Well it's of course not like she can't do anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole turned her head and could see the huge shapeless mountain fat that once had been a thin girl. She remembered that before this whole thing started she once now and then saw Cinderella. She was surprised to see how much chorus she needed to do. Sure she and her sister also needed to help at home sometimes but that was nothing compared to what she needed to do. They also got a good meal while Cinderella was fed nothing but some scraps. Even then she still was pretty, nice and friendly. Even to her mother and stepsisters who obvious did't liked her. But with only eating scrap she had always had been thin. There was nothing left of that thin girl. Suddenly Anastasia rolled a cart full with food over to her and started to feed Cinderella. Nicole almost could't believe how fast Cinderella was eating. It seemed like she just did't cared anymore. Maybe it was better if she also did't cared anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now open up my dear piggy. You still need to eat a lot. After that I will dress you in a nice other girly outfit. What do you think about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink! Oink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Anastasia suddenly screamed. \"Where's Drizella? You can't expect me to feed that unbelievable obese girl all by myself. I think she would even be able to eat a entire elephant and still wants more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where Drizella is! Now stop complaining and feed that fat ass of your stepsister!\" Lady DeVille's voice sounded from upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole also wondered where Drizella was. There was one part that liked or even loved Drizella but she still was't 100% sure if she could trust her. She still wanted her fatter and that time when she did escape she warned her mother and he spinster. Fine she still did't dared to do something against her mother's will or the spinster's will but perhaps if she was on her own she would't be so evil. Where was she?<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She was't able to say a single word. This girl looked so much like the girl she once fattened and deep in her hart still missed. How could she... Then she remembered how much Drizella wanted to fed Nicole and she also remembered that she left the DVD right in he player so everyone could see it. Drizella wanted to fed Nicole but because she made Nicole her personal piggy and she  alone could feed her so Drizella looked for a girl that looked just like the girl she once fattened just to tease her. She knew this but knew it was better to act like if she did't knew. She slowly got calm again and looked angry at Drizella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" She asked on a whispering tone full of hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I found this girl and I think her mother does't take good care of her, and since we're allowed to feed poor girls if we think they don't get enough food I thought to take her here as well.

She wanted to feed this girl too just like the other girl she once had, but also knew that Drizella would't let her just feed her.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

A mean boy once said that a kid once ate and drink to much that lead him to an early grave. Now he's in hell force fed rat's toads and snakes. Did god punished her this way. Had she been so greedy that God decided she had to become a piggy. She wondered where the two other girls were here for.

That adorable fat blond...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice of the spinster trailed of just like her memories. Nicole even thought she saw a tear in one of her eyes. She even looked a bit more human. One side of her felt bad for the spinster since she really seemed to love that girl. But at the other hand it was also her own fault that she fattened that girl. Else things might be going a lot different right about now. Then perhaps she would be at home with her mother and her little sister playing with some toys. That little girl Ashley would still be at home with her family, and Cinderella... Well she would probably still be here. But at the other hand, There was't much left of that once thin, beautiful, lovely and sweet girl. Her size increased just like her appetite. The only thing she cared about was food, and she ate a lot. Well no wonder. If you saw how big she was. She had a big belly to fill. She looked a lot like a shapeless blob. Growing bigger each day.<br>\r\nBut like things were going this way she would probably end up just like her. Well she was supposed to be a piggy. She should perhaps crawl around on for legs while her belly dragged over the floor. That would't take much longer. She was well aware of that. Her belly was hanging lower and lower, more reaching to the ground each day. Soon it would happen. What after that. She had no idea. Keep eating until she literally outgrew her legs. Possible. With someone so wicked as the spinster you never knew.<br>\r\nSuddenly the spinster entered her room again. She was so lost in thoughts she even did't realized she left. The spinster had a mean grin.

She did't looked good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello honey, how are you doing?\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can't answer.\" The spinsters loud voice said. \"She's a piggy. The only thing she can do is:  Oink! Come on. Oink for your mother you ungrateful piggy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink! Oink! Oink!\" Nicole squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what do you mean? She is't a piggy. She's a human.\" Nicole's mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore. Now she's a piggy. She can't say anything else then Oink. She walks on for paws she even eats like a pig.\" She put a hand on Nicole's yummy and rubbed the upcoming fat. \"This is just the start. She's gonna become way fatter. You must eat enough to become a good piggy. I'm gonna make you really fat. You gonna weigh at least a ton!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you want her to fatten up until she's at least a ton?\" Nicole's mother asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you can't... can't do that.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you bet we can. We need to make sure she eats enough.\" The spinster said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's mother burst out into tears when she heard this she fell on her knees and bend over too Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Nicole I'm so sorry.

Nicole's mother was very teary when hearing this news can her daughter ever forgive her, the only reason why this was placed upon Nicole was that Sasha was kept under lock and key in a cell thanks to Lady Deville, with a chuckle the spinster was just enjoying the sweet agony that Nicole's mother was in it was quite delicious to watch. \u201cwhy are you doing this to my precious daughter, she has not wronged you in any way\u201d the mother pleaded with lady Deville to stop this insanity that was being pushed upon Nicole. With a coy chuckle and a smile spread upon her face  lady Deville begun to speak to the scared mother in a soft almost gentle tone to her it was actually quite unlike her to speak this way to people, \u201cbecause my dear, you pissed me off\u201d shocked that this was her entire fault, this whole thing that has happened to her daughter was cause she had to stand up for whats right and make this evil woman mad \u201cI am so sorry Nicole I didn't mean for any of this to happen\u201d with a saddened \u201coink\u201d Nicole understood what her mother was saying but it did happen and now Nicole was going to have to be at least a ton to repay her mother's sin towards lady Deville. \u201cthis is delicious\u201d the old had stated petting her piglet on the head and giving her a kiss, \u201cdo not worry my dear, your daughter has a wonderful master and she won't talk like a human in a long time\u201d with another chuckle the spinster was enjoying Nicole's mother's tragedy that she unknowingly inflicted upon her daughter with out her knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMeanwhile in the other section of the basement Drizella was still training her piglet Ashley, yet Ashley was having a hard time understanding how to act like a piggy it was quite confusing to her it was so foreign to her, she never really liked playing and animal role when she was at home with her baby sister, Drizella was wondering what she could do to make sure that Ashley got this into her head that under no circumstances can she walk on two ever again, or talk in the human tongue ever again this is her duty if she wants food. Drizella silently looked at Ashley, she was quite a beautiful girl her pale skin thin body blue eyes and long blond hair it was quite a treat to see this girl when she got older she was going to be a heart breaker to the boys, too bad Drizella had to use her as a pawn to a acquire the love of her life. That was actually the greatest tragedy but at least now she was being taken care of  by one of the richest people in the land. Drizella still in trance when looking upon Ashley she was knocked out of her trance when her mother called her name this made her mad and scared at the same she didn't like her mother very much but at the dame time she knew not to cross her in anyway for she would feel her wrath, that was something that Drizella didn't wish on anyone for her mother was a very vindictive person she would find what you care about the most and use it to bend it to her will, this is why Drizella doesn't have enough courage to go against her mother. \u201cwell it looks like mother wants to see us Ashley looks like, remember your a piglet not human anymore don't speak human tongue in front of mother\u201d, \u201coink\u201d the girl answered with vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith leash in hand Drizella walk to where her mother was at she was at a slow pace for she didn't want to see her mother too soon, it was something Drizella begun to dread, she was finally seeing her mother for what she really was and it was something that she didn't like. When finally getting to the room where her mother was she saw that the spinster and her was chuckling as a woman was sobbing and holding Nicole, cradling her in between the woman's arms, finally Drizella recognized the woman as Nicole's Mother, saying to herself Drizella stated \u201cthis is just cruel punishment\u201d, \u201cyou wanted to see me mother?\u201d Drizella said with a grim face. \u201cyes my dear child I wanted to inspect Ashley again and ask you how old this girl is?\u201d, Drizella responded with \u201cI believe I am getting her to act like a piggy in a decent amount of time for a girl of her age, also mother I don't know her exact age I believe she is no more than four, it is my understanding that she Is two close to three, but I am unsure\u201d Nicole's mother looked up and saw the little girl and asked \u201cand how big are you gonna make that one you monster?\u201d</span></div></div>",

She Always used to be a bit greedy girl that Always wanted more food. Especially sweet and greasy stuff and now she got fed with every kind of sweet and greasy stuff and all she had to do is act like a piggy. She admit that she did't really liked acting like a piggy. She liked it more to act like a princess. But as long if she would get all the food she wanted she did't mind acting like a piggy. Her older cousin many times said she was a pig because she was chubby.<br>\r\nAshley must say that she liked Drizella. She would do her best to act like a good piggy so Drizella would stay the one feeding her. She really did't want the spinster to be the one feeding her but also saw that Lady DeVille wore the pants here. If she thought Drizella did a good job at feeding Ashley and let treat her like a piggy she thought everything would be all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You people are sick. How can you do this to her and your own daughter?\" Nicole's mother screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stepdaughter.\" Lady DeVille said while raising her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you husband. What would he think. If he saw what you did to his daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he is't here now... is he? He's dead. Do you really think I wanted a stepdaughter. However I must admit she used to be a good servant but this is better. Putting her in such misery is better for my soul. Now you saw your daughter... I think it's time for you to go. Nicole say goodbye to your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink! Oink!\" Nicole squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now spinster could you please help her leave. If she causes trouble ask Anastasia for help. I'm busy. Now Drizella let's see our new piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrizella put Ashley on the bed. Ashley sat on her ands and knees and looked up at Lady DeVille with her sweetest look. Putting her sweetest look worked on most other people. She could look so sweet it melted every ones hart. Question was if Lady DeVille had a hart.<br>\r\nLady DeVille was't impressed by the sweet look. She looked so cold that Ashley believed water would froze when she was near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk piggy!\" Lady DeVille command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley remembered everything that was told her and remembered also that Nicole only made pig noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink! Oink!\" She squealed happy. \"Oink! Oink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady DeVille looked around her. Looked at the empty plates she mumbled softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. On four legs. That's good. She makes pig sounds and it seemed like she has eaten a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked closer too Nicole and noticed the girls chubby belly and felt it a bit and pushed in it making it jiggle.  Ashley was a bit afraid what might happen while she kept looking sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. She looks kind of happy. But further I must say she acts like a good piggy. For now. Fine you can keep that little brat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley almost opened her mouth to say she was not a little brat but a warning look of Drizella made her stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But just remember my dear daughter. Like I said you could keep her, but if I find out she's not acting good enough like a piggy I might change my mind. The spinster would keep an eye on you.\" Lady DeVille said and looked at Ashley's belly. \"Seems like she has a bit of a head start on Cinderella and Nicole. I hope she fattens up nice. But it seems you did a good job on training her like a piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you mother.\" Drizella said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if you will excuse me... I'm gonna take a hot bath. That's good for my old bones and muscles.\"  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSlowly she left with a: Bonk! noise from her stick. Leaving the two of them alone. Drizella looked down at Ashley. Her own piggy.

The spinster knew that sooner or later Drizella would have to mess up with the girl, for the spinster knew that Drizella wouldn't be able to keep that girl in line for too long, she is too kind hearted to make sure that the girl oinks and eats all she gives her, she couldn't even bear it when the spinster did it to Nicole how would she be able to do it to a girl who is as young as Ashley, chuckling at the fact that Drizella might fail within the first week for Drizella was a weak willed girl who couldn't subjugate another person to do what she wanted them to do. As the spinster was lost in her thoughts Nicole took this time to actually look at her Body and how it was changing, as with every meal shew would be forced to eat she came closer to being the pig that the spinster wanted nothing but a ton sized pig, Nicole was fed the same sweets, she always was fed with the same food it isn't that it isn't delicious it's more like it's just boring for Nicole, but these thoughts were the least of her problems. After seeing her mother things that Nicole had locked away such as feelings for her mother and sister started to surface, it started to well up inside her and she didn't know how to stop the tears that she knew that were going to be upon her no matter what she did, as she figured the seeing of her mother started to bring back memories of her simple life as it slipped away and the cold bony touch of the spinster begun to make her return to the frame of mind, that she was still stuck in feed a lot and still a pig, tears begun to pour from her chubby face she didn't want to be a ton she wanted to see her mother more often and her little sister, this is all she wanted to do but she knew in her heart that this will never happen she will only be a piglet the rest of her life and that\u2019s it, there is no future for a girl like her.<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon't cry my dear here have some cake in your trough\u201d the spinster said while petting Nicole in a caring way that made Nicole freak out a bit kissing Nicole\u2019s cheek as she ate and started to act very motherly to the piglet that was now Nicole petting her long golden hair fixing her panties and dress to make her look proper as Nicole ate was the job that was the spinster took upon herself to do even though she didn't think the spinster could emote real emotions and this was just a ploy to make sure that Nicole wouldn't be on her guard for the next force feeding. Not taking any of this sweetness that the spinster was portraying Nicole kept her shields up just in case it was another trick that the spinster thought up, \u201chmm, wonder how old that Ashley girl is she is quite thin for a girl her age\u201d the spinster started to say to her self as Nicole ate, I guess there will need another trough put in for the little one I'll talk to lady Deville about it in the morning\u201d the spinster still spacing out about Ashley she didn't even notice that Nicole stopped eating at one point. \u201cI guess its bed time my little piglet\u201d the spinster stated as she leashed her piglet and led her to her bed and cuffed her to it, looking at the new girl in her bed that was right next too Nicole's she saw the thin girl next to her and felt sorry for the little girl, \u201c hi I'm Ashley who are you\u201d Ashley asked nicely as Nicole...</span></div></div>",

You get the life of a pig which only purpose is to become as fat as possible in the shortest time. But Lucky enough they're not gonna eat you. You think you only need to act like a piggy... oh no... You need to become a piggy. Act like a piggy twenty four seven. You can't act like a human anymore. After a long time... You don't know how to act human anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... that's what's gonna happen to me?\" Ashley asked who now got a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. I wish I could help you but I can't move anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I get a lot of tasty fatty food?\" Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet. They want you to get fatter for some strange reason. But I must admit they feed you tasty food. Tasty food is more fattening. That's the only good thing in here. At least Drizella feeds you. She's way more nice then the spinster. That woman is wicked. Anyway you can better start oinking. If the spinster or Lady DeVille notice you're talking the spinster will be in charge of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want too. I don't like her. I like Drizella.\" Ashley said scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you need to act like a piggy as good if you can. Stop talking and start Oinking. Walk on four and not on two and do exactly what you are told to do.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked at the sealing wondering what had happened to her. Acting like a piggy and become a piggy was't something she liked. But she liked eating. Especially tasty and greasy food. She liked eating because of the taste but it was also some sort of hobby. She liked it to eat if she was bored. She would get a lot of delicious food. As long if Drizella would be in charge of her she thought it would be okay. But she need to act like a piggy. She wondered if Drizella wanted this too.<br>\r\nA snoring in the direction of Cinderella told her Cinderella fell asleep. Ashley decided to try to make the best of it.

They probably won't recognize her with this body but just to be sure. <br>\r\nIt looked like everyone in the city was invited. Every girl wore the prettiest dress they could find and every man wore his best suit. <br>\r\nThen she saw the prince sitting next to his parents but strangely enough he seemed kind of bored while every single girl (and even some who were't single) tried to get his attention. Also the prince personal servant and good friend was standing to his side smiling friendly at every girl.<br>\r\nCinderella slowly walked to the prince. The prince suddenly stood up and said to his servant: \"Let's go outside to get some fresh air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderella slowly followed them while the walked to the balcony. Cinderella hide and listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My prince did you saw a girl you like? That was the point of this whole ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No i did't. I know my parents hoped that i would find a girl at the ball but... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My prince there are so much beautiful young girls inside. There must be at least one you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point is that all those girls are... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderella bend closer. she did't want to miss a single word. If she heard what the prince would like then she could act if she was a girl he liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Are so thin! I want a fat girl. A girl that does't coun't calories. Who likes it to be fat. But this are all toothpick girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderella felt like someone just hit her on the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He likes fat girls and i used my one wish to make me... oh stupid, stupid, stupid!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bumped her head a few times against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it. Why does every girl want to look like a skeleton?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because thin is in my prince. Every one believes thin woman are beautiful just like your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i do like fat girls. Bigger is better. Could't i change the way how girls need to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you can when you are king. Let's go back inside my prince. I'm sure there will also be a few fat girls inside.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but even those count calories and try to become slim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderella fast walked away so they did't see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great i have a toothpick body finally and then it appears those prince only likes fat girls. I would have more success with my old body. But that spell wears off at midnight so then... oh wait i can't or else my stepsisters and stepmother will see me and recognize me for sure. But maybe i can avoid them. But weight can change. What if i just try that i am a thin girl that tries to become fat. Just take some fatty food in each hand and say something about try to get fatter and then the prince will walk straight too me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to the balcony and went sitting and let the air cool off her heated brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Cindy now pull yourself together. Think. What is the smartest thing to do. Just wait until midnight or try too be a girl that wants to get fat. I will become fat anyway so what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

If i won't be able to do them anymore you and your sister need to do them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time Cinderella saw a little piece of doubt in her sister. She was still pushing cake in her mouth but she was thinking. Cindy was right. She did all the chores. When she was here she could't do any chores. She could count one plus one. However her outcome was three. But she knew that as long if her stepsister was stuck on this bed she could't do the chores anymore and someone else need to do them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder sister how good you will be in swiping the house clean. Or doing your laundry. Or doing the dishes. I guess now we have two big eaters in the family there will be a lot of plates to clean.\" She grinned evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That man can do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. that guy is hired to cook food to fatten me up. Not for the dishes. Besides it's hard getting chocolate of from plates. I know. I have done it several times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stepsister shoved her last piece of chocolate in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you better take a nap and let all that food digest because the next time you will get even more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave Cinderella the sleeping pills and in a few minutes her sister was in dreamland. She was breathing softly. Her stepsister rubbed her tummy. She was before told to do that so her sister could hold more food. She could feel her sisters blubber when rubbing her belly thinking about all the food what was in it she became a little jealous. Cinderella did't need anything to do. Just be in bed the whole day eat as much food if you could eat and some more. She liked to eat food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonk! Bonk! Bonk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. The fat pig finally is asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom she is the same size i am. Does that mean i'm also a fat pig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not honey. But she will be one soon. You know how i like to think about the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom... i was thinking. When Cindy is here... who is going to do all the chores around the house? She can't do them if she's immobile. And if it takes a year to fatten her up that much i mean we can't wait a year before our house will be cleaned right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Very good from you. So that's why you get to do some of her chores.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why do i have... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister will also get some chores. Think about the money. It's to important.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd she looked smiling at her fat growing stepdaughter.</span></div></div>",

So good in fact each one of them sported a nice little tummy, especially given their diet... which had more than just berries or fish. Yes dear reader, they were grizzly to the core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day,  Papa had made a huge pot of porridge and needed to let it cool, so the three went for a walk to build up an appetite. Not long after however,  the home had a guest: a girl with curly blonde hair named Goldilocks.  She was a greedy and curious girl who loved to go into others houses. She also loved to eat. And eat. And...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get the idea. She had a tummy already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she smelled the rich porridge laced with honey and sugar, it lured her in.

It seemed an entire feast had been laid out. Porridge, eggs, bacon, potatoes, a small mountain of pancakes. Everything she could possibly want was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoldilocks wasted no time sitting down and digging into the meal. She was not a very considerate girl and didn't particularly care that she was not only invading someone else's home or eating their food. She started by taking a little of everything and ravenously ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, she didn't notice the family of bears watching her eat through the window. The three bears may have been good cooks, but their efforts were all used towards getting their absolute favorite food: fresh meat. Papa and Mama cooked and baked to lure in greedy and hungry humans, which they would later serve on their own table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, like all their best meals, they needed fattening up. After all, they deserved it. These were greedy and selfish people anyway who would've just broken into someone else's home and eaten them out of house and home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMama and Papa watched with glee as Goldilocks ate more and more of their spread. She would make a fine meal indeed. She ate without a care in the world. She would be easy to fatten up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Goldilock's pace had slowed. That, or she was starting to run out of food on the table. Still, she had managed to stuff herself pretty well. After cleaning the last plate, she sat back and rubbed her swollen middle. Whoever lived here, they sure could cook, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a meal like that, Goldilocks started to feel pretty tired, and she got up looking for a place to rest. Like a stuffed, Christmas goose, Goldilocks waddled about, looking for a comfortable place to lay down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she found several chairs in the living room. At first she tried the biggest one, but it was far too hard. The second one was soft, but a little too soft. She sunk right in. The littlest chair felt fairly right to her. It was a bit of a tight squeeze with her belly full. It seemed like this would work, until she heard a horrible creaking sound coming from the chair. Instantly, it broke underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was a bit of a setback, she thought. Struggling to get to her feet, Goldilocks decided to try the bedrooms. She wanted to take a nap anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the bedroom, she found three beds. She already knew the outcome if she tried the first two. She went to the little bed first. She tried it cautiously, making sure it too did not suffer the same fate as the chair. This bed seemed sturdier and she laid back in it to sleep off her food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, the bears snuck back in the house, looking over the damages. \"I've never seen one eat that much,\" Papa Bear muttered, looking at the pile of dirty dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She broke my chair!\" Baby Bear wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother patted his shoulder. \"We'll get you a new one. This was a good sign. She's already pretty big to start with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey crept up the stairs to look over Goldilocks. Mama Bear lightly poked her stuffed belly. \"Oh, she'll do nicely,\" she said, practically licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPapa Bear crossed his arms. Just how to go about this...</span></div></div>",

I like to eat.\"<br>\r\n\"It's time for you to become slim lady.\"<br>\r\nHer little brothers John and Michiel looked at their father.<br>\r\n\"And what if i don't want to become slim. What if i want to become fa..\"<br>\r\n\"Don't even say that! You should be old enough to know what's good for you! How do you expect to find a man who likes you when your fat?\"<br>\r\n\"I heard stories about fatter land. There you need to be fat to find a nice man.\"<br>\r\nJohn and Michiel both closed their eyes. They both knew that their sister now really crossed the line. Their dad don't wanted his daughter to be fat or talk about some fairy land out a book. He hated both things.<br>\r\n\"I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANOTHER WORD ABOUT A STUPID FAIRY LAND WHERE YOU NEED TO BE FAT! YOU NEED TO BECOME SLIM! END OF STORY!\"<br>\r\nHer mother took a deep breath. If her husband felt this way there was no backtalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night Wendy looked in her fairytale book about fatter land while her brothers were playing.<br>\r\n\"Women in fatter land need to become fat to get a husband. And man need to feed girls and women.\"<br>\r\nEvery kind of girl and women in the book were fat. The mermaids and the Indians. But they sure looked happy. There was a big smile on their fat faces.<br>\r\nJohn looked over his sister's shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Wendy give it up. Dad will never let you become fat. Does't matter what you think.\"<br>\r\n\"And every time you start about it he becomes angry!\" Michiel said.<br>\r\n\"That's only because he doesn't take me how i am.\"   <br>\r\n \"You better hide the book because if he sees you reading that he will explode.\"<br>\r\nWendy closed the book and wanted to put it in the closet when the door opened. Wendy was so scared she dropped the book.<br>\r\nMichiel was maybe the youngest of the kids but smart enough to know that their father may not find the book so he kicked it under the bed.<br>\r\nTheir father walked in.<br>\r\n\"What were you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Eh talking about some things for exercise so Wendy can lose weight.\" Michiel said.<br>\r\nJohn looked at his little brother. He was smart for his age.<br>\r\n\"Well then thats good. Just keep it up.\"<br>\r\nNot one of the kids noticed the dark figure by their window except for the dog Nana. She was also the nanny for the kids and watched them. She jumped at the figure. But he was to fast to catch but not fast enough and Nana grabbed his shadow.<br>\r\nJust the their mother walked in and saw the shadow Nana hold between her jaws. <br>\r\n\"What's this?\" She asked while she took the shadow.  <br>\r\nShe lifted her shoulders and rolled up the shadow and put it in a drawer.<br>\r\n\"Will you three behave when were gone?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure mom. Don't worry. I will look after them.\" Wendy said.<br>\r\n\"I know honey. And no late night snacking. You need to know your father wants best for you. He does what he thinks thats best.\"<br>\r\n\"Thats just the problem with dad. What he thinks. But how about what i think?\"<br>\r\n\"I will try talking to your father all right. Maybe after some wine he starting to take it a little more easier.\"<br>\r\nShe left the room and a little later Wendy John and Michiel went to bed. After that the dark figure appeared again at the window with something that first seemed like a little ball of light. When you looked better you could see it was a fat fairy. She looked like a small melon. She was almost perfectly round. Her arms and legs disappeared in her fat body. Only her head, hands and feet stuck out of her body. She was having nice wings that were strange enough able to carry her. Her whole body gave light. That's why she first looked like a ball of light.<br>\r\nThe figure hoped in the room.<br>\r\nNow you could see he was a boy. He wore a green jacket, pants and hat with a red feather.<br>\r\n\"Come on think he whispered.    </span></div></div>",

Angry he closed another drawer. <br>\r\nThe little Michiel woke up and saw the boy. He did't start to scream but calm walked out of bed and walked over to Wendy's bed and shook her shoulder until she woke up.<br>\r\n\"Michiel what is it?\"<br>\r\n\"There is a boy in our room.\"<br>\r\nWendy looked up and saw the boy.<br>\r\n\"Ah finally i have him. Tink. Where are you?\"<br>\r\nMichiel heard some noises out of a drawer and opened it. The pixie flew out and started to make a lot of angry peeping noises to the boy. Strangely enough he seemed to understand the peeping noises.<br>\r\n\"Sorry i did't noticed you got in that drawer. Look i got my shadow back. But it still is't attached to my feet.\"<br>\r\n\"Hello! Who are you?\" Wendy asked.<br>\r\nThe boy looked up and noticed the two kids.<br>\r\n\"Oh hello. Don't mind me. I'm just here to get my shadow. but he did't want to stay stuck to my feet.\"<br>\r\n\"Well maybe i can attach you shadow to your feet.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" <br>\r\n\"Sure.\" She took a needle. \"Michiel wake up John please.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay Wendy.\"<br>\r\nWendy looked like a tailor while she attached the shadow back to the boys feet.<br>\r\n\"I know you. I saw you in my book. You Peter Pan right.\"<br>\r\n\"Yep. That's me. All girls like me because i can give them the best food.\"<br>\r\nThe pixie looked angry at Wendy.<br>\r\n\"Oh and thats Tinkerbell. Just call her Tink.\"<br>\r\nTink put her nose in the air and turned her back to Peter.<br>\r\n\"She is a little jealous.\"<br>\r\n\"So you really come from fatter land?\" Michiel asked.<br>\r\n\"Sure! If you don't believe me you can come with me. At my home i have some girls that liked to be fed.\"<br>\r\nWendy smiled. <br>\r\n\"I like to be fed!\"<br>\r\n\"I thought you would like. That's one of the reasons i first got here.\"<br>\r\n\"But how can we come with you if we can't fly?\" Michiel asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh it's easy to fly. You need to close your eyes think of something that makes you happy and then you can fly.\"<br>\r\nThe three kids closed their eyes and thought of something that would make them happy but the did't flew an inch.<br>\r\n\"Why does't it worked?\" Michiel asked.<br>\r\n\"Strange. Why... I know! We forget something. Dust!\"<br>\r\nConfused they asked: \"Dust?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep! Some fairy dust.\"<br>\r\n And he grabbed Tinkerbell an shook her like if she was some salt.<br>\r\n\"So. Now try again.\"<br>\r\nAnd this time Wendy and her brother could really fly.<br>\r\nTinkerbell face turned from red because of anger to green from jealousy. <br>\r\nPeter flew out the window and the three kids followed him.<br>\r\nWendy liked the flying. The wind through her hair. It was one of the best things that ever happened.<br>\r\nPeter flew above the city. Wendy and her brothers never before had a chance to look     from above at their city and they loved it.<br>\r\nFinally Peter decided that is was enough and he flew right up in the air. Wendy, John and Michiel followed him. And also Tinkerbell but also her light was turning from red to green.<br>\r\nThey flew right through the clouds. For a moment Wendy was afraid they loosed each other but then she her brothers and Peter appeared above the clouds. <br>\r\nAnd there it was. Fatter land. With his forests, open fields, seas and all the other things not to forget the delicious food.<br>\r\nThey flew over the water. Wendy saw some mermaids. They happily waved at Peter. Their human half was fat with big round bellies that stopped at their fishtail so it looked like they were hanging over there waistbands.<br>\r\n In the forest Wendy saw some girls with green dresses and leafs in their hair also with big belly's, thighs, puffy pink cheeks, fat arms and butt.<br>\r\nThey smiled at her and waved with their sausage fingers.<br>\r\nWendy waved back but Peter took her. They flew into a hollow tree and appeared in a room. <br>\r\n\"Here do i live. Hey kids. come say hello to our new members.\" <br>\r\nThe kids were all...    <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

The only thing that bothered her was: If she looked so cool then why did Peter and the other guys liked Wendy so much. Maybe it was her hair color. <br>\r\nWendy and her brothers were back home now and she was glad they were. She giggled softly. She knew she was sometimes acting a bit bitchy that was just who she was but she also had her good sides.<br>\r\nStill she wondered what was so much better about Wendy compared to size they both had long legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I even have bigger boobs then her so why... why did he liked her so much? Is it just because she is a not important human girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she was't completely fair. Wendy never had been mean to her but still she was jealous. One of her less nice sides. <br>\r\nShe looked outside and saw the boys were going outside. She stretched herself once and flew also outside. She looked around were Peter was. Now Wendy was gone he must put his attention back to her. She fast flew around and saw him on the top of a tree. Happy she flew too him on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Peter. How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Tink. You know i miss Wendy. She was such a good mother.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTinkerbells light turned from yellow into blood red and her face also looked very angry. Peter did't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope everything is all right with her. Maybe we should visit her. See how she does right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTinkerbell shook her head with her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Tink don't be so mean. I know you did't really liked her but what did she ever do too you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing that's the problem. Else i could hate her for that.\" She thought too herself but did't said it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry she flew away back too her small house inside she closed the door and angry went sitting on bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it. Finally she is gone and still she annoys me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to one of her closets and pulled out a small jar. Well small for a human. For a fairy it was pretty big. About the size of a acorn and to the edge full with honey. She took a small spoon and put it deep in the honey and started to eat. She felt really depressed. Her spoon kept going down in the Honey from time too time.<br>\r\nSuddenly she looked in the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What empty? That can't be. There must be a hole in it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She looked but found no hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did i really ate it all? No that can't be. Or can it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flew over to her mirror and saw her belly was pushing out a bit forward. Not that anyone should notice but she noticed since she looked less then an hour ago to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well every fairy get's a bit hungry every now and then. What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did't want to see Peter now. She decided to fly a bit around Neverland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once upon a time in a far away land, there was a peacefully kingdom. The King and the Queen loved their country and so they threat everyone very good. Since a few years both the King and the Queen desired nothing more than a son or a daughter. A long time it looked like it would never become true, but then finally the Queen became pregnant and gave birth to a beautiful little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe royal family was so happy about it that they planned to hold a big party just for her daughter. They even wanted to invite the thirteen powerful fairies which lived in the country. But unfortunately they had only 12 golden plates for them and a fairy wouldn't accept anything other than a golden one. They tried to get a 13th one, but there was no way they could get any before the day of the party. A decision was made by them, only 12 of the fairy's were invited to the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen finally the day of the great party to celebrate the birth of princess came and the entire kingdom happily enjoyed the day with celebrating. Even the 12 fairy's accepted the invitation and traveled to the kingdom to bless the little princess. The little princess was so cute that the fairy's even blessed her with their magic.<br>\r\nThey blessed her with things like health, beauty and a long life and the royal family was really proud. Its rather rare that the fairy's bless someone with their magic and now even 12 of them did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dawn came and the party came nearly to the end, but all of sudden a cold mist overcame he kingdom and a evil presence fulfilled the air. The doors of the great ballroom were pushed open and all the party guests, fairy's and the royal family say that the last uninvited fairy entered. She looked pissed a little because she heard about the party and even that all fairy's were invited except of her. That's the part the story really starts:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for interrupting the party, but I think their was a unhappy accident. It really looks like I am the only one who IS NOT invited to this party\"<br>\r\nThe Fairy said and walked into the room. All the guest got a huge fright as they saw her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the black fairy and not really a fairy, she was rather a cross breed of a human and a fairy. Unlike a fairy which was only half as tall as a human, she was with 10 foot nearly twice the size. And she was also much bigger than a normal fairy. She looked like 300 pounds heavy but everything was well placed,  Huge boobs, a wide potbelly and a even wider hip with a round and plump butt. And on top of that her light blue skin was folds and cellulite free. Her tush length raven black hairs flapped as she walked even neared to the King and the Queen. Her outfit was the most shocking thing for the most. A mix of nothing with fabric. Most of her skin was visible and only her breasts and her crotch was really covered by her outfit. But the uncovered fat on her huge belly, her massive ass checks and giant rack was wobbling and quivering like jelly as she walked. All the people made a bow around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess my invite got lost on the way to me, so I am willing to accept your apologizes\"<br>\r\nShe said selfishly and looked down to the cradle with the little princess.<br>\r\n\"Wow! She is really cute!\" <br>\r\nThe fairy yelled surprised and kneed down to the little baby which was only as Big as her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeelll... I think...\"<br>\r\nThe King said nervously and tried not to provoke her, because she was known as the most powerful under the fairy's<br>\r\nBut he was interrupted by one of the other fairy's<br>\r\n\"Stay away from her Piggy!\" she shouted to the dark fairy and flew in front of her to block the way to the princess. <br>\r\nBecause of the presence of the other eleven fairy's she didn't had to fear her, because the united strength of 12 fairy's was more then enough to bring her down in the case of emergency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't invited because you are ugly!\"<br>\r\n\"And the people fear you!\"<br>\r\n\"Go away your presence is destructing the mood of the party\"<br>\r\nThe other fairy's yelled at her mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled the dark fairy opened her eye's and stood up from the ground. Suddenly the air started to heat up and her step caused a little earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IS THAT TRUE WHAT THEY ARE SAYING!\" She shouted angrily to the King and risen up in her full size in front of him. Sweat appeared on his forehead and he didn't know what he should say. The 12 fairy's also looked at him awaiting his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... You know... the people are afraid of you. Sooo\"<br>\r\nHe tried to say but then the dark fairy snapped out.<br>\r\n\"OKAY! I understand! I am NOT Welcomed here. I will leave your god damned party but at least I will give your daughter my special blessing!\" she shouted really pissed and looked down to the cradle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her huge hand she pushed the other fairy away and opened her the path to the baby.<br>\r\n\"I bless your daughter with my powers! When she reach the age of seventeen she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel which will cause her a insatiably ravenous hunger for at least 100 years!\" she spelled and a red flash appeared in the cradle which lighten up the entire castle. Before the other fairy's could stop her, she already disappeared in a red dust and all what was left was a loud evil laughing echo of her which passed through the ball room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe royal family was horrified about the things that happened and the party was forced to an end. The fairy's insured them that they will force her sister to lift the bless (More a curse) of her daughter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The time flew by and slowly they forgot about the curse of the dark fairy. The princess got the name Hannah and raised up happily with her parents. They spend a lot of time with her and she had a very happy youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly 17 years passed by and the birthday of Hannah came even nearer. Slowly the memories of the dark fairy and her special blessing came back and the King and the Queen became very worried about. It even went so far that the king confiscated any spinning wheel in the entire country and let them burn to ashes just to get sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey never told Hannah about the curse which was lying on her, but they told her to stay away from spinning wheels. And to the worst the 12 fairy's never find her dark half sister to reverse her blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the day before her birthday came and Hannah was in her room with Julia, her own maidservant since she was a child. She helped her to put on the hand tailored dress she got from her father. She should wear it at her birthday party. Hannah grew up very healthy and had a very slim body with sexy curves. Her skin was white and smooth and combined to her long fire red hair, her raven black eye's and her luscious wine red lips their was absolutely no male being in the country which she couldn't seduce. Even if her father was very strict at this point she always tried to get a boyfriend. But she was like a bird in a golden cage and was rarely not in company with guard, servants or maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look truly beautiful miss Hannah\"<br>\r\nJulia said to her while adjust the evening dress she is wearing.<br>\r\n\"One thing is granted, you will be the star on the party with this dress\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but isn't that a bit to much?\"<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about miss Hannah?\"<br>\r\n\"This dress is much to fancy, look at all the detailing and the gemstones. I look like a walking jeweller\"<br>\r\n\"No, you look really great in it miss Hannah. All the gemstones just bring your inner beauty more to the daylight and with a fine make up all the invited princes will stand in queue for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen finally Julia was finished with dressing her and excited she left the room to get the Queen to show her Hannah in her dress. But she didn't thought at this moment that now Hannah was now alone. She forgot the promise she gave the King that she should never leave his daughters side until the birthday is finally over. She was just to excited about it and totally forgot about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah sat herself down on the chair and waited a while. All of sudden Hannah felt cold air touches her body and she started to shiver.<br>\r\n\"Wow? Why is it so cold all of sudden?\"<br>\r\nA fine light mist surrounded the part of the castle in which Hannah's room was. Slowly everything around her turned pale and colorless and the air was really thick, Hannah had a little problem with breathing but she was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried she walked out of her room and into the corridor, but what she saw was really strange. The flames on the candles were motionless like they were frozen and at the end of the corridor was a strange shadow which also was motionless. Curious and frightened she walked carefully nearer to the shadow. As nearer she got as more the shadow looked like a human. Finally she reached it and had to realize that it was Julia which stand motionless in the corridor and like everything around Hannah she also was pale and with no color. It really looked like the time stand still and she was the only one which wasn't affected by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Hannah heard a soft music came from the far. She looked fearfully around and noticed a staircase behind her she never saw before. And the soft music came from a few floors above her. She had absolutely nothing to lose and so she followed the music, maybe their is even someone who is also not affected by the time.<br>\r\nThen she reached the end of the stairs and noticed that she was in a tower of the castle which shouldn't even exist. But she didn't stopped here, she walked further to a closed door where the music came from. Slowly she opened the door and looked into the dark room. The music started to fade and all she saw was a little girl sitting in the edge of the room and she was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah couldn't just ignore her and walked worried to the girl.<br>\r\n\"Why are your crying?\"<br>\r\nInstantly the girl stopped crying and looked up to Hannah.<br>\r\n\"I was waiting for someone really important for me\"<br>\r\n\"You waited for someone at a place like this?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n\"And for who are you waiting?\"<br>\r\n\"For a Princess, but I don't know the name, I only know that she will become 17 tomorrow\"<br>\r\n\"17?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n\"Are you waiting for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the little girl didn't answered and stopped motionless.<br>\r\n\"Hey? are you alright?\"<br>\r\nHannah asked worried and looked down in her frozen face.<br>\r\nBut suddenly she started to smile evilly and Hannah got a huge fright.<br>\r\nThe little girl started to expand rapidly and her clothes started to strain. Hannah took frightened a few steps back and felt then back on her butt. The little girl expanded bigger and bigger and busted out of he remaining clothes. Her skin turned slowly into a light blue and her hairs grew longer and darken into a shining raven black. Even more she bulged out in front of the frightened and shivering Hannah and her shadow covered her entirely. Under the bursting clothes new clothes appeared, it was the nearly nothing covering suit of the dark fairy. Out of the flat girly chest, large overripe melon boobs grew and her small accentless butt and hip grew massively and was the widest part on her. On top of that a large potbelly expanded out of the rather slim girl body. <br>\r\nFinally the little girl transformed entily into the dark fairy and she looked exaclty like 17 years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Hannah had to look up to her and she grinned evilly down to her.<br>\r\n\"I waited 17 long years just for you\"<br>\r\nThe dark fairy said and started to laugh a bit.<br>\r\n\"Wha... wha?? What do... ooo  you want for me???\"</span></div></div>",

She did't trust her. She knew all the other fairies they visit sometimes and also came to her birthday every year. But this fairy was so much different. Besides it looked like she stopped the time for anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look like a fairy. You're much taller then an average fairy. And all the other fairies are a lot skinnier then you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm only half fairy. Do you want your present?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah played with her red hair what she always did when she was nervous. She liked getting presents like everyone else but she did't trust this new fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents told me not to talk to strangers. And i don't know you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true. I know you since the day you were born. You looked so cute by then. With all the other 12 fairies. You see i know there were 12 fairies. So i must have been there to know that right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The whole kingdom knows there were 12 fairies when i was born. That's no proof. Besides i need to get ready for my birthday. Could you please make the time running again. Julia really needs to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really don't want your special present. A terrific present.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah started to bite her nails. She now became very curious. Should she do it. Why not. If she really was a fairy she would't be mean, would she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all right then if  you're really a fairy then i guess it's all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What i got for you is this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave her a spinning wheel. Hannah looked confused at the sinning wheel. She never before saw a spinning wheel. Her parents never ever let her even in the same room with a spinning wheel and almost every spinning wheel in the kingdom was destroyed. So this was something completely new for her. She looked still confused but also curious at the spinning wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W... what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know what this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never saw one in my life. Al least not that i remember. I once had a bike. Is this maybe a new bike? It has a wheel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am i going through all this trouble? I just need to be sure she'll prick her finger.\" The dark fairy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed Hannah's hand and pushed her finger right on the needle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you need to be careful with those spinning wheels. They have sharp needles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spinning wheel? This is a spinning wheel?\" Hannah scary walked back. \"My parents told me they are dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they heard a rumbling noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i'm so hungry. I really need to eat something.\" Hannah ran out the room as quick if she could looking for something too eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark fairy laughed evilly in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you thought you were pretty clever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark fairy turned her head. One of her sisters was standing in the window opening. She had long black shiny hair and looked very cool but also really nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right big sis. Now reverse that blessing our curse from that princes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Listen i spend the last 17 years of my life looking for you to reverse that spell so you just think i would take no for an answer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your too late any way she already pricked her finger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait is her birthday today? I really need to pay more attention to my calendar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She pricked her finger so it has happened like if it should be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye little sister. See you.\" And she disappeared in a blue cloud of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh men. I spend 17 years looking for her an i screwed it up. And you should think she could find a nice way to disappear but nooooo. My half sister is a black fairy that disappears in a cloud of smoke. Stupid bitch.

It was strange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah was't so hungry when i left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she remembered what the dark fairy's blessing (well maybe curse) was. A ravenous hunger for hundred years. Hannah was alone for just a minute since the time stood still for Julia. And that was all the dark fairy needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what have i done. I knew about the curse. how could i have left her. And how do i tell the king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was someone else who was also very worried. The fairy with her shiny black hair.(her name is teddy by the way) She already warned her sisters that was't so hard for fairies and now she was looking for the princess. Her own powers were no match for her half sister but maybe she could make the hunger a little less and if she could't she could at least say she tried. That could make her feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Hannah was also very worried. Worried how to stop her ravenous hunger. She finally found the door to the kitchen. She opened it and looked drooling at all the food for her birthday. She could't stop herself and opened her mouth as wide if she could and jumped at the food and pushed hands full in her mouth. She pushed so much food in her face that it did't fit all in her mouth and soon her whole face was covered with food. <br>\r\nThe cooks looked confused at the beautiful little princess who now suddenly act like a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... excuse me your highness but this food is for your birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah looked at the cook and opened her mouth like she wanted to say something but what came out was a long and loud belch. Hannah was normally a perfectly mannered girl but this time she did't seemed embarressed in the least. She just smiled and you see pieces of food between her teeth before she again dived on the food letting it all go toward her mouth.<br>\r\nThe cooks were all a little confused what to do. Normally if anyone would eat all the food for a special feast they would stop that one but this was the princess and it was her party. Of course no one ever would have thought that the princess would break in the kitchen and eat all the food. The chef decided that it maybe would be better if they would stop the princess for now. She could always eat more at the party.  <br>\r\nIt took finally three cooks to stop the princess from eating all the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef looked at the princess and asked: \"What has happened to you?\" </span></div></div>",

A lot more. Julia just tied a pink ribbon around her waist when a knock was heard on the door. Teddy walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Teddy. Nice to see you again.\" Hannah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah knew all the 12 fairies. They visit often and came every year on her birthday and they always played with the little princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Hannah it's nice to see you again but... there is something bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't it wait till after the party. I'm really hungry right now. And i need some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just the problem Hannah. You are under the curse of the black fairy. My half sister. She also came to the party when you were born. She gave you a blessing. Well more a curse. When you turned seventeen you would prick your finger at a spinning wheel. Then you would get a ravenous hunger for hundred years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought your parents told you too never touch a spinning wheel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would have helped if i would have known how a spinning wheel looked like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah our bad. But now you need to... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teddy i really need to eat something! I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Hannah you may not let your hunger... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hannah did't listen and ran out the door. Leaving Julia and Teddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear. My sisters powers are more strong then i feared. Well my eleven sisters are downstairs maybe they can do something. I better go downstairs to help them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah came downstairs. Everyone was downstairs. Her parents the servants and their kids who played with Hannah. And also in one corner were eleven small figures whispering with each other. The other fairies. The smallest of them did one step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to tell the king and queen what has happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. Teddy is looking for her right. You don't to let her parents be worried sick while Teddy maybe already solved the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fairy wit long black hair that hide the half of her face said: \" You know that Teddy's powers are no match for the powers of the black fairy. Just face it. Besides if she would have lift those curse she would have told us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Hannah appeared <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The boys were in awe in front of this goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the usually flirty princess had turned her desire for a boyfriend in a desire for food. Instead of spotting the cutest boys in the room, she almost ran to the feast, where she started digging in. Forks, spoons and knives were once more forgotten, hands were faster to shove meals into her mouth. Soon, her face was smeared with chocolate, crumbs and grease. Yet, she couldn't stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were on the binging beauty. There were mixed reactions : shock, disbelieve, disgust. No one could believe how their usual perfect, polite and well-manered princess was acting now. While eating crazy, her stomach was looking like she was going through a different month of pregnancy, going from washboard flat to round and as taut as a drum. No one had ever seen her with such a big middle. Her tiny dress had trouble dealing with her new belly and it was ready to burst at any second. It was also stained with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king and queen watched their daughter, bemused by what was happening to her and her dress. Rapidly, they realised that she had been cursed by the dark fairy and they rushed to the 12 fairies. Teddy explained what occured to Hannah. The queen bursted in tears, the idea of her beautiful girl loosing her perfect figure was making her very sad. The king was sad too, but he was also very mad, as a fat princess would be harder to marry to a prince. They decided to end the party to find a way to save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Hannah's gut was about to burst out of her expensive dress, Julia took all her strenght to take her away from the feast, which she already emptied, and brought her to her room. The crown was even more speechless. The king began to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My daughter, your beloved princess Hannah, had been cursed with an overwhelming hunger which will last 100 years. Therefore, if someone has a way to find the dark fairy, or reverse the curse, please contact us, and we will grant you with one wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis speech launched many discussions amongst the people, and soon the news spread itself all over the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Teddy rejoigned Julia and Hannah in her room. She was shocked by the size of her tummy, full with food. However, she kept begging for more food. Teddy casted a spell upon her, and she immediatly felt asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So we look i eleven different directions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there are 12 of us.\" Millie the youngest of the fairies said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. You stay here to watch after the princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do i have to stay here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you the youngest.

My powers are no match for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one of us is a match to her so that does't matter. Just make sure Hannah does't eat so much she kills herself or becomes immobile. Make sure she eats just enough to survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other fairies flew away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate it to be the youngest. I'm already 275 years old. all right that's not so old for a fairy but still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to Hannah's room. At the other hand she and Hannah could get along really well. And with being the youngest of the fairies Millie herself was a little childish so she and the princess were always having fun playing little kids games. She walked in Hannah's room. Julia and her parents were sitting around her bed. Hannah was still in a deep sleep. Teddy really knew how to put on a sleeping spell. Hannah's now huge belly was digesting all the food turning it all into fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All my sisters are out looking for our half sister. I need to stay here and keep an eye on Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over and softly touched her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor girl. Hungry for hundred years. What a terrible curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you find the dark fairy is there a good chance she'll lift the curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To tell you the truth i'm afraid not. But maybe all my other sisters together can force her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you 12 try to lift the curse together?\" Julia suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know much about this curse. If we try to remove it there is a good chance we would kill her while lifting the curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if she does remove the curse will the weight also disappear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not. The weight will stay on her until she loses it on a normal way like exercising and a good diet. and letting her sleep here is't really helping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if she wakes up she starts eating again. She wanted more and more food before your sister put her to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point. Don't worry Hannah. We'll watch after you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

The food she ate was digested and her bloated belly had vanished, However, the bloat now affected her entire body, and the party dress which was fitting perfectly just a day ago had trouble containing her new size. She wasn't fat by any mean : she wasn't slim like before neither, she was just a bit plump. Her binge certainly added more sand in her hourglass figure. Her waist was less tapered, her hips were more padded and her B cups breasts had turned to C, which would have been nice if it didn't sort of blended with the rest, making their growth less noticable. Her sleek thighs, which used to make her proud, had thicken and were now meaty, along with her fuller calves. Her thin arms were covered with a layer of blubber and they were now straining her dress' sleeves. Hannah's stunning sharp featured face had also filled with the rest, but it was still pretty, even if it looked more cherubic than before. Yet the most shocking change on her was her flat stomach which melted into a soft potbelly sticking out a bit farter than her breasts. It was stretching the dress a lot, like the rest of her body, and it was now looking very unflattering on her expanded shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the usually self-conscious princess did seemed to care, or even notice her obvious weigh gain, and all she had in mind was her hunger.

She had a young looking nice body with just small A cups, a little pale skin but nice white blond hair and a friendly face. But even for a fairy she was kind of small. At least smaller then all her sisters but she also was the youngest. Suddenly she heard a scream from Julia. She fast took a dressing gown and jumped down flying at the last moment.

Millie and Julia also started to look everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Hannah had a great time. She could stuff her face and did't care about her figure that started to fill up. The only thing she cared about was food and fill her hungry belly. When the last crumb of food went down her belly she belched so loud that some of the servant heard her an found her in the kitchen. Food smeared over her face and dress. Hannah sat down and then her dress ripped showing Hannah in only her bra and undies. She just smiled silly and let out another loud belch. <br>\r\nMillie flew in the kitchen and looked shocked at the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in so much trouble.

Her body was only (and barely) contained with bra and panties, several sizes too small. Millie took a good look at her : sure, her long fire hair were luscious, her black eyes were gliterring, her wine red lips were tantalizing and her white skin was silky, but her sexy curves were nowhere to be seen, hidden under layers of blubber. She was more than a little plump now, she was much like a butterball. Her arms were hefty and they were looking far from the delicate ones they had been before. Her once perky breasts were coated with a thick blanket of fat and the added weight was causing them to ride lower than usual, even with the tight bra.

Its sleeves were cutting a bit her flabby arms, but it was a pretty cute dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she got dressed, Millie did her hair and make-up, playing with the blush to diminish the puffiness of her cheeks.

There was enough food to feed everyone in the palace. Hannah started to stuff anything in her mouth. Her dress was getting tighter and tighter. Hannah did't mind. The only thing she cared about was too eat. She opened jars, boxes and every other thing with food in it as long if you could eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie waited for five minutes.

He had only see her once or twice at royal gatherings, but he knew she was a very nice and kind girl, everyone agreed on this point. He was fond of her but he wasn't sure if it was real love : he really wanted to feel this for her though, he feared that his kiss wouldn't work anyway. The paintings on the walls kept reminding him how beautiful Hannah was looking and, sometimes, he tried to picture her with a few pounds more.

The reactions were mixed : somes laughed, somes refused because it wasn't good for the image of a country to be ruled by a plump queen, but all were truly heartbroken when they learned that the terrible curse made their beautiful goddess fat. Even the thought that she might be able to loose the flab after didn't help her case. However, Brandon decided to take the chance, even though he wasn't sure if he would be in love, or even attracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile climbing the stairs, he nervously asked Teddy :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she... like, curvier, plump, chubby, or downright fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know for now, but the last time I saw her, she was that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe volontary omitted that she was gaining very fast.

Slowly but surely, her not so lithe body started growing again. It wasn't much, compared to the pounds she already gained before, but it was noticeable enough to be annoying. Still, she was only becoming very chubby.  In the process, a small double chin began to frame her beautiful face, which was already bloated with flushed plump cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear her dress won't survive this binge\" said Teddy, alarmed by the sight of Hannah's dress, strained by its owner's fat body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right : after the last bite was popped into her mouth, tearing sounds could be heard and the dress turned to shreds, revealing an almost naked princess who let herself go. The too tight bra wasn't providing a good support and didn't prevent her heavy breasts from sagging over her belly. With that one, Hannah looked pregnant : round, jelly, with a deeper navel. It was overflowing her little panties, which were transformed into a tong by her inflated butt. Her large thighs were inviting and were followed by hefty calves which looked as fleshy as her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddy and Millie were shocked, and they feared that Hannah had ruined her chances with the prince.

How can i have let myself go like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was't your fault. It was the curse of the dark fairy. She gave you a ravenous hunger hunger for hundred years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looked at Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thank you so much for lifting the curse. And sorry that i'm so fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be sorry. I really like your fat. I really do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well who would have guessed.\" Teddy said with a smile.\" Brandon likes fat girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah looked at Julia and the two fairies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the dark fairy had put this curse on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S RIGHT!\" Ah loud voice said and the next moment they heard a: BENG! and the room was covered in smoke. And when the room finally cleared they saw the huge body of the dark fairy. <br>\r\nMillie and Teddy jumped between Hannah and the dark fairy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry sisters. I'm not her to curse that little princess of you or her prince.\" And she looked with an evil smile <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not? I thought you would be angry that she broke the curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well kind of. A little maybe. But i may be a dark fairy but i'm honest. I gave her a blessing... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More a curse.\" Teddy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ever. Point is, she broke it by receiving her first love kiss. So i just came by to see how it worked out. I must say Hannah you look better then the last time i saw you. You sure are a lot bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would take that like a compliment. So your not here to put another curse on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Like i said i'm honest. You broke the curse and that's final. Well congratulations! You defeated the evil fairy. But maybe you need to thank me. After all you now know for sure the prince really loves you. And i hope both of you grow up happy. Now gotta go. And who knows... maybe we see each other again once. When you have a daughter or son.\" And she laughed evil and disappeared in a cloud of smoke.<br>\r\nHannah looked a little scared at the point where the dark fairy was disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Hannah. When you invite her too your kids birth day she can't put a evil spell on your kid. It's a fairy code that you can't use evil magic at people who were nice enough to invite you. That goes for even for a dark fairy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah looked around. So what do we do now? I mean with all this fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon Still had his hands on Hannah's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i think you should keep it. It's really nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i guess it does have something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Millie get the king and queen. They need to know the has been lifted. And they need to know Hannah's future husband.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell i guess this is the end of the story. But i can tell you that there was a huge feast that the curse of the dark fairy was lifted. It was a double feast since it was also the marriage of Hannah and Brandon. Hannah kept gaining but not so fast like before and Brandon loved every pound on her. And some women in the kingdom also started to gain too look like heir queen and most men also started to love girls who were fat. Hannah and Brandon got five kids. two boys one girls. First you had Peter. Then Judith. Then came Brandon Junior and the two youngest a twin Sally and Sandy. All three girls became beautiful and fat, and the boys handsome and muscular. The dark fairy was on all birthdays and since she got invited she slowly got a lot nicer. But that are all stories that need to be told another time. Let's just finish the story with: and they lived happily and fat ever after.        <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

This food was for the princess birthday anyway and it was her feast and there was so much food no one would notice those few plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah was sitting in her chair. normally she was a very patient girl. Even at boring parties Hannah kept nice and polite and waited till the party ended. But she was always happy when the party was over. But now she really had trouble waiting for the food. The hunger kept nagging on her. Maybe nagging was't the right word. It was more chewing on her. She was at the point to get some food herself when the chef returned with some food. Hannah did't waited for the plates touched the table. She grabbed the food from them and opened her mouth as wide if was possible pushing as much food in it if was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything all right princess Hannah?\" The chief asked a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Just hungry.\" She said with full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Hannah cleaned the first plate she belched loud. The chef looked confused. Princess Hannah was always a mannered girl that never belched and always eat with her mouth closed and used a fork and knife and/or if needed a spoon. But now she was just eating the food with her hands, chewing it loudly and belching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what it is but i'm just so hungry all of a sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh princess Hannah... your birthday will start soon. should't you get ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will. But i can't get ready if i'm hungry right. Then i just can't concentrate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Since the princess had servants who were there for her every moment of the day and night she could always get some food for her when she was hungry so she never had this problem before. After the last plate was clean she belched loudly again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of chef i'm still hungry. could you please get me some more food.\" She looked at him with her famous puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef melted for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i will see what i can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chef ran back to the kitchen while Hannah licked the plates clean. Her chin and her cheeks were full with some grease and crumbs from the food but she did't care as long if she could get some more food to fill her hungry belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want food. I need food i'm very hungry. Really hungry.\"       </span></div></div>",

He had the largest gut of the three. He was the dimmest as well, and had not questioned the food showing up at his straw house's doorstep for the past week.

The constant soda made this pig belch constantly, his cheeks were the largest of the three, his jowls shook when he walked, each cheek as big as an orange and still growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of cheeks, the eldest brother's rear was his crowing achievement.

Due to the amounts of (possibly magic) beans this pig has been feasting on, his rump let loose constant, loud, fowl-smelling farts, they seemingly got worse every day. A few bricks came loose due to his powerful flatulance. The pig denied that it was the works of the wolf though, and continued to eat.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gabrielle was a large girl with very small feet, and she lived in a town, in a nation, in a time, where to be a large woman with small feet was to be loved.  Her father, the duke, fed her on bonbons, eclairs, strawberries, cream, and real bread and butter, and until she reached the age of thirteen, he had every right to believe that, because of her beauty, she would attract many handsome prospects when it came time for him to give her away.  Wishing for the girl to have an example of feminine grace (her own gentle mother had died some years before), he married the widow of a local landowner and brought her and her three scrawny daughters into the house he and his dear Gabrielle had inhabited in times of happiness and plenty.  Then he died.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shall not pretend that his death was due to foul play by the house's new inhabitants, for there is no reason not to believe that the duke's new wife did not love him.  She was temperamental and often jealous, especially of the attention he lavished on his little Gabrielle, and she told him more than once that he was spoiling the girl with the sweets and dresses he lavished on her.  Moreover, whatever the local peasants might have whispered, the duke died not of poison but disease--a wasting disease which Gabrielle's stepmother also contracted and survived, though at great cost to her once-notable beauty.  She quickly grew rail-thin and hollow-eyed, and she now truly looked like an old woman.  And so, with the death of her husband and little chance left her of gaining a new one, she turned her attention on the advancement of her own daughters, who became, in effect, the real mistresses of Gabrielle's house.  And because girls with straw-colored and mouse-brown hair often envy another her thick golden curls, and because women with little softness to their features frequently dislike a large-eyed, round-cheeked, light-skinned beauty, and because ladies whose figures are chiseled like rocks or knotty and lean like trees are maddened by a mademoiselle whose flesh rolls like the salt ocean, fruitful, stormy and alluring, Gabrielle was often mistreated by her new and older sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, I am sure, you have guessed what story we are revisiting.  For this reason, I would like to make one thing clear.  Gabrielle was never forced by her step-family to lift a finger or do a single day's work.  Such a thing would hardly have been tolerated by any of the late duke's connections, or even by any of the peasantry.  Again, let me say, they never forced her to work or assume a subordinate position of any kind.  Instead, her sisters teased her into it.  It began with a simple nickname, given to her by the stepsister nearest her own age, with a nose like a rat.  The two were fighting over a bauble that had been Gabrielle's--the one sister greasy and bristle-haired with a nose like a rat's, and Gabrielle tossing her curls and becoming visibly discomposed--though she never shouted.  When the step-sister knew she couldn't wrestle the plaything from the supple hands of her rival, she resorted to name-calling:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You--you--Graissielle!\" she shouted.  \"Give it to me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabrielle released the bauble at once, so suddenly that her ratty sister fell out of her chair.  Yet it was Gabrielle who was stunned.  She knew she was, indeed, graisse--plump--but what shocked her was hearing that her sister mock her because of an attribute that everyone always implied enhanced her considerable beauty.  \"Ah, how graisse you are growing, my little one!\" her uncles would always say when they made their visits.  \"Becoming quite the little woman!  You will make quite a match for some young man--that is certain!\" they would always add, which made her--fourteen, and only recently woman--blush prettily and look down.  But here, her sister used the term--graisse--not to flatter her, but rather insult her.  She felt something quite new when the name \"Graissielle\" was given to her, and in her confusion she became quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo not think this was lost on the other sisters.  This new name--Graissielle--seemed to put their little sister in her place--to make her acquiescent, humble, and eager-to-please.  It was a mystery to them, as well, why a word once used to compliment their sister--a compliment that any of them would have blushed and smiled to receive--should make her so intensely self-conscious.  But it did.  And they took advantage of this new power to degrade their pretty little sister further.  Whenever the girl was wearing a dress that looked particularly fetching or opulent, they would say something cunning--not quite out of the range of her hearing--like, \"Oh, there goes that little Grassielle.  Quite the little lady in her great, fluffy gown!  Shall we go and wait on her, sisters?\"  And the next day, they would notice, little Gabrielle would wear something much plainer.  Likewise, for a period of time, they called her \"Grassielle Gold-head!  Grassielle Gold-head!\" until one day, in exasperation, she begged them to cut her beautiful tresses off, then wept as they did so.  Seeing, later, that despite her terrible haircut she was still more beautiful than they, and still nevertheless desperate for their approval, they also took to saying things like, \"Well, we'd better sweep the house, I suppose--if we wait for lazy little Miss Grassielle to do it, we will be tripping over dustballs and cobwebs before long,\"  They enjoyed pretending to always be working harder than their sister who, in order to attempt to compensate for her apparent laziness, began sweeping floors, cleaning chimneys, washing dishes, making (but not eating) food, and even chopping wood and cleaning stables.  Gabrielle's stepmother, meanwhile, pretended lamely to discipline her girls, but secretly she was glad that little Gabrielle would at least be a little less spoiled for having grown up with her own children.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy her fifteenth birthday, to the delight of her stepsisters, Gabrielle was almost unrecognizable.  Her once-plump figure had dwindled to the point where--though still big-boned--it was almost as gaunt as that of the other women of the house.  Her hair was cut short (so as not to interfere with her work) and filthy.  Her opulent dresses no longer fit her, and she had to borrow clothes either from her sisters or the servants, as her stepmother refused to buy her new ones.  Only her face retained some beauty, though the softness of her chin and the plumpness of her cheeks were gone.  People living nearby no longer even recognized her as the daughter of their once-beloved duke, and they called her Cinderelle--\"Cinder-girl,\" a name which her sisters began using as well, once \"Grassielle,\" like the girl's dresses, no longer fit her.  As for the name \"Gabrielle,\" it was forgotten by everyone.  Or, at least, almost everyone.  But there was a woman, who had once been a friend of the duke, and who had been present at Gabrielle's christening despite a conflicted feelings about entering churches.  This woman lived far off in the woods, in a tiny thatch cottage and some held that she was a holy woman, and others insisted she was a witch.  Yet she was neither of these things, but rather one of the old ones called fay in Brittany.  And, though Cinderelle did not know her, she was, of course, her godmother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd Part I</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gabrielle or as she is now known, Cinderelle, was outside scrubbing the porch and windows. Such a chore would have never been forced upon her when her father was alive. Back when she was fat, the very notion of Gabrielle dirtying her gentle, delicate, plump body would have been unimaginable but tragically the poor girl had withered into a scrawny, dirty, slave girl, subservient to her abusive guardians. Gabrielle hated the labors right down to her very core but given her gentle nature she faltered to her step sisters' criticism. She yearned for the life she once had, kind friends, sweet desserts, beautiful dresses, bathes, her long blonde hair, and most of all her soft fat. Gabrielle was filled with sorrow as she felt her boney body bereft of luscious fat. As she started to clean the window, she saw her reflection and became enveloped in sadness at the sight of her emaciated reflection. Oh how Cinderelle wished to be the fat Graissielle yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderelle's desires did not go unheard for her godmother had felt her strong desires from far away in her cottage. The godmother immediately had set about a journey to find her unfortunate goddaughter.  The woman was a beautiful middle aged woman with long flowing hair, and a great plump body. She waited for Gabrielle's fifteenth birthday before getting involved in the girl's life, since common folk found her somewhat odd. This was mainly because the woman appeared to never age, for the past twenty years she had looked like a 40 year old woman. Another bizarre yet envious trait she possessed was that she also never lost weight. Even in hard times the woman never seemed to lose a single pound. Further proof of her peculiarity was she always kept rare confections in her cottage. The deceivingly modest cottage was laden with food totally unheard of, thus provoking suspicion of witchcraft. However what resigned here was a sweet, magical fairy godmother called Fay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderelle was working her calloused hands to the bone when a plump figure clad in a cloak approached the mangy girl. Cinderelle gazed upon the mysterious corpulent figure. \"Wh-who are you?\" Cinderelle asked. \"Oh you poor thing, I'm here to salvage your damaged life. I'm your fairy godmother, you may call me Fay.\" Fay answered opening her cloak, revealing her rotound body in a glistening dress exposing a deep long cleavage her huge breasts created. Cinderelle couldn't help but stare at the copious flesh, growing dejected at her own flat body. \"Have no fears deary I'll fix you up.\" Fay said comforting the distraught lass. \"We'll get you fattened up with some delicious food.\" Cinderelle's face unconsciously lite up with Fay's words. But after all of her misleading upbringing Cinderelle overcame her instincts and said \"But isn't being fat bad Fay?\" \"Not at all! Why all the pretty girls are fat. An abundance of fat on a woman shows her well being and adds to her beauty. Just look deep down in yourself, you want to be fat, you want to eat sweets, you don't deserve to be filthy.\" Fay said. With these true words Cinderelle instantly acknowledged her feelings. Cinderelle began to sob and threw herself upon Fay. \"Oh Fay I'm so skinny and dirty. And my beautiful hair is gone and and..\" \"There there we'll fix you up in no time dear.\" Fay trying to console the girl. \"But what about my step family? What if they won't let me get fat again?\" Cinderelle wept. \"No worries I'll deal with them.\" Fay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Fay than went inside and talk to the women while Cinderelle anxiously waited outside. \"Good news Gabrielle...\"</span></div></div>",

Oh and use this on your hair.\" Fay said pulling out a vial from her deep cleavage. Cinderelle rushed up to the bathtub, finally she could be clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderelle stripped out of her rags and hopped into the bath. She washed away all the grime and dirt from her skin which grew more smooth as she washed. As she scrubbed herself she could smell a heavenly odor eminating from the kitchen. Cinderelle's belly growled from the alluring scent, finally she was going to eat some scrumptious food. overcoming the distracting smell, Cinderelle remembered the vial and used it on her short weathered hair. Cinderelle massaged the contents into her scalp. Suddenly her scalp tingled. Cinderelle than noticed that her hair was becoming softer and brighter, and...longer! The girl's hair was growing back, full and luscious. The vial had miraculously retrieved Cinderelle's glorious blonde locks which now reached down to her buttocks. Cinderelle was full of joy and newfound confidence with her soft smooth skin, and long flowing hair far from the gritty sweaty servant girl she was earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the tub bearing a sweet fragrance Cinderelle went to her wardrobe to get dressed. Feeling more proud of herself, she happily went to adorn her body in an opulent dress. However Cinderelle found herself somewhat dejected. All of her dresses were far too loose for her emaciated figure. Cinderelle put on a loose fitting dress and walked to the dinning hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA magnificant sight beheld the ecstactic lass as a grand feast awaited the starved girl prepared by Fay. \"GASP Is this all for me?\" Cinderelle said quivering with joy. \"Yes it is. Now that you're clean, we can focus on regain every pound you lost, and more.\" Fay said. \"More?\" Cinderelle inquired. \"Definitely you've grown older since when you were fat so you should be even fatter than before. But my dear I think that doesn't do you justice. With your beauty you should be far fatter.\" Fay suggested. \"Fatter?\" Cinderelle asked. \"Indeed, I intend on making you the fattest woman in the land. Now it may be hard and it may take some time but I'll make you the culmination of femininity! Now eat up 'Graissielle'\" Fay said sliding a slab of meat to the boney girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderelle ate and ate, filling her belly with high calorie foods, swelling her stomach, something that she hasn't experienced in a while. \"Urp Fay that was so yummy! But I'm too full to continue.\" Cinderelle said. \"Of course your body has grown unaccustomed to heavy consumption so we may have to take it at a slow pace for a while. So let's just have one more slice of cake and take a break, okay.\" Fay said placing a rich slice of chocolate cake in front of Cinderelle. She gazes at the cake in awe \"Um that's kindof big...I don't think I can eat it.\" Cinderelle said. \"Don't worry I'll help you.\" Fay reassured the girl's doubts and grabbed the cake with her hands and handfed the girl \"Omph nomp\" Cinderelle struggled as the cake was crammed down her gullet. \"Trust me dear, this is for the best.\" Fay said wearing a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Marion herself wasn't a good ruler though she wasn't necessarily bad neither. While her leadership was lackluster, her beauty was acknowledged by all. Marion possessed long luscious blonde hair, dazzling blue eyes, smooth soft skin, and as for her body it was slender with plump breasts, long firm legs, with a tone butt. Marion would adore herself in profligate dresses to accentuate her beauty. Despite her beauty she was prideful and contemptuous, looking down upon others. Even with her doting servants she interacted with them in a condescending manner. Especially with her meals, Marion was excruciatingly critical of her nourishment, refusing to eat if it didn't meet her high demands. \"I can not eat this! It is too under cooked! Too bitter! Too sweet!\" Were common complaints Marion pouted. Marion's pompous attitude had no signs of diminishing, much to her servants' dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day Marion decided to bless the common folk with her presence by ornamenting herself with affluent jewelry and waltz through the town. Marion was accompanied by some aristocratic women as they ventured about the town. Of course they mocked all of the less fortunate all the while flaunting their extravagant wardrobes, taking great pleasure from the experience. As Marion cackled at the poor folk, a fat veiled woman approached Marion. \"Pardon me your highness, but would you be so kind as to spare some coins for a hungry fat girl?\" asked the fat woman. \"Ewww How vile! As if I would cater to your pandering!\" yelled Marion shoving the fat woman aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Marion, that fat woman was a witch who loved food and despised women who denied the joys of eating. Watching the small ass of Marion walk away the witch placed a curse upon the boney queen. The curse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

The only things they had was the roof over their head to keep them safe from rain, walls to keep them safe from hostiles, a wheat farm from which they got their daily bread from, and a broken well that barely gave enough water to survive each day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally had long, braided yellow hair, and wore only beige, ragged clothing, it looked as if it'd never been cleaned once. Despite the situation Sally was in, she tried to keep her and her mother's spirits up by playing games, such as hide and go seek and catch with a ball made out of sticks.<br>\r\nHer mother, however, had given up most of her hope. She wasn't much fun to play with anymore, so Sally decided it was time she leave her home, go into the dark woods and search for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in the dark of night, when her Mother was asleep, Sally sneaked out of the house, hoping to find whatever help she could. For hours she trekked forward in the dark woods, making sure she only followed a certain trail, making mental notes so she would not get lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of walking, she noticed a strange green glow coming beyond the trees. She pursued it, and found a strange looking structure. It was a rusted old well, and when she looked down she saw the string that held the bucket was dunked into the water, which was the source of the green glowing.<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Sally wondered, and she saw a note on the side of the well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Well of Magical Wishes<br>\r\nDrink from the well, and your greatest desire will come true, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">with terrible consequences</span></i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last three words were scribbled out hastily by whoever wrote it, but Sally didn't pay it any mind. She used the crank to lift the bucket of Green Liquid to the surface, and began to drink from it. It had a strange taste, not like normal water.<br>\r\nShe waited for something to happen, and after a while...</span></div></div>",

She grabbed hot dogs, bagels, and all types of food and shoved them into her mouth, eating them quickly.<br>\r\nFood continued to fall from the sky, and she kept eating like there was no tomorrow.<br>\r\nThe food was so delicious, she hardly noticed her body growing. Sally, being starved most of her life, just wanted to eat everything in sight without stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany minutes passed, and the food eventually stopped. But, Sally had devoured most of it. She had become chubby from how much she ate, and she felt a bit bad. She didn't realize how much she ate, but despite this, she actually liked being chubby. It was a nice change of pace from her bony thinness.<br>\r\nShe couldn't leave like this, though. She had to get some food for her mother, so she grabbed the green bucket once more, and drank from it.<br>\r\nThen, she waited once more, and food began to fall from the sky once again, but Sally still couldn't help herself. First she said she'd just have one more, then that one more turned into two more, then five more, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process of her drinking from the well and her eating all the food she created happened over and over, until Sally was very obese. Her clothes could barely stay on her body, and she was amazed at how much she ate, but also angry because she wanted to save at least some of the food for mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time she drank, however, she had to create more so that it was fair for her mother. It would seem weird if Sally came back as this large blob, stuffed with all these foods, while her mother only got so little. But Sally and her greed just couldn't stop eating.<br>\r\nSally was conflicted, what could she do to make things alright again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally takes a look at the back of the note, realizing there's writing on the back;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Warning: Using the Well too many times in a row may lead to unintended situations. Only use, at max, 3 times per person.</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally had used the well much more than three times, so this worried her.

The fairies were a little over five feet tall with glittering light green skin, long hair down to their butts, and had very skinny figures, covering their crotch and nipples with a small leaf each. The first fairy was a red head with green eyes whose name was ariel, the second had blue hair and blue eyes whose name was zexa, the third had silver hair with silver eyes whose name was xelia. \"So master what is your desire?\" the fairies asked. \"I want you three to become fat\" said Arthur. \"What master?\" \"Yes master it sounded like you asked us to get fat?\" \"I did for some reason I just want you to be fat.\" said Arthur. The fairies paused and stared at each other \"Wellllll... if its what the master wants, i guess we should fatten up\" said Xelia. The fairies then closed their eyes, raised their arms, and started humming. Their rail thin bodies began to vibrate and fat formed on them. Their boobs began to soften, their bellies started to bulge, their legs thickened, their asses widened, their boney arms softened. Their humming grew louder and more fat filled them out until they were about 300 pounds each. Their boobs were watermelon size, their bellies were globes of fat hanging over their crotch, their asses once petite and firm were now squishy and wobbly balls of fat, their backs had rolls of fat with their two little wings coming out of it. The fairies look at each other, ariel held out an arm and jiggled it, Zexa grabbed her arm and squeezed Ariel's arm fat with her fat hand. Xelia looked down at her belly and grabbed it a gave it a shake. Ariel poked Zexa's belly and Xelia held one of her boobs in her hands. \"Master... this is...WONDERFUL!!!! This feels so good! The myth is true you do know whats best\" the fairies said rushing to Arthur hugging him and engulfing him with their fat. \"Master please feel us\" the fairies said rubbing their fat against Arthur. \"Yes this is great\" said Arthur with a handful of belly in his hand. \"But now we must...\"Arthur said.      </span></div></div>",
