Today, yes TODAY she reminded herself, she was going to start her first job at Shakepocalypse, which was only the most hip and cool milkshake bar in the whole of *Insert State Here* . All of her friends were jelous, her family were proud and Samantha, the hottest and most popular girl in Jo's school, was Timorese to have been crying her eyes out at being beaten to a post at the bar by \"That disgusting, rat-faced Hopkins girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo could only giggle as she imagined Samantha covered in grease, stood behind the till of King Donalds Pizza Shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her encouraging mum drove her to the mall, Jo tried to compose herself. First impressions count, she recited to herself over and over and over and over again. She walked to the front of the shop, stared at it, took one last deep breath and walked down to a small door which was nestled in-between two shops. Slowly she pushed the door and walked through the hallway til she approached what seemed to be the access door for Shakepocalypse. Instantly after stepping inside, she fell over after slipping on a banana peel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, was the banana skin left there on purpose, or by accident?</span></div></div>",

As Jo picked herself of the ground, she herd a quite fimiliar laugh. \"Of course, Samantha...\" Jo thought, sighing to herself. Jo stood up to face Samantha. \"Hey loser!\" Samantha grinned. \" I just thought I'd come out and see you get fired on your first day.\" Jo just turned around and headed towards the managers office. \"Hello sir, I'm ready for my first day!\" Jo had obviously been in a bad mood due to her recent fall, but Samantha wasn't going to ruin her first day on the job! \"Excellent!\" The man said, as he sprung from his chair. \"I'm so happy that you have decided to join the shakepocalypse family, I'll get Katie to show you around!\" Jo only stood there, awaiting the arrival of her new mentor (and hopefully new friend). \"Oh! Before I forget, here's your shakepocalypse worker card, you can use it to get free milkshakes!\" He handed Jo the card. The card smelt of milkshake. \"Katie! Get in here and show our new employee the ropes!\" Minutes pass... \"Katie?\" It turns out that Katie is...</span></div></div>",

Soon after she starts though, she realises that all the other staff are rather... Well.... Fat and even more so the longer they have worked there. All of this is something to do with the cards which enable the staff to have free milkshakes. Can Jo escape from Shakepocalypse and it's evil manager? Can she show the world the dangers the bars are creating? Can she fit in her favourite jeans by the time this ordeal is over? The answer to all three is probably not but read on and add on to find out the truth!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo is a rather average schoolgirl. Pretty but not beautiful, Not popular but not unpopular, Not smart but not dumb. Her only extravagant tastes in life are for very bad zombie movies and very obscure melodic rock bands. She has short very dark blue hair and normally wears a pair of jeans, some old converse and a tshirt of a band no-one has ever heard of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowed: WG ( can be extreme) Stuffing, Breast Expansion, Butt Expansion, Face Expansion ( I think I made that one up), Small TF alllowed.<br>\r\nNot allowed: Vore, Immobility, GTS or shrink, foot </td>",
