For the examples above a dog gives you its sense of smell, hearing, endurance, teeth and claws,and, from a wolf, its ability to stay warm. A cow will give you its sense of smell , hearing, horns, power of inertia, and from a ow like the scottish highlander, its ability to survive on very little sustenance. And form a bird, its eyesight, talons, hollow bones, and, from birds like owls, its ability to move without making noise. You can choose any number of these abilities at a time.</span></div></div>",

In addition to that you can call on the abilities of that animal as well as others of that animal if they are close to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n        While there is nudity(clothes don't change with you) this is not a sexual story, no sex, no masturbation, no \"playing with yourself.\"(The only exception is if that animal does the action normally Ex. two dogs sniff each others butts in greeting.)<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n        The main character must not died until later in the story, after a suitable replacement has been introduced and brought up. Other characters can be introduced and killed much sooner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        No ending the story without possible continue options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGPs for chapters I don't have to edit majorly. My \"c v x\" keys do not work so I generally have to copy them from somewhere else. This is a pain so I hope to not have to do it too often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReviews will be done for items of yours if you add decent chapters or request them in the new chapter's title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nENJOY!!!!!!</td>",
