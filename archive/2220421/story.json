So when she called you at about eight this morning, you were sort of surprised because normally you're the one who calls her. Your alarm had gone off not even ten minutes before, and you had just poured yourself a cup of coffee when the phone rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi John. It's me. Look, I need a favor from you. I know we're not together anymore, but I really need you to watch our daughter for a couple of days. My job is requiring me to go on a trip to another city for a while, and I don't know anyone else that's available.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, no problem. Didn't really have any plans this weekend anyway. So when can I expect you to be here? We should get there around ten. Thanks a lot, see you then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you get dressed and tidy up the place, you watch TV until the doorbell rings. You answer it to find your ex and daughter standing there on the welcome mat. Just what species are your daughter and former love?</span></div></div>",

You met a female monster at a local bar, and the two of you hit it off pretty well. Or so you thought. Long story short, She got pregnant with your child, but a few months into the pregnancy, the two of you had a disagreement, and decided you weren't right for each other. Rather than take this to court, the two of you decided to have sort of a long distance relationship. You would see your child, which turned out to be a girl, every so often, as long as you stayed in contact with your former girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the ex needs your help. Since the two of you semi broke up, she's gotten a job with a major company, and is going away for a couple days. Now she needs you to look after your little girl while she's gone. Shouldn't be too hard, right? Oh, if only you knew...</td>",
