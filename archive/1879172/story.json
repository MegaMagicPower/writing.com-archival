Now we have to determine who's going to accompany you on your 'mission'. 3 people will be able to go with you: your best friend, your love interest, and your love interest's best friend/your best friend's love interest (if that makes sense). The third person will be determined, depending on who your love interest is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can choose your love interest from these three:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander Caldwell - 17. He's a 5'10\" junior with black hair and gray eyes. He doesn't talk much and he always looks like he's ready to kill someone, but he can't really help it -- he just naturally looks intimidating. That doesn't mean he isn't attractive though. Xander's really smart and athletic, so that'll help you out a lot. Just make sure you don't piss him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiden Falcon - 17. He's 5'8\" and has light brown hair with brown eyes. He has ADHD and because of that, he's easily distracted, impulsive, and short-tempered, which lands him in detention a lot of times. There's a plus side to it though: it gives him lightning reflexes and since he can't concentrate well, he's able to find things other people can't. He kinda gave up on school and has a lot of bad grades, but he's one of the best athletes and fighters in the school. You'll <i>definitely</i> have an interesting time with this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJayden Sharky - 17 and also a junior. He has a blonde moehawk and blue eyes. He's energetic, outgoing, funny, and a bit clumsy, but that's his charm. He plays soccer and basketball, and is pretty well-known in the school. He may not have the best grades, but he has random knowledge and experience. For example, he knows he seems to know every car, video game, and celebrity out there. And excuse him if it seems he's 'not on earth\" -- you can say he's a bit dirty-minded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo . . . who do <i>you </i>like?</span></div></div>",

No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought so.\" You stifled a snicker when you saw her groan in frustration. Then, glancing at the clock, you realized the time and looked at the girl you've known for nearly 2 years with a questioning look. \"Hey, didn't your brother's plane land two hours from now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalyn shrugged. \"I don't know. Pft, if I'm lucky, it crashes instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalyn had an older brother named Alexander who lived in Washington DC with their father, a special director in the CIA. A few weeks ago, it was announced that he would be moving to Cali today. The reason why was unknown -- even to Natalyn -- but whatever it was, it was meant to be a secret between him and their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped back to reality when Natalyn spoke up: \"Hey, wanna come over after school today?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To meet your brother?\" you question, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalyn snorted. \"Pft, no. I was talking about watching 'House of the Living Dead III'. Didn't you say you wanted to come over and watch it yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, yeah, you did say that.

It didn't take long to get there considering you guys took the school bus. Once you guys arrive at her house, she opens her door and lets you in before closing it gently. However, just as you guys begin to settle in, you hear a noise upstairs.Both of you freeze and immediately glance over at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that?\" Natalyn asks softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly nod. \"Is your mom home?\" you whisper to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she's coming home late today. It can't be my brother either -- his plane didn't land yet. It's a burglar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill makes its way up your spine. Natalyn notices your nervousness. \"Shh, stay calm. I'll handle this. Just hide and make sure you don't go upstairs.\" She then tip toes over to the closet, opens the door, and pulls out a shiny baseball bat. She then starts to head over to the stairs but just as she climbs the first step, you hold her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if you get hurt?\" you ask nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalyn shoots you a smirk. \"I'm the daughter of a CIA director -- this is gonna be a piece of cake. Now hide, and don't get out until I come back down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and give her a \"Good luck\" before taking cover in a closet.

As you pass the kitchen sink, you spot a knife holder. Realizing the burglar might be armed, you grab a knife before making your way upstairs quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door beside Natalyn's room is open and no noise is heard. With a battle cry that could put any gladiator to shame, you jump into the room, ready to face any danger that awaits you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to find Natalyn standing beside an older, black-haired guy that is no doubt her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing you, the older Caldwell whips out a gun from his jacket and points it at you, so fast everything was a blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop!\" Natalyn yells at her brother. \"She's a friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, the black-haired wonder lowers his gun. \"Should I be disturbed at the fact that your friend is holding a butcher knife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the weapon in your hand before grinning sheepishly. \"Sorry, I thought Natalyn was in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Caldwell tucks his weapon back safely under his jacket with a blank face. \"Well it's good to see my sister chose a faithful friend.\" He then turns to Natalyn. \"Dad decided to use the CIA private jet instead so that's why I'm early. Anyway, I need to talk to you about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance between the two siblings. This is most likely about private matters concerning the CIA, so it's probably best for you to leave. But then again, if it really is private, they would've asked you to leave already.

That doesn't mean he isn't attractive though. Xander's really smart and athletic, so that'll help you out a lot. Just make sure you don't piss him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiden Falcon - 17. He's 5'8\" and has light brown hair with brown eyes. He has ADHD and because of that, he's easily distracted, impulsive, and short-tempered, which lands him in detention a lot of times. There's a plus side to it though: it gives him lightning reflexes and since he can't concentrate well, he's able to find things other people can't. He kinda gave up on school and has a lot of bad grades, but he's one of the best athletes and fighters in the school. You'll definitely have an interesting time with this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJayden Sharky - 18 and also a senior. He has a blonde moehawk and blue eyes. He's energetic, outgoing, funny, and a bit clumsy, but that's his charm. He plays soccer and basketball, and is pretty well-known in the school. He may not have the best grades, but he has random knowledge and experience. For example, he knows how to fly a plane because his uncle's a pilot and he was taken on many trips. He seems to know every car, video game, and celebrity out there. And excuse him if it seems like he's sometimes 'not on earth\" -- you can say he's a bit dirty-minded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo . . . who do you like?</span></div></div>",

After waking up one morning, you turn on the news and find out that reports are coming in, saying flying saucers have been seen flying around the whole country the previous night, and that they all believe an invasion has come. And not just any invasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE Invasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing events soon prove that your great great great 20x great grandfather had predicted this. The only way to get rid of the aliens is to get to New York City and smash the aliens' source of power, a large, glowing green orb that generates power and is used to communicate with their motherland. It's not going to be easy though. Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause the orb is on the very top of the Empire State Building, you can't use planes, and you're stuck all the way on the other side of the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><u><b>Rules:</b></u></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Character deaths are allowed, but only through bad and extreme decisions. Please keep it to a minimum though.<br>\r\n2. Minor slang words are alright, but please no completed swearing.<br>\r\n3. Correct grammar please. However, everyday language and incomplete sentences during quotes allowed.<br>\r\n4. Violence is allowed as long as it's not graphic.<br>\r\n5. Romance is encouraged, but nothing extreme.<br>\r\n6. Keep it second person point of view please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, please add! Thanks for reading and enjoy!</td>",
