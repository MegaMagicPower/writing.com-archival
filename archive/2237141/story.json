One chant and a poisonous kiss later, you've been shrunk in your own costume. It was a crazy Halloween that you would never forget. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, the witch disappeared without a trace and you've been left this curse to shrink every Halloween until the sun rises again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow should this start?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever since that night, Halloween has never been the same, the only people who know about this curse is your family. You always had to rely on them for your help when Halloween comes, until you get a girlfriend or something. There are some friends of yours you've considered telling  about the curse to, but you've always been hesitant to tell someone something so unbelievable, but perhaps tonight may be the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour family hasn't been too trusting either with your sugar rushed siblings and busy parents tending to trick or treaters at the front door, meanwhile the dog is usually locked outside the backyard and the cat is often locked in your parents room for your protection, but there have been times where they've gotten close to you before when someone would forget to leave the door open. There was also this one time you fell in the candy bowl and your dad almost put you in some kid's candy bag, fortunately he wasn't too buzzed from sitting down and passing time watching TV and drinking when there wasn't anyone at the door. Going with your little siblings can be fun too, jumping in their bags and eating some candy, it also gives you a chance to jump off and explore the neighborhood yourself, as long as you keep track of them, getting a ride home isn't hard. Your friends also like to go places for Halloween, you could go on an adventure with their protection, or go party somewhere for Halloween. Speaking of parties, your mom likes to throw a Halloween party sometimes with friends or go to her friends parties, which has proven to make Halloween very difficult for you to survive the night when it is at home. This time now that you're finally 18, you can make the decision for yourself this Halloween what you want to do.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Halloween night just got a whole lot bigger for you, literally and metaphorically. You've been shrunk by a Halloween curse every Halloween, and must do whatever it takes to make it until 4AM to grow back to normal size, or face the fate of being trampled at a Halloween party, Halloween at home with family, or even in the bag of a hungry trick or treater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----\u2010-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story will start with multiple scenarios for the Halloween occasion, from a Halloween party, to Halloween at home, outside, around candy, or even at a haunted house with friends. I am open to many different scenarios for Halloween. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep the storyline according to the plot, you're cursed at the start of Halloween day and will stay shrunk until sunrise. You can kill off the main character but please make a Reader's choice in case someone else can make an alternative route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically anything is allowed, male/ female/female male/male, sex, vore, feet, crushing, digestion, unbirth, cock vore, anal vore, animals, I probably won't be deleting much. Scat weirds me out a bit though, so let's keep pooping to a bare minimum, if you gotta add poop, it can be after you been vored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdd any person and costume you want in the story<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all have fun with this </td>",
