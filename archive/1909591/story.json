As she darted out the door, you thought about how her concern really wasn\u2019t necessary, especially considering how little traffic your shop had seen today. You had a steady flow of customers that were turned away by the Guild in their ivory tower, and that brought in enough wealth for you to afford your shop just off of the main road bisecting the city of Dusktide. The city was pleasant with plenty of trade coming up the river cutting through the city as well as the fertile farmlands surrounding it, but it also wasn\u2019t quite as crowded as the capital further down the wide river. You actually preferred the quieter surroundings here, there was too much going on in the larger cities and there were more\u2026unsavory characters to be found in such environments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving yourself to your feet was a bit of a chore, but you had other business to attend to and the sooner the better. Adjusting your tight robe around your fleshy body, you moved off into the back of your store. How many times had you seen newcomers give a double take or even outright stare at your well-fed body spilling forth? You knew that not everyone enjoyed the figure you presented, but that was just too bad. You enjoyed the feeling of your flesh wiggling with every motion, as well as the more appreciative views that some people gave you. Even when growing up, you had always been large for your age. The farm you had been born and raised on was small but decently profitable, granting a bit more than enough food for your family. Despite the modest portions you ate during that time, it seemed you were destined to balloon ever outward with flesh. Leaving home and moving out into the wide world beyond had only added to this situation resulting in your present size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou passed a finger down the tome you were previously working from before tucking a stray lock of your long hair behind your ear and resuming your enchanting work. One of your loyal customers came in the day before looking about something for breathing underwater. The adventurer had wanted a potion, but you had suggested applying the necessary enchantment to his helmet after inquiring how long he was expecting to be underwater. He was soon convinced that the enchantment would be the better bet, especially so he didn\u2019t have to fumble with another potion in the deep if one wore off before he was expecting. It also meant that he was going to be paying a bit more than for the potions, so that was a nice bonus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just finished weaving the magic into the well used armor when you heard the bell tinkling from the front door. You called out that you would be out in a moment, as you wanted to make sure the spell had been properly applied. Satisfied with your work, you put away the remaining ingredients and wandered back through to the front. A familiar scent wafted to your nose, could it be? You flashed a smile when you saw that was indeed who you thought it was: the hybrid dwarf-elf knight Katren Snowwoods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings Ms Lawson,\u201d he said, bowing low at the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed slightly, \u201cHow many times must I tell you Katren, you can call me Sarah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps the next time it will stick,\u201d he said with a slight curl of his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasantries out of the way, he walked up to the counter, his travel cloak dusty from a hard ride. You tried to keep the anticipation from showing on your face, but proved only marginally successful. The swarthy young man stood before you, but didn\u2019t say another word or move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026?\u201d you prompted with hands atop your wide hips, tail swishing behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you aware that patience is a virtue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but I think I have been plenty patient so far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inclined his head, before delving into a pouch on his belt. When he held it open again, a small square of cloth opened to reveal a short sliver of crystal glimmering in his palm. The slight blue glow reflected in Katren\u2019s eyes and caught in the alchemical apparatuses you had on display nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is all I was able to find, there might be more, but nowhere that I could see,\u201d he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were more than a little shocked that this was all, but maybe just maybe it would be enough. You gave him a bit of a hard time about the amount, though both knew that it wasn\u2019t totally heartfelt. When you gave him his payment, you did give him some extra for a job done quickly and quietly. In truth though, you would have paid twice as much for what he had brought you. You wanted to get to the task as soon as you could, but knew that your business came first. Nervous excitement kept you fueled throughout the rest of the day, your mind constantly wandering to what that crystal might allow you to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night when you finally closed up the shop, you moved as quickly as you could, flesh rolling from the rapid motion. Careful to not lose it, you took the crystal upstairs to your personal lab where you had been preparing for this moment for what seemed like forever. It wouldn\u2019t do to waste what little there was though, and you had to make sure that there was enough material for what you required. Several tests later, you had your answer.</span></div></div>",

The slightest mistake might cost you everything and force you to start from scratch. The reward was well worth the risk however, so you set to work. Throughout that night, you were busy performing all kinds of tasks: dissolving the crystal in a special reagent, filtering the results, using a particular magical spell on the powdery remains, and on and on. You only took a quick break for a bite to eat, and that was only to silence your growling stomach. With that finished, you were right back at the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky was just starting to lighten as you squinted at the few scant drops of amber liquid that was the product of your night\u2019s work. It shimmered slightly even without any movement, and you could practically feel the magic flowing out of that tiny amount. It was obviously powerful, but would it work correctly, that was the question. There was only way to find out though and that was to try it out. You were moving in uncharted territory here, so the usual tests wouldn\u2019t apply. Grabbing the necklace that you were going to be using, you carefully placed the pendant so that the large gem in the center was easily accessible. Then, ever so carefully, you tipped the vial so that the drops eased out and dripped onto the gem. The ruby took on a slight glow that grew with each of the drops that struck it, becoming dazzlingly bright with the last drop before the glow faded to a much more subtle effect. And that was it; you would have to wait a full day before you could try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the necklace aside to rest, you stripped off your robe and retreated to your bedroom, hoping to catch a few winks before you had to get right back up and get to work. As you drifted off to sleep, your mind circled around what you wanted that charm to do.</span></div></div>",

If you wish to contribute then you MUST add at least two paragraphs and have LITERATE submissions. I will delete anything that a five year-old could do better with. Do not immediately kill off the characters and make sure that there is a plot and story, not just sexytiems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you will start out choosing a genre, from there you will create a character for yourself (Boy/Girl, Gay/Straight/Bisexual/other, etc.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will be placed in a world you chose to be a part of, depending on the scenario it may include more plot or more sex. I will try to submit as much as I can, hopefully I don't get bored of this project along the way.</td>",
