If it wasn't for the fact that Satan wasn't there that you would think he just went to hell. He looked at the flames and he thought to himself \"Why am I wasting time here?\" He recalls finding the rogue member and then a bright flash and then suddenly he was here. He looked around for anything he can use to find that man but nothing turns up. He then saw a vague image of an echidna who said \"You've arrived just as I anticipated.\" The figure made herself more clearer and she was revealed to be an echidna with ancient clothing. Axel wondered who she was but he said \"You knew I was coming?\" The echidna simply nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel reflects on what has happened and says \"Do you know where I can find a blood red echidna?\" The female echidna replied \"Why would you want to know where he is?\" Axel was about to say his reason but then he thought about it. Was it really a reason or an excuse? He pondered this and said \"I want to avenge my team.\" The echidna looked at him with sad eyes and said \"I'm afraid that determination like that will not help you defeat him.\" Axel gets angry and asks \"What do you mean!?\" The echidna replies \"You have a reason based off of anger but that's really not a reason but more of an excuse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel was pissed now. He has a good reason to take this guy down so why is this reason more of an excuse!? He wanted to know and he asked \"What's makes you think its an excuse!?\" The echidna replies \"Simply because I can say this, what would you do after you defeat him? Did you not say you lost your team? Who would you return to then? This is a question only you can answer.\" she disappeared after saying that. Axel then said to himself \"Why would I need someone to return to? I'm a loner and its going to stay that way.\" He wasn't to sure about that and he thought but then he said \"I'll just find my answer after I beat that jerk!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran off with new determination to defeat him and the female echidna appears in the distance and says \"Maybe he has what it takes to achieve the first step to beating that man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel had long left the volcanic area and entered the icy plains and he sees...     </span></div></div>",

The knight dodge the enormous blade and they fended off each others attacks. They traded blow for blow and it seem like the match would continue forever. Axel then did a rising strike with his sword and it caught the black knight off guard. He was about to land the victory blow but suddenly, his armor changed and he was no longer a black knight but a white paladin. He looked like what a knight in shining armor should look like. He then show an increase in speed since he wasn't wearing the black armor and it was only a matter of time before Axel made a mistake and the white paladin knocked him down. He had his sword pointed at Axel's throat as he stood as the victor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecil is the winner!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel curses himself for leaving such an opening and he prepares to get up but the white paladin suddenly extended a helping hand and he grabbed it as he was pulling himself up. The paladin said \"You're not bad. I know someone who uses a style similar to yours.\" Axel then realized why he lost. He was facing a person who knew a little bit about his technique and that's why he lost but he wasn't going to question how he knew about such a style and said \"I'm guessing your one of the legendary warriors the goddess of light send me to find.\" the paladin nodded and said \"I was told we were going to have backup in the fight against chaos but I never expected you to look so different.\" Axel just replied \"What were you expecting?\" The paladin then just says \"I kinda was expecting you to be a little taller.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel then gets angry and says \"Well excuse me for being short!\" The paladin then says \"Anyways, my name is Cecil.\" Axel replies \"Name's Axel.\" Cecil shakes his hand and says \"Great to meet you. I think we should look for crystals.\" Axel then recalled the goddess of light mentioning crystals and said \"I think were to suppose to pass some test for our crystals.\" Cecil then says \"Well what are we waiting for?

Missiles Massacre, Laser Bazooka, Rocket Punch, Magma Shotgun, Arctic Spear, and Cannon Shot for long range) She has to switch between the two(Melee Mode and Range Mode respectively, unless she is in EX Mode)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: Eve looks similar to Metal Sonic, but has four different things: Her eyes are green, not red. Her body is white(she also wears a shirt and pants.) She will talk to people if she has the time, and most of all she is a Warrior of Cosmos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Born in the lab of Shinra as a prototype, her life there was both painful and short-lived. After three years of torture, Eve finally found the courage to run away. In her escape, she killed 50 SOLDIERS, thus marking her a fugitive. After 10 years of running from Shinra, she found salvation in 7th Heaven. She walk in there, broken and near death when, she saw a brown echidna(Barret). She said, with her remaining strength, \"Help.\", before fainting. She woke up, tied down somewhere. She easily got loose but before she could escape, \"Where do you think you're going, Little Missy?\" a gruff voice said. She quickly turned around, weapon drawn, to see the echidna from before. \"I'm sorry Mr-\" \"Wallace. Barret Wallace.\" \"-Mr.Wallace, but I-\" Eve tried to explain before she saw that he had a mechanical cannon drawn at her as well. \"You're like-\" \"You? As if I would work with Shinra!\" \"Wait, you're against Shinra too?!\" Eve shouted. \"So?\" \"I could help you!\" Eve quickly explained, seeing this man had a short temper. 'This thing wants to help us? Well, any kind of help is better than none.' The echidna thought to himself before lowering his weapon down, Eve as well. \"I'm Eve, Prototype SOLDIER at your service!\" Eve proudly said. \"Listen you! If you cause even a little trouble, I will personally tear you apart! Understand?!\" Barret threateningly said to Eve. \"Got it.\" \"Good. Welcome to AVALANCHE.\" Barret said to her. Thus, the beginning of a trust that quickly grew from a spark to a inferno. She welcomed, along with Barret, Cloud.  Her trust with Cloud was rocky to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow she got here: Eve heard in her dreams a voice that said, \"Young one, if your hearing this, then you were chosen to help turn the tide of battle in a war. If you accept, you shall be taken from here. Time will stop until you return. Do you accept?\" Eve quickly said \"Yes.\" \"Very well.\" the voice told her before she blacked out. When she awoke, she found herself somewhere completely different. wondering where she was, she wanders around now, trying to find the owner of the voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEX Mode: Hero From Shinra: \"Let's run wild!\" Eve turns into a mixture of Bionic Commando, a Mecha(Similar to Gurren Lagann), and a Demon(From Devilman) In this form she gains the ability to use ether Range-only attacks or Close-only attack along with these:<br>\r\nHP Recovery<br>\r\nAP Drain<br>\r\nAssist Attack UP<br>\r\nAttack/Defense/Speed UP(1.5)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEx Burst: Final Strike: \"I\"LL CRUSH YOU!\" Eve hits the enemy with her sunglasses(on her head), they go around the enemy turning into a cross, trapping them in a cross position before you have to press buttons in the correct order. If done right, after hitting opponent 12 she ends the attack charging her whole left arm with energy. \"Omega...\", Eve then puts said arm to a rolling hook position \"...Star...\", before sending the wave of energy into the enemy(it turns into a energy punch) \"...BREAKER!!\", the blast hits the opponent \"It is done. Farewell.\" and a explosion cover the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictory Pose: Eve flies around before stopping and giving the player a thumbs-up.<br>\r\n\"Nice.\"<br>\r\n\"Great performance!\"<br>\r\n\"That's the of THAT chapter.\"<br>\r\n\"*Hums her theme*\"(True Heroes)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, this Character?</span></div></div>",

I have to find the old man soon before these things get to me first.\" He then rushes to an open area with light that cover the entire room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu looked around and he said \"I guess I'll rest here.\" He then set up his camp and he thought about why he was here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wonder what called him here and why he was chosen instead of somebody else. He eventually call it a day and went to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, rumbling is heard as a girl is thrown into a building. The young teenager got up from the wreckage as a young teenage boy continued fighting a tall man in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then says \"Step aside runt, I'm going to finish this.\" The boy replied \"No!

Why now of all times to show that dream?\" He blamed himself for not protecting his friend and she died because of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was no longer the weak runt he use to be and he was going to prove it.

He didn't care if the god decided to destroy the world, he just wanted to fight one man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw him in his army. The wolf who took Kate's life.

Onion knight! Firion!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them look at Ryu and says \"Get everyone out of here! I'm about to do something dangerous and you could all be caught in it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirion looked to Onion knight to see if he what he was talking about but his clueless expression said no. Firion then says \"All right but don't get yourself killed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra immediately says \"Wait! We're going to leave him!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirion turns to her and says \"Right now we can't beat that thing and if whatever Ryu has in mind might cause harm to us then it's better to do as he says.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra was trying to fight back tears but she knew he spoke the truth so she said \"All right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirion nods and says to Ryu \"Okay. We'll leave it in your hands! Squall, Terra, Onion knight and Tidus. Let's pull back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got behind some cover and when Terra was last, she said to herself \"Please don't die Ryu.\" She hid some cover as well. Ryu looked at his opponent and said \"All right. It's time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Ryu's mind.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was instantly in his mind and he was looking around as if searching for someone and he found who he was looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu ran up to the floating ball of wind and he said \"We're going to use THAT.\" The wind orb replies \"You do realize that you might die from this right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu shakes his head and says \"I don't care. I'm taking that bastard down.\" the orb is silent for a while and then it says \"Very well but try not to die.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu gets annoyed and says \"Man. What is it with everyone telling me not to die?\" Ryu then concentrates and unleashes an amazing power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the real world....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was suddenly surrounded by wind and he said \"Wind Breaker Mode\" Ryu then hit him with an HP attack and caught him in a bad position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe charged his blade and it was suddenly engulfed in wind and he shouts \"Typhoon Slash!\" a rush of cleaving wind came at him and he only said one word \"Sh**.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge burst of wind followed after that. The dust settled and all that was left of the knightmare was a piece of armor that faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu wins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu is now level 52!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu learned hp attack \"Wind cutter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu got the glove of heroes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu fell to the ground as he exited his Ex mode. He never had to use so much power all at once. Everyone came up to check on him and once again, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious fox from before showed up. Onion knight saw her appear and said \"Hey! It that Fox girl!\" Everyone saw her but Ryu was in too much pain to see her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat next to Ryu and said \"This one is very interesting. I'll have to keep my eye on him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirion then asked \"Where were you? We could have used your help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to Firion and says \"I've got my own problems you know. I'll travel with you guys seeing as this guy can't seem to stop getting himself hurt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra then asks \"What do you mean by that?\" She looks at her and says \"It's nothing you should concern yourself with.\" Squall then asks \"So...what now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirion then replies \"We need to find the others. I know Zidane and Bartz are together but I'm not sure where Cecil and Cloud are.\" Terra then asks \"But what about Ryu?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirion replies \"We're going to spend the night at the base. Follow me everyone!\" They all went to the underground base with Ryu still unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was left in the rest area and Terra offered to watch over him. Terra then starts thinking that she and Ryu might not be so different. Just as she's thinking this....       </span></div></div>",

Wol was utterly shocked that he stabbed an ally and everyone else was taking care of the poor hedgehog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu and Wol were the only ones in the room at the time. Ryu asks \"What has THOD done?\" Wol was wearing some dark blue armor but his shape told Ryu he was a hedgehog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol thought about it and said \"THOD has deceived many people into doing what he wants. He's always managed to elude us at every turn. Every time we find someone who knows him, they assume we were his enemies and attacked us and every time we got close, something happens and the person we were questioning is dead. He managed to pull this off many times but I was sure that I had him this time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu get a confused look and said \"This time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol explains \"He also has the ability to take over people and be a powerful influence. He was the worst criminal known to man and he eventually got the nickname \"The Magic Man\".\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu asks \"\"The Magic Man?\"\". Wol explains \"It basically means that he has the power to make a person disappear if he wanted to. That's how powerful he is. I received word that you had met THOD at one point so I was looking for you but I knew that I wasn't going to get any info so I thought that by putting you near death he would show up but I didn't think you weren't with him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"It's okay. It's not the first time I got confused for a bad guy but give me fair warning next time.\" Wol nodded and said \"Sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquall came in and said \"I'll explain what's been happening while you were out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu nods and Squall talked about how platinum came back and about what happened in the recent days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says 'So let me get this straight, The goddess of light and the god of discord are in a war that been going on for years but the goddess of light cosmos is now at a disadvantage because she's getting weaker and now you have to collect your crystals to help her stand a chance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquall nods and Ryu says \"I'm not sure if I'll be much help but I'll try. Squall turns to Wol and asks \"Should we get the others?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol shakes his head and replies \"No. We'll probably all run into each other on our own besides, we need to take care of the new warriors.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu is shocked and says \"What? I'm not the only one?\" Squall then explains that others might have been thrown into the war and that Chaos needs to be stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu stands up and says \"In that case, he's going down!\" Terra walks in and says \"Platinum is alive!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone rushes to the rest area and checks platinum and Wol gives a sigh of relief. Terra then all the sudden slaps him across the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol just says \"I probably deserved that.\" Squall says sarcastically \"Nah you think!?\"  Onion knight then asks \"Does anyone know where the others are?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol then says \"Well...I received word that Cloud was at the tower and Zidane and Bartz just got to a huge grass field but that's all I have.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirion says \"That will have to do. We need to find them as soon as possible.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol nods and says \"Okay. First, Ryu, Terra, and onion knight are going to the grassy plains and me, Tidus, and Squall will head to the tower. Firion will remain here and watch over Platinum.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gets together and puts their hands in one place and they say \"Go team!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"I'm feel silly for doing that.\" They packed up and left for the grassy plains as Wol's team left for the tower....         </span></div></div>",

Don't go saying that! I just don't have a choice in the matter!\" Ryu then says \"Okay. Let's get going.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeta then says \"Wait! I want to know what Darth meant by \"THOD led us to them.\" Did you have something to do with this THOD?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOD then says \"No! They just miss me because I'm their tactician.\" THOD closed his mouth after that part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Their tactician huh, that explains why they are so sloppy now. So you were the brains?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOD didn't want to say another word until Ryu said \"Don't make me give Zeta the okay to eat you.\" THOD then says \"Yes!

I feel like something bad is going to happen to them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud then says \"I don't know. They have shown they might be the heroes to save the world.\" Terra then says \"You're right. Maybe I'm worrying over nothing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opened and Kuja brings in two people. Kuja then says \"Hey guys! Do these people look familiar?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquall suddenly says \"Tidus and Cecil! Where did you find them?\" Kuja just laughs and says \"Wouldn't you like to know!?\" He tosses them in and takes their weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuja then says \"Yes! The nine warriors of Cosmos has shown themselves but for some odd reason, we can't find the leader.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud thinks (They can't Wol? I wonder where he is.) Kuja smirks ans say \"It doesn't matter. As long as we have you guys, he'll come to us. It's only a matter of time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then leaves. Tidus then gets up and says \"I heard what he just said, they didn't find Wol?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud says \"Apparently. That means that Zidane and Bartz must be with Ryu because he mentioned the nine of us.\" Terra then says to herself \"Please Ryu! Be safe!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Ryu's group....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu look over the hill and THOD says \"There it is. Chaos's Castle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw lava surrounding the place and Ryu says \"So after we get inside then we have to deal with the corridor of darkness?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOD then says \"Yes and let me tell you, this is going to be the most difficult battle yet, who knows how many enemies you're going to face. All I can say, you guys better be on your toes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Wow. You're actually warning us? Have you gone soft?\" THOD get angry and says \"Of course not! I just can't get back to normal if something happens to you guys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeta then says \"Liar. You know good and well that all you need is a few hours and your back to normal. Why else would you try to kill us even when you know you're at our mercy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOD sweat drops and says \"Fine. Let's just drop it okay?\" Ryu then says \"Well this is the last stretch. If you guys don't want to come, I won't force you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZidane then says \"Why would you ask us that? Our friends are in there! We're going to save them!\" Bartz nods and Ryu turns to Zeta and says \"Same reason?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeta nods and Ryu then says \"Okay.

He could only say \"I had too.....\" Suddenly, the area changed to fiery plains and dark clouds were showing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of lightning came and a figure appeared. Linda then says \"Crap! It's too soon!\" Ryu was wondering what she meant by that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure says in a evil manner \"Greetings. I am Chaos, God of Discord. My arrival has ensured your doom.\" Gamma then says \"This is bad! We have to stop him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos then says \"Why don't you guys sit this one out?\" Suddenly, he used stop on everyone and they're unable to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos approaches Cosmos and says \"It's been a long time Cosmos. What its been since we last fought? two hundred years?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmos replies \"You know as well as I do that this battle between good and evil must continue. If you end it like this, all that will be left is destruction.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos smirks and says \"Of course. It was my intention all along. I'm going to finally end this lifelong battle between you and I.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmos then says \"Before you do this, I'd like to make one thing clear. No matter how hard you try, you can never truly destroy the light. When one side starts to win against the other, a miracle shall occur so that darkness will never reign.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos then says \"Well, I'll be sure to destroy them too.\" With a wave of his hand, Cosmos was engulfed in flames as she disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody could do anything against Chaos because they were still affected by stop but Linda suddenly started moving again and attacked with her mystical bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos sidestepped the attack and hit her away. Everyone was now moving again and suddenly, Tidus disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was surprised and Ryu said \"What's going on here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExdeath then shows up and says \"You fools don't get it do you? When you guys got those crystals, Cosmos was not getting stronger but weaker.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZidane, Squall, and Cloud disappeared as Exdeath explained it. Onion knight then says \"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKefka then says \"My oh my, its just as Exdeath said, you guys had no idea what you were doing. As each of you found your crystals, Cosmos lost power which means, The cause of Cosmos's death was because of you guys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were surprised at what they were hearing. Just then, Terra, Bartz, Cecil, and Onion knight disappeared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Damn you! We'll stop you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKefka just laughs and says \"I think it's a little late for that. The reason how come you guys didn't disappear before was because of Cosmos and now that she's gone, you will all be lost to the darkness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu suddenly felt a pain in his stomach and Sara says \"Ryu!\" Ryu was trying hard to stay but he couldn't hold on and disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara was next and then the others until only Firion and Wol were left. Wol then says \"Damn it! I haven't even found my crystal yet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirion then says \"What going to happen now?\" Exdeath then says \"The world will be consumed by darkness and when that happens, Chaos will rule the world!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirion disappeared and Wol disappeared. Just as Wol vanished, he hears Ryu's voice \"Use my crystal! You have to stop them!\" Just as all hope seemed lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey suddenly reappeared again in Cosmos domain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol looked around at everyone that was there but he saw that one person is missing. Wol then says \"Where's Ryu?\" Onion knight then says \"I thought he was with you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol then remembers Ryu's words and realizes that Ryu is no longer with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol knew he had to tell everyone so as soon as everyone was quiet, he then says \"Ryu is not here. He gave up his crystal to get us this far. We need to stop Chaos no matter what!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all reflect on what Wol said and they decide that Chaos is going down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they went to fight Chaos's minions one last time, a certain person was in another location....            </span></div></div>",

I'm flattered.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Well you're about to be dead in five minutes.\" Chaos laughs and says \"You're saying that you're the strongest of them all? I'd like to see that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu drew his blade and said \"For all the people you have hurt, for all the people you killed, and for all the people you used. We will stop you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey charge at Chaos to finish this fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam Ryu vs Chaos<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra used some powerful spells to do damage and Cecil and Wol followed up with team attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidus then hits him with a powerful attack but Chaos just gets up and says \"Is that all you got? I was hoping for more.\" Ryu then says \"You want more? You got it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu pulls out a fully charged rail gun ready to blast Chaos. He fires and damages Chaos greatly. Firion followed up with a arrow shot to seal the deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos then says \"Not bad. But now its time for me to get serious!\" Chaos suddenly gets a power boost and Tidus tries to attack him but he's too fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Okay. I'm going in!\" Ryu holds out his hand and says \"Chaos Control!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu slowed everything around him and Chaos says \"What? You can use that too? Interesting. Maybe this won't be boring after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then engages Chaos in a long battle. The battle was even until Ryu hit Chaos's weak point. Chaos fell over as Ryu struck him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Chaos starts laughing and Ryu says \"What's so funny?\" Chaos then says.... </span></div></div>",

Say that a man dies in a accident and it seems like his life had no meaning. But his death can greatly affect how the rest of the world unfolds. Someone evil could take over the world but if that man lives, that could cause that event to not happen. These two events however can't exist in the same place so they split off into parallel worlds. But this is just all a theory. No one is sure if you can change your fate and destiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just simply laughs as if he knew what he was talking about.

What are those notes about?\" Gamma replied \"The functionality of the black chip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu smirked and said \"Now we're getting somewhere!\" The timer was now 16 min.

LETS GET HIM!\" just before they could jump out the door to fight it, Linda yells while blocking the door \"NOOO! DON'T YOU DARE! IT'S SUICIDE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidus asks \"what's the big deal!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda says frustrated \"WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL!? i'll tell you the BIG deal Tidus! the BIG deal, is that this monster outside our door, could put even Xeno, Draco-THOD, Arkadia, all Platinum clones, all Chaos minions, all known gods, and even all XENO-corp. to absolute SHAME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's mouths drop and Kate asks \"s-so your saying that...EVERYONE and EVERYTHING on this planet, EVERYTHING and EVERYONE on this planet combined wouldn't stand a CHANCE!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda swallows and says while beginnning to calm down \"th-that's correct! you know that XENO-corp. is ONLY fun and games compared to the \"EXS Empire\" right!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo-one says anything, they just begin to slowly fall into panicking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda sighs and says \"well...for some strange reason...he doesn't appear to be his usual destructive self i guess...ok just get Sara to cutely hand him some cookies while doing the puppy-dog eyes routine and he SHOULD back off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara asks \"but...it's a machine! it wouldn't understand cuteness would it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda begins her long and exciting explanation \"well...he's a machine physically yes but, this strange machine, kills anyone or anything which has comitted at least ONE sin in their life! even if they were just thinking about it! this machine only wants to make the world a perfect place, and it has been manufacturing the EXS since Ryu was born, i'm not sure if it's just coincedence or meant to be but, he started manufacturing copies of himself that were only about 10 foot-tall machines which were built to decapacitate a living things head completely removing the head and spine at the same time! in a more than gory fashion! but these machines come in the 1000's, but despite this, they are incredibly powerful, they are the equievalent of over a 100 XENO-soldiers! yep...there is only ONE smart thing to do if you are not UNBELIEVABLY powerful like a hedgehog called \"Quadra\", i think he's a Platinum clone which drinks a LOT! but if your not him, then run like there is no tomorrow! but as i was saying about the EXS \"SIN\", he is a machine in all possibly physical appearances, but in the center of the chest of this machine, where a humans heart is suppost to be, their is a orb identical to a soul orb, as big as your fist! it's in the shape of a human head, the head looks almost identical to Squall's, but it has been confirmed the soul is in not any way shape or form, associated with Squall at-all! but this soul orb, is the soul which used to be someone called \"Prince Sin\", he was a 16 year-old boy, who was a prince of a great, prosperous, friendly, lovely and even peaceful Empire! but the Empire fallen when Sin was killed! he was the last standing of a defence against XENO-corp., his entire Empire fallen in the defence against it, he used a jewel encrusted rapier, and had expensive white clothes all over him! but XENO-corp. finished him off, this event happened more than 12 million years ago! no-one is sure just how Sin is now...SIN, but most think he JUST wants revenge on all living things, especially XENO-corp.! and any powerful foes like Ryu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\neveryone is shocked almost witless and immediately wonder where the cookies are and sees Ninjoko with the entire cookie jar, knowing that they wanted them he turned it into a game of IT! *a few minutes later...* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinjoko was all tied up against the kitchen wall, struggling to get his cookies back! Sara immediately took the cookies out for him and the machines mouth actually opened, and shown it had organic organs! it says in a robotic voice \"thank...you\" it hands here over a million GIL!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Meanwhile in the forest...*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura says happily \"oh i see...well that's certainly very helpful\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra asks \"um...i'm sorry but could you repeat our entire conversation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura facepalms herself and says...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

EAT THIS!!!\" *SLASH! he slashes it diagnolly down from his left cheeck, all the way down to his right leg!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen blue blood sprays across the room! everyone notices it to be liquidized PURE chaos energy! and they then notice it to be a machine! but judging by the steel covering and how hard the mechanical copy was, and how easily Cloud slit it in half just like that without a seconds thought, they decided that taking the piss out of his tea drinking hobby, was NOT a very smart move!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud sits down again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiny says \"if your done then i shall now continue oh wait OH! of course you asked about SIN's life draining ability well if SIN kills a living thing depending on the strength of the victim he will drain there life force but not the soul only what powers it leaving the person just a soul orb and the body being a hollow shell basically draining the battery but the life force CAN be restored quite easily actually he tries not to actually destroy the body because if he doesn't and someone revives the same person then he will get to kill the same strong opponent again! but if he comes across a relatively weak foe, he will kill it in any way shape or form, he will actually do his best to kill the person! but despite ruining the body, the soul orb will still exist but the body won't, and the life force completely drained! but SIN's biggest targets are Chaos Guardians the last chaos guardian of light and holy chaos energy, was Ryu's grandfather, he was slaughtered by SIN, SIN does not hold anything back when fighting Chaos Guardians, that's why Laura was looking so worried about losing Ryu the same way she lost her fatherwhich was Ryu's grandfather! any more questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone says \"no\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiny floats away and Laura says \"thank you, who is that nice little ball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarniforous arrives and says while handing everyone a ball of red energy \"that is the soul of my little brother, and also the embodiment of \"Gravity Chaos\", i am the god of Gravity Chaos, if we were to merge bodies, we would become unstoppable, i have given you all the power of Gravity Chaos, hopefully you will become as powerful or surpass Ryu, and the Dread-Squad, but i doubt you have much of a chance of defeating Caliber when he is handing down perfect attack strategy, Caliber may be one of the most powerful foes you could ever face, but when combined with Dread-Squad, he utilizes perfect strategy knowing exactly what traits they use and there parameters and abilities, then he quickly divides there conditions and current positions, then thinks with great intellect to divise a great strategy, like sending Ghillie-Man to the tallest tree their is with a thermal scope and silenced sniper rifle, and Mini-Man to hold the front lines! but if his team goes down right in front of him, well...you won't like what he does, if that does happen then you can only hope you get lucky in barely surviving his onslaught! he can kill me, and he has done before, only Shiny happened to revive me at the last second, i was lucky to escape with not much of my life! now use my chaos, personally i think it's better than any light or dark, holy or evil chaos energy, so use it carefully and wisely, good luck, and we will meet again! i can promise you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe balls of energy all flow into everyone's bodies and they feel energized like never before! then they feel they could jump or float wherever they wanted, but it would make them very tired very quickly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda says while crossing her arms as she walks in the front door \"i hate gravity energy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWOL asks \"where the hell did you come from!? and bad timing, Ryu's been kidnapped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda says while looking down \"i know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then perks up and introduces someone as she says \"but i brought a friend and some help! say hello toooooo GOLBEZ!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peeks his head around the corner and says nervously and embarassed \"h-hi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecil swallows hard and says \"brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kuja!\" Garland came in wearing light blue knight's armor and Kuja was wearing more stylish clothes. Garland then says \"Yes sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarth then says \"Get this young hedgehog a uniform. He's going to help us catch a thief.\" Garland then says \"Yes sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarland went to the back and Kuja says \"A helper huh? Pleased to meet you. I\"m Kuja.\" Ryu then says \"I'm Ryu.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuja then says \"I hope we can count on you to catch this thief.\" Ryu then says \"Sure.\" They went to the changing room to put Ryu's new uniform on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was now sporting a blue leather jacket with light blue jeans and matching gloves. Darth then says \"The thief was last seen on the shopping district. Be alert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Okay.\" Ryu ran to the shopping district and looked around for the thief. Ryu then saw something move and said \"Don't move!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out a gun given to him by Kuja. Ryu went closer to see what the thief looked like but the shadow quickly moved past him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu managed to turn in time to see the thief's face.

I want to find a way to bring Ryu back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, I felt like the world around me changed. I suddenly started getting memories I didn't even know and that at one point, I did ask Ryu to see the meteor shower with me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I didn't remember that before so why now? I wasn't going to ponder it but then suddenly, I said \"Ryu is alive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have no idea where that came from but if this memory is true, then Ryu is at Xeno-corp.

What was with that flood of memories?\" Ryu then says \"Flood of memories? What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxi then asks \"Wait! You didn't get a flood of memories?\" Ryu nodded and Despair then says \"These memories were of a time where I was your enemy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then realized something and said \"Crap! This isn't good!\" Maxi then asks \"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu replies \"Since you guys got a flood of memories you don't even know and I didn't, that means that some has happened that caused this world to fuse with another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair then says \"He might be right. I'm getting memories I know I didn't have before.\" Maxi then asks \"But why is Ryu the only one unaffected?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Seeing as this situation has gotten bad, I'll tell you the truth.\" Ryu told them about his parallel world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter explaining it, Despair then says \"I think you hurt my head even more than the flood.\" Ryu replies \"Sorry.\" Maxi then asks \"So you're from the world that has fused with ours!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Yes. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you before but I wanted to maintain the balance of the dimensions. Guess that didn't help me much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair then says \"So what do you intent to do now? Your world has fused with ours.\" Ryu then says \"Nothing has changed.

Is it because he's the guardian of light?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe founder then says \"It's more than that. His dark side can unlock a powerful form within Ryu.

The second he gets that power, he'll turn against us!\" The founder then says \"Don't worry about that.

They couldn't believe that the founder of Xeno-corp had a way to control Ryu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth person asks \"You have a way to control him? What is this method?\" the founder replies \"I can't tell you. This info is very confidential. It would ruin everything if I told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader then asks \"So when will we find out?\" the founder replied \"In the near future.\" They dismissed themselves until only the founder and one other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person then asks \"So what about that girl? the one who likes Ryu?\" The founder asks \"Which one? There's so many of them it's insane.\" The person then says \"The echidna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe founder smirks and says \"I'll send my friend to keep an eye on her in due time.

Sara walks into the restaurant and says \"I'm back!\" Kuja looks around the corner and says \"Sara! She's back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone showed up and then Golbez says \"Welcome back Sara!\" Sara smiles and says \"It's great to be back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSephiroth then says \"By the way, there was someone unusual here before.\" Sara then says \"Someone unusual?\" Garland walks in and says \"He's talking about a hedgehog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara suddenly says \"A hedgehog!? What's his name!?\" Garland then says \"Calm down. I'll let Sheriff Darth explain it.\" Darth walked in with his sheriff's uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarth then says \"You're not going to believe who it is.\" They sat down and talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu, Maxi, and Despair were walking around the plains trying to get back to Rogue town.

Ryu says \"Well even if your not you must know SOMETHING if your talking like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure says \"oh but i know all there is to know...what do you want to know apart from details about what your life is turning into and how important you are to a group of people and me and some friends of mine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake gets up and says shocked and in rage \"wait a minute...that voice!

The figure jumps back out of shock in confusion of who and what just happened and hit him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't respond to even the sneak attack, he says to Ryu \"what a small charming war hero\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShantotto yells in a fit or pure rage \"WHAT!?

It's the only way you'll stand a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure then disappears and Ryu says \"Wait!\" Ryu then fell over from his injures. Despair helped him up and Ryu healed himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol then asks \"Why did you stop? You had him!\" Ryu replies \"I don't know what came over me. I just couldn't cut him down.

I'm sure you had a good reason.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"But I can't kill him for some reason. If I can't kill him, I'll never be able to fulfill my role as Guardian of light. A light that pierces the deepest darkness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu went into a depressed mood and ran out. Despair then says \"Ryu!

Sara then says \"So that's it? That was all so Ryu will learn something?\" Wol then says \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair then punches Wol in the face and says \"What kind of friends let their friend do things alone!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquall then says \"He has a heavy burden on his shoulders. If he can't overcome simple criticism, he doesn't deserve to be Guardian of light.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair then gets angry and says \"You guys!\" Issac then says \"That's enough! We shouldn't be fighting amongst each other.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol then says \"He's right.

Those two will help Ryu through this and when he comes back, he'll be stronger than ever!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidus and the other stepped down and Issac thought (I hope those girls help Ryu through this otherwise, we might all be doom.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was running through the forest and said to himself \"Why? Why was I chosen? I'm not meant to kill! I don't even know if my mind can take killing another person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu thought back and said \"I don't know what makes this one different. I've killed before to help y friends but all the sudden I feel like I'm hurting them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then thought (Maybe I should quit being a guardian of light. I wish my mom was here. She could tell me what to do.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"I never wanted to be a guardian in the first place and yet I'm stuck with the job. I can't past this burden to someone else.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then said \"Maybe I should let my dark side take over. He can kill without remorse even if that person was a friend.\" Ryu then went into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Ryu's mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was walking around and saw his dark side. His dark side asked \"What brings you here?\" Ryu then says \"Teach me how to kill without remorse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dark side then says \"So you finally want my help? Okay then. Here's what you do. You close off all emotions.\" Ryu then asks \"Okay. Then what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark side crossed his arms and replies \"I'm not telling anything else unless I get something in return. Like, control of your body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was about to say no but then he started thinking about it. He then said \"Okay. Here's my answer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ryu was about to give his answer, something woke him from his meditation state. Ryu looked behind him and saw...       </span></div></div>",

I might have to fight him myself.\" Jack then says \"Be careful, he's good at close range combat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu sighs and says \"Figures that if there's someone who's good at long range, there must be someone who's good at close range.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was about to leave until Jack asked \"Have you told them?\" Ryu then says \"What?\" Jack then asks \"Have you told them what would when this is over?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was silent for a bit and Jack says \"You should tell them.\" Ryu then says \"I get the feeling they already know.\" Jack then says \"You're actually from another world aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Yeah. My world just so happen to collide with this one. I've been stuck here with my parents ever since.\" Jack then says \"I hope you didn't form any close bonds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"I think its a little late for that.\" Jack didn't say anything for a bit and then said \"Let's get those guys.\" Ryu replied \"Yeah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left to defeat General Rain and find the Xeno level key card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXeno was wandering around looking for someone and said \"I hope I don't arrive too late.

It couldn't have been that long.\" Rogue then says \"It's because of what fox boy here calls separate time lines.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails then says \"Time passes differently in different worlds so what could have been a few months here, it could be a few years from our world.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then asks \"So if it took you one year to make a means of getting here, why did it take you so long to get here now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic replies \"Training.

It wasn't easy but I can get Sally here.\" Ryu then says \"Really!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails then says \"But it will take a while. I might not be able to make it in time if you pissed off Xeno-corp like you did.\" Ryu then says \"Leave base defense to us! Just get Sally here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails then says \"Not a problem! After some research, I think I can get her here in about a day.\" Despair then says \"Then we'll tell the others.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then asks \"By the way, when did you two become so close?\" Ryu then asks \"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic replies \"It's just that you've been holding hands since Despair got down here.\" Ryu looked down and saw Despair's hand over his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu immediately separated his hand from hers and said \"It's a recent thing. Please don't tell anyone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then says \"Don't worry. My lips are sealed.

I've setup a defense that can help!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBartz then asks \"Is that the reason why Firion was injured yesterday?\"  Onion knight then says \"Sorry. I didn't mean to.\" Terra then says \"We'll have to go with it for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara then says \"She's right. With Ryu missing, we'll be demolished if the enemy attacks now!\" Rogue then says \"Sounds like this is only a last defense.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol then says \"Yes.

I don't need your thanks!\" Ryu then says \"Whatever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu healed himself and thought (I can't use my PURE form.

I'll win the next round!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara was watching them and said \"Dude. Give it a rest. You lost ten times in a row.\" Squall then says \"I'm not done yet!\" Sara simply sighed and said \"Kick his butt one more time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair simply said \"With pleasure.\" They engage in another sparring match. Tails was  using the sensors to look for Ryu but he couldn't get the sensors to find him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails then says \"Strange. This sensor was designed to home in on Ryu but even with that knowledge, I still can't find him!\" Cream then asks \"Maybe you need to take a break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream gave Tails a sandwich and Tails said \"Thanks.\" Tails took a break from the search and ate the sandwich.

Shade then started fighting Zidane but Zidane had the upper hand because of his speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZidane then says \"Give up! You're no fighter!\" Shade then says \"Maybe. But I'm tougher than I look!\" Shade pressed something on her wrist and disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu happened to look in their direction as Shade did this and Ryu thought (Teleportation? No. I can still sense her. It must be camouflage or stealth.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZidane then asks \"Hey! Where did you go? Are you embarrassed to be losing to me?\" Shade replies \"No. I'm just looking for an opening!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Shade appeared behind him and took him out with one attack.

I want a rematch!\" Ryu then says \"Stop it both of you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZidane then says \"She started it!\" Ryu then says \"Says the one who provoked her into action.\" Zidane then decided to keep his mouth shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade then says \"Anyways, I'll go meet the others.\" Ryu then says \"What about Ix?\" Shade then says \"He and I no longer have a connection.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then thinks (Whoa! What happened when I wasn't around?) Zidane went to the medical room and Ryu continued to watch Wol and THOD's fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was about ready to break the two up until they both fell over from exhaustion. Wol then says \"You're pretty good for a warrior of darkness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOD then says \"Ha! I was holding back! I could have defeated you with one hand tied behind my back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol was about to say something until Ryu said \"Don't answer it. He was strong enough to be my match before and even now I still believe he has even more power.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol then says \"Fine. But just what is he doing here?\" Ryu then says \"We're going to have a problem soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne conversation later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu had just finished up and Wol then says \"So Xeno-city is so powerful, we'll need all the help we can get?\" Ryu then says \"Yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol then says \"I'd like to say that we don't need their help but based on the fact you almost died, we may need help after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOD then says \"And that's why I'm here! I'm the only one allowed to kill Ryu! No one else!\" Ryu then says \"You're not the first person to say that to me.\" THOD then says \"Shut it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Anyways, the enemy is going to be here soon. They're after me and I won't let them catch me again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol then says \"Okay then. We'll count on our strongest allies for this.\" Ryu then asks \"Where's Despair?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWol then says \"She went to the training room with Squall. I think Sara went after them.\" Ryu then thinks (Why is Squall training with Despair? I thought he trained alone.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu goes to the training room to see what's going on and THOD then says \"I guess I'll wait here.\" Wol then says \"You better otherwise, everyone will kill you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOD then says in a sarcastic voice \"Gee. Thanks for the advice. Like I couldn't have figured that out on my own!\" They eventually recover and THOD waits on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile....     </span></div></div>",

Xeno-corp knows we're here and I'm everyone has told you about the attack Dread-Squad made on us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara was taking in everything so she could make them pay double it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"There is also another imbalance in the dimensions.

Who could that have been?) Tails then says \"The portal used less energy but I'm sure something passed through it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Since Xeno-corp knows we're here, we can't send our strongest warriors anywhere. That includes myself but someone should investigate that portal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then says \"I'll take a small team and look into it.

Make sure you find out who this person or thing is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then says \"Will do!\" Ryu then says \"Anyways, I'm sending Kate, Cecil, and Tails with Sonic to look into the smaller portal.\" Amy then asks \"What about me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu replies \"We need you here. You're one of the few people who knows first aid and we have an injured person who needs medical attention.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was about to say something else but decided against it. Ryu then says \"Good luck Sonic. Make sure you get back soon.\" Sonic then said \"You bet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails then says \"By the way Ryu, make sure someone checks the sensor room every now and then. I've locked Sally's world coordinates so she could find us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Okay.

Zack was outside resting and then Ryu followed after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ryu said \"Let me make one thing clear, you mess with me, you mess with my friends.\" Zack thought about it and just laughed. Ryu then asked \"What's so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack replies \"You have no idea. You're not the only target Ryu. We have ways of making you come to us.\" Zack then says \"But the next time we meet, I will kill you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack then disappeared as Ryu was about to ask another question. Ryu then thinks (What could he mean?) Ryu goes back inside and sees Sonic, Tails, and Cecil with THOD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then asks \"Where's Kate?\" Once Kate was brought up, Sonic, Tails, and Cecil immediately got quiet. THOD then says \"I'll explain it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"What!? Kate has been kidnapped!?\" THOD then says \"Yeah. I was a little too late.\" Ryu thinks back on what Zack said and said \"This is what he meant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then got his gear together and Sonic asks \"Where are you going?\" Ryu replies \"I'm going to find Kate.\" Wol then says \"Wait! This is a trap! They want you to go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"I don't care! Kate is my friend and I won't abandon her!\" Zeta then says \"I know that you need to rescue Kate but if you just charge in, you're going to get killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Like I said, I won't abandon her!\" Sara then asks \"But what if we come up with a plan in case we need to bail you out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu replies \"There's no time! Kate is already suffering and  it's my fault that she was out there in the first place!\" Tails then says \"I got this world and Sally's world connected!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Great! When Sally gets here, brief her on the situation.\" Ryu then thought about where they might be but then a transmission came in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the figure in darkness and he said \"Hello Ryu.\" Ryu then says \"Just tell me where to go.\" The figure then says \"Straight to the point huh? You must be really pissed off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"You have no idea!\" the figure then says \"Go to Lester city. There will be one of my followers there. He'll take you straight to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Good. I want to settle this face to face.\" The figure then says \"By the way, come alone. Unless you want something to happen to your friend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"That's the intention. I look forward to fighting you.\" The figure smirked and Ryu went to the door. His friends tried to convince him to stay but he wouldn't budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu ran at full speed to find Lester city. Everyone was stunned by Ryu's sudden loner attitude. Sara more so than anyone else. Firion then says \"We can't let Ryu throw his life away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeta then says \"I know what you're saying but he obviously wants to do this alone.\" Sonic then says \"Someone should go after him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails then says \"But he can tell if someone is following him! How are we suppose to compete with that?\"  Shade then says \"Well...I have stealth gear. I can follow him with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all thought about but Despair didn't like it. Despair then says \"I'll go with Shade.\" Cecil then asks \"Can you be as quiet as Shade?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair then says \"Of course I can! Ryu needs our help and I won't let him gun it alone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara saw what Despair was trying to do and said \"Believe it or not, I have the ability to hide my power. I can follow him without being seen or heard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud then says \"We should send someone else as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Felix shows up and says \"Don't worry. He may look like an idiot but he's not. He probably has some backup plan to this recklessness. He is my son after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZidane then asks \"Where have you been? And why are you just now appearing?\" Felix then says \"It doesn't matter. Even though Ryu is going there alone, he does have backup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidus then asks \"Wait! Who are you talking about?\" Felix replies \"I'd rather not say. But trust me, it means a lot to me that you care so much for my son.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZidane then says \"Okay. I'll go along with the girls. My skills in thievery will be useful!\" Wol then says \"Then it's decided. Shade, Despair, Sara, and Zidane will follow Ryu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails then says \"Then I'll stay behind and be sure that Sally has someone to welcome her and brief her on everything.\" Tidus then says \"Good luck guys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade, Despair, Sara, and Zidane went after Ryu but made sure to stay out of his sight and his hearing. Firion then says \"I hope they know what they are doing.\" <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

I'll help you remember who you really are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then fell to one knee and Ryu was once again feeling pain and Lily says \"Don't worry. Once we remember what were suppose to do, you'll forget about everything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu tried to get up but he was too weak for some reason. Ryu then said in a weak voice \"Damn you!

Squall then asks \"What's going on!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix then said \"Ryu is being summoned to the final guardian battle.\" Cloud then asked \"What are you talking about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix then said \"My wife's grandfather had to participate in the last one and he barely survived before being done in by someone.\" Zeta then asks \"What's that about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix replies \"The guy who pulls the strings has the guardians fight until only one remains. Then he fights the surviving member. It's not a fair fight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara then said \"So someone wants Ryu dead?\" Felix then said \"Yeah.

I've never seen a guardian fight but I really hope we can get my son out in time before it's too late.\" Tails then says \"Don't worry! I'll find Ryu in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails got to work on finding Ryu and Kate then said to herself \"I think I know where he is. His mom told me about it once.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate then dashes off to the location and Despair notices this and follows after her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in an unknown location....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu woke up and saw Jake waiting for him. Jake then said \"Looks like we'll have to break out.\" Ryu then said \"Yeah.\" They were quiet for a while and Ryu said \"I saw Lily.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake then said \"Yeah. I don't know what's wrong but that's my situation.\" Ryu then said \"I'll help you get Lily back.\" Jake then asked \"Before the guardian fight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu replied \"Yeah. I have the best chance at resisting this curse so I'll bring her back.\" Jake then smirked and said \"I knew I could count on you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake then activated something and Ryu's cell opened. Jake then said \"Find her. Bring her back.

I won't waste time since you can only hold on for so long.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then asked \"I must overcome this. Can you help me Mom?\" Laura simply smiled and said \"Yes.

I'll free them all!\" Laura then put her hand in Ryu's hand and Ryu started to glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu suddenly found himself back in the Colosseum and saw he was wielding a different sword paired with strange gun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then saw what he had to do and said \"I call upon the power of the guardian of light! So that I may give you my pact! My pact is I vow to save my friends!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then felt a rush of energy and he suddenly was wearing white paladin armor, complete with the leggings and gauntlets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu also had two swords on one side and two guns on the other side. Ryu took both a sword and gun and pointed at the mysterious figure and said \"I will not fight the other guardians!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious figure then says \"You really don't have choice. you can't leave here until every guardian except yourself is dead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"That's not the only way out!

You're not a puppet! He's controlling you!

If I had your power, I could have saved her myself.\" Ryu then says \"I guess the light does have its perks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake then says \"By the way, when the final battle comes, you can expect me and Lily to be there.\" Ryu smiles and says \"Sure. We could use a hand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails then says \"Ryu! Sally's forces are heading here!\" Ryu then says \"That's great! We have the firepower now.\" Sonic then asks \"What's with the armor?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu looked at his armor and said \"I got this when my mother gave me her powers. Does it suit me?\" Sonic gives him a thumbs up and says \"You look like a true knight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu simply smiled and said \"Thanks. This form feels a little stronger than my PURE form. I'll try to master it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara then says \"Man! We had a rough day! We should all head home and get some rest!\" Ryu then says \"That's the best idea I've heard all day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then suddenly fell to the floor exhausted and his armor disappeared. Firion then asks \"Are you okay?\" Ryu replies \"Yeah. Just a little tired.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then tried to get up but he almost fell down again.  Squall then says \"Looks like that armor took its toll on you.\" Sara then says \"I'll carry him back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair then says \"I'll help too.\" They all left for the Heroes base as Ryu rested for half the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the base....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was in the main with everyone and asked the guardians \"So what are you going to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelta then says \"I really hate the fact that someone made this curse. I just want to end this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOD then says \"You already heard my answer. I just want this over so I can get back to killing you.\" Jake then says \"I'm with Ryu until the end.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarth then says \"Same reason as THOD. Just replace Ryu for Platinum.\" Corruption then says \"That guy will pay!\" Ryu then said \"OMG! You just said something intelligent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlpha then says \"He has his moments. I really don't like any of this either but I'll do what I can.\" Beta then asks \"Once we win this, can i kill you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair then says \"You'll have to get past me first!\" Ryu then noticed that three of the guardians were missing. Ryu then asked \"Where are the others?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOD replies \"They left. Not sure where they went though.\" Ryu then says \"We'll worry about it later. Right now, we need a plan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally then says \"Didn't you talk about attacking Xeno-city?\" Ryu then says \"Yeah. We were considering it until all that crazy stuff happened.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily then says \"I'm sorry that I troubled everyone.\" Ryu then says \"It's okay. I was planning on finding you anyways.\" Ryu suddenly felt three death glares after he said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily then picks up her whip sword and says \"I'll help you in the attack against Xeno-city. That will get us closer to the mastermind right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Right. They probably know we're coming now so we need to prepare tomorrow.\" Everyone went to go get anything they need for the final fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was practicing using his light form and making use of the armor's defensive abilities. Ryu started getting the hang of using a gun with his swords. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu eventually got the more powerful attacks down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu learned EX mode Guardian of Light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu learned Bravery attack Gun slash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu learned Hp attack Cross slash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu learned Hp attack Gun storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu learned EX Burst Light Bringer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu learned Holy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu learned Judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu received the option of using guns and swords back to back in EX mode!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu felt like he was given a huge burden but he had so many friends behind him that he knew he could do this.

You'll destroy us all!\" Ryu then asks \"What are you talking about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel replies \"You know good and well! You probably don't know it yet but if you continue what you're doing, you're going to hurt everyone around you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then said \"Axel!

Ryu then felt sick to his stomach. He couldn't believe Axel was against him too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't determine what he meant earlier but he figured that it was probably related to the prophecy.

Did he say something to Axel to make him this way?)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu suddenly heard in his head (Ryu! I need help!) Ryu then said \"Linda?\" Linda then thinks to Ryu (Xeno-corp has found me.

Ryu then thought (I should go help her but what about my friends?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then ran up to Sonic and said \"Sonic. Tell the others I'm going to look into something. I need to be somewhere.\" Sonic then asks \"Where are you going?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu replies \"To check up on Linda.\" Sonic then says \"Okay. Just get back soon okay?\" Ryu then said \"Okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then used chaos control and the others noticed this and Sara asked \"Where did Ryu go?\" Sonic replies \"He's going to look into something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu wrapped into the ruins of Phoenix and turned around just in time to see Linda dodging some Xeno-soldiers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu managed to take care of the Xeno-soldiers and said \"Sorry I'm late.

He was much stronger than I thought. I barely escaped. I used what I had left to contact you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then said \"Okay. I'll take you back to the base so you can rest up.\" Ryu then chaos controlled back to the Heroes base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one of Xeno-corp facilities...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair then said \"What are you doing here?\" Jake entered the room and said \"I saw you guys leave and followed after you. You came here without knowing the password?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeta then says \"We knew it wouldn't be easy but we had to try.\" Jake sighed and said \"Step aside. I'll handle this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was looking through for anything that would help him find out the password. Jake then said \"They're good. They left very little to go on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeta then asked \"Can we get back to base now?\" Jake thought some more and suddenly said \"I got it!\" Jake typed in the password he was thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer then said \"Access granted.\" Despair then asked \"What was the password?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake replied \"If I told you, it wouldn't do you any good.

I'm good with computers.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person then says \"Then you probably know how this is going to end.\" Despair then said \"Find out any info you can!

Ryu was sweating bullets as he tried to think of something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuggernaut then asks \"You're here to makes pancakes too?\" Ryu nods and Juggernaut says \"Good for you! A soldier must always have the best breakfast for duty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then said \"Yeah.\" Juggernaut then says \"So anyways, I'll just purchase these ingredients and be on my way.\" Juggernaut then walks away and Ryu gets the ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu takes them to the others and they purchase them without being seen by the soldiers. They manage to get to safe location. Ryu says \"Man! I thought he would have found me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair then says \"I'm actually more surprised we got by those soldiers. You would think they would be more aware.\" Ryu then says \"Anyways, time to head back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey get back to the base to see Ultros still running around. Ryu then says \"Let's hurry this up before he decides to take apart the base.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went inside and Despair went to the kitchen. Ryu then thought (Damn it. I'm starting to feel more useless by the day.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara saw that Ryu was a little depressed about something and asked \"Is something wrong?\" Ryu quickly straightens up and replies \"No! Nothing's wrong!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then went to the training room. Sara could obviously tell that something was troubling Ryu. She wanted to help but she didn't know how. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair finished the waffles and gave them to Ultros. Despair then decided to talk to Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was in the training room and he was cutting down training targets as he unleashed his rage. Ryu then yells \"Why am I so useless!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu couldn't figure out why he was feeling weak. He doesn't even know why he doesn't talk about this with Despair. He just wasn't sure. Sara walked in and said \"Ryu.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then turned around and said \"Sara.\" Sara then asks \"Are you okay?\" Ryu replies \"Yeah. I'm fine.\" Sara then says \"You don't sound fine. You sound depressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then said \"I don't want to talk about it.\" Sara then says \"Please Ryu. Don't try to shut me out. It's only going to hurt more if you don't tell someone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then thought about what she said and said \"I just...feel so useless. I've been failing a lot and I even made a number of mistakes. I just don't know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara then says \"I don't think you're useless.\" Ryu then says \"You're just saying that to make me feel better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara then says \"It's true! I really don't think you're useless! You've managed to make it this far. There were moments I thought you were dead. I'm pretty sure that counts for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"But...\" Sara then says \"I'm not going to let you degrade yourself anymore! If you ever feel like you're not strong enough, let us know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"But I'm suppose to stop this evil that's trying to conquer all the dimensions! How can I do that when I keep failing to help my friends?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara then says \"No one said you had to do it alone. You have a great power within you. A power that gets stronger with each trial you survive. Your friends are your power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"I...never thought of it like that.\" Sara then says \"So if you ever feel down and you have no one to talk to, I'm right here.\" Ryu thinks about it and said \"Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara just smiled and said \"No problem! I just wanted to help!\" Ryu then, for some odd reason, kissed her on the lips. Sara was caught off guard with that. She didn't know what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara then said \"Ryu. I...\" Ryu then says \"Don't say a word. I just needed to do that. It was probably not enough for what you did for me. So thanks for that pep talk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then left with a smile on his face as Sara was stunned by what just happened. She was very red in the face but she enjoyed every second of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then passed by Zidane and Zidane said \"You really shouldn't have done that.\" Ryu then said \"What do you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZidane then says \"That you like Despair but this changes everything.\" Ryu then says \"Damn it. Bartz told you didn't he!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZidane then says \"I figured it out by myself so why don't we get to the chase.\" Ryu then asks \"What do you want?\" Zidane replies \"Nothing much. Just score me a date.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"What? You want a date? With who?\" Zidane then says \"How about Kate?\" Ryu then says \"No way! I won't do that to my friend!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZidane then says \"I figured you'd say. That's why there's a option two.\" Ryu then says \"Option 2?\" Zidane then says \"Despair.\" Ryu then says \"What are you crazy!? I can't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZidane then says \"It's one or the other or you could face Despair's wrath if you find her knowing about this fun.\" Ryu then says \"You jerk!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZidane then says \"It's easy! Just set me up on date with one of the two and I won't speak a word of this to anyone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"I knew you were a thief but a blackmailer? That's a new low!\" Zidane then asks \"So what's it going to be?\" Ryu then says...       </span></div></div>",

Ryu then ran into Axel, who had recovered from the last battle, and said \"Outta my way Axel!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel then says \"Sorry. I can't let you go berserk and destroy us all!\" Ryu then asks \"What are you talking about?\" Axel then says \"I'll kill you in the name of peace!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then blocked Axel's strike but Ryu felt more strength behind it and thought (He really wants to kill me!) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu pushed him away and Axel asked \"Are you going to hold back like last time?\" Ryu replies \"I don't know what your deal is, but I won't be stopped by the likes of you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel then smirks and says \"Good.

You won't have to worry about it when you're dead!\" Axel started landing hits on Ryu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu says \"So that's how it's going to be huh? I'll show no mercy then!\" Ryu then pulled out his shining sword and gun and got into attack position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the base....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara then felt like something hit her and she said \"I don't know why but I've got a bad feeling about today.\" Sara then suddenly felt something and said \"What!? This power...Ryu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara then thought (Since when could I sense Ryu's presence?) Sara then went to the place that Ryu was at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the southern part of the forest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu flew through some trees and hit a big boulder. Ryu put his hand on his shoulder and said \"Damn it. When did Axel get this strong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel then caught up to him and said \"Found you.\" Axel took out his buster sword and said \"I hope you wrote your will today because I'm going to kill you now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then charged at him again but Axel saw it coming and counter with knee to the stomach and kicked him back at the same boulder. Ryu was barely standing this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel then says \"I guess this is it. To think that you would become a danger to us all in the future. I wouldn't have believed it before.\" Ryu then asks \"Where did you hear that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel then says \"Since you're about to die, I guess I can tell you. Someone told me.\" Ryu then says \"And you believed them!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel then says \"But they had proof. They showed me what would happen years from now. I saw you cutting down your friends.\" Ryu then says \"That's a load of crap!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel then asks \"Is it? Are you sure that you aren't telling anyone about your other half?\" Ryu then says \"My other half left! I have no darkness in me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel then says \"That's where you're wrong. Darkness exists in everything. Even those of pure light. You will become a danger to everyone. I'm just getting rid of the problem early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"I can't believe you're buying this! I would never embrace the darkness! You know that!\" Axel then says \"I wanted to believe that but that vision I had felt too real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Axel...\" Axel then says \"I think I've talked on long enough. Time to die.\" Axel then thrusts his buster sword at Ryu but it didn't connect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then looked up and saw Sara defending him. Sara then asks \"What is wrong with you Axel!? You know Ryu is not the enemy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel then says \"That's what you say now but wait a few years and you won't be saying the same thing.\" Sara then asks \"What are you talking about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel then says \"I'm going to kill Ryu and that's that.\" Sara then says \"Then I'll just stop you.\" Sara then pulls out her sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Wait Sara.

Sonic and some of the others helped out to ease Tail's burden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was mainly checking Ryu and found that most of Ryu's bones were either in the wrong place or broken beyond recognition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails then says \"Unbelievable. Most of his bones are broken but nothing vital was hit! Whoever attacked him, they weren't trying to kill him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair then asked \"How long before he's back up?\" Tails replied \"Not sure. But it's not going to be some time this week. He'll be lucky if he wakes up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did as much as they could patch up Ryu's wounds. Kate was sitting down thinking about how useless she's been but suddenly, she was someplace else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate then said \"What the?\" Kate looked around but she didn't see anything.

In one kick, he broke most of my bones. the worst part is that I think he was holding back.\" Kate then said \"No way. In just on kick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"The group needs to find a new base but with Sonic being the only one left who knows chaos control, that's going to be difficult.\" Kate then asks \"So why am I here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu replies \"Even though I can't move my body, that doesn't mean I can't teach some people new tricks.\" Kate then says \"So then...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Yes. I'm going to teach you chaos control.\" Kate then says \"But I don't have chaos energy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Are you sure? Try concentrating some energy in your hand.\" Kate then concentrated and then a flame appeared in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate then asked \"What the!? What just happened?\" Ryu replied \"You just showed that you had potential to use chaos energy.\" Kate then said \"This is unbelievable!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"I'm going to show you how to use your element first, then I'm going to teach you chaos control.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate then says \"But this is my mind. Will the knowledge I learn here transfer over when I wake up?\" Ryu replies \"Yes. Now let's get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome training later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate was sweating from the training she did. Ryu then said \"Good. Now you can manifest the flames into your attacks. This will make you stronger.\" Kate then says \"Thanks Ryu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"No problem.\" Ryu then disappears and Kate wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the real world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate woke up with a start and she looked at her hand and concentrated. She then made a flame and said \"So Ryu was telling the truth.

Any people who live from it will be dead soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair then asked \"How do you know this?\" Ryu replied \"I had a dream about the end of everything and won't let this one come true!\" Bartz then asks \"So what do we do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu replies \"We'll have to defeat that mysterious figure to stop this but even then, the worlds will still try to combine so everyone who is not from this world will have to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the entire room of people except Ryu says \"What!?\" Ryu then says \"I wanted to defeat Xeno-corp before we were low on time but I didn't think it would take this long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara then asks \"So we'll have to call off the assault on Xeno-corp?\" Ryu replies \"No. It will be postponed until mysterious figure is dealt with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirion then says \"But didn't you say that the worlds are merging? Does that mean more than half the people here will have to leave before the worlds merge!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu bowed his head and said \"Yes. It's the only way to stop the merging of the worlds.\" Jake then says \"But wait! That's means that we'll lose a lot of firepower before the big fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Not necessarily. We could do a duo team attack. Have one team fight Xeno-corp and the other fight the mysterious figure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then says \"Sounds like no matter what happens, the Xeno-corp assault team will have way more people than the other team.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"It can't be helped. We have to finish both battles in one go. We don't have a lot of time.\" Axel then asks \"Wait! How will you find the mysterious figure anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"For some reason, I can sense him now. It's like he wants me to find him now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake then says \"Then that means that Ryu's is going on the mysterious figure attack team.\" Sara then says \"I'll go with you!\" Despair then says \"Take me along as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Hold it there! I can't take a whole bunch of people with me! The Xeno-corp assault group has to have enough fighters!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone got quiet and Ryu then said \"We'll do it this way. I'll bring along three people with me on the attack team.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara then thinks (I hope Ryu picks me. I have a bad feeling about this.) Despair then thinks (If Ryu chooses to not have me on his team then that's fine. I'm good on either team.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"I'll bring along Sara, Axel, and....\" Ryu looked around the room and saw Linda and she gave him the sign that she didn't want to be on Ryu's team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then said \"Despair.\" Despair sighed a little but Sara was a little angry. Ryu then says \"When our battle is over, we'll join you guys in the battle against Xeno-corp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Remember guys. Don't throw away your lives. Assist the others anyway you can. Once the battles are over. Tails. Get that dimension travel device ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake then thinks (He didn't say don't die. He must really believe that this battle will incur some losses.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then thinks (I won't use the upgrade armor unless it's necessary. but if it comes down to it...) They went their separate ways as the remaining hours went to 16.</span></div></div>",

You won't get strong enough through training alone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then asks \"Is that related to why you went to find me?\" Ryu's dark side replies \"Yeah. I can't beat him by myself as much as I hate to admit it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"So you want to become part of me again?\" Ryu's dark side replies \"I much as I like this freedom, if that guy doesn't lose, we all die.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Sorry.

Of course I know about it. I promise you that if we defeat him, I won't take over your body again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then asks \"How can you expect me to believe that lie?\" Ryu's dark side replies \"The same way I know you're friends are going to die if you don't hurry to Xeno-city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"How would you know how my friends are faring?\" Ryu's dark side replied \"Power sensing. Duh. Now come on!

Let's go.\" Ryu then turned around only to find Emily gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu's dark side then said \"She's fast. By the way, you can call me Marcus.\" Ryu then says \"Whatever.\" Ryu used chaos control and left with Marcus for the battle at Xeno-city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was near a forest carrying Despair. Emily placed her next to Sara as she said \"That should be everyone. Time to go.\" Emily disappeared with amazing speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara wakes up to find herself outside. Sara asks herself \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the forest leading to Xeno-city...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu and Marcus were running through to conserve their strength. Ryu then runs into Zack again.

I'll cover you while you think. Just don't take too long.\" Issac then exchanges blows with Platinum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquall, Firion, Tidus, Sara, and Zeta were in the lobby talking about the possible secret Ryu has. Firion then asks \"What secret do you think Ryu s hiding?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquall replies \"Maybe a new power like last time?\" Tidus then says \"But why would he be afraid to tell us about a new form?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeta then suddenly says \"Maybe there's a catch to his new form.\" Sara then says \"What kind of catch?\" Zeta then says \"I'm thinking something that endangers either us or him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidus then says  \"With his personality, he's more likely covering for us. Which makes me wonder how powerful his new form is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquall suddenly says \"Wow! Tidus said something intelligent for once!\" Zeta glares at him and says \"What's that suppose to mean!?\" Squall then said in fear of dying \"Nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Tails ran in and said \"Despair is awake!\" Everyone in the lobby stopped what they were doing to check on Despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in a old mansion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel was doing some thinking and said \"I've already made Ryu aware of a possible future. I just hope he doesn't do anything that will require my assistance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel then noticed Emily walk up to him. Axel then asks \"How's Ryu?\" Emily replies \"He's thinking about the best way to tell his friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel then says \"Good. If anything goes wrong, I want you by Ryu's side.\" Emily then says \"Of course. I just hope it doesn't come to that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel then says \"I hope it doesn't come to that either.\" Emily then vanishes as Axel felt something. Axel then says \"Damn it. He's found him already.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel then gets moving hoping to stop the calamity that's about to unfold.</span></div></div>",

I have seen another part of you. You're willing to sacrifice your life for a friend even when it seems impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then asks \"So where is this other item that's paired with my blade?\" the voice replies \"Here you go.\" Then another sword appears and Ryu removes it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu suddenly felt more power than before. Ryu then says \"This is incredible.\" The voice then says \"That is Ultima weapon. It represents your selfless nature and determination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then takes the blade as it changes to a silvery blue. Ryu then says \"I'll make sure that everyone gets out of this alive. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu received Ultima weapon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu's strength and defense has increased by 200%!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then felt something and the voice says \"There's no time. Something big is about to occur and one of your friends will die if you don't get there now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Okay. By the way, thanks for the blades!\" Ryu then chaos controlled to the location of the power he felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater at some ancient ruins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu appeared as he said \"The power just got stronger. I have to hurry to everyone!\" Then a voice says \"I can't let you do that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then sees Zack and says \"Damnit! I don't have time for this!\" Zack then says \"You've gotten stronger but so have I. Let's finish our fight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Sorry. But I got somewhere I need to be.\" Zack then asks \"Are you running away?\" Ryu then says \"Far from it. I have something more important to take care of.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was about to run ahead but then Zack says \"If you won't fight me, then your little girlfriend will die!\" Ryu then stops and says \"What are you talking about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack then says \"I'm talking about Sara.\" Ryu then says \"What have you done with her!?\" Zack then says \"Nothing...yet.\" Ryu then says \"You!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack then says \"If you value Sara's life, you'll go to the valley of trials before nightfall. I'll be waiting for you at the end.\" Zack then disappeared as Ryu tried to grab him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then thought (Wait! If he has Sara, then everyone else is...I have to go to them!) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu looked at the sun and said \"It's going to be nightfall in an hour.

If you had been stronger, Terra wouldn't have died that other time!\" Ryu then says \"Stop it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure smirks and says \"You are pathetic. Unlike me, the real you.\" Ryu then says \"Real me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure steps into the light to reveal a hedgehog who looked just like him! Ryu then says \"What the!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFake Ryu then says \"That's right. I have a desire to kill that you keep suppressing. You think that everyone will be happy if no one died? It doesn't work that way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"What do you know!?\" Fake Ryu replies \"I know that you have screwed up in the past but it wouldn't have happened if you just kill them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then asks \"What are you talking about?\" Fake Ryu then says \"For instance, if you had finished off Zack when you had the chance, you wouldn't be in this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"We don't know what would have happened had I did something different!\" Fake Ryu then says \"But that's where you're wrong. You could have prevented this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"That's not true!\" Fake Ryu then says \"You keep insisting that we don't have to die but is that what you really think? Don't lie to yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Stop. No more!\" Fake Ryu then asks \"Why must you keep your blood lust in check? If you just kill, you might like it or is that what you're afraid of?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"I don't need to listen to you!\" Fake Ryu then says \"But you can do nothing but listen to me because I'm you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then gets mad and says \"Let's make one thing straight, You're not me!\" Fake Ryu then smirked as Emily arrived to the scene. Emily then said \"Don't said it isn't you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"What?\" Fake Ryu then says \"Too late!\" Suddenly, Fake Ryu started to get bigger and stronger by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then fell to his knees and asked \"What's happening to me?\" Fake Ryu laughs in a sinister voice and says \"You chose not accept me and now you will pay the price!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu tried to get up but he couldn't as something was taking away his strength. Fake Ryu then became a dragon with dark red scales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFake Ryu then says \"Yes! This power! With it, I can use it however I want! Once I become you, I'll throw away all those weaknesses you have!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then realized who he was talking to. Ryu then tried to say \"Wait. I know you.

I have to beat this thing to save him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFake Ryu then says \"You want to challenge me? Then bring it on!

Ryu noticed the part about Terra attacking him and said \"Is there a reason she attacked you or even why she left?\" Onion knight then says \"It's because of me. I pushed her over the edge and now its come to this.\" Ryu then says \"So you believed this Cloud of Darkness? What is wrong with you!?\" Onion knight looks up and says \"Huh?\" Ryu then says \"If you continue to mope like this then you'll prove her right. You need to realize that it wasn't your fault!\" Onion knight then says \"But I....\" Suddenly Cosmos appeared. Ryu then says \"Cosmos!\" Cosmos then says \"I heard Terra's prayer for help.\" Ryu then says \"Then you know what happened?\" Cosmos nods \"She is being manipulated by the Cloud of Darkness. She's in pain.\" Onion knight then says \"It's my fault.\" Ryu then says \"How many times do I have to tell you? It's not your....\" Cosmos interrupts him and says \"It is.\" Ryu looks back at Cosmos and says \"Cosmos! How can you say such a thing?\" Cosmos closes her eyes and says \"Because it's the truth.\" Ryu cringed when he heard that. Cosmos then says \"He simply overestimated his own ability.\" Onion then suddenly asked \"Cosmos! Do you know of a way to save Terra?\" Cosmos frowns and says \"Defeating the Cloud of Darkness is the only way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnion knight suddenly frowns and says \"But my policy of fighting opponents I can't win against...\" Ryu then says \"What kind of policy is that!? You won't know if you can win against someone unless you try!\" Onion knight then says \"Wait! That's it! The crystals!\" Ryu then says \"Wait! You mean the crystals that are known to be able to save the world?\" Onion knight then says \"If I can obtain my crystal, then I can save Terra...then I won't have to fight her.\" Onion knight then says \"Hey! The crystals you mentioned. Tell me where they are!\" Cosmos looks away for a minute and says \"Yes. Avoiding a fight is one way.\" Ryu then says \"How can you think like this!?\" Cosmos then says \"I won't deny your decision. But is that your true desire?\" Onion knight then says \"My true desire?\" Ryu then says \"Of course! I thought there was something strange with you! I think you want to beat her too!\" Cosmos then says \"The crystal is the brilliance of you resolution. If you follow your heart's truest desire...you will obtain it. That's all I have to say.\" She then disappears in a flash of light. Ryu then says \"I think she speaks the truth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a voice was heard behind them \"How pathetic.\" Ryu looks behind to see a hedgehog in black armor with gold lacing. Onion knight then says \"Chaos's underling.\" The hedgehog then says \"That girl, Terra....Due to an unbreakable spell placed on her, she is continuing the battle as a servant of the Cloud of Darkness. Using all her strength, she will surely die in battle.\" Onion knight was about to attack him but Ryu held him back and said \"What if he just defeats the Cloud of Darkness?\" The hedgehog then says \"You cannot defeat the Cloud of Darkness with your power alone. Avoiding a fight is a wise decision.\" Ryu then says \"That's not true! That would be the same as running away!\" The hedgehog noticed that Onion knight changed his composure and he asked \"What's wrong? Isn't that your line of reasoning?\" Ryu then says \"Just what are you trying to pull!?\" The hedgehog walks past them and says \"You should look within yourself and decide.\" He then disappears. Ryu then says \"Man! What is with everyone in leaving flashily? I don't get that!\" Onion knight then says \"We should get going.\" Ryu then says \"Huh?\" Onion knight replies \"Have a friend that needs my help!\" Ryu then said to himself \"Did the look in that boy's eyes change from before? Maybe it's just me.\" Ryu went with Onion knight to help him with his quest.         </span></div></div>",

Corruption!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquall then says \"What's going on?\" Axel then thought about what happened before they left for the battle field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier in Cosmos's domain....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmos was telling her warriors to prepare for battle but she also said \"I would like Axel and Ryu to stay for a little while, I have something to say to them.\" Everyone left except for Axel and Ryu and they asked what she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmos then says \"I want you both to meet a special warrior to our cause.\" The warrior comes out of hiding and says in a nervous manner \"Hello...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmos then says \"This is Linda. She is the incarnation of light and will report everything that happens to me. She will do some scouting on the enemy but we can't have everyone recognize her so you two will keep her identity a secret until the time is right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Leave it to us. We'll keep her mission a secret so she can move freely within enemy ranks without being recognized.\" Cosmos turns to Axel and asks \"Will you keep her identity a secret?\" Axel was quiet at the time....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to present day....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel wasn't sure if he should tell Squall about her because she is on a secret mission but he couldn't let too many people know otherwise the enemy will find out about her mission through their friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquall then says \"Hey! Are you still with me Axel!?\" Axel saw Linda fighting Corruption and Squall asked \"Do you want to help her out?\" Axel thought about and replied....  </span></div></div>",
