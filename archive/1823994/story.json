            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Samuel Bane, I'm a twenty two year old deep sea diver and test pilot. I work for my family business, a ocean research company in Orlando that explores the secrets and mysteries of the oceans. Looking at the company's latest mini submarine, I was aquifer of anticipation and fear as I was to be the first human to see the bottom of the Puerto Rico Trench to investigate a fifty year old mystery. To say I was nervous would be a huge understatement as I checked, double checked and triple checked every inch of the sub's outer hull, window seals, and equipment a hundred times over. It was not until my girlfriend, Megan Stone pulled me away that I stopped. She was a tall, 21 year old woman with strawberry blond hair, blue eyes, and a doll like frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Sugar Bear.\" stating her nickname for me, she said. \"Your dad wouldn't send you that deep if he had not checked everything a thousand times over himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, I brushed my longish light brown hair aside, revealing my green eyes. \"It doesn't hurt to check things over another thousand times.\" looking into her eyes, I replied. \"This has been tried before with robots, none of them made it without being crushed or the cable snapping or some other mishap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan shuddered. \"That's what worries me.\" she said. \"The robots we did manage to bring back up looked like they had been literally torn apart.\" pausing, she added, \"I don't want you to return like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be careful.\" kissing her, I promised. \"The sub is built tough, just like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, my dad, Thomas Bane came into view. He was a near mirror image of myself. Powerfully built with crew cut light brown hair and green eyes. He smiled, seeing Megan and I together but turned serious as he reached us. \"I don't need to tell you that this mission is dangerous, son.\" looking at me, he said. \"If you want to back out, now is the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Go big or go home.\" smiling, I replied. \"We worked too long and too hard to let someone outside of the family to take this mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled an patted my back. \"That's my boy.\" he said. \"Climb aboard, the conditions are perfect but you know the ocean will not allow that for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and gave Megan one long kiss good bye before climbing a ladder to the top of the sub where the hatch was where I entered with dad sealing the hatch behind me. Sitting into the command chair, I turned one of the cameras to see Megan clasping her hands together, crying. It was as if she feared she would never see me again and, although I had the same fear in the back of my mind, I dared not worry her with it as I began checking all the dials and gauges again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you hear me, Sam?\" asked dad's voice over the radio. \"Your mom is still stuck in Miami but she gives her love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rodger that.\" I replied. \"Final checks are complete, let's get this sub wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You be careful down there, Sam!\" came Megan's voice. she paused, choking with tears. \"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, Meg.\" blowing a kiss, I said. \"I'll see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sub was then lowered into the water and taken down to the ocean floor where I signaled I the surface, saying my last quick goodbyes before hitting a, disconnecting the tether and all communication with the ship. Little did I know my life would dramatically change from there....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManeuvering the mini sub down into the trench proved to be more difficult than I had first thought. Upon hitting the external lights, I found that there were sunken ships from all eras along the walls on huge cliff hangings, some of them seemed to to have been literally torn apart and I took a few pictures with the external camera to take a record of them. Traveling further down, I kept a sharp eye on the instruments and kept an ear out for any sounds of water leaking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible.\" admiring the scene, I whispered. \"I never expected to see this may ships down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I approached a small yacht that seemed to be just resting on the very edge of a cliff. As I passed it, the wake of my turbines sent it falling off and into the trench. I followed it down, figuring it would clear my path, to find it on the trench floor only I also saw a figure struggling beneath its broken mast. I moved it for a closer look to find what only could have been a young mermaid! \"Holy...\" I breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mermaid looked up at me with large fear filled blue eyes as her red hair swayed in the current. Other than the tail, she reminded me of Megan. \"It was my carelessness that got her pinned.\" frowning, I said. \"The least I can do it try to get her out from under the wreck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, as I touched the controls for the robot arms in the front of the mini sub, I heard a crack and the distinct sound of water leaking in. Turning in my seat, I saw that one of the side windows had cracked, allowing water to stream in from the outside. I knew I only had a matter of minutes before the pressure of the deep water would crush me but I could not leave the girl to die under the wreckage. \"Damn it all.\" I cursed. \"I have to save her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving in, I used the under water torch to cut away at the steel mast that was pinning the mermaid down, hoping to cut through the rusted metal quickly as another crack reached my ears. It took me only a minute to cut the mast in half and I quickly moved to push it off the trapped girl. \"Come on!\" I yelled, hearing the robot arms strain under the weight. \"Move that piece of junk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the mermaid was free and she swam up, looking no worse for wear. She looked at me through the main window of the mini sub and flashed me a grateful smile. I smiled back, just as the sub violently imploded upon me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat seemed like hours later, I opened my eyes, wondering if my deadly encounter with the trench was a dream until I saw the face of the mermaid I had rescued. She smiled at me as I tried to sit up but found I could not move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest, you were badly damaged.\" in a soft melodious voice, she said. \"I am Valdam,  I thank you for your brave rescue. I rescued you in turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" Weakly, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mermaid smiled and replied...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I had webbing between my fingers and my skin was more rough that I was used to. It was almost as if I had scales rather than fleshy skin. \"Is there a chance I can return to my own world, my own people.\" Worried, I demanded. \"My father and girlfriend were on the surface when I dived down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is complicated.\" Serious, Grain replied. \"Both medically and legally on many levels.\" He sighed. \"Valdam should have been more careful when she opened the portal back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I was pulled here by accident?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrain nodded. \"The procedure that had saved your life is permanent.\" Serious, he explained. \"We can send you back but you would likely be seen as an outcast.\" He frowned. \"Worse, you have no knowledge of how to survive in your oceans and would likely not live long. Forcing such misery upon another living being is unthinkable in our society.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I survive here?\" Tearing up, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have people here who can teach you.\" Reassuringly, Gain replied. \"If you remain here, you would be placed into a foster family until you are comfortable with living on your own.\" he smiled. \"While it is true we can teach you how to survive in your own oceans, would you be willing to live with being the only one of your kind there while you are among many here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, he swam off to allow you to rest and think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing the man, I screamed more until he sighed and began to make a deep vibrating sound from inside his throat. I don't know why but it sounded almost like a song and I quickly found myself feeling strangely calm. \"Where did you find this female child, Valdam?\" stopping his 'song', the man asked. \"You know as well as I do that it is forbidden to absorb human children unless they are a finger tip (an inch) from death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, please, its a long story.\" wincing, Valdam said. \"Give me the time to tell it properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the man sighed before pulling up what looked like a chair. \"Tell your story carefully.\" calmly, he warned. \"It will determine the severity of your punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValdam gulped. \"I had logged time to search the trench floor for wreckage that may be useful.\" carefully, she began. \"As I was ending my search, I saw a sinking vessel fall towards me; I could not escape in time and I became helplessly pinned under the mast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was the child inside this vessel?\" unconvinced, the man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, father, the 'female child' was a man in a strange submersible.\" surprising her father, Valdam said. \"He used an odd cutting tool to break the mast and move it off me.\" pausing, she added, \"He saved my life but the submersible imploded shortly after, I returned the favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" glancing at me, the man said. \"Why is the man now a small female child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only had seconds to save his life so I ordered the machine to absorb what was left alive and this was the result.\" quickly, Valdam replied. she then blushed and said, \"He became a little girl because I used my own DNA to complete the absorption process; I could not bear to leave him orphaned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, to repay this human male for saving your life, you turned his entire world upside down by making him not only a member of a different species but a different age and gender as well.\" rising to his feet, the man said. \"Young lady, from this light cycle (day) forward, you are responsible for your new sister's well being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, father.\" near tears, Valdam said. \"I will take my new responsibility seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not a punishment but a necessity.\" calmly, the man said. \"you chose to make the human male your little sister, you must now face the responsibilities of that decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... excuse me.\" raising my hand, I said. \"Can you please explain what happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man walked up to you with a kind smile. \"I am Soren, captain of the star vessel, Kraken.\" gently, he said. \"You had a deadly experience with the crushing water pressures outside of this vessel, making it necessary to rebuild your body into a new form.\" touching my shoulder, he quietly added, \"Unfortunately, we only know our anatomy so you were rebuilt into one of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I seem to remember being taller and not a girl.\" still effected by the calming song, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is because there was not much left of you to save, I'm afraid.\" remaining calm, Soren replied. \"As for being a girl, well, my daughter, Valdam decided you would adjust faster being her new little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, we do not absorb any human unless they are very close to death.\" chiming in, Valdam explained. \"We have absorbed children who had been pulled out to sea by a rip tide or were pulled down with a sinking ship...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, it is against our law to take any human, child or adult, who is healthy and in no danger of death.\" interrupting, Soren said. \"That is why I demanded Valdam to explain herself; the last thing we need at this time is seven billion angry humans raining down on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....\" the calming effect still holding me, I said. \"What happens to me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the moment, you will be taken to our family chambers where you will be welcomed into our family.\" serious, Soren replied. \"Valdam will be watching over you, explaining our laws and customs.\" he then sighed. \"As for me, I will be filling out paperwork, explaining why I suddenly have a second daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he walked away, mumbling under his breath....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I peered from behind the door and froze, seeing that it was Valdam.

Seeing them caused me to stop struggling as I remembered I was completely naked and blushed brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll catch a cold if you stay naked for too long, little one.\" smiling, she said. sighing, she added, \"I know you are terrified. Will you trust us enough to help you get dressed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes now a pink color, I slowly nodded and Valdam eased her grip, handing me the panties. I slipped them on, feeling the strange fabric against my new skin, it was an odd but not unpleasant sensation. Valdam then handed me what looked like a sleeveless leotard. Blushing further, I slipped it on to find it fit me almost like a second skin as I was then handed a pair of odd shoes that looked more like slippers as they had no laces. As I put them on, I was surprised that they closed up, contouring to the very shape of my foot. \"That's better, isn't it?\" giggling, Valdam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what this kid's story?\" curious, Aquarius asked. \"You know the Tribunal frowns upon absorbing human children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This young <i>man</i> was inside a small, strange submersible.\" turning to Aquarius, Valdam said. \"He arrived just after I found myself pinned under a fallen wreckage I did not see coming.\" her eyes turning a blue color, she added, \"He saved my life but the submersible crumbled under the water pressure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you saved his in turn.\" impressed, Aquarius said, eying you, still blushing. \"Why is he now a little girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValdam blushed. \"He was so close to death, I- I panicked.\" looking guilty, she replied. \"I rushed the process, causing a random rebuilding of his new Gaian body.\" sighing, she added, \"Instead of regenerating his old body, the system took the bio-matter that was still alive and rebuilt him into a little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaian body?\" confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is who we are, little one.\" turning back to me, Valdam said. \"It is now who you are as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, looking at the two girls as thousands of questions flooded my mind but one in particular was heavy on my mind. \"Will I be able to return home, to my family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Valdam and Aquarius winced, answering my question. \"I am truly sorry.\" her eyes now a deeper blue. \"Had I not acted, you would have certainly died. You are one of us now, the air you used to breath is now... deadly to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened, the realization that I can never return home again hitting me hard.

My friends call me Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam does not sound like a proper name for a girl.\" smiling, Aquarius stated. \"Maybe Samantha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced at that suggestion. \"If I'm going to be stuck as a girl, where ever we are, I'd like to pick my own name.\" gathering some courage, I said. \"If I were born a girl, my mom would have called me Kailani. It's Hawaiian for ocean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValdam smiled. \"Well then... <i>Kailani.</i>\" giggling, she said. \"Welcome to the city of Kraken. It and the city we call Leviathan rests in a massive under sea cavern below what you call the Puerto Rico Trench.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened again, stunned. \"We're still below the ocean!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we are.\" smiling, Aquarius replied. \"We've been here for the passed fifty star cycles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the impact... was your arrival here on Earth.\" shocked, I said. I giggled, my first since my transformation. \"I just solved the mystery.\" sighing, I added, \"Too bad I can't share my discovery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for the best, Kailani.\" comforting me, Valdam said. \"Your world is not yet ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a firm knock came to the hatch like door as a male voice reached them. \"Ope en de nay o Moro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Valdam and Aquarius gasped. \"Shit!, It's Moro!\" whispering Valdam said. \"I was hoping for more time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to answer, Valdam.\" said Aquarius, walking to the door. \"I hope you have a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she opened the door to find Moro...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked like human lizard but with no tail. His skin was covered in scales only they were so tightly packed the spaces between almost appeared drawn on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValdam looked down at me and sighed before turning to Moro, annoyed. \"Moro, you scared her!\" scolding, she said. \"I had just got her to calm down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then leaned in close and I was able to see her clearly for the first time. She had greenish brown skin, covered in scales, with red eyes and reddish hair that looked more blue in the strange light. She was wearing a blue lip color that made her strangely attractive. Only I darted back to the man, Moro as he spoke in strict but calm manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I detected an odd drain in power and discovered that there had been an unauthorized use of the absorption chamber.\" eying me, he said. \"Absorbing a child is a very delicate process, one you are not trained to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was not a child!\" countering, Valdam shouted. \"Not at first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoro sighed, a growl echoing in his throat but before he could utter a word, a small boy with greenish scaly skin and curiously ivory colored eyes came into view. He wore a leotard type outfit, similar to what I was wearing only mine came with a short skirt, his did not. \"Goo cycle.\" seeing me, he said. \"Was ya nay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot understanding the language, I tilted my heads to the side. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoro placed a hand onto the boy's shoulder. \"Esa, Coy, dis feyob no eek or lingo.\" calmly, he said. pausing, he then said, \"She apparently speaks English.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" nodding, the boy said. turning to me, he asked, \"May I please have your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I was Sam.\" nervous, I replied. \"Now...

As we followed, I found myself being held and guided by the iron hand of Moro, as if he feared I would run off. As he did, he was speaking his strange language through a hands free device while also talking with Valdam, no doubt reporting the situation to this Tribunal. Curious, I looked about, to find that the 'streets' of Kraken were busy but not congested with a number of what appeared to be shops and businesses through hatch like doors. Finally, we stopped at a set of massive doors deep within the city. \"This used to be the captain's quarters, where he and his family lived.\" looking at me, Moro explained. \"Now, it serves as the hall of the Tribunal, those who govern our laws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he placed his hand onto a panel, which scanned his hand before a voice came over a speaker. \"Enter, Moro.\" serious, the voice said. \"We have much to discuss with you and the new Gaian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors opened with a low rumble and I followed Moro inside to a huge chamber that looked much like a military court room I had seen in various movies only it had a more science fiction theme to it as I saw three Gaians, two males and one female, sitting behind a large desk with a monitor on each side of them and three other Gaians sitting behind slightly smaller desks on either side of the monitors in a large 'C' pattern. \"Welcome to the Tribunal, new Gaian.\" politely, the woman in the center of the group said. \"I am judge Vanhallen, to my right is judge Merlin and to my left is judge Skidrow.

Kailani.\" somewhat sadly, judge Skidrow said. \"You are here so to determine your fate. Also, there is a question of jurisdiction. You were absorbed in the city of Kraken by a citizen of Leviathan who, although botched the job, saved your life in return for your heroics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed hard. \"What is to become of me?\" tearing up, I asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Megan was in tears, looking at the camera screens. \"He's been down there too long.\" sobbing, she muttered. \"Where is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've reached the bottom of the trench.\" looking at the same camera screens, Thomas announced. \"Sam has to be down here as I didn't see any signs of it on the way down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then, to their horror, they found the crumpled wreck of the submersible, with your blood on the inside, silently resting on the trench floor. A blood chilling scream echoed from Megan's throat before she buried her face into Thomas' shoulder, crying hysterically. Thomas continued staring at the screen and found the mast of a large yacht near the submersible had been burned off. \"The yacht must have fallen free from a ledge and landed on the sub, pinning it down.\" he whispered, not knowing how close to the truth he was. \"It had to have damaged the ship and caused it to implode just as Sam got himself free from the wreck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He promised he'd be back!\" distraught, Megan screamed. \"He promised he'd be careful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas could do nothing to comfort Megan as he was distraught himself but paused as he noticed something strange. \"Wait a minute.\" touching the controls, he said. \"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan turned to look and became confused as well as she saw a shadow moving away from the floor of the trench. \"Another submersible?\" surprised, she asked. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas grabbed a pair of binoculars and ran up to the deck. Taking a moment, he carefully looked all around, finding no ship in the distance. \"This is very strange.\" becoming nervous, he said. \"Who could possibly have a sub that can go that deep without the need of a ship to launch from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May... Maybe, whoever it is found Sam and saved him.\" hopeful, Megan suggested. \"They may be on their way up to return him as we speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas, not wanting to raise any hopes, looked at the screen again, only to see the submersible fire something that looked like a slow moving laser before the screens went out. \"Somehow I do not think they are very friendly.\" sweat beading on his face, Thomas said. \"Only I agree that this means Sam may still be alive.\" knotting his jaws in decision, he turned to Megan. \"Mark these coordinates while I get us out of here!\" sternly, he ordered. \"What evere took out the robot may come for us next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We- We're leaving!?\" shocked, Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time to explain!\" quickly, Thomas yelled. \"Just do as I say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Megan marked the spot on the navigational map, Thomas took the wheel and pushed the ship into full throttle. \"Hang on, Sam!\" he muttered to himself. \"If you are still alive, I'll get you back!\" he shivered slightly, feeling the heat of his own anger. \"If you're dead, you can be damned sure I'll avenge you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the city of Kraken, a man looked at a camera monitor inside a small room and sighed. \"Such a fragile little device.\" shaking his head, he muttered. \"All I did was have the remote probe try to access its computer system and the silly thing overloaded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another part of the city, my tour took me to the various shops and eateries. I was thankful to have acquired a taste for seafood as it seemed to take up most of the Gaian's diet. It was very surprising to learn that the Gaians were very physical with everything they did. Their idea of a handshake was a smack to the front or back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of the city of Kraken so far, Kailani?\" walking with me, Valdam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's different, that's for sure.\" giggling, I said. then I sighed. \"Megan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoro frowned. \"You are worried about this Megan.\" looking at me, he said. \"I am sorry but you can no longer live on the surface world. The air there is too thick for you now, you would suffocate within minutes.\" sighing, he added, \"Even if you could breath the air, you would be an outcast among your own people. Either way, the life you once knew is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to sob, even though I knew it was the truth and Coy placed an arm around my shoulders. This sent a heavy wave of pleasure through me, making me blush brightly. <i>\"Oh God!\"</i> feeling disturbed, I thought. <i>\"Don't tell me I getting turned on by this boy already!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is so much to be discovered here in Kraken and even in the city of Leviathan.\" trying to be of comfort, he said. \"We may be of different nations but we are all Gaians... that includes you, Kailani.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... thank you.\" blushing brightly, I said. \"Could you stop that, it's freaking me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoy looked at me, confused. \"huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoro gave a slight gulping chuckle as he pulled Coy's arm off of me. \"Ehs no desu ot yobs 'uching' reh.\" emphasizing the word 'uching', he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoy blushed brightly at that. \"Sorry, I forgot you were a grown boy.\" looking at me, he said. \"I did not mean to touch your pleasure points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure points!?\" startled, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From transmissions we have intercepted from what I believe you call radio and television, blowing in one's ear creates a pleasurable feeling.\" explaining, Valdam said. \"Caressing the back of the neck creates the same effect for Gaian girls, its the front of the neck for boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this made me blush even more as I turned to Coy. \"It- It's alright, Coy.\" softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoy nodded, still blushing but Moro spoke up before the awkward feeling set in. \"Let's move on.\" smiling, he said. \"I think Kailani would like to see...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Moro's words echoed in my mind as I thought back to my family's efforts to protect the oceans. I had become lost in thought until Moro announced, \"Welcome to shuttle bay one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up and was surprised to see a number of strange looking shuttles, all made to look like creatures of the deep. Noticing my expression, Moro laughed. \"We try to remain unnoticed by humans until the time is right.\" smiling, he said. \"These shuttles had been modified since our arrival so to move through the waters without raising human interest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to one shuttle, modified to look like a stingray, I was surprised by how well it resembled the real thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a simple two seat shuttle, used to carry delegates to and from the city of Olympia.\" explaining, Moro said. \"This one will be leaving soon with two such delegates to try to form a trade agreement with the Aquarians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The who?\" confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValdam giggled. \"They are who you might call merpeople, Kailani.\" amused, she explained. \"There is much about your own oceans you do not understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoro gave a strange command and the back underside of the shuttle opened, revealing the inside. \"Let me show you how it works.\" offering, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and walked into the shuttle with Coy following. \"Careful not to touch any of the controls.\" serious, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the room shook violently, throwing you and Coy to the floor of the shuttle. \"It's a sea quake!\" struggling to maintain his balance, Moro announced. \"Remain calm, it will pass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaking continued, unnerving you slightly. Spotting what looked like a helmet, you grabbed and put it on, hoping it would provide protection. Coy, seeing this, laughed and reached to grab one of his own. Only he missed and the helmet fell onto the controls, closing the shuttle's hatch and activating the engines. \"Oh arc!\" cursing, Coy yelled. \"Get into a seat, Kailani! Hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe urgency in Coy's voice moved me to obey immediately as Coy quickly threw on the other helmet and strapped himself into the second seat. \"I guess we've been selected to be the delegates.\" nervously laughing, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the shuttle's engines start, Moro and Valdam ran into a small room and sealed the door just as alarms went off before two large doors opened, flooding the bay with sea water. The stingray like shuttle launched itself off the bay floor and fired off its thrusters, sending it onto its programed course with Coy and I going along for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The quake must have activated the pre-programed launch sequence.\" sighing, he muttered. \"I had better alert Olympia that they are about to receive two young guests.\" managing a smile, he added, \"Kailani is in for quite the adventure.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There, on the trench floor was the remains of my submersible, crushed and distorted with a significant amount of blood stained onto the inside walls. I began to cry, looking at it. Then spotted my dad's robot diver, burned out, on the floor near it and began to wail. The fact that my old life was over had finally sank in and the beginning of my new life did not seem to be at the greatest of starts. \"I-I'll nev-never see-see them aga-again!\" sobbing, I yelled. \"D-Dad, Mo-Mom, Me-Megan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to comfort me but not knowing how, Coy touched my hand, getting my attention. \"I don't know much about the surface but there is much to see in my world.\" smiling, he said. \"I was told that we live up to 450 to 500 years and, as we become more one with this Earth, that number will grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five hundred years?\" stunned, I asked. \"How old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I only eight.\" lightly, Coy replied. \"I'd say you were about ten or so. The absorption process computers would have your exact new age recorded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing, err, we can not breath under water.\" curious, I said. \"Why land at the bottom of the ocean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can change our bodies to suit any environment.\" simply, Coy replied. \"Only it does not last long as our bodies will eventually revert back to normal, you must concentrate hard to keep it up but it gets easier each time.\" smiling, he added, \"My dad can maintain a form for seven days before needing to change back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, so its a matter of practice.\" curious, I said. \"That's interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoy nodded. \"We could go onto the surface, in an emergency.\" wincing, he said. \"Only, the change would not last very long and the change back would be so subtle, as we are humanoid, we would not notice until it was too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, wanting to scream. \"Anything you can tell me about these Aquarians?\" changing the subject, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are a strange looking lot, that much is certain.\" smiling, Coy replied. \"Only, I was always told that we look just as odd to them as they do to us. We must respect those differences in looks and thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, impressed with Coy's maturity but smiled as he then asked, \"What of the surface world? What foods do they eat? Do they have music there? Are there any places to play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Easy!\" Giggling, I said. \"Humans eat a large variety of foods, depending on where you go, we listen to all kinds of music and yes, there are a lot of places to play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour, Coy and I exchanged stories of each others world. I was amazed to learn that a smack to the back or front of the head was their version of a handshake. I was shocked to learn that girls formerly greet each other by cupping the others breasts. \"It's only girl on girl.\" blushing, Coy said. \"If a boy does it to a girl he might get something pulled he doesn't want touched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that even more but, before I could speak, Coy suddenly looked out the window and gasped. \"We're here!\" excited, he said. \"Those are the welcoming arches!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked out and saw a row of stone arches with beautiful coral flowers and volcanic glass designs, making them a breathtaking sight to see. \"It's beautiful.\" I said. then I saw the city. \"Oh, wow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city rested inside what looked like an ancient meteor creator. I was not sure where on the map we were but I guessed that the city was shielded from human view somehow. Then Coy touched my hand. \"When we land, remember to be formal.\" said Coy. \"Dad will be very upset with us both if we make the wrong first impression.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded then watched as we approached a beautiful castle that seemed to have made from pure crystal. Standing at the front steps were two mermaids and a small mer-boy. I guessed they were the 'welcoming committee'. Once the shuttle had touched down, Coy and I unbuckled ourselves from the seats as the door opened for us, flooding the shuttle with sea water. At first I panicked but Coy smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These helmets allow us to breath underwater without changing our bodies.\" explaining, he said. \"It's a good thing as we may be here a while.\" he sighed. \"We best not keep them waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervous, I swam out first and peered at the three Aquarians. They indeed looked much different from Coy and myself but I saw nothing wrong with that. Still, I was frightened as I seemed to be now representing my new home. \"Um... hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tallest of the two mermaids smiled at us. \"Welcome, noble travelers.\" politely, she said. \"I am Calypso, queen of Olympia, this my daughter, Hera and my grandson Alexaries.\" she paused, looking as if she wanted to laugh. \"To be honest, I was expecting someone a little older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Queen!?\"</i> I quickly bowed before her, still uncomfortable with the 'formal' way of Gaian greetings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were... accidentally elected.\" also bowing, Coy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Coy or I, Moro had called ahead, telling the Aquarians of the incident that had sent us their way and to expect our arrival. He also told her I was once human. Calypso found it amusing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could only guess she was feeling conflicted emotions but I decided it best not to ask for the moment. \"I'm fine, Kailani.\" gently taking my hand, she said. \"Please, allow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and allowed Hera to carry me as she swam up, with Alex and Coy following. To my surprise, Coy was keeping up well, wiggling his body like a snake through the water. Hera soon stopped and I found myself about twenty five feet above the ocean floor as she pointed at the city. \"Behold the city of Olympia.\" smiling, she said. \"Beautiful isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened in wonder as I gazed upon what could only have been described as the ancient Greek ruins, restored to their original luster, placed underwater with the palace looking like the Parthenon only made of crystal.

It wasn't long before we were allowed to enter. Once inside I found myself looking around as Coy and Alex were, as this our first visit to the Archives. Swimming through the Entrance Hall, I found myself in a massive chamber. Looking around I saw 50 perfect pearls; resting in nests of seaweed in alcoves along the walls. \"Wow, these really are the size of my head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was taking in the beautiful sight when I saw an elderly, but strong, merman swimming out of one of the 20 hallways leading into the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, young ones.\" pausing, he said, \"I'm Kraken, Elder guardian and caretaker of the Archives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwimming forward, Coy respectfully bowed before Kraken. \"I am Coy of Kraken.\" smiling he said. \"I am honored you were named after my city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKraken chuckled. \"Actually, Coy, Kraken is a powerful creature of Earth's oceans.\" amused, she said. \"I am honored to be named after him and honored your ship is so named as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoy blushed brightly at his mistake but Kraken did not seem troubled and he soon smiled. \"Where did the Aquarians first come from?\" politely, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKraken touched one of the pearls and we watched as the room changed into a setting on the surface. Looking at everyone, Kraken said, \"We were known to the surface dwellers as the Neanderthal. We coexisted with the surface dwellers, living on the land and breathing the air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange figure appeared before us. I turned to Kraken and bowed to him. \"Speak, little one.\" motioning me to rise, Kraken said. \"What is your question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Kailani, recently absorbed human and new citizen of Kraken.\" rising, I said. \"Humans believe that Neanderthals died out thousands of years ago due to unknown circumstances. How did they go from living on land to becoming the Aquarians you are today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To answer your question, Kailani, we evolved and became one with the sea.\" pausing, Kraken said, \"The four brothers; Poseidon, Zeus, Vulcan, and Gaea agreed that the two dwellers of the surface must be parted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a story coming, Coy, Alex, and myself gave Kraken our full attention. <i>\"This should be interesting.\"</i> smiling, I thought. <i>\"A play on the Roman and Greek Mythology.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zeus sent forth a massive stone, forged by Vulcan, to be received by Gaea as a gift to the Neanderthal.\" explaining, Kraken said. \"This stone had magic, placed there by Poseidon, to prepare his new children to come home. With each birth, the Neanderthal became more and more ready to embrace their new identity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kraken spoke the history, adding a little of our religion into the story, we all saw the muscular Neanderthal slowly change; developing scales along their legs and slowly becoming more adapted for ocean life. Kraken paused near the end of his story, giving the class a bright smile of pride. \"By the one hundredth birth, the Neanderthal were no more and Aquarians were born.\" he said, as the image vanished. \"So as you can see, children, we do share a certain kinship with the poor surface dwellers.\" he gave us all a sad look. \"Only they're not as blessed as we, so we must remain patient until the day all evolve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us applauded, but soon fell silent as Coy turned to Alex. Bowing, he said, \"Blessed be, prince Alex, who hath evolved!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Kraken covered his mouth to hide a laugh as Hera smiled, seeing Alex blush before turning to me and stated, \"Blessed be Kailani, who hath evolved!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed brightly at that then smiled as Hera asked Coy, \"Would you like to be blessed as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoy blushed along with Alex and myself but before anything became to uncomfortable, Kraken cleared his throat. \"Please continue on your tour and feel free to ask the other elders any question you wish.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If our team catches it, we win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a small fish swam by with such speed, I had to look twice. Curious, I swam after it, not knowing my body had grown a tail to gain speed. I caught the fish after a minute of chasing and held it up to everyone's shock as my feet returned to 'normal'. \"What kind of fish is this?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kailani, you just caught a frenzy fish!\" stunned Isis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.china.cn/attachement/jpg/site1007/20101228/001ec94a1ea10e83ec4449.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.china.cn/attachement/jpg/s...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that is a frenzy fish.\" releasing it, I said. \"Now I know what to look for when I cheer on the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Oceania and Hera looked at me, their faces pale, causing me to worry. \"What- What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kailani... you better come with me quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" concerned, I asked. \"Is something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I found it impossible to breath and I gasped for air, struggling with the helmet over my head. Acting quickly, Oceania and Hera each took an arm and rushed me to the palace. There I was thrown into a pocket of air where I finally tore off the helmet, gasping at the air as I coughed. \"What's happening to me!?\" terrified, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to find out.\" assuring me, Hera replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, unknown to me, Calypso summoned Adra to her chambers. \"I'm afraid I have some grave news, Adra,\" seriously, she said. \"Kailani, the young Gaian girl, her body is rejecting the absorption process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean, exactly?\" asked Adra, worried for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalypso sighed. \"If we are to have any chance of saving her life, we must act now.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The story begins with a little history. Nearly fifty years ago, NASA detected a sizable impact in the Atlantic Ocean, over the Puerto Rico Trench. This unofficially sparked the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 as it moved the US government to investigate. As the years passed, it became less clear what that impact was as no one seemed to have detected such an impact that was large enough to be detected by satellites. Today, a private ocean research company, created a mini sub that they hoped would safely take a man to the bottom of the trench to investigate the age old impact mystery. They send their best deep sea diver and test pilot, Samuel Bane (you) to take on the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules are simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Do not change the names of the characters.<br>\r\n2. The main character can not be killed.<br>\r\n3. Add characters if you wish so long as they fit the story line.<br>\r\n4. Sex is allowed but please keep it age appropriate.<br>\r\n5. Proper spelling and grammar, please.<br>\r\n6. Always leave more than one option.<br>\r\n7.
