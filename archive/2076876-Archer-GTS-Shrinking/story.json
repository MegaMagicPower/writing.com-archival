You looked around the small space, noticing some bullet holes on the walls and even a few on the buttons. You wondered what the cause of this could've been but you didnt really care as long as the thing doesn't break on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator doors open, presenting you with the unimpressive base of operations. Seriously, this place looks just like an ordinary office. No fancy gadgets on the walls, no portraits of world leaders, not even so much as an American flag. Is this some sort of second front? A front within a front? Do they even do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wandered across the room past the cubicles and the odd bored employee here and there, you noticed two women at a desk by a set of double doors. The one sat at the desk was a skinny brunette girl with her hair tied back. The other was a... larger... lady with blonde hair. The double doors behind them seemed important so you approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me ladies?\" you adjusted your tie again, \"I'm here to see a Ms. Mallory Archer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me.\" the brunette said. You raised an eyebrow at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Ms. Archer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says Cheryl on your desk.\" you observed, pointing at the name plate by her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The blonde girl laughs, \"Dumbass.\" she teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Ms. Archer?\" you ask Cheryl's companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well, look, if you could just let her know I'm here, my name's Anon. I'm the new agent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New agent? Well, in that case hellooo.\" Cheryl leaned over her table, ensuring her cleavage was apparent under her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it a rest, 'Mallory', the guy just walked in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheryl sighed and flicked the switch on a intercom. \"Ms. Archer, your new agent is here.\" she said into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time you hussies stopped flirting with him, let him in already.\" a voice barked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she can't wait to finally meet you.\" Cheryl said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I heard what she said, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know that!\" she gasped. \"Does that mean everyone can hear her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored her antics and let yourself through the doors. An older woman sat at her desk, nursing a glass of scotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Anon. Sit.\" she motioned towards a chair in front of her. You did as instructed. \"Now, Lana Kane, one of our field agents is on her way up to induct you. In the meantime, I'll explain briefly what you'll be getting up to with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Based on what we could find on you, you've had minimal firearms training, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right ma'am. Basic training with assault rifles and advanced training with handguns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortunately you won't be needing guns to complete most of your assignments. You'll be part of our infiltration team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And Miss. Kane, is she part of this team?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lana? Goodness, no! The way she stomps around with those clunky feet I'm surprised we can't hear her coming. The infiltration team will be composed of you. Just you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... understand.\" you wonder how many agents this place has if one person is considered a team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door behind you opens and a simply stunning woman walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something about a new agent?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lana! How polite of you to stampede your way in here without knocking! This gentleman is Anon, our newest little infiltrator. I need you to take him down to the lab to show him what the infiltration will entail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana looks you up and down and extends her arm. \"Lana Kane. Pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anon. Likewise.\" you stand and shake her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anon? Just Anon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a nickname, I don't really use my full name much for obvious reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Follow me.\" she walks out of the office and you thank Mallory before obeying Lana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------  <b>THIS IS WHERE THE GOOD PART STARTS IF YOU HATE INTROS</b>  ----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told we'd be getting a female agent.\" Lana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to disappoint.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a problem with it but if you're anything like our current male field agent, I'll be nice and let you pick the window I toss you out of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just here to work.\" you assure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you enter what must be the lab. The first thing you've seen in this place that actually looks like it could belong to a secret organisation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Dr. Krieger's lab.\" Lana explains, \"Don't touch anything unless given permission and don't feed any animals you may find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Krieger was working on something that could help us infiltrate our competition. At first it was invisibility but then he said he had a new idea but didn't tell anyone what it was.\" she walks over to a nearby shelf and delicately picks up a syringe from it. \"This is what he made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you have no idea what it is?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if Krieger told me I wouldn't be able to explain it to you. There's a reason I'm paid to just go outside and shoot bad guys. You're paid to find out what this is and use it to complete your mission.\" she hands you the syringe. \"I'll be back in a couple minutes I've just gotta go do something. Let me know what that stuff does when you find out.\" she walks out of the lab and leaves you to your own devices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give the syringe a small shake. The liquid inside seems gelatinous. You weren't exactly one to inject odd substances into your veins you've always been a sucker for finding out what weird shit is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For science!\" you declare as you stick the needle in your arm. You feel the jelly-like substance make it way into your blood stream and you become light headed. You stretch to put your hand on a table for balance but find that you can't reach it. You take a step closer and try again but to no avail. You wipe the sweat from your forehead and rub your eyes. Your vision corrects itself and you realise the serum you injected into yourself was a shrinking formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck..?\" you look around, taking in your surroundings. Everything looks incredible. Tables tower higher than anything you've ever seen, a test tube on the ground beside you becomes a giant tunnel, the floor stretches on forever; a vast wasteland begging to be explored and the doorway, a gaping passage to a fantastic new world with even more to explore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for one problem; you're tiny and nobody knew what Krieger was making in here. Nobody knows you've shrunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what the hell do you do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>This was a chapter request for user \u2018war\u2019. If you\u2019d like to request a chapter yourself, please send me a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. Sorry it took a whole year, war! But here it is...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour excitement was quickly dulled by the reality of the situation. Sure, being this tiny was cool and all, but, you\u2019re also at a huge risk - all it took was one misstep from one of your new colleagues and you\u2019re finished! Plus at this size, all the dust and general dirt on the floor was more akin to rubble from an earthquake. And didn\u2019t Lana say something about animals? This was bad. You paced back and forth trying to come up with a game plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallory was the only solution. She\u2019s the one in charge here, she must have some sort of contingency plan! Though, you doubt there\u2019s a company policy on \u2018What to do when your new guy shrinks\u2019. Regardless, she\u2019s your safest bet. How long would it take to walk back to Mallory\u2019s office? Hours? Days? What can you eat? How will you find water? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you considered the logistics of your journey, a solution found itself falling into your lap. Or rather, stomping dangerously close into your personal space. Giant crashing footsteps that got louder with each step sent vibrations through your entire body. You looked up to the doorway and saw Lana walking in. Mallory wasn\u2019t kidding; she really is heavy on her feet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped in the doorway and scanned the room for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnon..?\u201d she slowly drew her gun from her holster. You made a mental note to inform Mallory of the total disregard for firearm safety in the workplace. You didn\u2019t speak. You were frozen. You wanted to call out or, at the very least, move away from the middle of the room but there\u2019s a freaking giant right in front of you! Your brain struggled to send any messages to your legs as it was busy still trying to process this woman as an actual human and not a skyscraper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana took a step forward. Although to her, she was slow and deliberate in her stride, you still felt the harsh vibration when her boot hit the floor.  She took another step. This time, right toward you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, fuck...\u201d you whispered, you closed your eyes and prepared to meet your end. You always knew you\u2019d die in this field of work but you\u2019d hoped for a more dignified end. The shadow of Lana\u2019s boot cast over you and you braced for impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana looked down, shocked at the sudden noise from under her boot. She lifted her foot to reveal the - now shattered - syringe she\u2019d given Anon before she left. She noticed only broken glass on the floor and no residue. Anon had injected whatever was inside. She bent down to pick up the glass only to notice something next to the rubble; a tiny man with his eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnon?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was louder than before. Definitely closer. You opened your eyes. You\u2019re not dead! To your left you saw a pile of broken glass and dead ahead you saw Lana\u2019s giant face. You surprised by your own composure. Less than a minute ago, you were preparing to die a most gruesome death and now you\u2019re staring a giant in the face. Most people would be freaking out by now. But what surprised you more was her composure. She hardy seemed phased that she almost killed her new colleague. She looked at you with cold eyes, almost unimpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA shrinking formula. Huh.\u201d she spoke as if this was an everyday occurrence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... yeah, so I found out what the syringe did...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing carried was a strange feeling. Sitting in Lana\u2019s hand was like being in a plane with no roof and no seatbelt. And lots of turbulence. Being away from the dusty floor made you feel a lot cleaner but the warmth coming from your new-found mode of transport made you uncomfortably hot. You loosened your tie and opened your shirt\u2019s top button. It did little to cool you down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long to get to Mallory\u2019s office. Being carried was definitely better than walking no matter the heat! Lana walked past Cheryl and Pam and through the double doors without so much as a friendly glance. You weren\u2019t sure if they saw you or not - Lana may have been walking to fast - but you wouldn\u2019t want too many people to see you like this anyway. As far as embarrassing first days go, getting yourself shrunk within 10 minutes of starting your shift had to be the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were dropped on Mallory\u2019s desk with little fanfare and the the two women stared at each other. Mallory looked at you over her glass of brandy then back at Lana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s tiny.\u201d she said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother one of Krieger\u2019s brilliant experiments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what good does an agent the size of my thumb do me?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKrieger\u2019s fault. Not mine. So...\u201d Lana unholstered her gun again and pointed the barrel - large enough for you to sit in - right at you. \u201cHe\u2019s no use now, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scurried away from the gun, heading for the edge of the desk. You might survive the fall but a bullet bigger than you would turn you into paste without a doubt. You turned to see Lana watching you make your daring escape with little urgency. You turned again to see Mallory\u2019s hand blocking your path. You weren\u2019t able to stop in time and crashed right into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite enough of that. Lana, put away your gun.\u201d she barked, returning her hand to the brandy glass where it belonged. Lana obeyed and you took a breath, knowing at the very least you weren\u2019t going to be shot. \u201cNow, shoo! I will decide what happens to our agent without you waving that thing around.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana slammed the door behind her, leaving you and Mallory alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she continued to drink her brandy, paying you no mind, you still had an uncomfortable feeling as if she was staring right at you. Mallory Archer was certainly a woman who knew how to exude an intimidating presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Archer..?\u201d you eventually piped up. Mallory turned her head slightly, implying she could hear you but perhaps wasn\u2019t entirely listening. \u201cThanks for... y\u2019know, that whole thing with Lana.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond. \u201c...what does happen now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallory put her drink down and looked at you. \u201cWell, you\u2019re of no use to us as a field agent anymore. So I suppose you\u2019ll need some sort of office duties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t come to ISIS for office work - you could find that in a much safer corporation for better pay - but you doubted any other place would accept a bug-sized data-entry admin. You shrugged. \u201cAlright, what did you have in mind? Maybe we could find a way to shrink a computer and I could\u2014\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were cut off by an enormous pair of feet making a rude entrance right in front of you. \u201cMiss Archer, what is this?!\u201d you called out, getting your breath back after such a startle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how you start with this. Then we can consider other responsibilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith what?!\u201d you didn\u2019t know why you were shouting, maybe the size of Mallory\u2019s feet made it seem like there was a wall between you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been needing a PA for a while but it\u2019s hard to find someone qualified in administrative duties and massages.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMassages?\u201d you looked up towards her toes, starting to understand where she was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a very stressed woman, and need relief. It\u2019s this or we genuinely have no use for you. If that\u2019s the case I\u2019ll have to call Lana back...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach dropped. This was your decision: act as a foot slave to your new boss, rubbing feet the size of buildings or be shot. You fell to your knees a tried to hide the terrified look on your face. You had to decide.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The threat of Lana\u2019s return proved a hefty motivator. You really didn\u2019t want to be shot. You stood back up and placed a hand on Mallory\u2019s sole. It was tough like leather but had no visible wear, no doubt the result of many years spent sitting at a desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Miss Archer... I\u2019ll do it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t reply. You figured you\u2019d better get used to not being acknowledged from now on and took a deep breath. You pressed both hands into her soles and started to rub. You\u2019d never given a massage before, even at normal size, so a lot of what you were doing was guess work. Should you rub up and down? Side to side? In a figure of 8? Write the alphabet? You settled on doing a mixture of all of the above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot was hardly an attentive audience - it hardly responded to your efforts, bar the occasional twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms began to ache within the first minute. Ten had passed. Your wrists felt like they would fall off at any moment and you were starting to sweat immensely. You couldn\u2019t continue. You let your arms drop and released an involuntary gasp as the pressure in your biceps was relieved. You dropped to your knees once again and let yourself fall on to your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quiet for only a moment before you heard Mallory shift in her chair. Although your eyes were closed, you could tell she was looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t finished yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need a minute...\u201d you said between breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought you\u2019d been permitted a break as Mallory didn\u2019t respond. Ten minutes, you told yourself, then you\u2019d start on the second foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you found yourself drowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar smell of brandy washed over you as gallons of the stuff doused your body. You quickly shot up, trying and failing to avoid swallowing too much of the sharp liquid. You soon found yourself standing in a pool of brandy, and almost certain you\u2019d be drunk within the next few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d you shouted up at Mallory, who sat watching you, empty glass in hand. She buzzed out to the girls at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan one of you come here and clean this up?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was staring to get dark outside. The day must be ending. You sat on the desk you\u2019d been left on all day, watching Mallory who was laying on the couch. You looked over at your shirt, which you draped over a stapler in an attempt to dry it but it still looked as wet as it did when she poured brandy all over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this is how your first day at work ends. Shirtless, drunk, and tiny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallory stood up from the couch and grabbed her coat from the rack. She continued to ignore you as she did for most of today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Archer? How am I going to get home?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm? Home?! You can\u2019t go home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I follow...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, by the time you make it home, it\u2019ll be time to come to work. It would be much more efficient if you stayed here from now on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn your office?\u201d you couldn\u2019t believe what you were hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! I\u2019ll return in the morning and we can continue your training. You still need practice in massages.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about food? What about water? I need a change of clothes! Miss Archer, please! Is there no way to make me big again?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallory threw her coat on and took a glove out of her pocket. \u201cPerhaps you can sleep in this. Until we can find more suitable accommodation...\u201d she dropped it next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Miss Archer, wait! You can\u2019t leave me like this! Wait!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallory left, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit.\u201d you stared at the door for while, hoping she\u2019d come back and reveal all of this to be some sort of prank. Something they do to all the new recruits. But nobody came. You walked in the stapler and felt your shirt. Wet. Cold. You returned to the glove and felt inside. Dry. Warm. </span></div></div>",
