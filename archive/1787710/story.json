            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shiki stood at the edge of the crosswalk that connected the Scramble with Hachiko park. Today was finally the day! The day where she would see her new friends for the first time in the RG- and this time, Neku and the others would see what she really looked like. During their life-changing adventures in the UG, Shiki had actually taken the form of her friend Eri, for her self-image had been her entry fee to participate in the game; so all her friends were probably subconciously on the lookout for someone with a big hat, flowing red hair, and green short-shorts. Boy, were they in for a surprise. While her own hairstyle was similar to Eri's- afterall, she had been the one to try and copy her-, her usual outfit looked nothing like her best friend's. Instead of a sleeveless top, Shiki was fond of wearing white jacket that did a pretty good job of concealing her figure. When combined with the round glasses she wore to correct her astigmatism, she almost looked like some sort of doctor or scientist. It's a good thing she had brought along Mr. Mew, the cat plushie she had used to help her fight back in the UG. It had been made by Shiki herself as one of her earliest forrays into sewing, and she was sure it's unique design would be memorable to her newest friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pedestrian light flashed green, and Shiki, along with dozens of other people making their way towards the park, took a step off the sidewalk and onto the black asphault of the road. About halfway across the street, she felt a sharp pain prick the sole of her right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Shiki cried out in pain as she lifted her foot up while still hopping forward on her left. She had just stepped on a screw with a blackened tip. Given how it had been in the middle of a busy intersection, Shiki automatically assumed that it had somehow gotten loose and fallen off a car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good thing Mom always kept me up to date on Tetnus shots,\" Shiki quickly thought to herself as she struggled to keep up with the advancing wall of people. \"Still, I should probably drop by the clinic after I go meet up with the others and have it looked at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving safely made it across, Shiki found the nearest trash can and threw the offending metal away.Once that had been accomplished, she tested her pricked foot with a few steps; and, after finding it to be only slightly tender still, continued onward towards the park. The park's design was simple overall. In the middle of the open space was the Hachiko Statue, surrounded by a row of benches and a few potted plants. Legend says that if you approached the statue during Hachifest and rubbed it just right, then you would be blessed with good luck. Shiki herself had gone to the festival when she was younger, and although she still didn't know if the statue had granted her good luck or not, recent events were causing her to lean toward the idea that the statue had indeed blessed her. Past the statue on the left were a few stores; mostly places selling snacks or offical Hachiko souviners. She had probably been to them a few times in the past, but she couldn't really remember. Either way, she wasn't here for a shopping trip, she was here to hook up with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of her friends, Shiki just caught sight of Beat skateboarding through the crowd towards the statue; and already infront of the statue were Neku and Rhyme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Shiki,\" The redhead quickly gave herself a peptalk as she slowly advanced through the tide of people. \"Don't worry about anything. They'll recognise Mr. Mew and everything will work out fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way past a group of tourists led by a young woman with a megaphone, Shiki got closer and closer to her friends; until finally, while she was still a few feet away but atleast hopefully within hearing range, she stopped moving and cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hi... everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree sets of eyes expectantly moved their gazes from her face, down to Mr. Mew, and then back to her face. In an instant, Shiki practically found herself being crushed by Beat's version of a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, Shiki, It's so good to see you again. Man, you DO look different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful Beat,\" Rhyme said with a warm smile on her face. \"You might break her in half if you keep holding on to her like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I wasn't trying to do anything like that!\" Beat panicked and quickly let go of Shiki. \"I was, just so happy to see to see her, ya' know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Rhyme said with a giggle. \"Just remember that you're pretty strong, and that you might hurt someone on accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know.\" Beat said with a sigh, before quickly finding another burst of excitement. \"Hey Neku, you remember when I punched through that wall-thing the Reapers had up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You practically shattered the whole thing, it's a miracle the Reapers didn't go after us for vandalism.\" Neku said as he attemped to tell a joke. Finding no response, the rehabilitated emo kid turned to face Shiki. \"By the way, It's great to see you again Shiki. We were just deciding on what we wanted to do first; what do you feel like doing?\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well,\" Shiki said as she mentally summoned a list of virtually every event that was going to occur today. After everything she and her friends had suffered through in the UG, she wanted their reunion to be absolutely perfect; so she had spent almost five hours last night creating a comprehensible spreadsheet in her mind that covered in detail everything from movie showtimes and concert ticket prices to where it would be the cheapest to go grab a bite to eat. Immediately, Shiki began connecting several events together and began forming a mental planner to insure that everyone got the most out of their day together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see: At 1:30 the Shibuya Cinema will start selling discount tickets for people who buy in groups, if you guys don't mind a long walk, the Tin Pin Slammer store in Molco is letting people come in and play on their proffessional tables for free today, or, we could always just head over to the 104 building and see what's new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, looks like we're going to the movies, playing Tin Pin, or going shopping,\" Rhyme said as she raised a finger on her right hand for each suggestion Shiki had made. \"Let's put it to a vote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around the circle the UG survivors were standing in, hands were raised as Rhyme parroted the options to everyone. After a third round of hand raising and a bit of childish attempts to sway one and others opinons, a concensus was more or less reached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Rhyme said in a raised voice to insure that everyone heard the decision. \"Despite the fact that Beat decided to change his vote four times-\" Beat laughed nervously as everyone else shot him a glance.\"-It seems that we finally have a winner. Get your best pins ready, because we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of Rhyme's verdict went unheard by Shiki, who suddenly bent over as a lance of pain suddenly piereced her midsection. All of a sudden, the redheaded girl began to feel her energy bleed right through the pores of her skin; it felt like she hadn't eaten in a week- no, a month. Tears began to well up in her eyes as her head desperately swung around; frantically trying to pinpoint the location of some type of food. Expectedly, her friends soon noticed her odd behavior, and all eyes were now on Shiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Shiki! Man, you feelin' okay? You don't look so good all of a sudden-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the skater kid spoke, a gust of wind managed to carry the sent of french fries to Shiki's nose. Like a millitary-grade targeting computer, her eyes instantly moved over to the left side of the park; and, upon seeing the sign for the local Sunshine Burger chain, took off in a bee line dash for the door; knocking over a small group of unsespecting tourists in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Shiki, where you going?\" Beat yelled in panic at the bespecled girl's decision to run a group of people over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we got to make sure she's okay!\" Neku responded as he began to chase after her; with Beat and Rhyme quickly fallowing suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry!\" Rhyme gave a drive-by appology to the group of tourists who were still trying to collect themselves off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that Rhyme had voiced an appology on her behalf, Shiki was already barging through the glass door of the shop; her momentum carrying her all the way to the front counter. Fortunately for her-or rather, the people around her, there was no one else in line at the time the starving redhead crashed into the order taker's station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... W-welcome to Sunshine!\" The young blond woman infront of Shiki said somewhat nervously; startled slightly by what she had just witnessed. \"C-can I take you're order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'llhavefourdoubleburgerstwoordersoffrenchfriesandalargesoda!\" Shiki spoke so quickly that her monstrously long order sounded like a single continous word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" An anime-style beat of sweat appeared on the back of the blond woman's head. \"Sure! That'll be be 2,500 yen... i think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki violently through the ammount required down infront of the nervous employee; anything to get something to eat. Thankfully, her order was prepared only a few minutes after she had placed it; which was good, considering that during the time it took to get to her, she had contemplated both stealing someone else's food and eating her own jacket. A minuture wall of food was placed infront of Shiki by the same woman that had took her order; who took a nervous step back when she saw how fast Shiki began shoveling food into her mouth. About the same time that the blond employee began a retreat to the safety of her work station, the other ex-Players arrived at the scene of the incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's over at both four,\" Neku reported to Beat and Rhyme. \"It look's like she just needed a bite to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"Ryme nodded slightly as they walked closer and closer to where she was sitting. \"A really big bite...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Rhyme was right. Sitting in front of Shiki were four two-tiered hamburgers, a sizable pile of fries, and a soda cup the size of a beer pint. Shiki was currently grabbing the shreeded potato chunks by the handful; craming one after another into her mouth and not even swallowing before grabbing more. After the pile of golden fries had been reduced to nothing more than a smearing of salt, Shiki grabbed the nearest burger and shoved half of it into her mouth at once; her teeth shearing the miniture tower of beef, cheese, letuce, and tomato clean into two identical pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Shiki...\" Neku half mummbled in bewilderment as he tapped her on the shoulder. No response. \"Shiki...\" Another tap. No response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dude! I totally know why She's eating so much!\" Beat suddenly added in excitedly; raising his hands in the air as if to physically support his revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, Beat?\" Rhyme asked. Still concerend for Shiki's wellbeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the Colors!\" Beat said as he pointed to the bright assortment of colors that decorated the interior of the resturaunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...come again?\" Neku replied after a moment of sheer mind numbiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay: hear me out. Awhile back, I was watching tv with Rhyme. I don't remember most of it because it was some boring special on \"Saicology\"- but during the one part I picked up, This old guy was talking about how different colors effect how you feel; and bright colors apparently make you want to eat more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhyme and Neku just stood there. Completely dumbstruck by the \"logic\" behind Beat's reasoning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't think that's it...\" Rhyme said finally after a few minutes of awkward silience had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Beat seemed to collapse with the invalidation of his theory; taking a step back from Rhyme and Neku. \"B-but, that scientist guy on tv said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beat, you shouldn't always believe what you see on tv,\" Neku said as he crossed his arms and thought for a moment. He had heard of that idea before as well; though he was pretty sure that the human subconcious was incapable of driving you to such alien acts. Trying to explain that to Beat however, might be a little time consuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. I guess you're right, Phones.\" Beat said as he composed himself again. \"Well, if it's not that, what do you think the problem is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Shiki let out a moan as she slowly became aware of her surroundings. Neku wasn't sure, but he thought he noticed a fliker of color in Shiki's iris' for a moment; though he couldn't be sure, as her eyes looked perfectly normal a split-second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'N-Neku?\" Shiki turned her head to face her friends. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well... We're not so sure. But it looks like you just had lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki tried to get up- but found herself hindered by a stiff pain in her midsection. Reaching down with her hands, she felt a small bump on her normally completely flat belly. Little by little, the bespecled girl began to remember the series of events that led up to this; needless to say, Shiki felt that the entire sequence had been highly embarrasing, and her cheeks quickly became flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...wow...um, I really don't know what to say. I guess i must have forgotten to eat breakfast...or...something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, it's okay.\" Beat said in his usual upbeat voice. \"We were just worried that something was wrong. If you were hungry, you could of just told us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki smiled nervously; relieved that her friends were perfectly fine with what had happened. Still though, she hadn't felt hungry on the way to the park; and she was pretty sure that she had had strawberry flavored poptarts for breakfast with a cup of skim milk and half an orange for breakfast. What had happened to her a few minutes ago? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Merril Anderson- joined the Reapers stationed in the San Fransisco UG at the age of eighteen. By the time she was twenty one, she had made it to the rank of Officer; and served as Game Master for the first time only a week after her birthday. Now, at age 24, she had been handpicked by the Angel's Board of Directors to head their efforts in tracking down the rogue Composer Yoshia \"Joshua\" Kiryu; who was wanted for a number of crimes by the Angel higher ups. The series of events last month that almost destroyed the Shibuya Underground had alerted the Angels that stricter observation of the world's UG's was necessary to insure their continued opperation; and that Composers would be held responsible for their actions. Unfortunately, a Fallen Angel by the name of Sane \"Mr.H\" Hanekoma had tipped Shibuya's composer off that he was to be apprehended, and they both dissapeared before the Angel's forces had arrived. Thankfully for her, someone had thought ahead of time to set up a blockade around Shibuya before they went after the Composer; so it was still likely that they were somewhere within the city limits. Armed with the title of Conductor and having the direct backing of the most powerful organization in exsistence, Merril was confident that Joshua and Mr.H would be brought to justice to answer for their crimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerril flipped through a dossier of the remaining Reaper personnel stationed at the Shibuya Underground; the multi-colored lights of Dead God's Pad causing her snow-white skin to take on a mulitude of different shades. The last month had taken a serious toll on the local division- all three Game Masters and the Conductor dead, a loss of over 90% of the field opperatives in two weeks alone, and a total breakdown in the UG's barrier system. Everyone knew that life as a reaper had its occupational hazards, but such a high casualty report in such a short time was unprecedented; and what partially brought to attention how dire the situation in Shibuya had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a tragic loss,\" the newly appointed Conductor mused to herself as she lounged in one of the Reaper base's many sofas, snacking on a box of donuts she had picked up from one of the local stores that was marked for UG admittance. While no one who reached upper tiers of Reaper society could be described as empathetic, Merril did feel some sympathy for the rank and file Harriers and Barrier controllers; though like the rest of the organization, she largely regarded players as nothing more than a set of skills and statistics, marking them as either potential Reaper material or just another poor soul to be eaten alive by the Noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerril flipped past the rest of the casuality report and turned to the page listing the surviving members who were currently on standy deeper in the Shibuya river. Nibbling on a chocolate drenched wheel, the brown-haired brown-eyed Reaper visually scrolled down the disturbingly short list. It didn't take too long for her to find someone who stood out, as her eyes caught sight of a Harrier by the name of Koki Kariya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, this one has top scores in practically everything: Combat Prowess, Creativity, Willingness to Cooperate, and a stellar erasure record. Why isn't he listed as an officer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Conductor reached over for another donut; only to find that the box had become empty already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I guess they sell you less than a dozen donuts in Japan. Oh well, I'll just take a stroll and pick up some more while I sort the rest of this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerril earmarked the page in the dossier she was on and proceeded to close the book and headed out of the retro Reaper base. As she exited the dark tunnel and entered into the Main part of the Shibuya UG, she opened the book up and resumed reading; afterall, if there wasn't anyone to run into, why should she bother watching where she was going? After spending about ten minutes winding through the crowds who couldn't see her, she managed to find the bakery she had visited earlier; and, after taking a moment to admire the little Reaper decal inscribed on a support beam, opened the glass door and walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! Welcome to Heaven's Bakery,\" a cheerful clerk suddenly sounded off as the Conductor entered. \"My name's Kasumi Chokosabe, what can I get for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. yes, hello,\" Merril said as she smirked to herself. She always found interacting with regular old humans humerous; for unbeknownst to them, she was a being of great power; someone who could bend the fabric of reality with just a thought- and normal old people had no way of knowing it. \"I'll take a dozen donuts- oh, and some sugar cookies as well,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up!\" The clerk said as she dashed over to some storage racks and gathered what the customer had requested. Within the time it took Merril to re-open the dossier and find Kariya's stats again, Kasumi had returned with two boxes that each had a tiny pink ribbon tied to the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go!\" The clerk beamed. \"That'll be 500 yen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerril smirked to herself again as she removed a pin from her collection and held it behind her back. Within an instant, the pin transformed into a 500 yen coin, which was quickly placed on the service counter as the Conductor placed the baked goods under her dossier and strolled out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! And come back again soon!\" The storeclerk practically cheered as the door slammed shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further delay, Merril finished combing through the dossier of information the Board of Directors had handed her when she had been selected for the job. Having processed what information the Angels had over some particualy delicous pastries, Merril knew where she would start. She would systematically interview all of the remaining personnel to get a better picture of the situation and possibly help her track down any other members who may have been accomplices. With a look of satisfaction on her sugar smeered face, Merril took out her cellphone and punched the number in for the holding room for the Shibuya survivors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. It's Merril Anderson. I would like you to bring me Koki Kariya and his partner Uzuki Yashiro immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for a response, Merril closed her phone and reached for one of the remaining sugar cookies. This would be the jumpstart of a much greater career. Success here was sure to mean a Composureship was in her future; and from there, well, there was nowhere to go but up.</span></div></div>",

We've already wasted a week in that box they kept us locked up in- I'm afraid my aim might get rusty if we don't get back to shooting players soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we're lucky to be alive right now,\" Kariya said as he and Uzuki began walking deeper into the dark tunnel surrounding them. \"From what I heard, the only Reapers that were left after that last game session were couped up with us in that room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Uzuki physically recoiled from the disturbing news; which almost cause her to drop her gun into the murky waters beside her. \"But there were only like, a dozen or so Harriers and support members that I was aware of.

With such a high casualty list from that last game, it's no wonder that the brass has this place locked down. They've actually shipped over some prodigy of an Officer to replace old Megumi as Conductor- in fact, we're supposed to be meeting her now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, a new Conductor...\" the pink Reaper began thinking of all the possible ramifications having a new Conductor might mean. Always one to try and make it to the top, Uzuki almost instantly jumped to one particular conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new Conductor will need a few new Game Masters!\" the gun-toting Reaper practically cheered at her self-revelation. \"Ones with experience and who know the layout of the city like the back of their hands! Oh, they sent us here to get promoted and help get the game up and running again! I better start thinking of challenges now so that I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, woah- easy girl! Don't be so quick to jump to conclusions.\" Kariya said quickly; trying to contain his partner's enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on! We're easily the most senior Harriers left; why else could we be down here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we'll be finding out shortly,\" The orange Reaper said as the bright multi-colored lights of Dead God's Den finally became noticable. From the outside, the headquarters of the Reaper Officers looked rather uninteresting; it had no windows, unpainted concrete walls, and a single steel door. Once you entered through the door however, its like you just walked through time and returned to the American 1970's. Hanging from the ceiling was an enormous disco ball that gave off a wide variety of different colors. Blasting from a jukebox in the corner was an endless march of music that was much older than either Uzuki and Kariya were. On either side of the room was a sofa set situated around a round table; and next to each sitting area was a pool table with a much smaller scale disco ball hanging above it. The whole place had a very retro theme to it, and the Reaper duo had a running bet going on which of the Officers had done the decorating; although they both knew it probably had been Megumi's design. Sitting in the left hand booth was a young woman wearing a black trench coat with a matching undershirt and pants. She was currently multitasking between scribbling some notes and taking bites out of a rather large cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be her,\" The pink Reaper thought to herself as she made her way across the aquarium beneath her and headed over to where the new Conductor was sitting; with Kariya shuffling along behind her slightly. Once she was standing close enough to the table that she believed the woman would hear her over the music, Uzuki cleared her throat and composed herself as formally as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uzuki Yashiro and Koki Kariya, reporting for duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-clad woman turned her attention from her notes and fixed her dark brown eyes on the Reaper duo. \"Ah. Good, you made it. Come, have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Reaper pair sat down across from the new Conductor, feeling themselves sink slightly into the foam of the red cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Merril Anderson. As you may already know, the Shibuya UG's Reaper personnel suffered an unprecedented level of casualties in the past month. The brass has assigned me the task of traking down those who were responsible for the incident and brining them in for questioning; so I'm going to have to ask you two some questions about what you remember from the last few weeks. Now for starters, was there anything particularly odd that happened during the three game sessions of last month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there was plenty,\" Kariya responded as his mind began crawling through his memories to select various bits of information. \"Knothing too out of the ordinary happened during the first week; although Mr. H did intervene for these two kids-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Merril said as she frantically grabbed a new piece of paper and began scribbling down some notes. Producers almost never interacted with the game itself- let alone the players within it. \"Who did he help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't remember the girl's name, but the boy's name was Neku. And let me tell you, he was a real trooper. He played the Reaper's game for three consecutive weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but that's unheard of,\" The newly appointed Conductor stammered; this situation was indeed unique. \"Why didn't he get reincarnated after winning the first time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beat's me. Although the kid's list of friends didn't stop at Mr. H. During the second week- which was also the one where the Taboo noise started showing up everywhere, Neku somehow made a pact with an illegal player...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerril continued to frantically write down notes as the Harrier continued to tell the story of the last month in the Shibuya UG. Unfortunately for her, Kariya's info only seemed to make the incident even more confusing. One of the two Angels stationed there had played the game in the second week- and judging by the fact that Kariya hadn't said it was Hanekoma, the Conductor automatically asumed that it had been the Composer; the only problem was, why had the Composer played his own game? On top of that, neither of the Reapers had any recollection of how the week had ended; although Merril could gather that the Game Master for that week and the previous Conductor had both died after the Harriers had been blanked out. However, she still didn't know who had erased them. Was it that Neku kid who had managed to survive in the UG for three consecutive weeks? Or had the Composer eliminated his own underlings so that he could flee without being tracked? At the very least, Kariya had confirmed the Taboo noise presence in Shibuya had occured while the Composer was still in power; meaning that it must have been either Mr.H or Joshua who had set up the manufacturing sigils. That alone was enough to bring them both in; all she had to do now was to find them. It's a shame she had no way of knowing whether or not that Neku kid could be reached, as the Angel blockade of the city meant that no one could send a message in or out for atleast another month. If the fallen Angels couldn't be brought in before the blockade ended, then the games would be started again in order to return the system to normal; meaning traveling between the planes of existence would become possible again, giving the two renegades an easy chance to escape. She would just have to insure that they were found before that chance was open to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you both for coming in and telling me this.\" the Conductor said as her pen fell from her hands  and crashed onto the table below. \"As I told you earlier, I'm in charge of tracking down the individuals responsible for last month's incident; and the brass believes that Mr. Hanekoma and that illegal player- who's name is Joshua by the way, are the prime suspects. Since both of you have served in the Shibuya Reapers for quite some time, I'm promoting the two of you to the Officer's corps. Your first order is to organize the remaining reapers into groups of two to begin a city wide search for the suspects. Report back to me once you are finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" Uzuki said excitedly as her earlier suspicion was validated; she had indeed been promoted. \"We won't let you down!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yoshiya Kiryu moved a black pawn forward two squares, causing it to threaten an opposing knight. He then moved said knight forward three and left one, allowing him to completely circumvent the pawn and directly threaten the a black rook at the same time. Playing chess against himself was a hobby he had taken up many years ago when he first started his career as the Shibuya Composer; and he was actually quite good at challenging himself to move both teams without favoring one over the other. It was around midday now, and the ex-Composer hadn't moved from the folding chair he was currently sitting on for atleast four hours. It wasn't like there was much else he could do right now however, as he and Mr. Hanekoma were hiding out in a secret storage room of a small local bakery; and the room was pretty empty. Aside from the table Joshua was currently sitting at and the two accompaning fold out chairs, the only other thing in the room was a small security screen on the wall behind him that showed images of the store's front and back enterences, along with a stream of the clerk's desk and one of the door that seperated him from the rest of civilization and from the prying eyes of the Angels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree knocks echoed across the old metal door that was the entrence to their current base of opperations. With just a thought, the ex-Composer slid the door open with ease, and Mr. Hanekoma silently walked into the room; the door sealing itself behind him automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this plan of your's will work, Mr. H?\" Joshua said in a half-whisper as the ex-Producer sat down and took up the role of the white team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, now that you mention it- I have no idea.\" Mr.H laughed to himself as Joshua moved his rook out of danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm sure the both of us could just take her and anyone she has with her out and just jump ship when the blockade ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad idea, Chief. Right now they're still using Reaper level guys against us. If we take them out, then the Board is sure to make an exception of the usual regulations and send actual Angel enforcers after us; and trust me, they aren't fun to deal with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're just going to sit here while some up-and-comer from America turns over every stone in the city trying to find us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the time being, yeah.\" Mr.H responded with another laugh as he moved his knight again and placed it dangerously close to the black queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well then, I atleast hope that your plan will insure that se only turns over 99% of the city's stones while trying to find us.\" Joshua moved his queen and captured the nearby knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at it this way, Chief. I know people. This Merril Anderson is just you're typical individual who climbed the corporate ladder a bit too quickly. She's devoted to her job and spends almost all of her time working; causing her to miss out on the finer things in life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so she'll be chasing us from six to ten instead of nine to five like everyone else would; what's you're point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My point is that if she were to find something she enjoys more than working, she'll spend less time trying to find us.\" Mr. H finished his explination as he captured the black queen with his bishop; thus also putting Joshua in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think that showing her the joys of eating baked goods is going to buy us enough time to get out before they find us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when you put it that way, it does sound like a pretty stupid idea,\" Mr. H laughed at his own joke again; though when he noticed how serious a look Joshua was giving him, he quickly composed himself. \"I agree that it isn't the most likely plan in the world to succeed, but it's the best I could come up with on such a short notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, an image of the individual in question appeared in the live feed of the front of the store; which procceded to open the door and cross into the store itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, it's not like she's going to discover it on her own, I'll be helping her out a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr.H took out a pin and flipped it off the table; within seconds, a cloud of dust errupted from the center, dipositing a young woman into the room right next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made her to look after my cofee shop whenever I had to go out; it's a shame I never had any customers to come see my work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl ran out of the room- or rather, through the room, and returned about a moment later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wants a dozen donuts, a box of sugar cookies, and a strawberry shortcake.\" The animation said with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr.H took out a few more pins, and flipped them in a similar fashion as before; each one turning into a part of Merril's order. The parcels were then stacked and picked up carefully by the artifical cler,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, Kasumi. Now go take the order to the customer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick nod, Kasumi left the room, phasing the packages through the wall with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You named it?\" Joshua said as he passed an aside glance to Mr.H<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey? what can I say, I'm an artist. I name everything I make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why do you even have pins that summon pastries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another idea for my shop. Though the higher ups ultimately told me that I couldn't use them. Another real shame; I really thought they could help stir up some interest for my shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua turned his attention back to the board- only to realize that Mr.H had already put him in checkmate without him realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's hope this plan of your's works.\" the ex-Composer said as he rearranged the pieces and they started another game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerril stepped out of the bakery with her cache of pastries piled high infront of her. It hadn't quite occured to her that she had bought so much; her mind must have blanked out in the store. No matter, Uzuki and Kariya should be back at the base within the hour, which would give her plenty of time for a snack. And atleast buying several things at once ment that she wouldn't have to keep making trips from the Shibuya River out towards town; so it was probably a good thing overall that she was too distracted by work to concentrate on what she was buying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minute walk, she returned to Dead God's Pad and placed the baked goods down next to where she usually sat. After taking a note of the time, she turned to face the three boxes in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" She said to herself as she carefully looked over each box with excited interest. \"What looks good?\"  </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After taking a moment to examine the selection of pastries infront of her, Merril removed the shortcake from the box and placed it infront of her. It certainly looked good to say the least; and since the Conductor had already enjoyed the bakery's confections in the past, she wasted no time in picking up the complementary plastic fork that came with the cake and tore off a sizeable chunk of the spongy, sugar drenched material. Once the prongs of the fork were completely engulfed by the mini-mountain of cake, she then proceded to shove the morsel into her mouth. Instantly, the Conductor felt an amazing sensation of pleasure drip down from her throat that soon went on to warm up her torso as she swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That is good...\" Merril hazily thought to herself as the euphoric feelings continued to course through her. Suddenly, a massive craving began clawing to the forefront of her mind. Her body needed more. More of that heavenly substance that carried with it such wonderful sensations. Immediately, her forkhand responded to the brain's command and began ripping chunk after increasingly larger chunk from the yellowish mound infront of her. Momentum rising with each bite, it became more and more common place for bits and pieces to miss their intended destination and wind up splattering sweetened goo onto the Conductor's normally prestine jacket. Merril paid no mind to these trivial inconviences however, as her brain had focused all of her motorskills and thoughts into achieving one goal: consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a dozen or so massive forkfulls of shortcake, Merril's fork suddenly crashed into the tasteless cardboard that had been holding the cake that had now been transported piece by piece into the Conductor's stiff middle. Ignoring the mild pain now prodding her from her stomach, Merril reached out with both arms; trying to find something else to fill her body's need for pleasure. Luckily for her, her hands came to rest upon the box containing the dozen donuts she had ordered. Like a starving animal, she aggressively pulled the box toward her and began pulling the sweet wheels from the box in groups of two and shoving them both into her mouth in one bite. This tactic slowed her pace down considerably; as she was now forced to chew for much longer than she had been with the shortcake. The upside to this however, was that she felt the distinct tastes of each item for a longer amount of time as well; making each bite all the more enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, just as the cake before it, the donuts were no match for the Conductor's voracious appitite. Once again Merril found herself scraping the bottom of the barrel to no avail. Angerly, she tossed the empty box aside; how dare it run empty on her! Frantically swinging her head back and forth, she managed to lay eyes on the final box of baked goods and made an attempt to grasp at it. unfortunately, her movement was impaired by her painfully swollen belly. Hastily, Merril reached down towards her jacket and unbuttoned it; hoping that allowing it to strench out unimpeded would ease the pain. Unable to wait for a noticeable difference, she made another lunge at the final box. Landing a lucky hit this time, she quickly dragged the cookies inwards; causing them to crash between her stomach and breasts. Within seconds, cookies began to be crushed into loosely formed balls as Merril became a little to eager to shove them down her throat. As a final bite passed her lips, she felt her eyelids grow heavy; and after managing to get in a minute of basking in the glow radiating from her body, collapsed in a heap on the sofa and fell asleep immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUzuki was almost dancing through the Trial of Sinners as she rushed onward to report to her superior officer. The promotion she had been gunning for ever since she had joined the Reapers was finally hers; and the best part of it was, she wouldn't have to share the position with that backstabing bitch Konishi. As soon as this little game of hide and seek with Mr.H and that kid who cheated was over, she would be running her first ever game as Game Master. The very thought made her juvinily giddy; as if a child had just opened up a playset with thousands upon thousands of toys just waiting to be taken out of their boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the best. day. eveeeer!\" The pink Reaper sung to herself as she continued to advance towards the Officer's secret hideout- which she was now a member of! The newly promoted officer giggled slightly at the realization; before slapping herself in the face in order to calm herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay: do not look unprofessional infront of the new boss,\" Uzuki made a mental note as she composed herself just outside of the retro base's door. \"Just go and report that the search is ready to begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one last deep breath, Uzuki pulled open the heavy steel door and proceeded into the strobe-lit room. To her surprise, she couldn't find the Conductor's pale face sticking out above the meeting tables, so she started poking around the area for any sight of her. As she neared the left hand sitting area, the pink Reaper noticed a strong smell of sugar in the air. Moving in for a closer look, she thought she saw a form huddled up under the Conductor's enormous jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Conductor...ma'am?\" Uzuki nervously mummbled as she streched out a finger and prodded it into the ebon trenchcoat; causing Merril to suddenly jolt upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, Uzuki...\" The Conductor said as she regained conciousness, remnant feelings of pleasure from the earlier feast forcing her to repress a smile. \"What is your report?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...\" Uzuki was suddenly taken back by the mess of sugar, chocolate, and god-knows what else coated the new Conductor's face and coat. Still, the need to cultivate a good image for her boss forced her to carry on past the notion to comment on the picture infront of her. \"All sixteen remaining field Reapers have been organized according to you're instruction and await your'e orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" Merril said as she too realized the mess she had made of herself and began patting her coat down and licking her face clean. \"Come, we will start the search immediately.\"</span></div></div>",
