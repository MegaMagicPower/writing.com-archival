            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just encroaching on 150 years in the state the Death found himself in. After the battle his thousand years of living had come to an end. It was a new thing for him to experience, so he wasn\u2019t really sure what to expect. He thought he would be free after 100 years, but alas he wasn\u2019t. He was too big, heavy, and sturdy to move. So the army that conquered Shadow Valley had left him there. To be fair, they didn\u2019t conquer them in the slaughter definition that is implied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were too few of the Forbidden tribe to protect Shadow Valley. Even for all their advancements and powers, another battle like that would genocide them. Even if they considered it, Death was no longer there to help. So, by order of King Butch, the Forbidden Tribe was no more. All research and samples of material that was too advanced for this age was destroyed. He had bred a kingly conscience, finally, and didn\u2019t want the Forbidden Tribe\u2019s power to be used by the thrones of men. Such a thing would only insight more war and more bloodshed. The only exceptions to this was the items made for immediate and personal use. Such as enchanted swords and armor. But anything that created them and any notes to duplicate the process were destroyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time that followed; items, people, and other attachments to the Forbidden Tribe were spread out. Some went to live among normal men from beggars, disguised as such while living a lavish life. All the way to Deities, Elementals and such were mostly in this particular group. Some went to the king and offered to serve as teachers. Such as an Archmage in their magic learning schools, or a trainer of their soldiers, and so on. As for the items that were spread out over that time, they were fought over if they were to roam among men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Death had turned into a statue of Sinc, it was literally impossible to wretch any of his items off of him. No one could move him and no one could do\u2026 well\u2026 anything to him. Unfortunately that also meant save him from his current state, for those that wanted to. So he stood there for all to see and a trophy of a battle, rather than the actual truth behind the matter. If any that gazed at him actually knew who he was and what he did, they might\u2019ve looked at him differently. It was then that the powers at be decided to banish this\u2026 statue of Death, so no more uprisings of super powered people would come to pass. The decision was made and their mages found a way to send him to another world, time, and place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is this so important?\u201d Asked a well-dressed and robed man. The robes were clearly marked with the mage\u2019s symbol on it. Guards known as Clerics were stationed around to keep them inline. To be honest, Mages were never let out of the schools that they taught. But this order was from the King\u2019s command so\u2026 certain allowances were given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOther than this thing giving off enough magical energy to destroy half our known land mass\u2026 because the King ordered us to do it.\u201d The other Mage said. He was wearing a better robe and as such probably had a better station within the Mages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose\u2026 Apologies Sir.\u201d Said the mage as he got back to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long will this thing take?\u201d Asked a cranky old man in full armor. He was the highest ranking Cleric there at the moment and was obviously not thrilled about watching a few dozen unshackled Mages wield magic in the open. Even if Clerics could resist magic, they couldn\u2019t negate it if these mages wanted to escape. But the bluff that he could was probably the only thing keeping the Mages there\u2026 that and the threat of being killed when recaptured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly a few more moments sir.\u201d The head mage stated as they finished incantations, circles, and other precautions. \u201cThis is a very complex piece of magic\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Yeah.\u201d The Cleric interrupted with a hateful glare. \u201cJust get it done and let us be on our way back to the tower, where you\u2026 People, belong.\u201d The word \u2018people\u2019 being strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a hurried few moments, they were all ready and chanting a combination of spells and using the prepared items. Slowly, the statue started to dim, as if the very fabric of time and space were being effected itself. Like a picture slowly getting out of focus was the image of the statue being sent away. The chanting continued as a dozen staffs shooting spells at the statue, as if shoving the statue into the next world. An apt description regarding what they were trying to do. The very sky was distorted as the magic coming from the Death Statue was being shoved into the next world with it. Like a funnel, the effects that had plagued the area were being drained away. With a final spell from all involved, the Statue was gone and the Magic ceased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, now let\u2019s get going.\u201d The Cleric demanded, perhaps too soon. He had to push his authority while the mages were obviously still tired out from the ordeal. If he was lucky, he would get them all back before any of them got any ideas to start trouble. But his mission was half over, so there was that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Death, he was watching the whole thing. Just because he was a statue now, didn\u2019t mean that he couldn\u2019t see what was going on. See, but not change it. However, that changed as he entered the new world. Like hitting reset on a computer, his statue form was beginning to break apart and he was becoming free. Unfortunately, his ability wasn\u2019t active while a statue. So he had no idea how to get back. But he had watched the mages and could possibly replicate the process, given enough time. For now he was being set free in a brand new world. Fully powered and ready to do something other than just stand around, like he had done for 150 years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where was he???<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn't have much control over that. He was at full power until he was fully free, at which point he could seal a high majority of his power. He waited, knowing full well that the darkening sky, the intense gravity, and the atmospheric effects of his power would attract people around him. Like he predicted, when he was all done and the last of the Sinc left his body, there was an explosion of power that shot up into the sky like a beam of black energy that only served to make mini earth quakes and make the sky even blacker than it already was. However, he quickly moved to remedy this. After the initial energy spike; he dematerialized his swords, transformed into is 'Kamper' form, and started otherwise sealing his power. In the course of a few minutes he was all sealed and exhausted. But even him being completely sealed and exhausted was still stronger than normal humans. So, with his training equipment on and his power more or less sealed, he started walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stop right there!\" Said a voice from behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course he had sense people coming, and knew he was there. But for appearances he did as he was told. But that was about all he could do at the moment. He was hoping to get to a hidden spot before taking a rest. Sealing his power was not something that was easy to do, or something that left him particularly energized. On top of that, he had used a considerable amount of energy in the battle before being turned into that statue. He was not going to stand much longer. So he slowly turned to get a glimpse of the person belonging to the voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was average height compared to Kamper and dressed in full ninja gear, hand in a pocket on his back with weapons in it. Kamper looked around to see the crater he had made when going to full power. It wasn't near as big as it normally was. But it was still a few hundred feet in diameter. This new comer had every right to be nervous about him. So, with that, Kamper dropped and was out. He figured, there was no use fighting this person, especially if he had decimated some of the forest in his home. So the easiest way to get to talk with whomever was in charge would be to be carried to a place that they perceived as safe, and right here wasn't it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is there when he wakes up?</span></div></div>",

He is established as the name \u201cDeath\u201d when he is normal and released, \u201cKamper\u201d when he is in his sealed form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper woke as he usually does. He didn\u2019t give any signs that he was awake. Not even his breathing was different then when someone is out. He simply observed his surroundings so he knew what he was waking into. This didn\u2019t take him long as nothing was overly complicated, to him. He was laying in what appeared to be a medical housing of some kind. He had his own room, but there were many rooms in the place and many sick and/or injured people there. From what he could tell, the people there constantly in battle. A high majority however were not injured in any other way but the physical. This was a bit of comfort. Physical injuries was not something new to him, nor were the remedies that were being used to save them. This would make his interacting with this world that much easier. He didn\u2019t want to be falling over sick every time someone did something in his direction. Just outside his room were some of the more healthy and physically fit people that were in the immediate area. He didn\u2019t have much time, as one of them, the female, came into the room. He thought about disappearing for a while. But there was no need. They didn\u2019t seem like they could do him any lasting damage. So he waited until she was in the room and looking over him before moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can stop faking now\u2026\u201d She said after a few moments of idleness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive\u2026.\u201d Kamper responded simply. Not that he thought the act was overly impressive, but the fact that someone as low leveled as her could see through it. With that he sat up and put his back against the headboard so he could more formally speak with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a highly trained Medical Ninja, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that I can tell if you are sleeping or not.\u201d She said back, slightly put off. Kamper could see that she had a short fuse a good part of the time. She stopped, as if giving him time to speak. When he didn\u2019t, she continued, \u201cDo you know where you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d was his simple answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, he knew his surroundings from his limited observation. Heck, he could tell when the nearest apple on a tree was ready and about to fall onto the ground. But he didn\u2019t know there terminology. Sure he could read their minds easy enough. But he knew very little on how insulting that would be, or if they could detect such a thing. So he figured that the answers would come soon enough and he could wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are in a leaf village hospital.\u201d She informed, taking a moment to gauge if he understood. But he looked concentrated but otherwise blank. She couldn\u2019t read him like most. She let a little time lapse for the usual, \u2018why am I here?\u2019 and \u2018what happened to me?\u2019 questions that usually came about from being told a person is in the hospital. But he said nothing and seemed content just sitting there, observing her. \u201cDo you know who you are, and what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Came another simple answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then you know more about you than we do. Feel like sharing?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Kamper stated back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that would be rude to not even give your name\u2026 then again, I haven\u2019t given mine either. So why don\u2019t we do this right, with introductions; I am Lady Tsunade, Fifth Hokage\u2026\u201d She replied then addressed more formally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKamper, Titan.\u201d Kamper replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTitan? Is that your last name or a rank of some kind?\u201d She asked. He didn\u2019t need to ask what \u2018Hokage\u2019 meant. From her emphasis on the word and demeanor, it was safe to assume that she was the leader of at least the village in which he currently resided in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRank.\u201d He answered, again more simply than she preferred. Most ninja were good at perceiving information from the most simple questions. But he was, to her slight annoyance, not giving her anything to perceive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind if I ask you some potentially personal questions?\u201d She asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, if you really do remember what happened, then can you please tell me what or who made that crater that you were found in?\u201d She asked, seemingly starting things off slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did.\u201d He replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did?! How did you manage that?\u201d She asked, slightly surprised but half expecting the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasily.\u201d Kamper answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I just need to know if that is going to happen here. So I need a little more information than a one word answer. I will not risk all the lives I am responsible for over your secrecy.\u201d She stated and asked at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to try and kill me?\u201d Kamper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, why would we do that?\u201d She asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you have no problem.\u201d Kamper responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, we\u2019ll get back to that later\u2026 When they brought you in here, no one could help you. We tried different medical things to help you, this is a hospital after all. But everything didn\u2019t work. No matter how powerful the jutsu or medicine, your body wouldn\u2019t allow us to work. We\u2019ve never seen something like that before. Can you explain?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a Titan. Wither you believe in such things is not my concern. What matters is that one doesn\u2019t reach that rank by being any form of weak.\u201d Kamper replied. Inside he smirked a little bit. If they were having a hard time penetrating your skin, body, and mind now. Just imagine what it would be like when he transforms\u2026 if he transforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about your clothes? We had to take them off in our attempt to treat you. We\u2019ve never seen anything like them. Our most advanced methods can\u2019t even scratch them\u2026?\u201d She asked, trying to get him to answer at least some of the questions in a way that made sense to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are made of Dragon\u2019s hide and lining. The likelihood of you being able to damage them is highly unlikely.\u201d Kamper said, not even caring that his armor was not with him. This also didn\u2019t make much sense to her. Why would he not be concerned about such prized armor being taken from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you feel like you want them back?\u201d She asked, trying to get some emotion out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. They will return to me when I need them.\u201d Kamper replied without a care about the subject. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The conversation was going nowhere as far as revealing information. So, Lady Tsunade did what most would do in their position. Since she couldn\u2019t determine if he was a security risk, she put him in jail as a security risk until proven otherwise. To be fair, leave a close to one mile crater when he arrived didn\u2019t do him any favors and made sense why they thought he was a security risk. So after being placed in a cell, he was taken from there to a room and put in a contraption that left only his head exposed. This was their \u2018intel  division\u2019 responsible for getting information out of people like him. However, unlike Kamper\u2019s way or reading and digging through minds, their way was less refined and rather harmful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaking entry.\u201d They all said as the ninja entered Kamper\u2019s mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper was only introduced to a man called \u2018Ibiki\u2019 and he was apparently their top information retrieval expert. He certainly looked the part. But Kamper wasn\u2019t worried. If other Titans and demons couldn\u2019t penetrate his mind, they sure would have a hard time. As they entered, rather than an open space to look through with a brain to enter, there was a vastly open space with a man standing in the center. They approached to address him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d They asked, both out of his mind and inside, asking themselves and the figure before them. Unknown to them, this was Death\u2019s released form, guarding his mind from intruders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy have you come here?\u201d came his voice as he opened the eye that wasn\u2019t covered with the eye patch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have come to find this mind\u2019s secrets.\u201d Said the one that seemed to be the one in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMortals are not welcome here.\u201d Death said to them, not flinching at the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t leave with nothing. If we can\u2019t see into his mind, will you answer questions for us?\u201d The lead ninja asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, however, be warned. Tread lightly, I do not suffer nor fear infants of arrogance and ignorance.\u201d Death said as a clear warning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d The ninja asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have 2 names. My real name is tied to this form. I am known as \u2018Death\u2019. The form you are currently holding in restraints is known as \u2018Kamper\u2019.\u201d Death answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Interesting\u2026 What purpose do you have here?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone. I was sent here from another world, one of which I am incapable of returning to. I have yet to establish any form of desire one way or another.\u201d Death replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said to the Hokage, that you are a Titan. What is that exactly?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Titan is a being that judges those who would proclaim themselves as \u2018gods\u2019. A Titan, in a sense, is the ultimate power of fear to those that wish to have others bow and worship them. As these \u2018gods\u2019 tend to be overly powerful, a Titan must be that much more powerful.\u201d Death replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how powerful are you? You don\u2019t seem like you know any jutsu, but the entrance you made makes us nervous.\u201d The ninja replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have much to learn.\u201d Death replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, answering like that only makes it harder on yourself. We just want security and you aren\u2019t helping.\u201d He responded back, slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am answering each of your questions with the bare truth. Most of my explanations wouldn\u2019t make sense to you. So I am simplistic, using terms you understand.\u201d Death answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, earlier you said \u2018mortals\u2019, does that mean you are\u2026 immortal?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Death answered. The three before him looked at each other in slight shock. \u201cI tire of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said he released a seemingly small amount of energy, expelling them from his mind. He opened his eye as Kamper, outside of his mind to address the room of shocked ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuestion me here or in my mind, there is little difference.\u201d Kamper said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to think that you are in control, you are mistaken. We WILL get the information we seek, with or without your help.\u201d Said the one called Ibiki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful sir, we haven\u2019t learned much but what we have learned is that he is immortal. I wouldn\u2019t underestimate him.\u201d Said the other ninja that was in your mind for a time. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All the jutsus had no effect on him, and those that looked like they worked, he did things that rendered them useless. Like putting him in an unconscious state, he just woke up when he felt like it. So they went elsewhere to discuss. Kamper could feel them and was able to eavesdrop from the vibrations they were making. He was still hesitant about reading their minds however. Eventually, they came back in with the Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, from what my people have told me, you have told them and done some interesting things\u2026 and we still can\u2019t make any sense of your equipment. Is it fair to assume that you are just toying with us?\u201d Lady Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be an apt conclusion. I have nowhere to go, so I\u2019ve been playing your little game.\u201d Kamper responded. Calling the torture, jailing, and questioning a game was not something that they were accustomed to. They obviously had a fairly high opinion of themselves and their abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGame? I wouldn\u2019t want to be in the shoes you have been in for the last few weeks.\u201d Tsunade replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me be clear then.\u201d Kamper said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper was still in a contraption that was basically encasing him in stone. No normal human would dream of breaking it. But Kamper just stood up, as if the steel and rock holding him were nothing but wet tissue paper. He walked out of the mess and stood before a very shocked group. He didn\u2019t even take any of his training equipment off, not that they could see them to take them off anyway. However, to the onlooker, he was wearing nothing but a pair of underwear. That didn\u2019t last long, as he held out his arms, as if someone was about to dress him. Then, his armor started to come back to him, as if the shadows themselves were bringing him his clothes and redressing him. The shadows went back into the corners after he was fully dressed and in his armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t want to be here and listen to you, I wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Kamper said with a slight glare, openly challenging them and materializing the Death sword on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-how did you do that?\u201d Tsunade exclaimed and asked as she and the others came out of the shock of seeing Kamper do what he did. They were now in ready stances, with weapons out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand the answer if I said it.\u201d Kamper replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Tsunade asked, starting to grasp how uncertainly immense Kamper\u2019s potential power and risk was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. As I have said, I just got here. So, not trying to kill me would be most kind of you.\u201d Kamper replied as calm as any of his other answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want nothing? No power, no money, no status\u2026?\u201d Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI find no value in such things. Not that there is anything in those options that you could give that would be enough to impress me. I suppose that a good standing relationship with you will be enough, if you must have something\u2026\u201d Kamper replied, the last part a little less formally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to\u2026 say\u2026\u201d Tsunade stated.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was clear at this point that they couldn\u2019t contain him in any way. Tsunade complimented him on his patience then asked where he would like to go. She offered a meal, but he just asked to be taken to the largest open space they had. They escorted him to a very large training field. A few more were following at this point. Mainly curious people and a few other high ranking ninja. A few of which were a white haired man that looked like a fool, but was about as powerful as Tsunade was. Kamper didn\u2019t take much time to relate to them, yet. He needed to establish himself first, and figure out a few things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we are here, now what?\u201d Tsunade asked after she presented the field to Kamper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay there, and don\u2019t move.\u201d Kamper instructed. Most were put off that he was ordering them around, but did as commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 That is strange\u2026.\u201d Kamper almost whispered as he walked a little bit into the field then tried to open up other portals. A few being the one to Canas, Donguy, and his realm to name a few. He was unsuccessful. He turned off his training equipment and tried again\u2026 nothing. It wasn\u2019t a lack of power, he was just too far out of tune with those worlds and realms. Must be a whole other reality. Kamper then had an idea. He put out his hand and attempted to open a summoning portal. He had felt a summoning contract with a few of the ninja that he had come in contact with. He was delighted to learn that it worked. A short time later there was an explosion and a whoosh of wings, clearing the smoke away to give sight to an enormous black dragon that he knew all too well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2026 this place smells wrong\u2026\u201d Said Nodrag as he sniffed and searched for the only person that the dragons had gave a summoning contract to, Kamper/Death. He looked at an on guard group of people before resting his eyes on Kamper. \u201cThere you are, young one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Master Nodrag, it is good to see you again.\u201d Kamper said with a smile, bowing respectfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has been some time since we last spoke, over 100 years by my count. We were beginning to think that something had happened to you.\u201d Nodrag said in his usual very deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be quicker to just show you.\u201d Kamper replied to which he came over and touched the large dragon\u2019s temple, inserting his experiences over the last 150 years. Nodrag shuddered with the information overflow. But as Kamper returned to a more speaking distance, Nodrag recovered and was able to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, that complicates things. I am afraid that you will have to do your own research in the matter of returning. Let me know what you find and I will attempt to send word to the friends you still have, that are alive.\u201d Nodrag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there a way that I can come back with you?\u201d Kamper asked, slightly hoping to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, Young One. The art of summoning in the matter necessary for bringing me here only works because this\u2026 reality\u2026 has the system to accommodate for summoning. However, since magic was used to send you there, you must find the answer through magic to send you back.\u201d Nodrag informed, causing Kamper to sigh slightly but not lose composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, understood Master.\u201d Kamper responded respectfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry young one. For what it is worth, you may call on me or any of my children at any time. I would expect that Duke would be wanting some time to catch up with you as well.\u201d Nodrag responded, more sympathetically that usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Master. I will definitely take you up on that.\u201d Kamper said with a bow. Then, with an explosion of smoke, he was gone. Kamper simply stood there for a little bit. He was content in waiting for the ninja to make contact, but he did instruct them to stay there and, to their credit, they had obeyed. So he walked over to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what was that?!\u201d Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA dragon, a friend from my home realm. He informed me that I am unable to be sent back and I can\u2019t go with him to return. So I guess I am stuck here.\u201d Kamper informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA\u2026A D-dragon?!\u201d Asked an older person that didn\u2019t look overly powerful. Kamper assumed that she was an elder of some kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Tsunade and I can summon our summoning animals. Giant toads and slugs are available, so why not Giant dragons\u2026\u201d Said the man with long white hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point.\u201d Tsunade stated then turned back to Kamper. \u201cWhat is your plan then?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith permission, I would like 2 things.\u201d Kamper stated, to which they started listening more intensely. \u201cFirst is admittance into the village as a member. Second is to have a property where I can create and operate a forge.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe already have many fine blacksmith shops.\u201d Said an older man, probably another elder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, I will make my specialized weapons and armor elsewhere, but a place of residence would be much appreciated.\u201d Kamper returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will need time to speak of this with our counsel and other leaders, will you come with us and wait?\u201d Tsunade asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish\u2026\u201d Kamper stated and was escorted on to a large, primarily red building.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If he goes to another village\u2026\u201d Jiraiya said as the council met and deliberated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he is not of this village, how can we make him part of it, just like that?\u201d asked one of the elders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to them, Kamper could hear all that was going on. They had him in an adjacent room so they could tell him their decision right away. However, a single closed door was not much of a deterrent when it came to listening in, not for him at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember him asking that he should be a leaf village ninja or anything like that. I seemed to recall him asking for residence inside the village and membership. We can gift him residence and have him as a long standing guest until we get to know him. Although not a man of many words, he seems sensible enough.\u201d Another white haired man named Kakashi Hatake answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he could just as easily destroy the village, judging on the crater he left just coming here!\u201d Cried one of the elders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the more reason to keep him close. If he is indeed a threat to deal with, then why send him away to hide? And if he is a potential ally, then why turn away such powerful help. Even if for some unlikely event, he is weak, he had that dragon to summon. You can\u2019t say that it would be a bad thing to have at least a dragon on our side\u2026\u201d Tsunade replied, with many nodding to her reasoning in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat of his claim to make weapons elsewhere?\u201d One of the Elders put forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we give him a large lot in the village to work out of, that doubles as his residence. That way he has to choose what is more important to him, his forge or his home and build accordingly.\u201d Jiraiya suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould he make weapons for the village, or against it?\u201d Asked another man by the name of Donzo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could always ASK HIM that question.\u201d Tsunade sarcastically suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine then, if we are in agreement of him staying in the leaf with the property he requested, we can tell him now.\u201d Jiraiya said and the others, some reluctantly nodded. Obviously there would be more talk later, as some of them liked to talk a lot about their opinions on the matter. A few ninja went out and retrieved him from his position, escorting him in the room. He stood at the spot instructed and waited as they looked at him. It was unclear if they just wanted to make him sweat or if they were just good at taking their time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKamper\u2026 do you have a last name?\u201d Asked Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Kamper replied simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, Kamper, we have agreed to gift you with an empty plot of land inside the village. You will be afforded to do as you wish in that plot, wither it be building a house or a forge, it is up to you. In addition, you will be granted a status as a long standing guest in the leaf. We simply need more time to see if you are compatible enough to be a leaf village member. As such, you are free to walk around, train as you like, and must obey our laws as a member of the villages so we can see how you would do in that roll.\u201d Lady Tsunade said. If Kamper was going to agree to this, then he would need to change to an attitude that gave the societal respect of their leadership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI accept, Lady Tsunade.\u201d Kamper said with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, before we escort you to your land, we would like to know something.\u201d And elder started to which Kamper looked her way. His concentrated gaze made her stumble a little and flinch, but she caught herself and continued, \u201cYou said that you would be making weapons and armor, what did you mean by that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am capable and have a knack for creating specialty items and high grade weapons. The higher end things are made for clients, and being that I am in the Leaf Village, then the clients would most likely be for the Leaf Village. For the other things, I make for my own amusement and to help others, mostly for no charge.\u201d Kamper responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, just to be clear, you would NOT be making weapons for our enemies?\u201d Lady Tsunade asked for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncorrect.\u201d Kamper stated, to which they started getting nervous and Kamper thought it best to establish his meaning before their imaginations could run wild. \u201cFor all lower grade items I make for local people, so unless you make a habit out of letting your \u2018enemies\u2019 stay in your village, then that won\u2019t be a problem. But for high end things, if someone were to come into the village, with or without your knowledge, convince me to make something for them, then turn out to be an enemy. In such a case, I would\u2019ve supplied my goods to an enemy. However, it is not my place to filter who comes and goes in the village. That being said, as long as a situation like that doesn\u2019t come to pass, I will not be supplying your enemies, and I certainly won\u2019t be seeking out your enemies to sell to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, that makes more sense.\u201d Master Jiraiya stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, we will have someone escort you to the plot we have set aside for you.\u201d Said an elder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother\u2026\u201d Master Jiraiya said, to which they all looked at him. \u201cI\u2019ll take him, better to get to know the new kid on the block anyway\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo, I know this is a little unorthodox, but I was wondering if you could do me a favor?\u201d Jiraiya asked as he walked with Kamper through the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as I eventually get to my new residence, then I will do what I can.\u201d Kamper answered without really asking what it was this strange white haired man wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent!!!\u201d He remarked as he changed directions and went to the same training area he had summoned Nodrag in. It was apparent that others new what he was going to do, as there was a few watching, more noticeable a young blonde haired boy that Kamper could feel was not what he appeared to be. \u201cI just want to test you a little bit, just to see if it would be right to request a mission or two out of you, if that is ok with you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Kamper said simply then straightened and got into a simple stance, facing Jiraiya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know how ninja spar?\u201d Jiraiya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Kamper stated. It was a moot point. Every sparing match where he grew up was a potentially fatal match. Not that he could die easily anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Jiraiya backed up and started the match by throwing some small knife like weapons known as Kunai at Kamper, who barely moved to dodge them. It made it look like Jiraiya had missed. Kamper didn\u2019t have to do much as he deflected or dodged pretty much anything thrown at him, all without moving more than 3 feet. At one point, Jiraiya used a high grade wind attack. Kamper just used his energy to spin the wind in the opposite direction, cancelling his move out. Through all that, Kamper had yet to take the offense. He seemed content just letting his opponent wear himself out. Finally, Jiraiya got serious and summoned a giant toad that was slightly smaller than Nodrag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this, Jiraiya. Calling me out here for this small one?\u201d The toad complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust attack and see how helpless he is.\u201d Jiraiya challenged. The toad did so with his great sword. Kamper could\u2019ve dodged easily. Such a large weapon was not hard to see coming. But he chose to catch the incoming blade instead, then proceeded to hold it there, not letting the toad retrieve his sword from his grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be possible!\u201d The toad said as he tried to squash Kamper flat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper replied by putting up his hand and using wind to blast him back a considerable distance, letting go of the sword as well. Trees and ground were thrown about as the behemoth of a toad skidded to a halt then came back over. They definitely didn\u2019t want to lose, so they continued. Each time, Kamper would send them flying without any noticeable effort. When it came for a large fire attack and what they said were \u2018wind bullets\u2019 Kamper just absorbed them\u2026 in a matter of speaking. When both of his opponents were tired out, they stopped the fight and the toad went elsewhere with a white puff of smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026\u201d started Jiraiya as he caught his breath, further marveling that Kamper wasn\u2019t. \u201c\u2026 that was crazy. For you to just stand there and take all that, my best shots, and not feel a thing. I believe that you are one good friend to have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour praise is appreciated.\u201d Kamper replied with a slight bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you want to get to the area you\u2019ll be staying then.\u201d Jiraiya stated. He waited for a response, but learned quickly that Kamper wasn\u2019t an overly large talker. So he led Kamper through the small crowd of surprised people and through the village, to a plot of land that was empty, save for a few scrap pieces of garbage lying around. \u201cWell, this is it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is perfect, thank you.\u201d Kamper replied then walked toward the center and started mapping out what he wanted and where. It was a slightly larger plot of land than a normal house, just big enough for a forge, if he wanted it. With a plan in motion, he went to work. The ninja had a habit on spying on people. So, even though Jiraiya had officially walked away, others were watching Kamper as he worked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The fact that he barely ate or slept was the only VISIBLE thing that caught the ninjas\u2019 eye. The young blonde kid would sneak around and spy on him as well, of course Kamper knew who was there and why. To the untrained eye, he was just steadily working. But if someone actually knew what he was doing, they would\u2019ve been amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each board he put down, ever stone he put in place, and every piece of steel he forged for the construction; all of it was infused with charms of every type of energy he knew. The three types being; magical, physical, and spiritual energy. When he appeared to be singing in a soothingly deep voice, he was actually casting spells and charms on things. Little by little his place was built. Each piece was so high quality that even he would have a hard time destroying it. Such a thing was needed, as any serious forging on an inferior surface would not be a good thing, or useful for that matter. If every time he put his hammer down it broke the anvil, then what use was it? Even the windows could handle an unbelievable amount of punishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the forge looked inconspicuous to the rest of the village. He didn\u2019t need people to start asking questions or for enemies of the village to target his building. However, it was self-cleaning and in addition to its strength, it also had panels on it that doubled as energy stores from the sun. This energy he could use for many things, but he soon learned that it was also called, \u2018electricity\u2019. Either way, the stores he had could light up the whole village for a year, when full. On the inside he had all the tools he needed to create any item he needed/wanted. From silk crafting items to a heavy forge, he was all set. He also put in a vault of sorts that held any and all completed works for display. People could look at them, but a barrier was around the room. No one could touch anything without his say so. Finally there was a small area connected to the vault for sleep. A simple bed was all that was there. In the fault he made a spot for his armor and weapons. He didn\u2019t need them on at the moment. He doubted that he would need them at all. So he put them on a display so others could see, but not touch. If he ever needed them, he merely needed. To summon them like before anyway. So he dressed in a simple black get up. Some dragon scale black pants and boots with a sleeveless shirt to match, made of the same thing. With that all done, he got to work experimenting with things of this \u2018realm\u2019 he found himself in. He exposed himself to a few new things, but most of it was the same as the earth he left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH!!! Came a noise one morning as someone stumbled in Kamper\u2019s shop. He looked at a sprawled out kid. The main door for the shop\u2019s use was in the vault room but also visible to the forge and finishing area, so no matter where he was inside, he could address any who entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 Sorry to intrude!!!\u201d yelled a kid before Kamper could say anything. It was the same blonde haired kid that was spying on him. But as soon as he looked up at Kamper\u2019s selection of items, he was memorized. There wasn\u2019t a lot, yet. But each piece was without compare, especially his released form\u2019s armor and weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d Kamper asked as he walked over to the Vault to address him. It was a common question to ask in shops, Kamper found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 uh\u2026 did you make all these?\u201d The kid asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Kamper responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey must be crazy expensive!\u201d The kid stated, apparently having an eye for weapons\u2026 then again, most ninja did. Ninja tools were always a source of knowledge for a ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are free.\u201d Kamper replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFree?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, if you can take them, you can have them.\u201d Kamper replied then watched as the kid browsed his selection. He was hesitant but then tried touching a Katana. When his skin made contact, flames shot out from it and sent him flying. He rebounded quite quickly and took a defensive stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that!?\u201d He exclaimed. \u201cI thought you said I could have one!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said that. I said, \u2018if you can take them, you can have them\u2019. My weapons are made and choose their own master. If any besides their master tries to use them\u2026 they retaliate, as you have experienced. In a way, they have a mind of their own. So, if it chooses a master, I have no right to keep the two from being with each other. Thus the free price. If you find a weapon that chooses you, then you can have it, free of charge. But don\u2019t assume that any of them will go with you just because you want them to.\u201d Kamper explained as the kid looked at the sword, just stopping its flame and was back the way it was before he tried to touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this one?\u201d He asked, pointing to a hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, before I answer too many questions, what is your name?\u201d Kamper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author\u2019s note: I may take from other sources to make it easier to understand. Such as, the hammer would be \u2018Thor\u2019s Hammer\u2019. I am not trying to bash or copy too much, it is just to make the understanding better. If you write, you may do the same. )<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, Naruto, that is \u2018Thor\u2019s Hammer\u2019. I don\u2019t really think it is your cup of tea. I think, now that I\u2019ve me you formally, you would find this useful.\u201d Kamper said as he pointed to, what looked like, a normal Leaf ninja headband. He looked at it then went to touch it. Instead of attacking him, it lunged forward and pretty much melted into his head, then came out, forcing his other one off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!...\u201d He started, catching his falling headband and pulling at his new one. \u201cWhat is this!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it appears that you don\u2019t have a connection to a particular type of weapon. Sure you use and don\u2019t use certain weapons, but you don\u2019t consider one YOU. So, this headband will disappear and reappear when you wish it, but otherwise be an indestructible part of you. NO ONE will ever be able to take it or damage it for that matter. Also, since it is bonded with you, you don\u2019t have to tie it on or worry about losing it, in battle or otherwise. It also gives you the ability to fortify and strengthen your mind as you see fit. Sure it will require you to train. But you will be a supreme power over your own mind, even more so than if someone were to do a Genjutsu or try to otherwise enter your mind.\u201d Kamper revealed. Kamper knew that this boy was more of a physical fighter with loads of potential, but there was some nasty non-physical ways to fight. This object helped with that. Sure not to a Titan level, but far superior to anything Kamper had witnessed in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean\u2026 I don\u2019t have to worry about Genjustu???\u201d He asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d Kamper responded which made Naruto\u2019s expression drop. \u201cHowever, with your new headband, it will help you train in that regard and guide you. Where an experienced ninja might have to train for decades to learn how to guard their mind, you will be able to do it in days, if you work hard on it. Afterwards, you will find that not many Genjutsu will work at all on you\u2026 and\u2026 that spirit inside you will be less likely to take over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!? How did you know about that!!!\u201d Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all have our abilities and special talents.\u201d Kamper answered simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean the nine-tails will be further sealed?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that is your wish. I will repeat. YOU will be in control of your mind. So, if you wish him to take over than he will. If you wish him to not interfere, he will not have a choice in the matter.\u201d Kamper responded, making Naruto thankful and confused. \u201cGo on now. I am sure you can figure your new toy out. I will be here if you have further questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026 wait, how do I train with this?\u201d Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you train your mind?\u201d Kamper asked as an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy meditating, of course.\u201d Naruto responded then Kamper turned to continue his work. \u201c\u2026 got it, ok, see you later and\u2026 Thanks a lot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Naruto bounded out of Kamper\u2019s forge. Kamper dwelled on the strange but uplifting boy for a while. Of all the people he had met so far, HE was the most uplifting. He had an\u2026 aura about him. Despite his extra passenger and the potential chaos of the beast within, he was still happy and uplifted everyone around him. Kamper decided that he would allow him to grow as he should, but help him when he could. With that decided, he went back to work. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As his skin and other parts of him cracked and went back to normal there were black clouds starting to form around him. He didn't have much control over that. He was at full power until he was fully free, at which point he could seal a high majority of his power. He waited, knowing full well that the darkening sky, the intense gravity, and the atmospheric effects of his power would attract people around him. Like he predicted, when he was all done and the last of the Sinc left his body, there was an explosion of power that shot up into the sky like a beam of black energy that only served to make mini earth quakes and make the sky even blacker than it already was. However, he quickly moved to remedy this. After the initial energy spike; he dematerialized his swords, transformed into is 'Kamper' form, and started otherwise sealing his power. In the course of a few minutes he was all sealed and exhausted. But even him being completely sealed and exhausted was still stronger than normal humans. So, with his training equipment on and his power more or less sealed, he started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was luck on his part that his entrance and awakening was not foreseen by whatever beings governing this world. Because by the time he could sense a gaze from a few more powerful individuals, he was long gone. His sealed form was good enough to fool even the Titans from where he was from, there was no way that anyone around here would be able to guess that he had such power. He walked for a while, until he found himself in a city of some kind. For the first time he was grateful of simplicity. From what he could tell, there was nothing that was new to hurt him. This... Realm... was just like his. No abnormal energy or material. In fact, his Realm was probably more diverse than this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt!\" Said a guard. Kamper looked him over quickly. Just like most of the 'warriors' around here, he wasn't in full armor, or metal armor. He had a large shield on his left arm, a short sword strapped to his waste, and a spear gracing his right arm. One that was now pointing at his head. Other than that though, he had a helmet, a cape of some kind, sandals, and piece that was little better than a loin cloth. Kamper stopped to be addressed by this 'guard'. \"What do you want here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shelter, sir.\" Kamper said with a bow. Once again, that simple act seemed to melt the hostility of those around him. An ego based pride was easily controlled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, watch your step. Cause any trouble and I'll run you through!\" He barked, then lowered his spear and let him pass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper walked around, getting strange looks from people every once in a while. It was probably the way he dressed. Most people were not wearing as much coverings as he was, and his was slightly different then the social norm. So, before he did too much else, he dematerialized his own armor and put on a black sleeveless type of shirt with his pair of dragon lining pants and boots, with a black cloak that he saw being sold at a few places. Finishing the ensemble was his Death Sword on his back and his training gloves on. He had too be careful though, while doing magic or anything out of the ordinary. The larger powers he felt were constantly looking in on people, and him by default. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do you for?\" Asked a merchant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am new around Greece in general. Who are the strongest warriors?\" He asked, which almost immediately caused the man and all those around him to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That!... That is the first time I have EVER heard that question!\" He laughed, but Kamper was patient and waited for the man to finish. Apparently the question was obvious. \"You must be from anther world to not know the answer to that. The Spartans are known to everyone! No one questions who the best is. Even people from across the see and in the heavens know that one. People say that they are decedents of Hercules himself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My thanks.\" Kamper responded then left before he caught any more attention. But the others were still laughing at him as he walked away. It must be extremely obvious that these 'Spartans' were the top of the warrior ladder around here, for them to just burst out laughing and not go into a game of 20 questions over him not knowing about them. Instead of asking another person, he gleaned the answer or where Sparta was from people around him, then headed there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While this new world was not without its hazards, the walk from where he was to Sparta was surprisingly eventless. There was the odd bandit and whatnot, but Kamper silently dealt with them easily. As he neared Sparta though, the bandits got progressively more skilled. In a way it made sense. For a bandit to be successful in this part of the country, they would have to be able to kill a Spartan, and everything that Kamper had heard was that Spartans were no ones to be taken lightly, even in single combat against a group. Eventually Kamper made it to Sparta and was scouting a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing for sale for you here.\" said a blacksmith as Kamper approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not wish for product, only information.\" Kamper replied with a bow. But he only received a backhanded blow from the man as his response. While he could've easily avoided or prevented such a low level blow, he did not wish to cause trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID... nothing for sale for you here!\" He almost growled out, then returned to his work. For people who had only achieved iron working skills, they had a very high opinion of themselves. Kamper had no choice but to pick himself up and go on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat attitude toward him as a non-Spartan stranger was normal. It seamed that the only people that weren't full blooded Spartans were a very select few of free men that were proving useful and a few slaves. But the high majority of people were fully battle trained to the Spartan standard. Even the elderly looked like they'd be a match for a normal person in the other militaries that Kamper had seen, like the guard he had first saw. Eventually Kamper only saw one course open to him. He had to talk with an authority in the city. Although other parts of the society was well guarded, meeting with its people was not one of them. Most could go anywhere as long as they didn't mind a sword in the gut if they found themselves in the wrong place. So Kamper wandered to what looked like a training area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the training area he found a group of Spartans fighting. But this level was borderline crazy. There was 5 men beating the crap out of the one in the middle, while that man was fighting almost successfully back. However, the guards and teachers around were not stopping the fight, more encouraging it. Kamper found this odd, but tolerable. If this was one of the ways they trained then that was something that he understood. He, after all, had a pretty crazy training sessions as well. So he leaned against one of the entrance pillars and watched them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stroking your pride with what a true warrior is capable?\" Asked a feminine voice from behind him. Kamper of course knew that she was coming. He turned to properly address her. She was a comparatively beautiful women that was obviously high up in their society. One thing that was easy to guess in this new world was the social order of people. Their upkeep and status all gave clues to those that could perceive them. This women looked close to a queen in upkeep, but too young. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are very impressive My Lady...\" Kamper said as he bowed to one knee. This seamed to please the young woman, but not impress her. She didn't look more than 17 years old, but also looked very put together and capable, as all Spartans did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they do. They are my father's personal guard.\" She stated with a certain amount of pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes you the King's daughter?\" Kamper asked in an embellished tone that got her to blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figure that one out yourself?\" She teased. She wasn't snobby or anything like that. It seamed like she was just judging him as someone that wasn't a Spartan. It was a sentiment that seemed to be a constant trend among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Kamper answered in a respectful tone, as if he was accepting his rank in life, to her eyes at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am new to Greece. I was hoping to find a place to settle and perhaps be useful. Someone said that Sparta was the place with the best warriors so I decided that the place I want to settle would be around Sparta, if that is possible.\" Kamper explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not for you or me to decide.\" she stated mater of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask whom I must talk to then?\" Kamper asked respectfully, still bowing in respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was obviously the King and both his mannerism, presence, and statue was that of someone that led the greatest warriors in the world. Kamper himself looked no more than 20 years old, when in actuality he had lived for more than 200 years with 1000 years of training. So looks weren't everything. However, for what this King was looking for, it looked like his daughter was introducing a very young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found him watching some of your guard practicing. Says he wants to live in or near Sparta, so I brought him to you.\" She responded. Her persona completely changed when talking to him. It was somewhere between bashful and proud of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did good. Now leave us.\" He stated to her in a gentler tone. When she had left he turned his attention to Kamper. So, you want to live in Sparta?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very much so, yes.\" Kamper responded with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you understand what that request is. We care not that you are useful or your desire. If we gave permission to everyone that wanted to join our population, then we would have a weak nation. You must prove you are worthy of this request.\" The King said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How may I do that?\" Kamper asked, still bowed to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could say more there was an impact on the side of his head. It came from a boot of the King, driving him to the ground. Again, Kamper could've avoided it but he didn't wish to make a seen that could be gawked at. He was also keeping a low key presence in the gaze of whatever powers that were currently looking down on him from above. Either way, more kicks and blows followed, but he got up each time and resumed the bowed position to one knee. Some of the times the King would have others do the blows, and at times it resounded with sickening impact that even got them to cringe. But regardless how much blood was flowing, Kamper still got up and got back into a one knee bowed position. This continued until the Spartans administering this.... test... were actually out of breath. At this point the King had them stop and address the battered Kamper as he still kneeled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not many could take that kind of beating. Why do you not fight back?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, more is said without retaliating.\" Kamper responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True enough...\" He said with some thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I can't allow for such a weak man to remain in Sparta. You must leave. However, I can have you taken to a mountain side that isn't owned by anyone. You may live there or find somewhere else in Greece to live. That will be the closest you will get to living in Sparta.\" The King said after some thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I understand.\" Kamper said, then was taken away rather forcefully. The Spartan Guards pushed, shoved, and kicked him out of the land by a large mountain range, like the King of Sparta had said. Some watched, but most laughed at this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he was left alone, after the Spartans escorting him got a few last blows in for good measure and a warning not to return to Sparta or to bother their King anymore. With that Kamper got up and made his way through the Mountains. He searched until he found the biggest one. It was obvious that this realm didn't have any Dwarves or such people that made their cities in the mountains or beneath the earth. So Kamper started working on the mountain side. Once again, Kamper couldn't demonstrate too much ability, as the powerful beings he was feeling were looking at him from time to time. So he staggered his working so not to be noticed. The first thing he did was make an entrance in the side of the mountain with HUGE double doors made of Granite and reinforced with thick steel beams. He would need to upgrade eventually, but for a time that had only just mastered bronze working, they would suffice. He also put enchantments on them, just in case. Basically he made the doors strong enough to keep out or welcome even Charity from home at her full size of 500 feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that he started work on the inside. He transformed the inside of the mountain into a castle of a fortress. It was a very elaborate Castle, but hidden in the mountain, but also scaled the same as the doors were. He made a master forge and craftsman shop under the castle where he could work on more powerful weapons without being spied on by the powers he was feeling. He didn't know what he would encounter, but keeping up his talent for making armor and weapons of the highest caliber was definitely a plus. Finally he put on the finishing touches. The entire place was overlaid with 10 feet of solid gold, and that was overlaid with a layer of diamond. He didn't need people damaging the gold floor or other surfaces, especially if he invited a dragon or something like that in there. Finally he put a few natural sources of light. He had to be careful because the nature of this place was to be strong and hidden enough to repel anything, sight or force. So he made a sort of entryway at the top where light was filtered in and sent down, as well as making a place for others to wet their curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was confident he had created a well enough home, he went to the throne room and started summoning everyone he had a summoning contract with.  One by one he would talk with them then tell them his situation. They would wish him luck and offer to spread the word that you were ok but out of touch for a while at least. They all offered to help if ever he needed it. The last one to contact was Duke, a Dragon friend that he had saved when he was just a little hatchling. Now he was rather large and intimidating to most, not to Kamper though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I thought you were living in poverty or hiding out.\" Duke responded as he walked around the Castle with Kamper. Like most dragons, he had a thing for treasure. So the gold floor, ceiling, walls had appealed to him greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This world is a pain, but there is a few advantages. These things were really easy to find. Plus there are no Dwarves to worry about so I got to build this mountain castle without worry.\" Kamper replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has to be a good addition. No Scepters either, that has to be nice. Oh, before I forget...\" Duke said then began hacking a great deal. After a few tries, out flew a familiar Bald Eagle from his jaws. It was Pride, Kamper's old messenger bird, given to him by the dragons and as immortal as Kamper was. \"Sorry about that. When we heard you were summoning us we had to get you something to remember us by. Pride has been ecstatic ever since you disappeared from your spot in Shadow Valley.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPride shook off the dragon drool then flew over to Kamper, perching on his shoulder very... prideful that he was now serving his master again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Kamper said as he stroked Pride a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how long are you going to be stuck here?\" Duke asked. It was a common question for those that he was meeting. Duke, despite his size, was the nearest to Kamper's age and one of his oldest friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I would assume until I can first replicate the spell used to send me here, that would probably spit me out into another realm. Then I would need to master it, then I will be able to come back at will. It may take a considerable amount of time.\" Kamper answered as he sent Pride off to explore the Castle. He would have to make a way for him to get out without letting anyone else in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not easy being you, is it?\" Duke asked with a sympathy glance then went to change the subject. \"So, how are the people of this world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same as ours, just a bit more primitive. There are some higher beings, but I have yet to communicate with them. The other humans have their own societies and whatnot. All impressive in their own way. But no diversity in species. Just humans, no Elves or Dwarves... or Dragons for that matter. I might find the rare one, but no large nests as best as I can tell.\" Kamper reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you ever need any of our help, you know we will do so.\" He said as you both made it back to the throne room. \"Take care of yourself Buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too.\" Kamper replied back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuke nodded then was sent back to his realm.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kamper was tempted to just stay in his new home. The large doors and the almost shrine like entrance were the only places on the outside that signified that he was there. In the decade since he started his work, people and... other beings had scouted out the two new landmarks, but other than that, he had remained excluded from the outside world's problems. He even spent a bit of time filling his armory with VERY advanced weapons and armor. But he could only stay in his very large castle so long. So, with that done, he decided to go out into the world. He exited and locked his castle. From the markings on the door, it looked like some very strong beings had tried to get in. They had to be in order to even scratch the door through the barriers he set up. He could feel a presence observe him exit his castle then keep their gaze as he moved away. He headed out of the mountain pass that his castle doors fed into. He saw Pride fly out of the \"window\". The \"window\" was just a shift in perception that only Pride could access. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't need to worry about Pride. He had already linked him to his energy and life, making Pride have a very small portion of Death/Kamper's power and abilities. Still didn't have a sapient mind, but had a version of it and more than capable of defending himself and many others if needed, even against something as deadly as a dragon... again, if necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper moved around the country, but didn't enter Sparta. He would obey the order of the Spartan King, as the Spartans were the only race, currently, that he favored. He kept going, observing quite a bit. He would come across the random bandit raid, or quarrel. He didn't interfere, but every once in a while he sensed one of the more powerful beings above interfere, a few still watching him closely. He went into cities and kept as low profile as possible. But this mode of investigation could only last for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away...!\" Croaked a very weak voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper was currently searching an area in which he had felt a different form of energy. Unlike the lighter version he had felt from above, this was dark and almost the opposite feel. As if he had moved into some other power's territory. He felt the hard presence of a battle and went to it. There he found a strange sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were burnt craters and impact marks everywhere and in the middle of one of them there was a very large woman. She must've been about 50 feet tall and glowing with gold looking armor on. She also had a bow and arrow with her, out of her hands now with a spent quiver on her back. She was on the ground and being stalked by a dark individual that looked like a demon. He had red eyes and the horns of a bull with a spaded tail, almost breathing fire. He was a few heads (their heads) taller than her and obviously going in for the kill. Kamper was just going to leave things where they lay, but a few things made him reconsider. One was that the light one looked good, and the other one just felt evil. Another reason was that he couldn't feel the gaze of the higher beings he was avoiding at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will take pride in skinning you!\" Snarled the demon, or whatever he was as he moved forward, still stalking the woman who was barely able to move back by crawling backwards. She was weak now and they both knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please leave.\" came a response as Kamper was noticed by both of them. He had sped over to a small rising of earth to the side of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? Run away, mortal!\" The woman exclaimed weakly. She was barely able to stay awake, much less escape. But she used some of her remaining strength to warn Kamper. That was earning her even more points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He obviously wants to bow to me, and see me skin a so called 'god'.\" The Demon blared with a wicked smile as he looked back over to her and pulled out a large knife. She was in no position to stop him and he approached her with the blade but then was thrown back as an invisible impact smacked into his head and flung him into a nearby mountain wall. \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked you to leave.\" Kamper repeated as he glared at him. \"I am not used to repeating myself to likes of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did that! Impossible!\" He blared as he got up and rushed forward. \"One of the other god's must be here! Show yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, run!\" The woman said again to Kamper, thinking the Demon was distracted. She was right to worry about a normal human's safety. Even if she was being rescued, a fight between another of her kind and this Demon would be dangerous for a lone human. She obviously didn't think Kamper was the cause of the attack either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears that I must be more clear.\" Kamper said. His small voice seamed to magically reach each one of them as if he was their size and talking right in front of them. They both looked at him. He lifted an arm and the Demon was lifted off his feet, being restrained by an invisible power, now obviously of Kamper's doing. The Demon tried to move but was unable to move even an inch in a way that Kamper wouldn't allow. Kamper floated to meet him face to face, within Kamper's arm reach. \"This is the third time I will ask, there will not be a fourth. PLEASE LEAVE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he lifted an arm and used a finger in a flicking motion to the large Demon's head which caused him to go flying into the distance and out of a normal sight line. Kamper could feel him land a few miles in the distance, then floated over to the large woman that now laid motionless on the ground, unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why must this always happen?\" Kamper asked himself as he tried to figure out what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand he could get her to his Castle. The powers he was avoiding wouldn't be able to see him teleport her there with him and she looked like she needed some medical attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, she looked to be one of these 'gods' that were spying on him and seemed to be capable of defending herself. Not to mention that the other 'gods' would be able to see past the barrier that the Demon had made and send help, if they hadn't done so already. Also, as a Titan in his world, his job was to 'test' any so called 'gods' and kill them if they stepped out of line. This wasn't his world, so he had no desire to impact this one by his rules, but there it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kamper didn't really have much to do other than explore, and he didn't want to start out a relationship with these 'gods' in a bad light. So, before anyone knew anything different he picked up her, her weapons, and what was left of her tattered battle attire, then teleported them all to his castle. He put her in a room that was accustomed to her size, filled it with things that she would look for right away; stuff like food, water, a white and gold silk robe. Then he went out to repair her armor and weapons. They were different and as such it took him a while to learn about them and whatnot, but they were nowhere near the quality that he was used to working with. So once he figured them out, they were easy to repair. She only started to wake as he placed her newly repaired bow and quiver full of new arrows on a rack beside her armor in the armory. He could feel her moving around and wonder at the castle. He didn't know what she was accustomed to, but waking in a strange new place after being attacked, all made of gold, was enough to make anyone curious. So Kamper waited in the relaxation area that was directly outside this area of personal rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" She asked as she came out of her room, wearing the robe Kamper had provided and... glowing a little. Kamper didn't notice this when he put the healing spell on her. It must have something to do with how or where she gets her power. Her question was more to herself then anyone, as she looked around curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in my home.\" Kamper responded, his low voice echoing through the halls of the room. After all, it was made for both 1 inch people and 500 foot people, so it was quite vast. She searched for the owner of the voice until she found him and approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who are you?\" She asked, apparently not ready to let her guard down, despite being unarmed at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Kamper. I believe you and your kind have been watching me for some time.\" Kamper revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you are the mortal that built his house behind those doors he... you made? and the shrine?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I am.\" Kamper responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is the place inside that mountain and behind those doors?\" She asked, gesturing to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of it, yes.\" Kamper responded. \"Now, a question I have for you. Who and what was that demon that was attacking you earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you don't know?\" She asked, almost astounded then a thought popped into her head. \"Do you even know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I do not.\" He revealed, this shocked her even more. It took a few minutes for her to collect herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am goddess Artemis.\" She revealed, her arm sweeping as if her name would reveal something to Kamper of great value. She was a little confused by his lack of awe at her presence. She then continued, \"The 'demon' as you called it was a high ranking titan soldier. Probably an assassin of some kind, sent to kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Titans, gods, and goddesses. This place just gets better and better. I have to assume that Titans are not the same as they are from where I am from?\" Kamper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they like where you come from?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They maintain order and make sure that normal humans and whatnot are not forced to do a 'god's' bidding by holding a 'divine' power over them. If their thirst for worship and power is too much, the Titan around... deals with them.\" Kamper answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, they are not at war with each other, the gods and titans from where you are from?\" She asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the Titans only number in the single digits, but they far outmatch the 'gods'.\" Kamper answered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"While all of this is very enlightening, what have you done with by belongings?\" Artemis asked, looking to be a bit more bold now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way.\" Kamper waved as he started to walk down the enormous halls to the armory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his comparatively smaller size, it took some time and Artemis constantly had to slow down or take shorter strides. But that wasn't as hard as it seemed, especially since she was looking around the gold castle Kamper had made. Every once in a while she would see a statue of some kind. Kamper had created some intricate sculptures of his friends and family, but made out of different precious stones and metals. They looked accurate, but not life like. Kind of like an overly embellished picture of someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You built all of this?\" Artemis asked. She had assumed that the room she woke up in and the larger community area she had found him in was the extent of the place, but she was dead wrong. While those two areas were impressive, she was marveling at the vast nature of the castle she was being led through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Came Kamper's simple answer. She continued to marvel as he brought her into the armory. She looked at weapons for miniature size people to those of giant sized people, leagues larger than herself. But Kamper finally brought her to a stand where a very familiar bow, armor, and arrows were being presented. \"Here are your belongings, repaired and restocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You handled MY bow?\" she asked in an almost wrathful tone that made her all the more angry that it wasn't effecting him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, unless you would've preferred it to be broken into pieces and left at the battle site then I would advise gratitude instead of wrath. I didn't have to rescue you, and I was certainly under no obligation to heal you, repair your low grade equipment, or teleport all of it and you here so you could recover in safety.\" Kamper stated, suddenly very serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Low grade???\" She stumbled, she was obviously not accustomed for someone Kamper's sized talking to her like that, nor thinking that her stuff was low grade. She then let her gaze travel to an item that had previously fascinated her. It looked like a strange light in the shape of a spear/sword/ pole hybrid figure. To be honest she thought it looked like a lightning bolt. \"What is that?\" She asked, still with a bit of arrogance in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A master lightning bolt. Haven't perfected it yet. The one who holds it would receive an extremely high authority over lighting and all that it is capable of, as well as becoming immune to lighting of lower proportions.\" Kamper responded as if he was unimpressed. \"It is just a first try at it though, I have yet to perfect that weapon yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" she answered waveringly, as if she was suddenly struck with a twinge of fear. Obviously she knew of another that could control lightning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her things then started to undress to put on her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will leave you to dress and retrieve your things.\" Kamper said then went out the door, but stopped without looking at the disrobing 'goddess' behind him. \"A word of warning though. Do not try to even tough the other things in this room. A high majority of them have minds of their own and loath disrespect, or being handled by anyone besides their chosen masters. You have been warned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kamper left and waited outside the door. He used his enhance perception to feel what she was doing. Just enough to ensure that she wasn't trying to take any of the things he was keeping in the armory, and thus harming herself. Most of the things could kill her if she decided to test his warning. She got curious and got close to touching a few of them, but in the end didn't. She used some kind of power to resize herself, once she had fully dressed and retrieve her things, then came out to join Kamper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word he started leading her through the immense halls and rooms. At one point she was at an area overlooking the main hall and throne rooms. She actually gasped at the sight. He led her up and to the shrine exit/entrance at the top. As she exited she seemed to already miss the golden halls in place of the still lovely but less glorious granite room of the shrine at the top of the enormous mountain that she now understood to be his home, and that it was a considerable amount larger on this inside than it appeared on the outside. A very thick and large door shut, closing them off from Kamper's castle once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrine was one that had Kamper's true form, Death, displayed as well as his close friends and family, as well as a written history of what and who he was in an ancient language of his world. That way, only those 'worthy' could understand how to call out to him if they wanted to meet with him. It acted like a beacon, so if someone was to know what to say and how to say it, he would be physically notified of the fact and be able to teleport back to meet the person. And, like the rest of his castle, it was sized to colossal proportions, and reinforced. Artemis looked around as she reached the entrance and wide open area to which she was visible to the world once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has been quite interesting, Mortal.\" She stated, going back to her true size and glowing all the more. Obviously, whatever gave her power was amplified in the wilderness and in the world. Kamper felt that it could be some kind of worship based power. So he held himself back from casting judgment on her. Again, it wasn't his world to judge. But he did want to put one thing straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't trying to impress. But there is one thing that you should know. You have been calling me 'Mortal' all this time. Yet you have yet to realize the truth.\" Kamper replied, to which he went to the edge of the mountain top, where the shrine dropped off into the depths below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that would be?\" She asked, in a superior tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not Mortal.\" Kamper replied them teleported away from both her and his castle, leaving a very shocked 'goddess'. She was equally shocked to is statement as she was to the fact that his move to teleport was beyond her ability to do or follow. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYes, one apple please.\u201d Kamper replied as he bought some food from a vender in one of the big cities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now felt like he was being watched like crazy. He knew that Artemis, where ever she is, was probably observing him and telling the others of what she saw. Kamper had to be extra careful. He had no intension of catching unwanted attention. He avoided fights when he could and when he did need to fight, like with a bandit or something, he made it a believable human level. He also had to keep reminding himself to do things that normal humans did. Like eating and sleeping. While he needed those things, he didn\u2019t need them nearly as much. He was after all human still, just immortal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should pay your respects!\u201d said a random man on the street as Kamper passed a temple. \u201cZeus is the ruler of us all, and maker of us all!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper only walked passed him and let the man preach to the others that were walking by. Strange enough for how ragged and smelly he was, he convinced over half the people that walked by to go in and worship this \u2018Zeus\u2019 and most of the other half had apparently done so earlier. People like him were all over the place. They were like god salesman, or something like that. Kamper found himself wanting to impale a few of them. But he never once bowed in worship of them. He was a Titan, in his realm at least. While it meant something completely different in this realm there was at least one thing that was the same. They nor he would bow in worship to any proclaimed \u2018god\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually went up to a high point of a random but very large city and just meditrained there. It was the only way for him to train without other people seeing, more specifically these \u2018gods\u2019 that everyone was talking about. Unlike them however, Kamper could feel them observing\u2026 as well as another equally powerful force that he assumed to be this realm\u2019s titans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA strange way you choose to spend your time, young one..?\u201d asked a seemingly old man as he approached, then sat next to Kamper on a large rock that acted as a bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper could tell right away that this old man was not who he appeared. There was a significant amount of power underneath the disguise of the old man face. Probably one of the gods or titans, disguised so they could walk among humans without drawing attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeditation and training is a choice of those who value such.\u201d Kamper answered. He wasn\u2019t about to explain the art of meditraining to these gods and titans. He had told himself that he had to put up with them, but he didn\u2019t have to aid them by any means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeditation\u2026? Shouldn\u2019t you be praying to the gods for enlightenment rather than relying on yourself?\u201d The old man asked in a slightly condescending tone, like an old man rebuking a young man, which is what it looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bow to no man. Wither he or she goes by the title god, human, titan, or whatever\u2026 I certainly pray to the Blessed One, but that is the only one that will receive my prayers, or deserves them.\u201d Kamper replied. He didn\u2019t know much about this realm. But the Blessed One was the god he worshipped in his realm. Creator of everything, and he had to believe that if he created everything, it included this realm. But that was his faith, not to be forced on others, no matter how much he knew it to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlessed One? What manner of god is he?\u201d the old man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Creator of everything. I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but you can worship your gods and I will worship mine. But I will not say that they are superior to the all powerful god that I believe in.\u201d Kamper replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you don\u2019t think the exist?\u201d The old man asked in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I know they do. For all the talk about these \u2018gods\u2019 not interfering in the lives or mortals, they show themselves by their actions all the time. I know they exist and are watching, when they feel like it. But I far from think that they will deserve worship, least of all from me.\u201d Kamper replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like the old man was going to blow a gasket. Obviously, whatever god underneath that disguise was not accustomed to such talk from an apparent human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou astound me, young man! To have such disrespect for those that gave you life!\u201d He bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t give me life, nor can they take it from me.\u201d Kamper stated, driving the mood of this guy even more sour. \u201cBut I tell you what. If they can correctly decipher this symbol, then they will have proven that they are at least competent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kamper drew a symbol on the ground. It was his family symbol, but they didn\u2019t know that. It was described on the shrine he had left for people wanting to contact him. So, if they were able to read the shrine and fine him, they would be able to know what they are dealing with, and back off. So telling this test to him wasn\u2019t a useless exercise. With little left to say, the old man stumbled off, very angry. Kamper followed him with his mind for a while until he used some kind of lightning bolt to ride off to the sky.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only things that he had yet to experience, which made him a bit sick from time to time cause of his ability, but also info about these \u2018gods\u2019 that he was being watched by. He guessed that the one he had talked to with the Old man was Zeus. Artemis was the only other one he had met and it now made sense why he felt her a lot more when he was in the forest between cities. But either way, he was on a road bordering Sparta, which he still didn\u2019t enter. He then heard a scream and a few cries of pain. He went over and saw a battle commencing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, form up!\u201d said a voice from the man looking to be the leader. There was only 10 of them, but they were Spartans. They were facing a multiple headed snake looking thing. Kamper wasn\u2019t sure what it was, but it looked advanced and not that easy to defeat for normal humans. Then again, these were Spartans, so maybe they could do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet him already!\u201d Shouted a voice that seamed familiar voice, but slightly different. He looked at the source and saw a woman that looked very familiar and he soon noticed that it was Alexa. Sure it had been 10 years, but she still looked pretty impressive, then again she was a Spartan, so it fit well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper leapt up into a tree and watched as the Spartans fought the creature. A few times they managed to cut off a head, only for the creature to grow two more in its place, a few spewing fire and a few other elements. Kamper once again marveled at the skill these Spartans possessed. They didn\u2019t lose a single man as they battled, but they were tiring against the might of this beast. Soon, they could do little more than block against the attacks this beast gave them. With a few more attacks, they were defeated and the beast turned its sights on Alexa, her men not dead but dispatched none the less around the battle field. The beast was now a 25 headed snake looking hybrid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will not find me easy prey!\u201d Alexa boomed as she picked up a sword from the ground. Kamper was impressed by her courage in face of an obviously more powerful enemy that meant to kill her, or possibly worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kamper dropped down behind her and stood with arms crossed behind her so that she didn\u2019t notice he was there, but the beast surely could. Kamper was glaring at the beast so intense that it shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, that\u2019s right, you know a Spartan is bad news for you don\u2019t you!?\u201d Alexa taunted, which put the beast over the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was previously deciding wither to heed its instinct and run away from Kamper, or attack. He had already defeated a bunch of Spartans already, so two more humans shouldn\u2019t be a problem, but Kamper was anything but ordinary, and he could feel it through Kamper\u2019s glare. With a hissing roar the beast spewed fire and ice at her while the other heads  came forward to press the attack. To her credit, Alexa didn\u2019t flinch, she stood her ground and readied herself for the attack that would undoubtedly leave her a frozen pile of ashes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Kamper walked past her. She looked surprisingly at him then almost tried to stop him, but by the time she started moving, he was too far away to do much but watch. As he came in contact with the fire and ice he absorbed it, causing a sort of vacuum effect. After which the other heads were still coming. He met the first one with a straight punch. On the outside it looked like he hit the thing and the body exploded. But in actuality he used a sonic strike. A type of attack that shot his energy into another object, person, or in in this case a beast; after his energy was inside, he could do anything he wanted with it, wither it be healing or reducing the organs and bones to mush, then releasing the excess energy\u2026 causing an explosion in a direction of his choosing. It was an enhanced ability that he developed and one that not many could follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW\u2026 who are you?\u201d Alexa asked as he started walking away. He turned so she could see his face, which actually got her to gasp in shock. \u201cThat is impossible. You look just the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper answered her million questions forming in her head by pointing to the ground and used a bit of fire to burn his sign into the ground then vanished from view, just as the other Spartans were getting onto their feet. Kamper knew that they all had seen him do what he did, along with the so called \u2018gods\u2019. So sooner or later they would come looking for him. His time of silently exploring was now over. From now on, he would have to be visible to the world as a higher form of power. So the question remained; who would be the first to swallow their pride or embellish their curiosity and come visit him at his shrine? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kamper knew that he would be unable to travel without being tested and such by the gods since his display in protection of Alexa. As it was he was tested on his way back to his castle. He easily defeated another large beast. So as soon as he got into his castle he took a much needed day off. Then he started improving his castle yet again. Nothing with any point. Just hobbies and whatnot. He liked the idea of something he had back home. In Canas, the sky changed to show the state of affairs in the world. So he did a similar effect in the observation/throne room. He made it so his increased perception could watch things from a considerable distance. After a few more things, he noticed some activity in the shrine at the top of his castle. Someone was trying to figure out his little puzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt obviously means something!\u201d Bellowed a very large man. Kamper assumed that it was one of the \u2018gods\u2019 as he was Artemis\u2019s size, perhaps a bit bigger and had the same type of glowing armor that she was wearing. That and Artemis was there as well, looking at the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it does as well. All I am saying is that this is a language that is unknown to us. However you will find something interesting.\u201d Said the large man that was talking to the one that looked to be in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Came the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile most of our efforts have been useless, there is something that works when we say certain words.\u201d Said the other man to which Artemis came over to observe, as did a few other \u2018gods\u2019 that were around. The man gestured to Kamper\u2019s symbol for them to pay attention. \u201cDeath.\u201d He spoke and as he did so, the symbol gave off a little bit of Kamper\u2019s Black energy. \u201cIt appears that once we get a word right, it shows on the corresponding symbol.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that is the symbol that Kamper said was his.\u201d Artemis replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen he must have another name. Not surprising, since we each have multiple names that we and mortals used for us. If he is as strong as we are thinking, then there is good reason to have multiple names.\u201d Said yet another large woman other than Artemis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we just force the door open?!\u201d Boomed a war like person that was obviously having trouble with patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can try if you want.\u201d Artemis said with a bored tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the one who suggested it charged at the door and swung a massive sword like weapon at it. The surroundings shuddered with the force he used. Kamper was slightly impressed at the amount of power he had. But the door stood firm, unscratched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! That is impossible!!!\u201d He bellowed and tried striking it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have all tried, and that door is yet to open. Even if it seems to be the weaker of the two doors, it still won\u2019t budge.\u201d Said the large man in control. \u201cNow, Ares, help us find an actual way in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything you can tell us about this inside?\u201d One of them asked Artemis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is either made with or overlaid with pure gold. I only saw a fraction of the place, and it is massive. Definitely bigger on the inside as it is on the outside. But most noticeable is his armory.\u201d Artemis responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Asked the man in charge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe fixed my bow and armor like nothing and I swear they work better then before. That and he called them of lower grade. He had some rather impressive weapons and armor in there. He even had a\u2026\u201d She started then stopped, looking at the man in charge nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZeus, he has, what he calls, a master lightning bolt. I have to say, it\u2026 well it looks more impressive than the ones you use.\u201d She said in tones that indicated she didn\u2019t wish to upset him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe does?!\u201d Zeus asked in a bit of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and he said it wasn\u2019t even done.\u201d She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the more reason for us to figure out how to get in.\u201d Zeus said, to which they all redoubled their efforts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Good thing too, because the language that Kamper/Death wrote them in was one of great power. But either way, they finally met to deliberate on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is all very disturbing. If this is right, the man inside is not of this world and has more than enough power to destroy not only us but this whole world, if he so wanted.\u201d Said one of them that was identified as Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d Said Zeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, he hasn\u2019t shown anything that says he wishes to use his power to rule or anything like that. He even saved my life.\u201d Artemis replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas anyone seen him leave?\u201d Asked Ares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he is most likely waiting for us to either call on him or move on.\u201d Hermes stated, as he was put in charge of watching the mountain for that express purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we aren\u2019t going to get any more answers out here. Let\u2019s go in.\u201d Zeus declared then led the way toward the door. \u201cWhen you knock on Death\u2019s door, Death knocks back.\u201d He recited as the password to open the door. Kamper had used that as more of a door bell. It couldn\u2019t allow passage to anyone, but it did allow him to know that whomever said it was ready to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Kamper opened the door. The group of \u2018gods\u2019 marveled at the sight as they came in. Kamper waited in the throne room, closing off any other passageways so they only had one place to go. He trusted that Artemis would lead them well enough. After all, if these so called \u2018gods\u2019 couldn\u2019t even remember the way in and out of a castle like his, then they were more hopeless then he thought. As he guessed, they were able to find their way. They entered the throne room and saw him sitting on his throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt certainly took you long enough.\u201d Kamper stated as they approached, some gripping their weapons and some looking upon him with an arrogant gaze. Only Artemis and Zeus were composed enough to not do either, Artemis because she knew he wouldn\u2019t attack and Zeus by wisdom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn impressive castle you have here\u2026\u201d Said Ares, clutching his spear as if itching for a fight. It seemed that he was holding back only for his respect for Zeus, or perhaps fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI worked hard on it.\u201d Kamper stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou built this all by yourself, in ten years?!\u201d Asked Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Kamper answered simply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is impossible. Whom else is here?\u201d Asked Ares, which seemed to be the opinion of the rest of them as well, with the acceptation of Artemis and perhaps Zeus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that it is any of your business\u2026\u201d came a voice as Charity came from a room adjacent to the throne room, and at full size. This made the whole room of \u2018gods\u2019 brandish weapons at her and was ready to attack or defend at a moment\u2019s notice. \u201c\u2026I am here, but I had nothing to do with helping him build this place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey gave her some distance as she walked over to a seat that materialized beside Kamper. The size difference between the two was enormous, with Charity 500 feet tall and Kamper at about 6 feet tall, but Charity still gave him a bow before sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Asked Zeus, as carefully as he was comfortable with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Charity. My Friend here says that he put a complete history that you must understand before you can come in here. So I assume that just my name will suffice.\u201d Charity answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are one of his fellow Titans?\u201d Asked Artemis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed I am. Now, he has asked me here so that size can no longer be an issue. As you can see, I am much larger than he. Be even in his sealed form, I would never dream of challenging him. So, be careful how you speak, I\u2019ve seen him kill for far less than a simple word and you being all \u2018gods\u2019 of this world\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t take much for him to slaughter you all.\u201d Charity replied and explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharity\u2026\u201d Kamper said in a warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?! I just wanted them to understand what their position is. If they were on our world, we\u2019d have killed them by now.\u201d Charity replied, to which Kamper just stared up at her until she looked back to the recomposing guests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it that you want here?\u201d Said Zeus, still keeping his eye on the overly large woman to Kamper\u2019s right. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From your story on the wall, you seem to have an interest in conflict, to a certain degree.\u201d Zeus added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s hardly fair,\u201d Charity started, to which they all looked up to her. \u201cHe helps people out of kindness, not because he likes fighting. While, I admit, he likes a challenge, he doesn\u2019t rule or exert his power over others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he is your leader, is he not?\u201d Athena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you, or did you not, read our history?\u201d Charity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Another stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see the Titan Tablet?\u201d Charity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, with Death\u2019s symbol at the top.\u201d Athena responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you failed to bring the two together.\u201d Charity responded as she nursed what appeared to be the starting of a headache. \u201cYou mortals are so frustrating to bring up to speed. Especially the ones that see themselves as gods. Now I understand why we kill gods in our realm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are not mortal!\u201d Ares blared out, apparently offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you die?\u201d Charity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can live forever\u2026!\u201d Ares responded, being too heated for a simple glance from Zeus to bring his emotions down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the question. The question was\u2026 CAN YOU DIE?\u201d She asked, raising her voice a little but calming with one look from Kamper, who was letting them duel it out at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we can.\u201d Zeus responded before Ares could, to which Ares looked at him and Zeus glared at him, backing him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo can I. But it takes more to kill me than it does to kill you. So, in my eyes, you all are the mortals here. Not to mention my friend here.\u201d Charity said, then gestured to Kamper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Artemis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple. He is incapable of dying\u2026 or more accurately, staying dead.\u201d Charity stated. \u201cTrust me, for his Titan challenge, all of the rest of the Titans, including ones that are leagues more powerful than I, tried to kill him. He not only defeated us, but an enemy that we were powerless against. To him, we ALL are mortals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t want to rule us?\u201d Zeus asked Kamper directly, to which he just received a nod. \u201cWhat is it that you want then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeace and Freedom.\u201d Kamper said in a simple response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat he means by that is\u2026\u201d Charity started as she saw their confused faces. \u201cThat he wants to avoid conflict as much as he can. But if he decides he wants to do something, then he doesn\u2019t want to jump through your rules to do it. You let him do what he wants, when he wants, and require nothing from him. It would also help that you give him some respect. He generally gets what he goes after.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Someone over 3 times her size would have that effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe can, he just prefers to act rather than talk. Would you rather him beat the stuffing out of you to make his point?\u201d She asked rhetorically, then continued\u2026 \u201c\u2026 Anyway\u2026 what he wants is for him to not be pursued for one reason or another. While he prefers not to fight, he also enjoys stretching his muscles\u2026 which might be at the expense of any who are stupid enough to attack him. But there is one thing he tends to go overboard in\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d Zeus asked, obviously wondering what could make a force like Kamper/Death to react in a way that could threaten him or his fellow \u2018gods\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if someone or something were to threaten something he values\u2026 he\u2026 well no one has been able to threaten or bribe him before\u2026 and live to tell about it.\u201d Charity answered, earning a few gulps from those around in the \u2018god\u2019 crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you side with this realm\u2019s Titans?\u201d Zeus asked, almost nervously at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf they had a good reason.\u201d Kamper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood reason?\u201d Zeus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike a heavily injured young lady that is begging for mercy\u2026 I would help them. Like Artemis was.\u201d Kamper responded, which cause a few looks and a blush from Artemis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if they are not noble and we are then\u2026\u201d Athena started to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you not hear him?\u201d Charity asked with annoyance. \u201cHe will do what he wishes, which is on the side of the morally good. Regardless who is doing the evil, he will probably fight them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, that makes sense.\u201d Zeus said, hoping the look of their group to improve in Kamper/Death\u2019s eyes. \u201cMy I ask for a favor?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak.\u201d Kamper agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you show us your Death form, so we know who you are?\u201d Zeus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room became insanely heavy and they all dropped to their knees, some to the floor with the amount of power Kamper was expelling. It seemed that they were now regretting their request. Charity was looking down with favor and amusement. Kamper slowly began to change, to the astonished gaze of the \u2018gods\u2019. It was as if the shadows in the room was eating at Kamper\u2019s form until a 10 foot frame of Death was gazing at them idly. Static discharges the size of lightning bolts, black flames eating parts of the floor, and water in dishes were being carried through the room. Showing that he had power over every element they knew and didn\u2019t know about. When he saw that they were about to pass out, he dialed it down and sat on the throne with the room back to normal, as Kamper, as if nothing was happening or happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was his full power, your full power???\u201d Zeus asked with disbelief, that only got Charity to start laughing. \u201cWhat???\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 that was his minimal power in his released form. By the looks of things, you mortals wouldn\u2019t be able to survive if he went any higher.\u201d She stated to their disbelief. \u201cAgain, I\u2019ve seen him at full power\u2026 believe me when I say, never wish for that. I\u2019ve never been so scared in all my life. For your sakes, I think he will probably remain in his sealed form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will?\u201d Zeus asked, or more like begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will do as I must.\u201d Kamper responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, especially in the aftermath of what they just saw, they took every word as very vital. Perhaps seeing just the sight of Death to be more than enough to illustrate that they were not to piss off this Titan. A new found respect had even the warring Ares a very hesitant man. Mere men is what they were compared to him, perhaps lower. It was very unlikely that they would move to anger this new addition to their realm. And they prayed\u2026 to whom they didn\u2019t know, that he didn\u2019t choose the side of their realm\u2019s titans against them. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGood. Thank you, Charity.\u201d Kamper said as they agreed and were inlightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny time\u2026\u201d She said, then walked into the room behind the throne, where Kamper had put a portal system for his friends to visit. Sadly, he couldn\u2019t use it to get home, but they could come visit for very short periods of time. Soon the thunderous booms of her footfalls had disappeared and Kamper got up, earning a bow or two from the observing gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome with me, please.\u201d Kamper requested then led the group out into the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wound down the vast hallways with them following, talking and discussing different aspects of what just happened. It wasn\u2019t until about 15 minutes of walking that the issue of where they were going came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArtemis, where is he taking us?\u201d Zeus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could be mistaken, but he could be taking us to his Armory. It is this way, or I\u2019m pretty sure it was in this direction\u2026\u201d Artemis answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right. Kamper led them into the armory and they gawked at many of the weapons in the room. None were anything less than master pieces. Despite their gawking, they followed Kamper until he led them to a row of weapons that had some of their names next to the weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my gift to you all, for being civil. I have upgraded your\u2026 inferior weapons.\u201d Kamper stated as he gestured to the weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus was first in stepping forward toward the case with his name and presumed weapon in it. A finished Master Lightning bolt sat in the case, sparking and whirring in potentially violent patterns. He hesitated then reached out and grabbed the bolt. There was an immediate power surge through him and lighting began flowing around the room, then it seemed to seep into his body and the bolt that he now held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo much power\u2026!\u201d Zeus stated, this got the other gods to grab their own assigned weapons. Each of them had a like experience when they grabbed hold of their weapons. Poseidon had a surge of water that almost collided with Zeus\u2019 lighting, but they were able to control their weapons good enough. \u201cYou are just giving us this much power?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand your rolls good enough. I will trust that you will not abuse the power I\u2019ve given you\u2026 and realize that I command a stronger power than the ones I\u2019ve given to you all. Do not test me in the future and be worthy of the power I\u2019ve given you. If I find that giving you power was a mistake, I WILL take it away.\u201d Kamper responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what do we do with our old weapons?\u201d Athena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you want. Maybe put them in the reach of men so they can do quests for them. Either way, the weapons I\u2019ve given to you is over 10 \u2013 100 times the power of the ones you used to have. But it is up to you.\u201d Kamper responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to give weapon upgrades to our realm\u2019s Titans as well?\u201d Zeus asked, then the others turned to see what Kamper\u2019s answer was. They had forgot that he could just as easily give them equally superior weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps\u2026 If the prove themselves worthy. Thus far, they have far from impressed me.\u201d<br>\r\n Kamper responded. They all seemed to be glad of that and would go off and decide what they should do with this new found power they had received\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kamper was slightly surprised when the \u2018gods\u2019 didn\u2019t misuse their power. He saw a generous amount of testing of their new found abilities, but they didn\u2019t go on a Titan killing spree, or force their will on the kingdoms of men. They did, however, answer the prayers that they were given on occasion. When people paid homage to Zeus, for example, he helped them in ways that included sending a lightning bolt down to defeat an enemy that was rather vile. But they were always weary of Kamper, as he started to walk among men again. They rarely used their power in a manner that could be looked at as arrogant or \u2018godlike\u2019. The only exception to this was when a titan picked a fight with them. They would soundly defeat the offending titan, but not by any means go looking for Titans to kill. They also stopped testing Kamper with mythical beasts from their domains. They also seemed to understand, that if Kamper wanted to interfere with Man, then he could. They would not move to stop him, even if they wanted to, which they didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out!\u201d Hollered a priest as he instructed the guards of temple area to throw Kamper out of it. He had been just passing by, taking a moment to evaluate the statue that the other humans were worshiping. It was a 200 foot tall version of Zeus, overlaid with gold and holding a large lightning bolt in his hand. When he was approached and ordered to kneel to the figure for worship, he refused. To which they promptly threw him out of the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Said a beggar looking old man that Kamper had landed next to as the priest and guards made their way back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was not your doing.\u201d Kamper responded as he got up and sat on a ledge facing the temple, to which the old man bowed to him then took a seat next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it was my followers, at my temple.\u201d The old man, said. The statement alone would be enough for a normal man to deduce that he was Zeus, apologizing for being any part of an attack on Kamper. Of course, Kamper already knew that and who he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut not you. They are merely doing what they\u2019ve been raised to do. I can\u2019t fault them for it, or you.\u201d Kamper responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour mercy knows no bounds. If you were a lesser person, you could very easily punish them for their insolence, and me for not teaching them as they should.\u201d Zeus complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is not mercy. Your affairs and that of this world are for you and the governing powers to decide on. I am merely passing through. I care not for a few misguided fools or their actions.\u201d Kamper responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, if I may ask, why haven\u2019t you entered Sparta? They would definitely have less \u2018fools\u2019 there to bother you. It would no doubt be a more pleasant place to live for one such as you.\u201d Zeus inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is simple. I gave Sparta my word that I would not enter it. So, I won\u2019t.\u201d Kamper responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Zeus answered. Kamper could tell that Zeus didn\u2019t really get it. As a \u2018god\u2019, he enjoyed the freedom of going anywhere he pleased. \u201cYou know\u2026? Ares could send them to your home\u2026 Sparta worships him as the \u2018god of war\u2019. If he were to drop a few hints as signs from above, they could be enticed to seek you out\u2026?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo as you wish.\u201d Kamper responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you wish for anything?\u201d Zeus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at the moment.\u201d Kamper responded simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Pride is a formidable companion\u2026!\u201d Zeus complimented as he spotted Pride in the air above city, also hoping to change to a different topic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. Is he causing problems?\u201d Kamper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, not at all. He often flies around Mount Olympus and perches in some of the best places this world has to offer. We are glad to have him around. Although, he did get attacked by a titan a few weeks ago\u2026\u201d Zeus responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot the most wise move\u2026\u201d Kamper replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all. The offending titan didn\u2019t last long enough for any one of us gods to render aid.\u201d Zeus agreed.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Years pass, and many that remembered when Kamper\u2019s Castle wasn\u2019t there were long dead. Even the Sparta Princess that he had once saved was now long dead and buried, although the story of Kamper was passed on. Little by little, and age by age, people started making pilgrimages to the great golden doors of Kamper\u2019s Castle, as well as the shrine at the top of the mountain. A narrow staircase had been erected for the less sturdy to ascend the mountain. Although the trip was still a day or so journey to the top, and more than a few had fallen off the narrow stairs to the top, falling to their death. Kamper people generally walked amoung the realms of men, except Sparta, and observe them. After that he would go to his castle and continue training, make more additions to his castle or its features, or just observe those trying to unravel the secrets of his shrine. The only time he interfered in this was when a few of them had made an alter to him, which he soundly destroyed and boomed out his displeasure at being worshiped. Although, after that display, it only escalated the worship in the cities. Some of the age\u2019s scholars would get as far as his name, watching how his symbol glowed as they said it, but that was about it as far as people getting into his castle. Eventually, he got sick of it and decided to go to the main temple they made for him, which was rich with many treasures and inaccurate descriptions, and set them straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived in his sealed form, looking up to the replicas of his golden doors to his castle. They hadn\u2019t spared any expense in recreating them\u2026 minus Kamper\u2019s enchantments and reinforcements of course. They were currently open and people were flooding in and out of the massive doors. Kamper was silently glad he hadn\u2019t opened his doors to this extent, he could only imagine how many people would flood the place if he did so. He walked passed a 200 foot statue that was their best replica of his image that was found on the walls of his shrine. He had to admit, it wasn\u2019t horrible. The grand hall, right after the doors, was as huge as the doors were, but etched and painted with an exact replica of his shrine, again without the enchantments and fortifications. However, unlike his shrine, there were venders of different kinds on both sides of the main walkway. Most of them trying to pawn off of his name to sell things. \u2018Death\u2019s chosen knife blades\u2019, \u2018Cloaks worth of Death\u2019, and so on. At the back was another door that was currently open, where the door to your Castle would be up at the shrine, but this one was smaller and open. He took a step inside and it seemed like he was stepping into an altered slaughter house. There was a very large alter at the back, with different stations beforehand that dealt with preparing both the people and the animals for worship. There were sections were people would cut themselves, other stations where they could wash themselves and their sacrifices. Even a chart where they could see what their sacrifice level would please \u2018Death\u2019 or so the Chart said. He looked at it and the dozens of stations and was angered by what he saw. At the bottom were the standard things of sacrifice; sheep, cows, pigs, birds, and that sort of thing. But it got progressively worse, at the top, even after mythical beings and animals, were the worshiper\u2019s first born. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome, pilgrim, what has brought you to the temple of the most powerful god of all Greece?\u201d One of the Priest asked Kamper as he made his rounds. He seemed approachable, but also slightly arrogant and vain. Thinking that he was part of some elite club. But his comment only infuriated him more. Kamper was and is a Titan that punished would be gods. He NEVER wanted to be perceived as one. How these people had got him so messed up was beyond him, but he couldn\u2019t lose his temper\u2026 yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about him?\u201d Kamper asked, hiding his distain well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, a new worshiper!\u201d He exclaimed, which got a round of clapping before they all went about their business. \u201cDeath is the most powerful of all the gods. After all, even the mighty Zeus fears dying. It is for that reason we worship him. In doing so, we can earn his favor and not only extend our own lives, but shorten those of our enemies.\u201d He started. He then went on preaching to Kamper about what was ensured and required for \u2018Death\u2019s favor\u2019, as usual, sacrifices of blood was the highest sacrifice in each category, but they also could be appeased with mass amounts of gold or land. This temple, being the starting point, was the biggest and most accurate replica of Kamper\u2019s own shrine. \u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think\u2026\u201d Kamper started, looking around then back at the priest, very angry\u2026especially about the infant sacrifices that he had just heard about. \u201c\u2026 it is revolting! GET OUT!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last part was in a very loud and ominous voice that also had its own power. It lifted everyone and every living thing, except the now entering Pride and the priests, out the doors , then sealed them shut. Before anyone, including the priest that was talking to him, could get a good look at him, he changed to his released form, Death. With a flick of the wrist he sent all the priests to one side of the room and another rendered all the instruments in the room and gathered gold to ash. The priests were in horrified shock by this, but then looked to see Pride landing on a statue of Death, right above them. Unlike Kamper or Death, Pride was seen all too often and was well known to be Death\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever, in all my years have I ever been so insulted.\u201d Death said in his low and ominous voice, static discharges and flames erupting around the room at his mere presence. \u201cWHERE do you get the idea that I am a god or need, much less want, sacrifices\u2026 EXPECIALLY CHILDREN!!!?!???\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy\u2026\u201d Started whom appeared to be the high priest. He had cuts up and down his arms and face, probably in other parts of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSILENCE!\u201d Boomed Death as he, with no movement, rose the high priest off his knee and feet so he was floating above the rest of them. \u201cI have written carefully worded history and instructions in the shrine at the top of my mountain, so this sort of thing does NOT happen. You get a few words right and you assume you know enough to start a temple in my name. If you had actually bothered learning what I actually wrote, you would know that this whole thing\u2026\u201d Kamper continued as he ripped off the huge tablet off the wall and hovered it so they could see it, then slowly began turning it to ash as he had with the gold in the room \u201c\u2026 is unbelievably revolting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, even people outside could tell that something was up, as they could sometimes hear him, the pressure around them was increasing, and black clouds began to form above the temple and spreading over the city. They could easily see, that Death was NOT happy. Some began running, thinking that the temple and all those around it would experience Death\u2019s wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me make this, absolutely clear. I am not a god, I do not wish to be worshipped, I am disgusted at the thought of any sacrifice of life on my account, If you wish to continue then you must finish reading my shrine, and\u2026\u201d Death listed off then raised them all above the ground, making them listen intently to what he had to say. \u201c\u2026 if I ever see you all take innocent life on my account again, I will destroy you all in the longest and most painful way possible. Is that understood???\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy\u2026\u201d Started the high priest said again, before he was cut off by another increase of Death\u2019s power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI care not for your excessive brown nosing. A simple yes or no will suffice. Do you understand???\u201d Death explained and repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes!\u201d They all said at once. At that moment, he turned into the shadow of the room and most of his powers left the area, doors opening as well. Death disappeared from their view and Pride flew out the open doors and, to the crowd\u2019s amazement, flew majestically into the distance, amidst the dispersing black clouds, producing some effects of his own. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Making him into a god and doing such horrid things in his name\u2026 But he noticed that a new wave of worship followed in his wake, after he had appeared before them and corrected them. They hadn\u2019t stopped worshipping him, but they had stopped the sacrificing of life. That, and they started to work hard in translating the walls of his shrine. Many made pilgrimages to his shrine to make sure the temples were accurate and sometimes to test words to the symbols on the wall. He was not known as a god anymore, but a Titan. Regardless of the accuracy of the statement, he wasn\u2019t thrilled that it made him more of a villain than anything. After all, Titans in this realm were, at best, troublemakers. Every once in a while, a god would walk with him, as he wondered the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you insist on walking among men? You are only going to see first hand how crude and simple they are. What you saw in your temple\u2026 that is the sort of thing they escalate to every few decades.\u201d Artemis asked, not understanding why Zeus\u2019 offer to house him at Mount Olympus didn\u2019t interest him. After all, one could potentially see all of the world in any detail one wished from up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do not wish to be some all powerful deity that judges from on high. I want to be among the people, and actually living in the world. Sure, some of them\u2026 most of them are not any sort of equal to me. But there is one group of people that are always better than I am, or you for that matter.\u201d Kamper said as he walked. Artemis was hidden as well in a common but still a little more high profile commoner getup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what group would that be?\u201d Artemis asked, wondering what being she had been blind to that could best Kamper/Death\u2026 and the gods\u2026 with their new weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThem\u2026\u201d Kamper responded as he pointed to some innocent children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMortal children???\u201d She asked, unbelieving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. Name one being in creation that is as pure, trusting, loving, energetic, and a host of other POSTIVE characters that is higher than a child. I dare say, you will find it a fruitless pursuit to find such a creature.\u201d Kamper explained. \u201cFor this reason, I do not give up on man. There is the rare adult person that is pleasant to be around. I get to live among them and experience, possibly even help them when I can get away with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat must be nice, being able to look at them like that. While we just rule over them from Olympus\u2026\u201d She accepted, but was still having a hard time believing. After all, the common perception of power was that the one that had the most of it was the one that was better than everyone else. But she at least knew how Kamper/Death viewed things a little better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss\u2026 Here you go! You are really pretty!\u201d said a young girl that had picked a flower and given it to Artemis. Rather than explain it, Kamper just let her experience it. There was no way the little one knew who she was. It was an innocent gesture to her, regardless who she was, just because\u2026 Artemis was unable to voice words but smiled to the little one before she went off playing with the other kids again. Kamper watched as he saw her treasure the small flower. The flower was nothing special, hundreds of thousands of them grew and were cut down in the fields around them all the time. But she looked to treasure this one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to go!\u201d She suddenly said and disappeared when she was certain that none of the people around were looking. Even if they were currently allowed to effect the world of men, the gods were beginning to limit that interaction, per Zeus\u2019s orders. Kamper suspected that Artemis\u2019s sudden exit was probably because a mortal had affected her in a way that she would want to be more open. Kamper also suspected that she would use her powers as a god to reward the young girl, and maybe watch over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kamper had been watching them for a while, ever since they had come out of Sparta and came to his shrine. It was no secret to most that knew Kamper/Death, mainly the gods, that Sparta held his respect. It was the only place he would not go, on order from the King that had died some time ago, so Kamper transformed into Death and had Pride fly in to a spot where he could perch and be reached by normal sized mortals. However, Pride was more than powerful enough to screech at his arrival and force the Spartans back with merely the sonic burst from his screech and landing. One of them, that looked like the new King, came forward slowly to retrieve the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018For what purpose do you wish to enter my domain?\u2019 The letter wrote. The young man straightened before speaking, but to the door, rather than to Pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Grandmother said, before she died, that she knew you and that it would be best for Sparta if I would open communications with you. SHE said that, even if you are a god, you have obeyed her father\u2019s ban of you in our kingdom, and that lifting it would be something you would want\u2026\u201d He said, a little confusion but also pleading in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper was still not thrilled by having the \u2018god\u2019 title, but he agreed, access to Sparta was something that he more than desired. To this, he opened the door to his castle and made a passage directly to the throne room by sealing all other doors and passages, but leaving observing points so they could look around as they traveled. They looked at the open doors wearily, but not out of fear. Spartans, after all, weren\u2019t known for their fear. Pride took off, and flew slowly as if to guide them, to which they followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2026 can\u2019t be possible\u2026\u201d Stated a few of the men as they walked along the colossal walkways and passages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were unconcerned when the doors behind them closed, more excited actually. But they were not ready for the sheer magnitude of the place, as well as the value of the very ground they walked on. Even for a warrior society like theirs, they knew the value of so much gold around them. They eventually made it to the throne room, to which Pride flew over to Death and perched near his throne, a spot that seemed made just for him. He resonated with Death, making black flames erupt out of his wings and Death\u2019s body to an extent, before settling in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Grandmother and her Father\u2019s name may have gotten me to open the doors, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have the same authority. For what reason do you want me present in Sparta?\u201d Death asked. He could\u2019ve just ready their minds, but he preferred with his favorite people in this realm to have them answer themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know already? The things they say about you in your temple makes you seem all knowledgeable\u2026\u201d The King stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have admired Sparta for some time. Due in no small part to its reputation and the attitude I witnessed by your Grandmother and her Father. I have a certain respect for Sparta\u2026 I am capable or reading your minds and those of every subject you have\u2026 I choose not to out of my respect for your country. Do not confuse it with ignorance.\u201d Death replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026 are fighting a war. Something, I am sure, you are not surprised in. However, this new enemy is not or mortal men. They are a variety of creatures, some easily handled, and some that decimate men and land alike. Even our soldiers are helpless against them to a point. It seems like the other gods do no help like they do with other parts of Greece. Even the great god Ares hasn\u2019t rendered us aid\u2026\u201d The King answered, again, not scared but more concerned for his Country. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is because they are letting man handle their own problems. But since I have taken a particular interest in Sparta, they have left me as your champion. The beasts you speak of see that you have banned me from Sparta and see that leaves it without a protector, opening the doors for them to attack more boldly. Possibly spurred on by the titans.\u201d Death answered as if informing them of the weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you help us, and be our Champion then?\u201d The King asked, more formally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you not hear what I said? I AM your Champion. But that binds me to your banishment of me. If you don\u2019t want me in your Country, then I will not set foot inside it, as I have done. Not to say that I haven\u2019t helped any and all Spartan forces that came out of the boundaries of Sparta, like your dear Grandmother. I believe I saved her from a Hydra at one point.\u201d Death answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 the only thing I would need to do\u2026 is welcome you back into Sparta???\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Death answered simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I wish to do so.\u201d He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cState your name.\u201d Death stated as he stood, making the area around him and them shake with his power. After all, it was hard to hold back in his released form. He seemed to float down until his 10 foot form was a mere 20 feet away from the Spartan King and his few soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am King Leonidas of Sparta!\u201d He declared, obviously very proud of the Sparta part more than his rank. This Death liked most about him\u2026 in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKing Leonidas, do you give me permission to enter and do as I will in your domain until the end of time?\u201d Death asked simply, but there was obvious power behind his words. It could almost be felt around them, centering with Death and the young King. His next words would obviously make something happen, one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do, as King of Sparta. I, King Leonidas give you entry to do as you will in Sparta from now till the end of time!\u201d he declared and repeated, to be clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that point there was a bit of energy that became material and floated around the room then plunged itself into the young King\u2019s chest, driving him back and staggering him a little. Before he could accuse or ask what it was, Death started explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am now bound to your bloodline. As long as it exists, I will render aid and protect you and what you require me to protect, within reason. Your oath will be magically sealed by your blood, and by all those after you. This bond will give you the strength of many men, and me access to Sparta whenever and however I chose. This is our pact. Now, as for this threat you are so worried about\u2026\u201d Death stated and slammed a foot down, instantly transporting all the people in the room to a field in the direct center of Sparta. They all looked around and instantly knew where they were, it was also right beside a temple of his, to which he turned to ash to their astonishment. \u201c\u2026 I am not a god, nor do I require worship. My doors will always open to the King and his descendents. As for them\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath looked over and saw a giant naga closing in on the city behind them. Death raised his hand and the giant creature rose off the ground as well. He gave his hand a flick and it was burst into black flames before the wind carried the reduced ashes away. After that, he slammed his exposed hand into the ground and a sort of magical barrier spread from his location until it encompassed all of Sparta with all its land and people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile inside the confines of Sparta, your people will not suffer harm from what is unnatural. In the affairs of man, I trust Sparta can handle itself.\u201d Death stated then whistled loudly to which Pride came down. \u201cHe will keep an ever constant eye on this domain and alert me if I need to be present. The only other person that can call me is YOU, Leonidas, King of Sparta.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u2026 What should I call you and how do I call for you?\u201d The young King asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy my name, Death. As for how to contact me\u2026 you must say my chosen password, which only you will be able to say, and those of your bloodline. Anyone else will become tongue tied when trying. The phrase is, \u2018You\u2019ve knocked on Death\u2019s door, now Death is knocking back.\u2019 That will be a phrase to summon me in emergencies. Do not use it otherwise. In less emergency situations, tell Pride contact me. He will in a manner of hours.\u201d Death responded then began to fade into the growing shadow of the sunset. \u201cLive well, King Leonidas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Death faded and melded with the shadows around them, they were still trying to process what had just happened. One thing was for sure, Kamper/Death would be spending a lot more time in Sparta, finally\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kamper, once again, walked around among men. But this time he was visiting Sparta for the first time since he was invited back. He dared not come back when he was banned, but now that he was allowed to roam free as he desired and as long as he wanted, he freely walked through the country and in the cities. He saw that they had NOT rebuilt his temple and they earned a bunch of points for that. The other countries had only escalated his worship after his instruction, although the sacrificing of innocent children and people were no longer tolerated. It was nice to give instruction and they actually follow it. Kamper casually walked through the capital City and once again observed some of the Spartan soldiers training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you!\u201d Yelled one of the men training, or looked more like an instructor of sorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pointing to Kamper, who had taken to sitting on a wall, observing them train with a general interest. After all, Spartans training, while brutal, was much more entertaining than any other army of man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think you are doing?\u201d He demanded as he came near Kamper, to which Kamper simply looked down at him from his perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatching Spartans train.\u201d Kamper responded, as if it was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why are you doing that?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it is pleasing to watch.\u201d Kamper responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you definitely aren\u2019t a Spartan, from the look of you. That means you must be a slave of some kind.\u201d He said with an amount of certainty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, just an ally, hopefully a friend of sorts.\u201d Kamper responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFriend!...\u201d He blared out, making him and the others laugh loudly at the fact. \u201cYou want to come down here and see how worthy of friendship you are?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d Kamper responded. He then pushed himself off the wall and landed on the ground. Some of the laughing stopped, as the drop was about 20 feet. Not enough to be awe inspiring, but enough to impress some. They were more fascinated by the fact that this apparent new comer was not backing down to the fighting skill of an obviously well trained Spartan. He walked passed the Spartan in question and into the training circle. Then turned and waited casually for the Spartan to approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you wish to die?\u201d He more stated then asked as he adjusted his shield and spear. Unlike most other armies, Spartans sometimes, depending what level they were at, trained with real weapons rather than wooden ones. Again, some of the observing Spartans started laughing at Kamper\u2019s apparent idiocy at accepting a match against a Spartan of any rank, much more their superior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Kamper asked as he drew his sword and stood at a relaxed position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose not.\u201d The offending Spartan said then started the match by walking forward and thrusting his spear at his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was obviously thought that he could end it quickly by piercing a shoulder, without killing a potential ally of Sparta. But it was not in Sparta\u2019s nature to suffer fools. So, this would be the only mercy shot he would give. Kamper, on the other hand was no novice, even in his current sealed form. He was still more powerful than most of the gods in this form, not to mention his Death sword was not one to be trifled with. So Kamper easily dodged his thrust and started to spar. It was like a dance to him. The Spartan would attack, followed by a close evasion, followed by Kamper moving to a blind spot and doing something; like kicking him in the backside, or pushing his shoulder so that the spear or shield went into the dirt. However, while such an action would\u2019ve rendered the weapon unusable to most, Spartans had enough experience and strength to forcibly pull the buried weapon out of the ground and continue the match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper also knew that destroying the shield like he had done to other Greek warriors would not be a good move to do to a Spartan. A Spartan had a certain connection to his shield. One that Kamper had no desire to take away. So he simply played this game with him for a staggering 4 hours, amazed at this mortal\u2019s ability to keep going. Then again, he was a Spartan, so it was half expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ever going to attack?!?\u201d Yelled the Spartan, frustrated that he was being out maneuvered so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot when you are doing such a good job of it yourself. All I have to do is evade until you run out of energy, then I win.\u201d Kamper answered, as if it was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point there was a crowd watching. Whomever this was, it was someone of great standing in Sparta, because no one dared laugh or smile at his progress in this match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why are you fighting?\u201d Asked one of the bystanders. The Spartan that was fighting looked to whom it was, then righted himself and bowed as King Leonidas was there, observing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was gauging a Spartan\u2019s fighting strength.\u201d Kamper responded. \u201cI\u2019m impressed\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd who are you to gauge such a thing?\u2019\u2019 The King asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho do you think?\u201d Kamper responded then pointed at a bit of ground at his feet. He looked down and Kamper made some black flames appear and cast his symbol on the ground, then disappear when he saw the King realize who he was. He almost bowed, but Kamper shook his head to stop him. \u201cIf it pleases the King, I would like to walk among your people and dwell here for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Yes of course!\u201d The King agreed. Now knowing who he was talking to, he also seemed to understand that Kamper didn\u2019t want his presence overly known, but was far from hiding either. Therefore he didn\u2019t make a decree for them all to bow to him. \u201cYou may dwell in Sparta for as long as you wish. Maybe teach us a thing or two?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that is your wish, my King.\u201d Kamper said, and bowed to him. This seemed to shock him and make him gulp at the same time. For someone of Kamper/Death\u2019s stature to bow to him was both exhilarating and humbling at the same time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kamper didn\u2019t really need a dwelling inside Sparta, per say. If he needed rest, he went back to his own mountain/palace/castle. Mostly, he wandered around and observed Sparta. As with most societies, there were bits he didn\u2019t like overly much. But, as a whole, he was content just observing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery once in a while he would interact and have fun with some of them. He had a few training sessions with the King and some of his elite men, who were still not clear why Kamper was afforded such respect and freedom. Only those that had come to see him in his palace figured it out, and didn\u2019t spread it overly so. Last thing they wanted to do was anger him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe liked that there were barely any actual sealed doors in the place. They just didn\u2019t see the point he assumed. Anyone caught being somewhere they weren\u2019t supposed to be were\u2026 otherwise motivated not to do so again, and others with that example. Therefore, Kamper had very little difficulty moving amongst peoples\u2019 homes and whatnot. On this day, Kamper had entered the King\u2019s home, easily snuck past the guards, and was observing him train his son. It was usually hard training, but that only produced the level of people that Kamper had now put a high value on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper watched for a while as the young boy tried to topple the giant of a warrior that was his father, with real swords of course. It took some time, but the King\u2019s wife joined in watching from the opposite side and took even more time to notice Kamper. When she did, she walked forward to get her husband\u2019s attention. That put a hold on his training session with his son, then his attention was on her, then on Kamper, which brought him forward now as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, My King.\u201d Kamper greeted as he entered the sandy area. The King eyed his son, then realized that trying to protect anyone against Kamper would be a fruitless pursuit if he really wanted to do them harm. So his eyes came back to Kamper, again thrown off by him showing him such respect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I ask, My Lord, what you are doing in my home?\u201d The King asked, trying to gauge Kamper\u2019s intensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI felt a good amount of potential and fighting spirit in here. I knew your aura, so I was interested in seeing who you were training with.\u201d Kamper answered, then looked at the boy. \u201cVery impressive. Such a scent, coming from someone so young.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFather? Who is this?\u201d Asked the young boy, in a stance from his training, obviously unaware of whom he was referring to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wife had the same question and was more interested that her King of a husband hadn\u2019t shown this intruder the door yet, in as aggressive a manner as his intrusion dictated. The King looked to Kamper, who nodded that it was ok to tell them, then again, Kamper hadn\u2019t restricted the information that he was who he was. It was more an assumption on their part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Lord, this is my son; Pleistarchus, and Wife; Gorgo of Sparta.\u201d He introduced, then looked at his Wife and Son, then back at Kamper. \u201cHe is known as Kamper, also known as the Spartan Champion Titan; Death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his words his wife gasped and his son dropped the sword he was holding. However, Kamper just glanced at it and it floated in midair just before hitting the ground. He raised it in front of the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour blade shouldn\u2019t taste the dirt unless you will it.\u201d Kamper stated. The boy looked at the blade that just floated in front of him. He hesitantly reached out and grabbed it by the hilt to which Kamper let it go and let him hold it as he willed. He then looked to his wife and bowed a little. \u201cGood to meet you, My Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-My Lord\u2026\u201d She said as she started to bow, to which the King stopped her. She looked at him as if he had just signed her death warrant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe has expressed that he doesn\u2019t wish to be bowed to by any Spartan.\u201d He explained, to which she straightened and nodded, then took an official stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper thought about just leaving it at that, but he felt like their family deserved something more. So he, very slowly and careful to not effect too much, transformed into his normal Death form. He now stood a staggering 10 feet tall above them, his energy flapping his cloak around and causing wind to whip around the area, despite his efforts to the contrary. He held that form for a few minutes so the other two could soak it in, then reverted back to the sealed Kamper form, still in the same relaxed pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mind an extra body at your dinner table this evening?\u201d Kamper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be an honor\u2026\u201d The Queen answered, still very nervous at the sudden realization that she had a Titan in her home. Not just any Titan either, but Spartan\u2019s protector and the one that was rumored to cause the gods to quake in fear. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kamper made quite an impression on the King and his family. That he was willing to just come by and spend time with them was something they were at first awestruck at, then valued highly. He showed both the King and his son some things in their training, but not enough to give them much more of advantage that Spartans already had normally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamper was an enigma of sorts. Some knew who he was and knew not to treat him like his title would otherwise dictate. Others just knew him as one of the only non-Spartans that got to roam so freely that he was welcomed into the King\u2019s home and could trounce a Spartan in battle. Kamper would go back to his castle every once in a while and socialize with a god or right a temple that was going too far. But, primarily, he stayed around Sparta. However, his journeys outside had shown him a threat that was closing in. Not to him, obviously, but to Greece and Sparta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after the initial confrontation and start of the war, a messenger came to Sparta and was shown the bottom of a well. He made it clear to the King that he was not there to fight their battles or decide their course. He was their protector from the realm beyond the realm of man. This war was for him and Sparta to decide. When he returned with news that they were not to go to war and you noticed that a few bribes were being exchanged, you decided that you would accompany him and his 300 \u2018body guards\u2019 as he called them, to the Hot Gates. So, he met them at the border.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you are about to have some fun.\u201d Kamper said as he leaned against a tree in their path. Leonidas smiled at this then nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you come to wish us luck, or perhaps\u2026?\u201d Leonidas started to ask, knowing full well Kamper\u2019s ability and affinity for battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will be traveling with you, stretching my legs, as you will be\u2026 if you don\u2019t mind that is?\u201d Kamper asked. The King smiled at his apparent non-Titan like behavior. He, the Titan above gods and other Titans, was asking HIM for permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it is blood you seek, you are welcome to join us.\u201d He answered with a broadening smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then\u2026 we can get going then.\u201d Kamper agreed, standing straight and clearly ready to travel. As he did so, the others, most of them, knew him as the man that trained with Spartans every once in a while. But some didn\u2019t care to take part in the gossip. So they were curious and possibly a bit annoyed that their King just had a young man half some of their ages join, or looked have their ages at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy King?\u201d Asked their Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d Leonidas asked as they started walking and Kamper took position beside him to the right, while the Captain was stuck at his left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is this young man, or boy?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see, my friend.\u201d The King responded with a smile to which Kamper joined in. This was a game for him then, perfect. Kamper humored him and shrugged to agree. All they would have to do is see him fight once to realize that he was anything besides normal. Soon the Acadians joined them as well, and they were on their way. One night, while Leonidas was sitting with Kamper, watching his men, another old man came by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you are planning on helping them then?\u201d Asked the old man to Kamper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Lord?\u201d Leonidas asked, about to wake his men to surround the old man. Old or not, he was an intruder. But he didn\u2019t know just who it was. So, Kamper just put a hand on his shoulder and shook his head. To this he sat and watched as the man settled in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust having a bit of fun. Help, would be a strong word, but I suppose I\u2019ll be fighting at a lower level, so help works I guess.\u201d Kamper answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind if we watch, do you?\u201d The old man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s up to King Leonidas here\u2026 I\u2019m part of his party, not the other way around.\u201d Kamper answered then looked at Leonidas who was looking at him for an introduction at least. \u201cMy King, this is Zeus, in disguise of course. Zeus, this is King Leonidas, King of Sparta.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZeus?!?\u201d Leonidas asked, then looked at the old man. \u201cTruly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is as he says. Now, do you mind, King of Sparta, if the gods watch your battle from Olympus?\u201d Zeus asked, a bit irritated that he had to pay homage to a mortal King of all things. But it was worth it if it put him on Death\u2019s good side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, My Lord. Of course, do as you please.\u201d Leonidas answered with a bow. Kamper was going to stop it but knew that it was the proper thing for him to do. Also, he was doing so out of respect and honor, not obligation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWithin reason\u2026\u201d You added, to which both looked at him. \u201cYou may do as you wish, within reason. Sparta is still under my protection.

Kamper spent a considerable amount of time with Leonidas as the others did most of the work. He also watched the Persians with some intrigue, and was interested as to why they thought their king was a god of all things. He wasn\u2019t even close to one, not even the form of those on Olympus. The other Spartans, particularly the Captain was a bit skeptical of him, but trusted in their king enough to not question his decision to have Kamper be with him all the time. Finally, the battle started and he watched as the 300 easily dispatched the soldiers thrown at them. It was beyond easy for the Spartans and the rest, including Kamper, could only watch. Finally, after Leonidas\u2019s little meeting with their King, he came to ask something of Kamper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, looks like he took your bait.\u201d Kamper said as he looked in the direction of the Persians\u2019 camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Leonidas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome specialty unit is starting to move around and form up at his command and anger. I got to say, young man, you never disappoint.\u201d Kamper answered, then looked to him specifically. \u201cYou wanted to ask me something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, how would you like to \u2018stretch your legs\u2019 like you said?\u201d Leonidas asked with a cautious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could do with some entertainment. What do you have in mind?\u201d Kamper asked plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps you being on standby in an area to give us Spartans a breath before we continue? I have a feeling that tonight will be rather interesting.\u201d Leonidas asked and commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat I agree. Remember, I will fight with you, but I won\u2019t do anything overly crazy. If you make a decision that loses you this battle, I won\u2019t just pick up the slack.\u201d Kamper warned. He knew that Leonidas didn\u2019t plan on losing, but Spartans weren\u2019t exactly known for their retreating nature, quite the opposite actually. So, he thought it prudent to let him know, that if it came down to it, Kamper wouldn\u2019t protect him beyond a certain point. After all, this was the affairs of men and he had his own life to live\u2026 and die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand, My Champion\u2026\u201d Leonidas answered, getting excited about seeing Kamper fight as well as his own fight to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has been quite entertaining to see you all have your fun. As I\u2019ve thought, Spartans are a class of their own. Makes me very glad that I wanted to be a part of your kingdom.\u201d Kamper complimented as he looked over to the other Spartans as they went around and celebrated their current success and prepared for the upcoming fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe definitely have had our fun, as you say. We do work hard at being the best warriors in the world\u2026 except you of course.\u201d Leonidas agreed with pride at Kamper\u2019s compliments to him and his country. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is hardly fair. I am a Titan, after all. I\u2019m guessing that if you had access to my lifespan and immortality, you would be very comparable to my strength. Still, you\u2019ve done very well as a mortal. Even if you were to die today, your family and people would still be ok, do in no small part to your leadership thus far.\u201d Kamper returned with a bit of fondness. There were a few things that he didn\u2019t like about Spartan society as a whole, but they were still his favorite in the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue enough. Although, if I was immortal, I would still probably still fight and live the Spartan life, wither King or not.\u201d Leonidas commented, insinuating that he really didn\u2019t want to be immortal, even if it was an option for him. This made Kamper smile a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough\u2026\u201d Kamper ended with, then continued to observe, waiting for the events to play out and have his part. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yes the story\u2019s hero is a bit overpowered, and it can be a bit unfair. However I liked the concept so, if you like this story and the chapters that follow then you might want to pick up a copy. As this is will be Fan fiction, I am not really writing on all the rules. But that is the point, isn\u2019t it? Anyway, the book will describe more of the fine tuned things that are just standard with this guy. I will try to explain the best I can but for some things it is best to just go to the source. Without further ado, here is the start of this series, I hope you all like it\u2026 and tell me if you do\u2026 Please!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, here are the rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)    No overly exotic themes. You can use ANYTHING you want to do to add to the story. But, this should be an item that is, at most, a R rated item. So keep that in mind please. Hopefully it gets some writers to think more on how they want to portray an idea to make it work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2)   Try to keep an eye out for your grammar. I will not be a grammar or spelling Nazi. But just use spell check or something, please!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3)  Have fun. I hope you like this interactive and add something. Even if you don't, I hope you enjoy reading it, especially when it gets a bit bigger!!!</td>",
