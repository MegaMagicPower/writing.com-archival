This continues from Delilah's \"Playtime\"]]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah reached for me; slowly, luxuriously, stretching out the moment\u2026until her giant hand stopped just short of grabbing me for whatever \u201cfun\u201d she had in mind. \u201cJust a minute. What am I doing? I can\u2019t just play with you like this, Greg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was delirious with relief. I let out a breath I\u2019d forgotten I was holding and shuddered, putting a hand on my chest to calm my heartbeat from its machine gun pace. Some god up there had given me a break for once, and decided to make this amorous rhino giantess come to her senses and NOT make me her personal pleasure object. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Doctor Davison,\u201d I heard myself say. \u201cIt\u2019d be too dangerous\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I hog you all to myself?\u201d Delilah said brightly, as if I hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cThat would just be selfish. No, a cutie like you should be shared! The more the merrier, as they say!\u201d She gave me a sultry wink and grin, then reached for the phone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hope that had been rekindled just got a cold wave thrown on it. If I wasn\u2019t dead before, I was practically in the grave already now. There was no way I\u2019d survive <b>TWO</b> amorous titanesses playing with me! I tried to beg her to stop dialing, but all I could offer was a weak croak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo exited to speak, Greggie?\u201d Delilah purred, covering the phone\u2019s mic. She licked her lips and winked at me. \u201cJust be patient, you\u2019ll get in on the fun soon enough.\u201d She shifted, and once more I was covered in the shadow of her gigantic rump\u2026before it crashed down right next to me, making the bed creak and launching me into the air. Screaming, I rocketed upward, then fell\u2014bouncing off one of Delilah\u2019s ample thighs. She immediately brought her legs together, trapping me between her thunder thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRough pachyderm hide ground against me as I was squeezed between mountains of rhino celulite. Sweat and floral perfume assaulted my nose as Delilah gave me a quick squeeze, sighing at my struggles. She patiently waited for the phone to ring\u2026and when I heard the other line pick up, my blood ran cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeya Toronto! You know how you said I can play with Greg? Well, I figured you need a little stress relief from running this place\u2014come on down and join in! I\u2019ve got plenty of ideas on how we can have fun with Greg\u2026I know it\u2019s been a while since we played with a human. Why not relive some old times?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Nononono. NO! Not Miss Holmes. ANYONE BUT MISS HOLMES! That cow was merciless. She\u2019d made no secret about how she\u2019d stepped on, sat on, and EATEN humans and enjoyed it. Not as a threat, but a simple fact. She\u2019d always been suspicious of me, now she had the perfect excuse to take out any frustrations on the only human who worked for her. And with her to egg Delilah on, the rhino would do FAR worse than she ever could alone. I was so freaking dead\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolmes and Deliah chatted for some time. I was too terrified of my impending doom to hear most of it, but I caught the tail end just before Delilah hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome right down, Toronto! This\u2019ll be so much fun, you\u2019ll see. I promise I\u2019ll hold off on Greg until you get here\u2026oh! And be sure to bring\u2014\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have a great figure, you should show off your assets more often,\" Delilah purred, biting her lip and sighing in amorous bliss. She squeed her thighs together, squishing me again. \"I'm in my bikini, it'll be awkward if you're all gussied up. See you soon!\" She hung up and smirked down at me. \"It's your lucky day, Greg. You get TWO big beauties today...of course I'll get first dibs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to beg for mercy, but she just clenched her thighs again and produced a magazine to read while we waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Miss Holmes arrived--and <i>Jesus Mary and Joseph</i>, she was a bombshell! The bra and panties were pure frilly lace, with fancy frills all around them. Shining white, crisp and clean. They were plus-sized, but fit TIGHT on her giant rump and breasts...merciless slave driver she was, I had to admit Miss Holmes was HOT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still probably gonna die, though...wait, why did she have that box in her hand? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned evilly, her tail swishing behind her as she closed and locked the door. \"Delilah; where is he? Ah don't take breaks often, so let's make this one count!\" She rubbed her stomach with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah slapped her thighs, creating waves that battered me around like a hurricane. \"Oh, we'll have fun Toronto--and you should relax more. It's unhealthy to overwork yourself like you do.\" She reached into the flab with two fingers and plucked me from the trap, setting me on the floor. \"What's that you've got there, by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolmes grinned, tearing the box open and producing what looked like a yellow toy gun and aimed it at me. \"New gizmo from Kelly. She said it's a shrink ray...this'll be even better if Greg's even smaller!\" She flicked a switch, and the gun's barrel glowed red. \"Business isn't good, Greg. Guess it's time fer some <i>downsizin'!</i>\" She laughed at her own joke and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ray of red light engulfed me. I felt pressure crushing down from all sides--no, it was like something was drawing me inward from within. The room stretched around me--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat lasted three seconds before I blacked out.<br>\r\nMiss Holmes's evil laugh was the last thing I heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was spinning. Stars danced around my vision even with my eyes held shut. I felt like I'd somehow fall even lying down. Eventually I came to and opened my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And wished I hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wakey-wakey, Greg!\" Delilah sang. Her voice thundered. I looked up, and up, AND UP...and kept on looking up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMountains. <br>\r\nThey were mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo all-encompassing goddesses looming over their human toy, pain and fear incarnate in pachydermic and bovine forms. Inescapable, overwhelming, merciless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt like...no, I WAS; an ant before these titanic dominatrixes. Normally I would be ankle-high to Delilah; now her toenail alone was bigger than me. Miss Holmes' hoof looked big enough to crush a hundred of me in one go. Her panties and bra looked deadly as they were beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't move, couldn't scream. My legs gave out and I fell flat on my back, looking up at my certain doom with a slack jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Holmes eyed me like I was one of her chocolate strawberries that had gone a little stale but was still edible. \"Welp; we know Kelly's gadget works,\" she mused, examining the shrink ray. \"Think Ah overdid it, though--didn't expect Greg ta git THAT small...shoot, Ah can barely see 'im!\" She squinted and leaned down. \"Ya <i>sure</i> we can play with 'im, Delilah? Looks like he'd break just from pickin' 'im up. What fun is that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, pishposh!\" Delilah tutted. \"Greg's at the PERFECT size. You overthink things, Toronto. Honestly, he's about...half an inch high? Maybe less? Oh, it doesn't matter. He's even cuter now, and he's more durable than you think--I sat on him, and he didn't even have one broken bone!\" She slapped her gigantic rump and leered down at me. \"And I'm not exactly a lightweight, am I Greg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only whimper. They didn't see even me as  a human now, just as a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolmes whistled. \"He survived YOUR ass? Day-um! He IS tough. 'Course, he can't put any sunblock on our booties NOW. It'd take him half and hour just to walk across our butts! Come ta think of it, he can't really do his job now at all...\" She eyed me and licked her lips. \"Kelly said she didn't have a way to UN-shrink him yet; so he'd just be freeloadin' until she came up with one. And Ah don't like freeloaders...haven't eaten a human in a while either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah waved her off. \"Now now Toronto, you can't just eat humans who could still be useful. For all you know Kelly could un-shrink him tomorrow! Personally, I'd like to keep him at this size for good--he'd make an ADORABLE pet!\" She giggled. \"But for now...let's have our fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now yer talkin'! Git ready Greg, 'cause we play rough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo giant hands reached for me.<br>\r\nI screamed for some god to help me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How do Holmes and Delilah play with the shrunken Greg?</i></span></div></div>",

With a tired groan, I rolled out of bed and blearily walked up to the window to see what little I could of the view outside past the red plastic tube. The waves were now turned on and crashing against the sand, and the blustery snowstorm that'd been pounding on the glass dome for two weeks flickered away into a bright blue sky above an an infinite-looking ocean, giving the perfect illusion of a gorgeous beach during the heart of summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the room saved me a few bucks on an alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the wardrobe and pulled out a tall, slim package wrapped in plastic, carrying it with me into the bathroom. After a long shower, a shave, and some hair brushing, I came back out ten minutes later with the bedridden, disheveled me shedded off in favor of somebody good enough to be at a wedding, with a dark black suit, evenly combed hair, and clean skin, but all of that was only half of the trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned on a light in the wardrobe so I could see my reflection inside. The get up was perfect, but the fire inside wasn't quite burning, yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI forced a smile. It came too fast, kind of crooked. \"<i>Hello,</i> there, miss. How may I help you, today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nah, too whimsical.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled again, but smaller and softer. \"Hello there, miss! How may I help you, today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Better...but too next-door neighborish.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, miss! How may I help you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Spastic, but getting there...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, there, miss. How may I help you, today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect. Not a single twitch or smirk in sight, and not the least bit forced. I was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and in time, too, as the red phone let out a ring. I instantly broke character and dove in a mad dash to grab the phone before it rang a second time, and reached so much speed that my back slammed against the wall before I took the phone off its hook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, miss Holmes. How're you today?\" I greeted, mustering up the same rehearsed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Howdy. Just fine...\"</i> She drawled on the other end with a preoccupied tone. <i>\"Y'all ready for the day?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, miss! Everything is in perfect order!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good ta hear. Anyways, today I'm gonna have you be workin' in...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Y'all better make sure the pantry is stocked, otherwise, we'll have to cook you.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" I let out a grunt at that. I didn't know whether or not she was serious or not but being a cook at the White Brimstone was the most stressful job of all. Given that many of the guests are large anthros and big eaters as well, I had to make absolutely sure of several factors. First I had to check the inventory, then there's preparing the food and making sure not to keep the guests waiting. One mistake could be dangerous. Not to mention, I'm pretty sure that at least a few of the guests would eat me if they thought they could get away with it. Well, hopefully I can get the job done today without ending up as the main course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst I was making a note of the inventory and everything seemed to be in order. Most of it was all kinds of seafood. It was a good thing that Ms. Holmes hired those fishermen the other day or I'd be sunk. After all, a lot of the guests were carnivores and even the herbivorous animals could get pretty ravenous. Of course, that's when I heard a grunt because somebody had snuck up on me. I looked to both sides to see two balck and white furry asses right next to me pressing against me and there appeared to be pink panties and maid outfits attached with long cats tails. Two of the dectuplets had surrounded me. \u201cHi Gregy.\u201d Both of them say in a sing-song tone. You let out a groan. \u201cIris,\u201d I said. \u201cMaia. Leave me alone.\u201d The two cat girls then grabbed each of my legs and squeezed them between my thighs and I screamed in pain. \u201cI\u2019m Nike,\u201d said the one on the left. \u201cI\u2019m not Maia.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m Nemesis.\u201d Of course. It\u2019s not like I care which one of them is which. Who the hell could tell since they look exactly alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNike (or Nemesis) I really don\u2019t care batted at the side of my face as Nemesis (or Nike) licked my face. \u201cMe-ow. Come on, Gregy, how about we both take a break and catch that new Elisa Young movie.\u201d The other of the girls let out a hiss. \"No way, Nike, he's coming with me.\" Nemesis and Nike then hissed at each other and showed their claws before I pushed both of them out of the way. \"Girls, girls, girls!\" I yelled. \"Leave me alone. I've got bigger fish to fry. If Ms. Holmes catches me skipping work, she'll swallow me down with a handful of watermelons.\" Nike let out a scoff. \"You're no fun. Maybe we should tell the boss what you really think of the customers.\" I let out a moan. Their tomfoolery never failed to irk me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNemesis then gave a smirk. \"You know, Nike. Maybe we should like Greg work. After all, we're expecting at least three important guests today.\" I gave a gulp. Special guests always made me nervous. \"And which guests would those be?\" Nike let out a laugh. \"I'll tell you three names, Gregy. First, Elisa Young.\" Now that got me excited. I had heard of Elisa Young. She was a famous anthro actress who did mainly action and romance movies. She was a 75ft tall anthro hippopotamus with pure teal skin and shiny bluish midnight black hair worn in a beehive style. However, she was most recognizable for the triple heart tattoo on her large behind. Being a hippopotamus she was obviously large, probably even heavier than my boss. I may complain about my job in private but boy would I like to meet Elisa Young one day. I'm kind of a fan. I did hear that she predictably had a rather large appetite and wasn't exactly picky about food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second,\" said Nemesis with a giggle. \"There's Jean of Zaldin.\" Now that made me nervous. Zaldin was a country that has had numerous quarrels with the country that Gaia 2.0 was located in. Their queen, Jean, was a 67' 1\" and obese phoenix with bright green feathers all over her body and sparkling red hair with eyes that shined like topaz as well as an enormous belly big enough to deflect missiles. She's currently in the country and I heard she was there in order to sign a peace treaty with our country and Zaldin. She was also rumored to be hot and cold towards outsiders. If she was at the hotel, I'd have to be on my toes. I neither want to end up in a phoenix's throat or to cause a war. I didn't know enough about the country of Zaldin to know what not to do to avoid offending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the third guest?\" I asked nervously. Both the sisters laughed as they walked out. \"Try Lady Xanadu.\" \"Lady Xanadu?!\" I yelled. Lady Xanadu, now that woman scared me. Not that she was mean. It's just that I wasn't entirely sure about her mental health. Lady Xanadu was a pop singer and a 44' 4\" armadillo woman with long pure white hair and a gold-colored shell. She was rather obese but most of it went into her huge boobs and her shelled back that even had spikes embedded into it. She was one of the most well known singers in the world of Neo-Earth. However, she was rather eccentric. How eccentric, try wearing a bikini made out of barcodes. Not only that, no one has ever seen her eyes behind the sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf those are only three of the special guests, I was wondering how I was going to please them without getting into trouble or ending up in their stomaches myself. Sure enough, Hera (or Demeter, I really don't care), came into the room. \"Heads up, Gregy,\" she said in just as much a flirty tone as her sisters. \"You've got your first guest of the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough the first guest in the White Brimstone was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a loud shaking sound and I realized that the first guest was a particularly large and very heavy guest given the sound of their footsteps. I mean, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised since most of the guests are giant fat ladies who could swallow me whole and my boss herself was so big I don\u2019t think I could budge her fat ass with a bulldozer. But whoever was coming was probably big enough to make Ms. Holmes and her ginormous hulk look small if that was even possible. I felt that it was best to look out to see what Hera, Demeter or whoever that dectuplet was, was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there I looked out and saw someone that A) I never thought I\u2019d ever meet before and B) I always wished I\u2019d be able to meet. It was none other than the hippopotamus goddess of the silver screen herself; the very beautiful and very huge Elisa Young. Standing 75ft tall, she was very obese (but then again she was a hippo so that was predictable). She had an 80ft wide stomach and a huge 90ft wide ass, her most dazzling feature, especially with the triple heart tattoo on her right butt cheek. There was an urban rumor that a meteor shattered upon image with Elisa\u2019s huge rear and Elisa herself didn\u2019t even feel it. Her bright teal skin glistened in the light. I looked up to see her bluish black hair worn in her standard beehive, which is how I got the fetish for the hairstyle in the first place. Surprisingly for a big time movie star, she was dressed casually, although that was understandable. She probably didn\u2019t want to be hounded by fans, even though this was a rather exclusive resort. The hippopotamus was wearing a black tanktop and a pink vest with a pair of tight blue jeans that were coming apart due to her large, fat and beautiful ass. Finally, she was wearing a pair of dark glasses. Damn, I got really hard looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the cats quickly noticed this gesture and pouted. \u201cOh geez,\u201d said Nike. \u201cGreg\u2019s been a fan of that pachydermic diva for years.\u201d \u201cWhat could he possibly see in her?\u201d scoffed Nemesis with a smirk. \u201cI heard a rumor she once accidentally swallowed a guy like him in a salad.\u201d I had heard about this rumor myself and while I wasn\u2019t sure if it was true, it.... probably be worth it.... if I could just be in the presence of a goddess like Elisa Young. At that moment, the divine hippo was taking a seat in three chairs at a table built for our more titanic guests. The third of the dectuplets was about to go out and take Elisa\u2019s order, but I pushed her to the side as she meowed loudly. There was no way I was going to miss a chance to meet my favorite actress. I immediately ran up to the table to call up to Elisa Young. \u201cHello! Miss Young! Down here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa took off her sunglasses and the hippopotamus giantess looked down and appeared to be surprised to see a human on the ground. \u201cWell that\u2019s fast service,\u201d said the giantess with a cheeky smile. \u201cBut this dish doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s cooked properly.\u201d I let out a nervous laugh at what I thought was a joke. \u201cM-My name is G... uh, it\u2019s Greg! And I will be your slave... I mean your server, forever, I mean, today.\u201d Elisa let out a sigh and a slight smile. \u201cSo much for incognito. I thought I\u2019d be able to take it easy for once at Gaia 2.0. \u201cSorry, Miss Young,\u201d I said with a blush. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m a... I\u2019m a big fan.\u201d Elisa rolled her eyes and smiled. \u201cFlattery will get you nowhere,\u201d she says. \u201cBut maybe I\u2019ll give you a hint of my next movie role if I\u2019m in a good mood later.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what Elisa was going to do for her next roll but I remembered her last role in Cheer Ninjas and it was one of my favorite movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace, the dragon head chef, walked out and seemed surprised to see me speaking with a hippopotamus that utterly dwarfed her. \u201cUh-oh,\u201d says Candace. \u201cSounds like somebody is going all fanboy out there. This should be interesting.\u201d The dectuplets that were in the kitchen were hissing as Elisa was looking at a menu. I was anxious as to what she would order. It could be anything since it was a known fact Elisa Young would eat anything. That\u2019s when she decided on a dish. \u201cThis looks interesting.\u201d She said as I prepared to write her order down. \"And what will it be today, Miss Young?\"</span></div></div>",

No, five. <i>Five.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course.

I didn't do my usual glances around to make sure I wasn't about to get snatched away by some starving patron as I ran by, but all the way across the restaurant I didn't remember until it was too late to dodge a black tail that curled around my waist and fished me off my feet, just a few steps from the kitchen doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhichever-greek-goddess-she-was-named-after swung me straight into her belly and smushed me in with both arms, spinning me around as she scraped my face with a wet, sandpapery tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gkk...Nike, cut that out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Maia!\" She huffed. \"I'd think <i>you</i> of all people would recognize me, Gregory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, just let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wriggled out of her arms and hit the ground again, but she took care to let her tail drag along my face as I took off for the kitchen.

The sight of them in such action distracted me from three of the bird-agents striding towards the kitchen door, and I came to just in time to leap out of the way from being trampled by the two running in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Workership liscense?\" Demanded the third agent that stayed outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, sure!\" I fumbled more then usual as I pulled out my wallet, flashing him my ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" An eyebrow creased over his sunglasses as he examined the card. \"Alright. That's a check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the agents peeked his head through the door. \"Everybody here checks, sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" He hit a button on his wristwatch and spoke into the face. \"Bring her in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery one of the bird guards' heads swiveled towards the White Brimstone's main doors. They cracked open, then were heaved apart by two grounded rows of birds pushing through, opening the door for a very tall, very wide, and very round body that stood outside, partly silhouetted by the harsher lighting in the Aether's hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hefty phoenixes dressed in veils fluttered into the room whilst carrying the ends of a long square of ornately designed fabric along the ground, but even as towered dover the rest of the bodyguards, they weren't even a paper clip on a rubber band compared to the gigantic ruler whose stomach poured out several feet over every end of the material. Jean didn't even look like she needed their help as she effortlessly walked in through the door, despite carrying a stomach that poured out along a length of floor almost as long as the climb up along her thick lovehandles to the top of her shoulders, and wide enough to form the curve of a bell tracing down from the tips of her shoulder blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her beak high with her eyes shut, flaunting a layer of black mascara that punched two holes within the emerald green luster of her feathers, all dressed up in an exotic flair that was topped by a thin red veil that flared around a head of weightless, wavy black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were still closed as she lowered her monolithic legs into her seat, but then she glanced to her right and looked around at the ground. That hit my spark plug and I strode briskly, yet smoothly to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, YOU!!!\" One of her body guards panicked at my speed and rocketed straight at me, strikign the ground only a few feet away from me when I stumbled and faceplanted on the hardwood. \"WHAT BUSINESS DO YOU HAVE WITH ZALDIN'S JEAN?!!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, relax, Thespi...\" Jean tempered, but not out of compassion. \"I highly doubt a human as him'll count as a major threat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, I think I'd made a good enough impression...</i> I mentally smacked myself.</span></div></div>",

One almost as tall as Miss Holmes, and just like Miss Holmes was ridiculously fat, with a heaping asteroid of a big belly covered in grayish-brown scales that scraped loud along the hardwood floor of the White Brimstone. Her breasts were absolutely enormous, and otherwise the only part of her body clothed by a taut black T-shirt with garbled silver lettering spray painted along her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a few years of experience, it'd gotten to be a dead giveaway that you'd be in for a pretty bad day if a snake came slithering in. I'd been sat on by celebrities, nearly been swiped away for standing a few feet close to the buffet, and one time wasn't even as lucky and ended up trapped inside some dumbass horse's stomach for two days, but snakes? Snakes were pretty much the only kind of guest I'd immediately come to fear, <i>especially</i> cobras. It sure as hell didn't help that this one had a <i>friggin' skull painted on her face.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unlike any of the guests in general we'd get, she actually had three humans at her side walking into the restaurant. They weren't even carrying around any baggage or taking notes as advisors would, they just looked like they were with her for a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...\" Nike or Nemesis cringed, and for the first time I'd ever seen any of the Dectuplets do, the two waddled away, abandoning me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, don't...!\" But there wasn't a single waiter in the White Brimstone closer than I was to the snake woman waiting at the podium. \"Oh...\" <i>Come to think of it, Miss Holmes' perfume smells kinda nice...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, my muscle memory got the better of me and tugged me towards the front doors. Yet as I approached the quadrio, I tried to guide my attention towards one of her humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sirs and...<i>madame</i>, how may I help the four of you?\" I struggled to smooth out my shaky posture and voice, but they didn't seem to question me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One reservation for a 'Toxic Nightshade', please?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be...\" I whipped out my tablet, scrolling through the list of guests for today. Sure enough, one of the reservations bore the distinct name. \"...Kelly and Eric Monroe, Matt Ericks, and Nick Bastion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. right this way, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTable forty eight, one of the tables in the furthest corner of the joint. I lead the way for them, with the three other humans standing frontline on their snake's belly, who, to my surprise, I could hear keeping up a slow pace in order to let them keep up a natural pace, which for her was a half of fraction of a decimal of a crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither out of curiosity or tempting fear, I couldn't help but look back up at her. Given her reptile senses, she easily noticed my movement and glanced back down, and of all things, smiled at me. It wasn't some vicious snarl or predatory grin, but something like a silent, friendly hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh. First snake I'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, table forty eight.\" I guess I should've instantly know where they'd sit. It'd been arranged and set as one table over thirty feet tall, with a more human-geared setup put together on top. \"May I interest you in a ladd-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when I turned back, the snake was already busy picking the three of them up one at a time, setting them on the table. \"Pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued setting them at their table on hers, and I politely excused myself back to the kitchen as they looked through the menu. I didn't bother to stick around, but I didn't try to sprint away, either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when I got in, every single eye of the staff was staring at me. Most of them looked absolutely flabbergasted, as if my coming back to work alive was the work of some witchcraft, while the others seemed pitiful. The only one who wasn't gawking happened to lay a clawed hand on my shoulder, and I glanced back at Candace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright there, buddy?\" She asked knowingly, her expression somber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, actually. I'm alive, aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knelt down, getting onto my level. \"Wanna stick around here till they go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" I looked out the window back at their table. To add more icing on the cake, she was chatting with them, and <i>laughing.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was honestly a little stumped. Hera (or Demeter) said it was a guest, but all I saw were two yellow-and-black striped boulders. They were being carried by two 6 foot muscular female bees. When I saw there backs sink into the boulders, it clicked: those enormous things were a pair of breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked forward, I could see a head above the gigantic boobs. It was a bee woman with short, orange hair, black insect eyes, two antenna, and a mandible. She had a small crown, so she must have been a queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, all three of them made it to a large booth. The two workers set the queen's gargantuan knockers on the table while they sat at a nearby table. Almost immediatly, the table shattered under the weight. I walked up to the queen Now that I had a side view, I could see the queen bee was over 9 feet tall. She had fairly muscular build, thick arms and legs and a decent butt. She was covered in yellow-and-black fuzz, had large insect wings, and a large thorax with a stinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked up to the queen to take her order. \"Hello, you're majesty.\" I said, trying to be polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I'm on vacation.\" She said with a French accent. \"Call me Felicia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Felicia, would you like to start with a drink?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll start with a Le Miel La Reine La Joie.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head and saw I was confused. I'd never heard of that drink before. \"Oh, my apologies.\" She said. \"That's French for Honey Queen Delight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and started to walk away to tell one of the cats. One of the two worker bees stopped me. She had blonde hair and green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we'll just take waters. And sorry about the table. Guess the ones here aren't built to hold 2000 pounds of breast.\" She said.<br>\r\nI went wide-eyed. \"2000 pounds?\" I asked.<br>\r\n\"Yup. 1000 pounds each. Big breasts are a status symbol for queens in our hive. Queen Felicia is the biggest so far, and she's obsessed with them. But she's also trying to learn to be more self-reliant and humble. Pampered her whole life. That's why shes here.\" The worker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why are you here then? And if she's a queen, shouldn't she be pregnant?\" I ask, having at least some knowledge on how hives work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're the royal breast carriers. She can't move those behemoths on her own. And someone else takes care of worker repopulation. Oh, I'm Hailey, the bluenette with brown eyes who hates smiling is Miki.\" Hailey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and went back to the kitchen. Artemis (or Isis) was talking to Athena (or Maia).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at those jugs. How can she walk? And they flattened a table.\" Athena (or Maia) said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just ignored them and got the drinks. I gave the waters to Hailey and Maia and the Le Miel La bla bla bla to Felicia. She looked at me with a smile (or as much of a smile as mandibles can give).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to order?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, now that I see you, I may need your services.\" Felicia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you, for the week I'm here, to be my personal...</span></div></div>",

Still, I tried to keep my head angled enough so Felicia was just in my line of sight, anticipating the moment to see her face when we'd clear past the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not that I could really stop seeing her, with her breasts rolling out only inches from my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light tone sang from the speakers, followed by a crudely patched electronic voice. <span class=\"cpink\">\"Now Approaching: Glass Tornado.

I took the opportunuty to join in and look at the spot just next to the superior bee's head, giving me much more of a chance to see her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train came towards and barreled straight through a wide circle of light that'd materialized around the, filling the windows with a sudden glare that faded back into a row of palm trees speeding by, separating us from a vibrant blue sky and the sandy shores it overlooked. Miki and Haily immediately huddled together with astonished whispers, only becoming even more flabbergasted as we passed more of the island's mountains and flora, along with the boardwalks and pools that weaved through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Felicia, her lifetime as a ruler was fighting tooth and nail to keep up a stoic look, but even with a face only made up of two black eyes and a set of pincers, I could still smile from seeing a wave of awe splash across by the way her eyes shone and antennae buckled. \"<i>This</i> is indoors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around here, it's as close as we can get to being outside.

Once the doors shifted open, Hailey and Niki ran back to their respective work stations and crawled their way underneath both breasts. With one push up, they pushed the ridiculous weights on their backs up enough for them to grab up from behind, and rise in tune with their ruler as she got up from her seat, all of them walking towards the station. Their surprise didn't end as they got out into the fresh air, eyes widening at the feeling of the warm air hitting their fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be able to show you all around, as said, but I'd be more than welcome for any stops you'd all like to make!\"</span></div></div>",

Most guests just call him 'servant boy' or 'human', but this one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...its Gregory, miss Felicia\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gregory...\" Felicia said practically sounding out the words. Felicia sounded a lot more tired now, her body was going at the same place as Greg, which was slow for an anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, your majesty?\" Hailey asked under her right boob.\" I'm usually not the one to complain, but...\" She took a couple of seconds to catch her breath,\"Your mammeries are a bit heavier than usual. You aren't leaning into them, are you... Your magesty?\". Felicia didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg tried too look past her massively sized boobs, and unresponsive guest sometimes means a health problem. Felicia was far from sick tom his perspective however. She had a large, happy smile. Her eyes were closed from pure ecstasy. Greg blushed madly,' Felicia must be trying really hard to be cute, three no way she's-' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrrrrrr\" Felicia suddenly moaned in pure happiness and stopped moving.

She took off her crown and dropped it to the sand, shaking her head so that her hair loosened out, her bangs falling in front of her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright, miss Comelo?\" I asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, my name's Felicia...\" She slowly corrected, a slight purr coming from her throat. \"And I'm quite fine, since you ask.

She kept a weary look as she pulled up a large armful of its flesh and let it drop again, getting a feel for how it jiggled in place for quite some time after. She reached behind her back and tried to adjust her swimsuit, and it was then that I noticed the strap seemed tighter, and that the cups digging deeper into the vast tracts of furry flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gregory...do you think my breasts have grown?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can't really say, miss...\" I answered, my cheeks warming up with blush.

She crossed her legs, one over the other, while she rested her head in her elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little rub would be nice.\" She teased, her voice loud and clear despite the sheer weight on her body. \"I give you my full permission to sit on my legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...a massage?\" I replied, forgetting to be immediate with my response. \"I mean...yes, Felicia, I wouldn't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia reared her head back, looking like the most content bee in existence as I came down over to her lap and sat on her legs, readying my hands and mind to make physical contact. I'd massaged many a woman in many other obscure places, mind you, but the biggest difficulty to overcome was seeing the classy woman who stepped on the beach first make such a quick turn in the opposite direction, particularly as she bit her lip as my I lowered my palms down and brushed them against her fur. Her legs bent up as I pressed down into the vast, supple oceans of mass that she carried upon her chest, feeling so plush that I was almost tempted to rest my head in them to see how comfy they were, but I focused my mind on all the possible outcomes to fight off the urge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmn...\" Felicia moaned, biting her lip as she hugged either side of her own breast. \"That feels <i>amazing! </i>Keep it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Felicia.\" I answered obediently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then proceeded to knead their surface like dough, and the way they squished under the elbow grease felt pretty dang close, only with more of a firm tenderness to them, with all their paunch churning about like jello from the motions being applied. Felicia hugged herself even tighter, and the bikini constantly seemed like it was seconds away from snapping apart through the rest of the massage, her face unable to emote the sheer level of ecstasy she was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, more!\" She insisted. \"Don't you<i> dare</i> give out on me any time soon!\"</span></div></div>",

You and I both know people you and my size's can get LOST in breasts so big here.\" Felicia winked. It was true, although you couldn't really say that they were the biggest you have ever seen, Ms. Holmes comes immediately to mind, but in comparison to the size of their own body, Felicia's were absolute wreaking balls to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short Monorail trip back to the beach from the Diamond mines later, the young queen's yellow and black fur was greeted by the pleasant morning sun, the pool being completely full as was every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to Gertrude\u2019s hut to grab a radio, taking it out of the hut, only to put it on a table nearby Felicia, Miki, and Hailey so they could enjoy some music while they was swimming about, turning it on and scrolling through the local stations, eventually settling on a jazz channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiki and Hailey soon got out from under Felicia's breats, letting them flop down onto the soft, warm sand, Felicia already having pulled the straps back onto her own shoulders to contain her 'little' breasts.

A significant amount of the caverns were bathed in shadow, despite a line of small bulbs glowing along the roof, but enough light came free to see all the intricate networks of the mall from the signs and windows of shops, salons, or restaurants that seemed to spout from inside the walls like gems hidden underground, shining with either the sterile white walls of overly modernized shopping boutiques or colorful neon displays from the more lustful or stylishly dingy hideaways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minecart's tracks needled straight through the center of the tunnel on wooden supports, with switches occasionally curving off the main line to stop in front of some of the mall's strips. Without a warning, Katrina silently hit a button on the control panel only a second before our stop's route came up, and I was jarred around slightly without a chance to brace myself as we swerved onto the other track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh, sorry about that.\" She said quietly, noticing me rock around in my seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. We're coming up close, though, so get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, and her hand went for the brake valve, this time pulling it gently to let our speed slowly dwindle. I could see my stop coming from a vertical sign hanging over the door, and by the time we'd made it to the walkway, Katrina'd slowed us down enough that she could come to smooth, yet complete stop, opening the doorway with a flick of the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. See you around!\" I beckoned as I stepped onto the earthen walkway, and she nodded back before shutting the hatch behind me, her attention turning back on the track ahead as she set off. I watched her travel away for some seconds before looking ahead myself, walking towards the doorway of...</span></div></div>",

I had to jump and reach to get my fingers to grab the handle, using every muscle in my body to push it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls built around the shop had all the grunge of a boxing pub, nailed together by weathered wood with paintings, ink sketches, or even more neon displays of common body decals hanging over the upper walkway, but they all still caged in the pep of a beauty salon with seven crisp red beauty chairs standing along the center of the room, each one facing a round beauty mirror lit by a bulb at the top of each arch. A faint buzzing sound could be heard that came from the front desk, which sat straight ahead between the door and a large, colorful mass sitting just behind, its sides pouring well free of either end of the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma'd long been staring at the door since it'd began creaking open, but her pre-grumpy face fell just a little bit more when she saw my head come through. \"She sent <i>you</i> down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And may good morrow and fortune approach you on your daily endeavors as well, Miss Krueger.\" I remarked as I squeezed through, letting the door shut on its own behind me. \"I assure you, your accommodations are more than appreciated, and shan't be taken in vain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe edges of her mouth tensed in a soft growl, but then she put down the needles she'd been inspecting and pushed up off the counter with a grunt, slowly rising up off the two super-reinforced metal chairs that both kept her enormous buttocks afloat. Slowly, she rose up, up, up, and <i>up</i>, nearly doubling up in size until she was at a height big enough to bare her teeth down at roof of a house, and right now, she'd ungritted them to leer down on me. Even with those rare guests and workers alike that'd push their births and heights to the absolute extreme limits of what the resort could stretch around, Velma was still one with a body impossible not to pull in the eyes of anybody going by, particularly below her blubber-swaddled face, or anywhere else wherever her belly was laying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever part of her that wasn't dyed or needled with gallons of ink was left a pure white, which pretty much constituted everything along and above a pair of massive breasts using all their might to try and rip the black t-shirt she was wearing in half, but all that sat just under was a vast canvas of rich colors and linework. Even up close, every strand of fur was painted into a photorealistic scene of an armored Pegasus whose teeth were bared as she grappled with a snarling gryphon, standing before a coliseum flooded by a screaming audience of thousands, and the amount of ripe detail put in all the wrinkles or shadows on their expressions almost gave the illusion that the stomach it was all printed on was some massive crystal ball that perpetually was perpetually denting the floorboards of the ground in front of her, even if an occasional jiggle along the gloss shaved off that image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snapped her claws a few times, pulling me out from my staring. \"Well, <i>I've</i> got a customer, and I sure as hell know that <i>I'm</i> not gonna be receiving any complaints tonight. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm hmm.\" I nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Just relaying the facts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hind paw came down on a button on the ground, activating a loud, motorized whir below us that tugged all the beauty chairs back towards the wall behind her. With the entire front half of the room clear, the path was open for a very lare panel in the wall at the very end to jut in and slide away, and from the shadows inside, a leviathan' s version of the seats rolled into its position at the very center of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...Who the he'll are we <i>serving,</i> Godzilla?\" I asked as she tested the cherry picker's control, which she unfolded from the back cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno. A ninety-footer, if I remember right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah, great...</i> Hearing the scales from Velma was pretty much hearing the percent chance of having a bad day with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and it was coming soon. From somewhere outside, we both suddenly heard a heavy quake rumble through the floorboards and hanging decorations in the parlor, followed by a trailer of softer, but still loud and ominous set of footsteps trudging toward the door. Each of us went back to our spots, me going up into the cherry picker and undergoing to the front desk to prepare her own needles, and we both tried to brush around, trying  look in the midst of our work as the door cracked open again...</span></div></div>",

At around 90' in height, she was humongously obese in almost every way, with rolls of fat all around, from her huge double chin down to her extremely wide hips, which were at least the size of a big house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the biggest part of her body was her insanely huge breasts, which reached down to her knees. They were so massive that I wondered how the girl was even able to move them. After looking around for a bit, I saw that the breasts were being held by two big chairs, which had wheels which allowed the girl to move easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of looking at the vulture girl, she finally spoke. \"Ugh, this place looks so cheap compared to the rest of this place. Either way, names Varia, Varia Estille. I need some branding done on my hips, and if you don't do a good job, then don't expect even a small tip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh, not another person like you. Well anyway, just sit over here, and we can get you branded after finishing our set-up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, I guided Varia to her seat, which was a very hard task since she could barely even see me due to our size difference. After a few more minutes of set-up, Velma and I got to work on Varia's branding. The design she chose was a very complex design, as she wanted it to be a eastern dragon design covered in rose petals and having the logo of her parent's company on the brand tattoo as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the branding process, Varia was arguing about the design. She kept saying that the designs were \"too drab\", or \"too small on her body\". Because of this, Velma was starting to get grumpy, and I was worried she might let loose her anger on me once we were done with the vulture girl's branding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we were done applying the brand design on Varia's hips...</span></div></div>",

The front doors of the shop were arranged in 8 sizes for each size of the guests, and luckily the smallest door was around my height, which made it easy for me to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe insides of the shop were mostly modern with various posters of various fashion companies, both old and new. There were also various displays that were holding Octavia's latest dresses and clothes of all sizes, which ranged from being styled after clothes from the Renaissance to very modern and hip clothes. After a few minutes of waiting for Octavia to come, I heard the distinct wheels of Octavia's personal water tank drive up close to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Gregory, it's real nice to see you!\" Octavia said, using her remote to control the arms on her water tank to give me a good and firm hug. Octavia, like most of the other aquatic Anthros, needed water to live, so she uses a mobile water tank to move around. Her pink-colored 16' body was almost as wide as she was tall, and her huge breasts and thick hips (which took the form of 6 thick tentacles), gave her a thick hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Octavia\" I said to Octavia in a friendly tone. \"So what do you need me to do for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's a simple and easy job today.\" Octavia said, smiling as she was looking at the list of clients she had today. \"I just need help measuring somebody today. Normally I just use a measuring tool to measure the dimensions for my clients, but since its being repaired today I need someone to help me with keeping record as I measure today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that seems simple enough\" I responded, relieved that I was going to have it easy today. \"Do you know the person we have to measure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well on my list it says her name is...\"</span></div></div>",

The one halfway down the stack was cracked open, and Octavia and I gave a bow as we both heard a <i>lot</i> of legs scuttle in along the hardwood floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...it's a pleasure to be of your service, miss Teverton.\" Octavia greeted before we'd even looked back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we laid eyes on who'd came in first, however, it wasn't nearly as familiar as the face and name of one of the world's biggest companies. She wasn't even half as tall, only coming in at halfway the height of the door being help open for her, but the family resemblance was still plain to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, without buckling under her weight, the six legs of her more arachnid half kept her body afloat despite two enormously wide globes persistently floating in the air in front of her torso, which she vainly tried to push down with her arms as they sat crammed inside a super-stretchy brown hoodie. Within its hood, I could make out six bright red eyes sitting above a fanged mouth that was nervously pursed as she saw us and glanced around the boutique, brushing a lock of long, raven-like hair from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Carla came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinier spider side-stepped away from the door, and in trudged a face that couldn't not be seen within ten feet of any electronics store in the world. The door was much more befitting for her height, even though each of the lowest of her heaping lovehandles scraped along the edge of the frame and visibly bobbed loose once she's cleared through. For Carla, her entire body was nothing but thousands of pounds of fat, enormous mass; even her legs were swollen to several feet thick at the very ends, their girths actually bloating larger the farther back they were. Unlike her daughter, though, they couldn't sustain the strength to carry her entire weight and could only push her along the ground like oars rowing a boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerched on top of two very thick, hanging chins, her overfed face was filled with the amount of pride only a mother could gather up as she pushed her stomach along the ground, which greedily sprawled out in front of her in a towering spherical mass that, although packed within a shiny exoskeleton, still wobbled as though it were a black water balloon the size of a house. Her breasts sat comfortably on top and, even if it was only a close finish, were fatter and wider than \"Gwen's\", with plenty of surface and cleavage allowed to be seen by the collar of a red dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she came into the light from the shadows of the diamond mine's caverns, Octavia and I were both silently amazed as her thorax was dragged in, which piled in so tall that its very dome loomed just under the line of her silver hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I take it that you're the well-known 'Octavia' around these parts, hmm?\" She asked as she smiled down at Octavia, who quickly nodded with a deep blush. She then turned to me. \"...and who's your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gregory, miss.\" The two of us said simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a chuff. \"Well, considering what sense of style and luxor I'd seen nothing less of by your <i>wonderful</i> choice of job's space, I'd been hoping the two of you could've tailored me and my daughter hear a few dresses. Is that wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Of course, Miss Teverton!\" Octavia blurted before I could speak, bowing again. \"The two of us would <i>gladly </i>set you and your daughter up with any taste of your choice! care to look around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lead me the way!\" She nodded enthusiastically, motioning for Gwen to follow with a hand. \"Follow me, dear. Keep your eyes peeled for designs, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia wheeled her Tank around and drove down the other way towards the store's measuring section, and I scampered off after her, followed by sound of Carla's heavy body dragging the entire way, and Gwen's humble scuttling just a short distance behind...</span></div></div>",

I head to the counter to pick up a measuring tape. \"Now, Ms. Teverton, I'm going to need you to remove your hoodie so I can take a proper measurement.\" I tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen stays silent, and is looking off in another direction. She's still trying to make her breasts look smaller. \"Ms. Teverton?\" I ask. \"Did you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen finally looks at me. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I can't.</font>\" She says in a very quiet voice. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I don't... want you to see.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" I ask, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">My... chest.</font>\" She says.

Gwen keeps shifting slightly, clearly uncomfortable with me. I try my best to calm her down, but she keeps fidgeting. Finally, I'm able to get a good measurement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I'm shocked by it. According to the measuring tape, Gwen's bust was 23 feet wide. That was actually bigger then Felicia Comelo's. I'm surprised they aren't ripping her hoodie or making her immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I don't say anything as I continue to measure the rest of Gwen. It was clear that she was embarrassed by her breasts. She continued to fidget as I measured, but I was eventually able to finish the measurements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got back on the floor, Carla and Octavia come over. Carla looked happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Gwen, time to look for some fabrics for our dresses.\" She said. \"And please, try to pick some bright colors this time. I'd like for you to at least try to stand out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded slightly and scurried off. Carla looked at her and frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about Gwen. She's painfully shy and embarrassed of her breasts. I brought her with me so she could try to be more outgoing, but...\" Carla said. She then looked at me. \"Mr. Gregory, what are duties here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a number of jobs here, Ms. Teverton. Cook, blackjack dealer, lifeguard...\" I explain, listing off my duties, which takes about 5 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I finished, Carla smiled. \"Quite a varied career.\" She said. \"Do you mind if you come with me and my daughter for the day? You seem like such a nice man, and you could be a friend to Gwen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at her in amazement. Me, spending a day with Carla and Gwen? That would be amazing. But would Octavia be fine with me leaving for the day?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I took the seat next to her (or, at least, the half left of the seat that her breasts overlapped with,) and I could barely notice her try to hone in on her book a little more, eyes starting to worry up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina pulled the door shut, and switched on a key that started the motor up in a deep, constant buzz, sending rippled through Charla's belly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to, Miss Teverton?\" She called over the hum.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Take us to the food court if you would, please?\u201d Charla said. \u201cAlright then, to the food court it is!\u201d Katrina Exclaimed. As the carts began moving you couldn\u2019t help but noticed that Gwen has had a bit of a winced look on her face after her mother mentioned the words \u201cfood\u201d and \u201ccourt\u201d. Given Charla\u2019s size it\u2019s not hard to see why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the mine carts came to a stop the three left their seats and made their way to the large array food chains, each varying in style. While Charla looked eager to get her chow on her daughter seemed a little unsure about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everything alright dear?\u201d Charla asked, noticing her daughter acting a little off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\u201cO-oh I\u2019m fine. I just... need to use the restroom first.\u201d</font></font> Gwen said coyly as she quickly wandered off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed Charla sighed as her daughter left us to ourselves. \u201cIs something the matter miss Teverton?\u201d I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Gwen. She always like this when we come to the food court\u201d. Charla\u2019s tone wasn\u2019t the more up beat one I was used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can see why. There are a lot of people here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that.\u201d \u201cShe may not look it but she has her mothers appetite\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe does?\u201d I gave Charla a quizzical look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bold statement I know but it\u2019s true. The poor girl never eats enough to truly satisfy herself in fear of putting on any weight. She\u2019s already embarrassed by the size of her breasts and the attention they bring, so the thought of any part of her getting any bigger is unbearable to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this I felt bad for Gwen. The poor girl was nearly starving herself to keep people\u2019s attention off her. \u201cWow... that really sucks. I wish I could help make her feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharla paused for a moment, then her expression brightened up as she looked at me eagerly. \u201cPerhaps you could!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could?\u201d I looked back at her wondering what she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you could! She never lets anybody she\u2019s not familiar with see her without her chest covered. But you managed to get her to let you measure her didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel unsure about how I would accomplish such a task. Getting someone to actively put on weight seemed like something I wasn\u2019t sure I could accomplish \u201cI suppose, but I\u2019m not the most-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I was about to interject Charla had cut me off as Gwen had returned. \u201cGwen darling! You certainly kept us waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\u201cM-my apologies, I simply...\u201d</font></font> Gwen\u2019s quite talk had trailed of into a mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter honey. I have good news! You new friend has just picked out a new place for you to regularly eat and interact with other people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\u201cH-he did!?\u201d</font></font> Gwen was surprised by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did!?\u201d I say, also unaware of what her mother was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right! Go on, show her the place you picked out for her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s... um... I...\u201d Charla was really putting me on the spot here! I desperately looked around for a place to help me go along with her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first restaurant that caught my eye was called \u201cThe Bakery Blend\u201d. A quiet little coffee shop that also provides fresh baked goods. There\u2019s free WiFi, plentiful deserts and friendly faces all around. Not exactly the place to fatten somebody up but it would definitely give Gwen a place to read while also getting her steadily become more comfortable interacting with people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second restaurant was called \u201cGreasy\u2019s Buffet\u201d. It seemed to be a cross between an all-you-can-eat buffet and a fast food joint. The food on the signs feature oversized, sloppily put together fast food hybrids, their signature being \u201cthe pizza burger\u201d. Just looking in its direction alone allowed me to smell the fried grease it no doubt coated the food there, this definitely wasn\u2019t Gwen\u2019s scene. Making her a regular here might be a bit of an extreme solution, but if Charla wants results...</span></div></div>",

So to the casino if you'd be so kind.\" Charla said sweetly. \"Will do, Miss Teverton!\" Katrina exclaimed before accelerating a bit. The sudden jolt of movement caught Greg off guard for a moment, but he soon regained his composure. With that the trio was off to the casino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip took about 10 minutes to get there, Katrina stopped in front of the enterance. \"Fate's hand casino, last call, Drop off to Fate's hand casino.\" The driver up front tells the three that they stopped. They exit the carts and head inside. Various noises of Jackpots from machines, excited shouts from the tables, as well as a few disappointed grunts filled the ears of our trio as they trekked to the receptionist. Gwen was very embarrassed from walking through a bunch of people. She holds her chest as close as she could. Greg took notice but didn't bring attention to it yet. Charla skitters over and waits at the desk for the receptionist to notice her. \"Hello, how may I help you?\" The receptionist asked politely. She was a Jackal anthro that was the same height as Charla. She was tapping away on the computer in front of her, not breaking any focus with the screen. \"Yes, I'd like to have my keys to my room.\" \"First and last name please.\" \"Charla Teverton.\" \"Okay, Miss Teverton, I have you booked for a two bedroom suite on the top floor. Room 708. And here are your keys.\" The jackal handed Charla her key, still not breaking focus. \"Okay. Come Gwen.\" Charla leads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe cut the the inside of an empty room. The door's handle jiggling and rattling by forces on the other side. With a click and a turn, the door opens and the spider woman enters, her daughter soon following with Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Greg, get yourself comfortable. We'd like to--\" Charla was interrupted by a catchy tune and vibrating coming from her cleavage. \"Oh darn, hold on I need to go out and take this. Can't even have some time with my daughter.\" Charla grumbled. \"But please, don't wait for me. Get to know one another.\" The spider woman said before exiting the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stood an awkward silence between the human and spider girl for a moment before Greg spoke up. \"Sooo... you like to read?\" Greg asked, not really sure how to start. \"Uhm... yes...\" she shyly replied. Greg wanted to keep it going but couldn't find much to say to Gwen. \"Please don't stare.\" Gwen says out of the blue. \"I uh... okay then.\" The human just agrees. Gwen was fidgeting in place as her breathing got a bit heavier as well as sweat a bit. \"You don't need a jacket in here, it's quite warn in here.\" Greg spoke. \"That's not the problem...\" Gwen held herself, looking away downward away from the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I mean.. they should be fine I bet that they... look... lovely?\" He spoke not sure what to say. \"But they're just... so... big. People stare at them and I don't like the attention.\" \"I promise I won't stare. I'm worried that you'll get too hot under there.\" Gwen loosened up a little bit. \"You mean it?\" Gwen looks at Greg. \"Absolutely.\" Gwen reluctantly grabbed her zipper and pulled it down. It went down about a quarter of the way before it got stuck. \"Come on!\" Gwen quietly shouts, playing with the zipper. \"Would you like me to help?\" Greg offered. \"Mmhmm...\" Gwen nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller person approached Gwen. \"I'll need a bit of a lift.\" The spider girl lowered both of her hands. Greg hopped on as let Gwen lifted him up. The human got a clear view of whatever cleavage was exposed. '<i>Yeesh, she wasn't kidding. They are big.</i>' Greg thought to himself. He looked away, doing his best to keep his promise. He grabs the zipper and yanks it down. The zipper didn't budge. \"Okay then.\" He said before yanking it again. The zipper sped down her jacket. A bit faster than Greg expected as he went diving into Gwen's rack. His lower body sticking out and upper body lodged between the two mounds. Gwen was shocked and let out tiny gasps. Eyes widened and mouth gaping open from shock. This was one of the things that she didn't want to happen. She was on the verge of screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n........</span></div></div>",

It was one of those clean and modern joints, decorated with the same kind of treatment you'd find in some sort of home gadgetry store, only the stands and shelves were lined with the fixings of a spy movie when you stepped in through the front doors. Ads stood at the aisles for night vision contact lenses or flesh-tone bulletproof vests, and when you walked past, you'd see wall to wall stacks of boxes that were casually labeled for blades designed to shoot out of your sleeves, stun guns disguised to blend with your palms, wallets rigged with knockout darts, and even chewing gum that doubled as smoke screens, all given the same courtesy as lame kitchenware you'd see on an infomercial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...and let's say you're </i>not<i> in the amazon! Let's say you're in the alleys of city, open to every knife and junkie itching to stab and steal!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand...Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading towards her voice, I cleared past the corner to see a great big wall of dragon ass standing just two aisles away, firmly wedged between the shelves at either side of the walkway. A tail with bright yellow scales sprouted over the crack between the two great globes of her tremendous behind, sitting upon legs so massive that her clawed feet were just dainty little appendages poking out from underneath the indescribable weight of the scaly flesh resting above. All of which was padded by a super-sized pair of workpants that was nonetheless very snug around the joints, whilst the body above was only moderately (albeit unyieldingly) obese, her white dress shirt clearly conforming around the folds of her back beneath a head of very long, silver hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's how it always goes!\" She continued. \"You're walking home from the movie theater, all alone, maybe mom decides it's not the biggest risk to go down that one alleyway! Well, you go through, and so far, so good, it looks like you're just about in the clear, the exit is in sight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kelly, Miss Holmes said you needed some help wi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and <b><i>WHAMMO!!!</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one swift motion, Kelly's dislodged her butt from its prison as she spun around to face me, the tip of her tail coming pretty damn close to lobbing my head off as it swung past. I leapt back, landing assfirst on the floor, but Kelly didn't give me a chance to breath before she tossed a toy chainsaw up in the air and onto my lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever the threat of many a street on the city, a <i>chainsaw killer</i> leaps out into the open,<i> wearing the face of his dead cellmate!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...huh?\" I gurgled out, the crowd murmuring to one another in surprised whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly stared at me through a brief pause, then gestured to me with a hurried look. \"He's screaming! The sound of the chainsaw fills your ears, spreading sheer panic through your system!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up, the chainsaw falling off my lap. \"Kelly, what the hell is going on!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's <i>going insane!</i>\" Kelly gritted out. \"He's scaring us! People's lives are in danger here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Looking down at the chainsaw, I bent over and picked it back up, shakily pointing it at Kelly's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's snarling like an animal!\" Kelly describes, getting more exasperated with each sentence. \"Heck, if he weren't a chainsaw killer, then he'd be <i>an actor great enough to get into Gaia 2.0!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh....hraaaargh!!! SNRRRK!!!!\" I growled, forcing out an animalistic grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's absolutely off his rocker! I can barely think over his screaming and the chainsaw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SNYRAAAAAARGH!!!! HUUUUUUUURRRRKKKK!!!\" I gnashed as loudly as I could, and more or less had a mental breakdown with the chainsaw, madly swinging it around by the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Kelly seemed satisfied as I madly danced around with the chainsaw, and smile back at her audience. \"...and as I've covered in my book, 'Death by Nature: Survival in the Jungles of Tree and Concrete,' I'd covered multiple means of disabling a man with a chainsaw, but if you were in a pinch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Kelly swiftly spun around and swung her tail at me, and this time connected it with its target. The plastic chainsaw was totally obliterated, and my hand came pretty damn close to joining the shower of broken pieces that were thrown all over the floor at my side, leaving me startled and unarmed, right in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and now that he is unarmed,\" Kelly continued, her fingers reaching into a pocket that was severely overstretched along her backside. After a moment's search, she drew her hand out and pointed its contents right at me, being a white plastic gun with a clear red visor over the barrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, what the hell is <i>that?!</i>\" I stammered, holding both hands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you have a number of ways to further disable him, to ensure he never brings harm to another moviegoing family, but today, I'd like to demonstrate for your viewing eyes, fresh on the shelves...\"</span></div></div>",

Plastic or not, I know what a gun's safety sounds like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd watching our little show wasn't impressed. \"But he's, like, a <i>human</i>,\" a slim alligator woman put in. \"He's already tiny. What's the point of making him smaller; you can just step on him already.\" The crowd chuckled at that, Kelly rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this can just make it easier. Besides, you never know what a crazy chainsaw killer might pull...maybe even something that could take down an Anthro. Ever heard of the Moscow Tripper?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Gator and several Anthros in the audience winced at that. I was, of course, clueless--had there been some suicidal Russki tripping Anthros I was unaware of? I gave the guy/girl a week before they were caught and eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, see? It isn't that easy! And what if you <i>aren't</i> facing a human attacker, but an anthro assailant? Can you  'just step on them' then? No, you can't. That's what the K-Shrink is for!

Her clawed feet were  now big as semi trucks, and her plump belly and cleavage jutted out do far--from my ant's perspective--that her face was hidden. I'd dealt with gigantic anthros before, but THIS? This was in a whole new league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"See, ladies and gents? The chainsaw killer is no threat! Now he's the size of a dust molt, even WITH his chainsaw he'd pose no threat to you and your moviegoing family,\"</i> Kelly thundered from above, proudly waving her shrink gun around. I risked a look  past her and found I couldn't see the audience. I was so small that they were blocked by the counter, which now looked like a skyscraper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrist, just how small <i>was</i> I?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience applauded, clamoring to buy a K-Shrink of their own. Kelly, soaking in the praise, held up her clawed hands. <i>\"Calm down, folks;<br>\r\n there's plenty to go around...but wait, what's this? It seems our chainsaw killer is stubborn!

She winked at them, then looked down at me, over her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Greg...\" she whispered. \"But it's part of my sales pitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, before I could protest, she...</span></div></div>",

I experienced a sense of vertigo as she lifted me off the ground and over her head, paying no mind to the discomfort such treatment was causing me. If looking up at her like a mote of dust on the ground was terrifying, that was nothing compared to being suspended by a living mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd just like to mention that the K-Shrink only shrinks its targets. No need to worry about harmful radiation. Your would-be attacker is completely safe to eat as a tiny-treat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EAT?!\" I cried out in terror. My voice was so squeaky I didn't even know if Kelly heard me or not. If she did, she didn't feel guilty enough to look ashamed. \"In fact, the shrinking process condenses a person's natural flavor making them tastier than ever before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of me held out hope that this was all just some elaborate fake out. That hope died when Kelly licked her lips and opened her jaws wide. I couldn't even get out a plea before she dropped me. It was like freefalling out of an airplane without a parachute. The wind whipped at me, there was a roaring in my ears, and I was so scared, I threw dignity to the wind and even tried to flap my arms in the impossible hope to fly away from the hungry maw below me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI landed on her tongue with a splat. Kelly clamped her jaws shut, sealing me in darkness. I was winded from the fall and defenseless as she used her tongue to slam me against her cheek and sucked on me like a piece of candy. She made exaggerated chewing and moaning sounds as she worked me in her mouth. No doubt it was another strategy to convince anyone still on the fence about buying a K-Shrink. She spoke with her mouth full, and her voice was so loud to my ears it was almost deafening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see,\" Kelly said, slurping, \"the shrinking process condenses a person's natural flavor, making them tastier than they ever were at full-size! Some of you may scoff, but believe me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth, giving her audience a view of my battered, drool-soaked form. I tried to call out for help, but then her tongue rose, sending me sliding to the back of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... It's not hard to swallow,\" she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gulp, I was sent screaming down her throat. Kelly opened her mouth to show all trace of me was gone. I landed in her stomach and immediately spit out a mouthful of stomach acid. I could hear the wild applause outside her stomach. How nice to know my death was a nice show! Suddenly, the fleshy walls moved around me, and I was submerged beneath a wave of stomach acid as Kelly bowed for her adoring crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly went about her business for the next hour, selling so many K-Shrinks that she ran out and had to put the remaining customer requests on layaway. I wouldn't be surprised if dollar signs were in her eyes during her sale. When the last customer left, Kelly locked the door and hung up a sign in her store window saying, \"Out to Lunch.\" Her stomach made a gurgling noise and she burped into her hand. It was only then that she remembered me trapped in her stomach, even though I'd been begging her to let me out the entire hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, almost forgot about you, Greg. Maybe I don't need to go out to lunch after all.\" She patted her stomach, making everything rumble around me and I began cursing her out. Kelly giggled. \"Relax, I'm just teasing you. It's usually against my nature to give up a free lunch, but you were so helpful I'll make an exception. Hold on, this will be a bumpy ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around me the stomach began bubbling like in an enormous Jacuzzi. The walls of the stomach compressed and from beyond the fleshy chamber came ominous gurgling sounds. I felt pressure building up inside, like a can of soda ready to explode. The air began sucking at me and I was actually lifted out of the sea of stomach acid when-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!\" ;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly let loose with the loudest belch I've ever heard. The air whirled around me and picked me up like a tornado, sending me rocketing up the expanse of her throat and out of her mouth. I was terrified I'd plummet to the floor below but Kelly caught me as easily as when she'd grabbed me off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta-da!\" she said. \"Neat trick, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy ears were still ringing from the burp but I gave her a sarcastic thumb-up. \"Yeah, yeah, you're a freaking goddess among anthros. Now will you please just unshrink me so I can get back to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought I saw a look in Kelly's eyes, something that terrified me just as much as when she dropped me into her mouth. Maybe I was seeing things. It might've been nothing at all, but for a wild second I was terrified with the possibility that she might not be able to change me back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kelly opened her mouth she said...</span></div></div>",

It wasn't even gone when I ran out of breath, and I weakly flopped forward and faceplanted into her palm, tired, tiny, covered in spit, and screaming whatever energy I had left into her scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...maybe this'll add urgency to the patent!\" She offered, only the slightest bit hopeful. \"Maybe this'll help speed along the process, out of pity, or desperation?

Kelly was wedged in her seat and I was inside the glass jar she put me in, bouncing around it with every jostle of the cart on its tracts. I never knew how much I missed seatbelts. I still couldn't wrap my head around this. Five months. I'd be spending five months the size of a speck. And that was being optimistic! Maybe it'd take even longer for the enlargement device to be built, maybe the thing wouldn't work, or maybe I'd end up dead under some careless person's foot or inside their gut before the patent ever came through. It really felt like things couldn't get any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we travelled in awkward silence, I took in my surroundings. It took a few minutes before I realized the buildings didn't match what I expected, though that could've been because of my impaired view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly,\" I asked, \"where exactly do you live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why are you asking that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no reason, mostly. I was just a tiny bit curious about where I'd be living for the next five months,\" I said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly gave me a look like I was crazy. \"Greg, you're not living with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't be ridiculous. Look at you! You're so tiny and fragile. You need constant attention and specialized care. I can't give you that. I have a business to run, inventions to create, money to spend! I can't afford to waste time looking after you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These were probably things you should've thought of <i>BEFORE YOU SHRANK ME!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly ignored my outburst. \"Don't worry. I may be too busy to take care of you, but I'm leaving you in good hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" Kelly said evasively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did not sound reassuring. She looked away and ignored my pestering questions about where we were headed. A few minutes later, the cart turned down a track and came to a stop. Kelly got out and carried me with her. It was around now that I got a clear view of my surroundings. Kelly stopped in front of a door and knocked. By then I'd recognized exactly where I was and knew exactly who Kelly was going to leave me with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

She treated me like an insect before I was the size of one! You can't leave me alone with her, she'll eat me alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're exaggerating,\" Kelly said. It was a bald-faced lie and she knew it. \"Besides, we both work for her. I can't keep something like this a secret from her. How do you think she'll react if you never show up for work for half a year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then make a phone call and tell her what happened, don't plop me on her lap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't think a phone call would do it... See, I kinda, sorta, maybe, somewhat got in a bit of trouble before for testing my devices on employees without her permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes. \"Why am I not surprised?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Ms. Holmes wasn't too happy with me. She actually threatened to fire me. Guess we're lucky I wasn't testing out my disintegration ray this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOUR <i>WHAT?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" she said quickly, \"I think this situation is delicate enough that I need to explain what happened face-to-face. And you should stop worrying. Ms. Holmes is a professional. I'm positive she'll find a new position for you befitting your... stature...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Really? A short joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly ignored me and buzzed the intercom to Ms. Holmes's \"office.\" The speaker crackled before we heard our boss's southern drawl, \"Who's there?\" Her voice was muffled. It sounded like she was in the middle of eating something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Kelly, Ms. Holmes. And Greg too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddya two want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's... been kind of an accident at my store. Um, it's easier to show you than to explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Holmes groaned, unhappy that her post-lunch pre-dinner meal was being interrupted. \"Fine. Come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe buzzed us in. The way Kelly was entering Ms. Holmes's office was the employee entrance. The actual entrance was over ten times as large. While a lot of anthros towered over humans, some were literal giants. Ms. Holmes was one of those. Her \"office\" doubled as her apartment and bedroom. It wasn't the fanciest room in all of Gaia, but it was the one decorated exactly to its residents tastes. Ms. Holmes was from down South and she decorated her room with mementos from her childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gigantic bed occupied most of the room. Ms. Holmes lounged on it, a swivel desk built into the wall beside her. The desk and one of the end tables were both covered in paperwork that Ms. Holmes was filing out with one hand. With the other she was reaching into a bowl of chocolate-covered strawberries and shoveling fistfuls into her mouth. When she polished off the bowl, she'd push a button, and a metal chute would send a cascade of them tumbling down to refill her. I knew that the chute also sent down different foods depending on what she selected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt over 65 feet tall, Ms. Holmes was the biggest anthro I'd ever seen before getting a job at Gaia. She was always fat but at my current size, the cow looked like a mountain of blubber to me. She was covered in bronze fur and she had golden hair tied in a long braid. She wore a light yellow, sleeveless sundress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya said Greg was with y'all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly walked towards the boss even though she looked scared out of her wits. I could see the sweat on Kelly's palms as she held the jar I was in and hoped she wouldn't drop me. She was usually so confident that it was weird to see her cowering before her planetary-sized boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um, yes mam. Greg is... right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up the jar and Ms. Holmes squinted at the speck inside. It took her a few seconds to figure out the speck was me. She swore loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fer the love of--What did ya do this time ya dumb lizard? Were y'all experimenting on tha employees again? I warned ya what would happen if--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg shrunk himself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" I screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly muttered out of the corner of her mouth something only I could hear. \"Sorry Greg, change of plans. I'm going to need you to take the fall for me on this. Thanks, appreciate it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't get a word out edgewise before Kelly launched into her new act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to stop him, boss! I told him not to go fiddling with my K-Shrink. I told him it was a prototype and that I had no way of changing him back until I could start working on my growth ray! I don't think he was paying attention. Please don't be too mad at him. It was only an accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Holmes! Don't believe a word of what she says!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately my tiny squeaks couldn't reach Ms. Holmes's ears. The colossal cow rolled her eyes like it was just so typical of me to get myself shrunk to the size of a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Greg! How dumb can ya be? It's a miracle a dim bulb like you could survive this long. How long will it take ya to make your growth ray, Kelly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Realistically? Five months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Holmes growled. \"That's just great. Give him here, Kelly. I need to figure out what's to be done with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, boss!\" Kelly said. To me she whispered, \"Thanks for taking the fall for this one, Greg. I owe you one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I will murder you, lizard.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly dropped my glass prison into Ms. Holmes's gigantic hand. The jar was the size of the top of her thumb, and I was even smaller than that. The wyvern who got me into this mess turned-tail and ran back through the employee entrance. Ms. Holmes inspected me in my jar. Her pupil was as big as me. She did not look happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ya finally gone and did it, didn't cha Greg? Finally got yourself in a pickle ya can't get out of. Just what am I supposed to do with ya? There's no place in Gaia I can send ya where ya can do a halfway decent job. Not that ya could do one even when ya weren't tiny. Honestly. Y'all are more trouble than you're worth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pleaded with her, trying to tell her my side of the story, but I don't think she could hear anything but pathetic squeaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I paid for months of trainin' for ya, and now you're too small ta do any of the thangs I hired ya for. And now I'm supposed ta wait half a year before ya can even work again? I'd have ta keep ya on me at all times just so ya don't end up dead. But why should I be nice when it's you're own stupidity that got ya in this mess. I should just save myself a heap of trouble and get rid of ya right now... Yeah... Maybe I should... It is lunch time after all. Even if y'all wouldn't even be a mouthful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped. It looked like this really might be the end. Ms. Holmes threatened me all the time but she'd kept me around because I could actually do my job. Now that she considered me completely useless, she might be serious about finishing me off after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) The Boss's Assistant - Ms. Holmes spares Greg but in exchange for keeping him alive, she has him work as her personal assistant and whatever possible terrors that involves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Employee Termination - Ms. Holmes decides Greg's too much of a hassle at his current size and disposes of him in some way.</span></div></div>",

Like an idiot, I flailed my arms about in the hope that I would somehow steer myself away from the gaping maw rushing up at me...it got me nothing but an eye-roll from Miss Holmes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Plop!*</i> I faceplanted on Hiss Holmes' tongue, getting a face full of cow slobber just as her jaws clamped shut, sealing me in darkness. Her mouth started watering almost immediately, and before I could even sit up I was taken by a current of spit, slammed about her maw as she swished me around like a breath mint. I almost broke my legs on her teeth more than once, and nearly suffocated when she pressed her tongue--and me--against the roof of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mut baff\", she mumbled without opening her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not bad</i>, she meant. Miss Holmes ate humans who annoyed her: she'd told me that point-blank once, said she'd done it since she was a calf. Not as a threat, but simply a fact of life. If she wasn't hungry, she sat or stepped on them. But hearing that casual, businesslike mumble made it worse. Most anthros viewed humans as delicious...but she acted like I was some cheap snack. Even all the swishing around seemed more out of habit than her playing with her tasty human meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was hit by a wave of vertigo as the world tilted...<i>backwards.</i> <br>\r\nAgain, like an idiot; I tried to grab onto her tongue, and the saliva made it too slippery, sending me sliding back towards her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Miss Holmes snort derisively at my futile efforts before I fell down a pit, and with one final earthshaking <i>*GULP!*</i> I was sent screaming down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidn't stop me from firing off one last hurrah, though.<br>\r\n\"KELLY DID IT, YOU OVERBEARING COW!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToronto sighed, tracing Greg's path down her throat with a finger until the tiny lump in her neck vanished into her rotund belly.

If Greg was going to screw up that badly, the LEAST the little human could do was be flavorful! He was so bland she'd almost spat him back out. \"Ain't ate a human in weeks and I just have to get a bland one...maybe I should keep a spice rack at my desk fer the next human I get to eat, Yeah, that's a mighty fine idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a mental note to do just that before refocusing on her work....and drafting a notice that Greg's poistion had opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fine, Greg; you asked fer it.\" She stepped off her bed and got to her feet, giving a crooked grin at her stomach. So her snack thought he could defy her? Well, he had another thing coming. Something Toronto's mother had taught her when she was a calf, the first time she'd eaten a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Tummy Two-Poke.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hand went to Toronto's navel, the other just below her chest. She couldn't supress a grin, and recited her mom's rhyme. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One hand down on yer belly button; one hand up top; poke 'em both...and the human is slop!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poked herself in both places...and let out a brief mooing cackle as her stomach did its work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world seemed to lurch. The stomach all around him convulsed and spasmed, knocking him off his feet--and sloshing the acid sea into a massive wave that towered over his makeshift raft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg knew he was done for. He could do nothing but let out an unholy scream as the tidal wave of acids capsized his strawberry raft...and plunged him into the depths to his fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and the strawberry sank vanished into the mire, leaving no trace but a spew of bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotonto smirked darkly, stroking her ample belly. She'd eaten enough humans to know when they'd fallen into the mire of acids within her stomachs. Their struggles felt...different. More frantic and desperate, than a snack who had found a safe haven: even the tougher humans, who could last for days otherwise, thrashed the same way when their time came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all it took to show feisty food its place was two quick pokes to her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works every time...thanks, Ma.\" Toronto mused, looking at her mother's photo on her desk. The older bovine had plenty of tricks for making sure a human digested properly--and they had always worked perfectly. Now that she thought about it, it <i>had</i> been a long time since she'd visited home; too long. Maybe she should go visit one weekend? Yes, definitely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin widened--Greg's struggles were already starting to fade. At his shrunken state, he'd be digested in no time, not even getting to her second stomach alive--no less than he deserved, after his screw-up. Even better, he wouldn't send her into a burping fit--that was a problem with eating humans full-size. Toronto made a mental note to ask Kelly for one of her shrinking gadgets--eating humans was <i>much</i> more fun when they were bite-sized! Maybe she could try sitting on them when they were shrunken...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToronto gave her stomach another pat, enjoying Greg's thrashes as digestion set in, and flopped back onto her bed, getting back to work as if nothing had happened. As she predicted, Greg's struggles weakened rapidly...and stopped for good less than an hour later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she had a proper lunch, she had already forgotten his name. <br>\r\nAfter all, he was only food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was dead, I was beyond dead, I had driven twenty miles past the border of dead, built a house and become the Mayor of Deadtown, that's how dead I was. I said my prayers as Holmes stuck her giant pink tongue out to intercept me. Her tongue gave me a lick like a lollipop and I cringed as her drool soaked through my clothes. Her breath stank of chocolate and strawberries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when I was certain my life was over, Ms. Holmes pulled me away sharply from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing?\" she asked herself. \"I can't eatcha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god. Thank you, Ms. Holmes, I knew you wouldn't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'all taste terrible,\" she said as if I hadn't spoken. \"You're easily the worst tastin' human I've ever had. How can such awful flavor stand out in such a small body? I give you one last job, to be a snack, and you couldn't even do that right? Pathetic.\" She shook her head. \"Ah well. Nothin' for it. Time for Plan B.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Plan B?\" I asked, terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plan B-HIND that is!\" Ms. Holmes lifted her ass and smacked a cheek, cackling at her own joke. Again I screamed and begged for mercy, but Ms. Holmes had none. She positioned me behind her raised cheek and dropped me on the bed. The mattress had been worn down into a permanent indent under the weight of her colossal cheeks, causing me to slide down the slope and leaving me trapped in a crater. I gagged at the smell of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya gotta kiss a lot of ass to make it far in this business, Greg! So <i>pucker up!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Holmes let out another nasty laugh and lowered her cheek slowly. I tried to crawl out of the hole I was trapped in, but it was too steep and the sweat-stained fabric was too slippery. Her butt came down leisurely as Ms. Holmes eased herself back into the bed. She was enjoying this. I knew she didn't like me, I'd been threatened enough before to catch on, but I never realized how sadistic she was. My begging only made her giggle. Now the ass was inches away from me, like the moon falling from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MS. HOLMES, PLEAS--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe full weight of Ms. Holmes' butt enveloped me, the cellulite of one cheek spreading out like an ocean of flab. I couldn't move, couldn't breathe. I could only breathe in the scent of her sweat-soaked sundress. Ms. Holmes enjoyed herself immensely. Even though she couldn't feel me, just the knowledge that I was there, suffering underneath her, was enough for her. She wriggled her tush back and forth to get more comfortable. I couldn't even scream as the immense pressure bore down on me. It hurt. Everything hurt. I felt like an insect underneath a fingertip. A mountain of merciless fat was pressing down on me. It was unbearable. It--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CRUNCH</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Holmes hadn't been able to feel Greg beneath her, but she heard the crunching sound and felt the small pop like a grape bursting. She got up and pulled the backside of her dress around to confirm what she already knew. All that was left of Greg was a small red stain. Ms. Holmes let go of her dress and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well, best start the paperwork to replace him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Greg's time as an employee of Gaia 2.0 came to an end. Specifically, a cow's end.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll just be a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\u201cI said not to open the door!\u201d</i></b> She howled back, her voice nearing a shriek. <b><i>\u201cI\u2019m working on something really important right no-\u201d </i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly thrust her foot through the door and happily strutted into the parlor, taking route to where Velma was hunched over a customer, a confused-looking bat woman seated with her back inked up in colorful tattoos. I couldn\u2019t even see Velma\u2019s initial burst of anger while her maw was open and locked in terror, eyes jittering at an ugly-looking line she\u2019d permanently carved into her client by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-What\u2019s going on?\u201d The bat lady asked. \u201cIs the tattoo done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaw still agape, Velma\u2019s eyes widened, shooting between her, Kelly, and the tattoo, then faked a smile. \u201cNothing! Nothing at all.\u201d She insisted in a fake tone, fumbling with her equipment to find a set of headphones that she tenderly placed on the bat woman\u2019s ears. \u201cJust gotta...uh...refill my ink cartridges! Listen to some tunes, and I\u2019ll be back in a jiff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe customer\u2019s mouth furrowed in discomfort, but once Velma could see her head begging to bop to the beat of some muffled music, her facade turned to a snarl of rage as she spun to Kelly, pointing a claw at her. \u201cYou <i>better</i> tell me you\u2019ve invented the world\u2019s best tattoo remover before I reach over there and throttle you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, Kelly, it\u2019s been a Gaian winter since we\u2019ve last met!\u201d Kelly greeted, her tone implying she didn\u2019t even realize she wasn\u2019t the first to speak. \u201cHow\u2019s it been, you old dog?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only wish there were corners in the jar for me to hide into as the Velma stomped up to us, Kelly unfazed by the now-gargantuan wolf\u2019s fury. Even in a good (or, more specifically, \u2018not angry\u2019) mood, Velma was one of those women whose presence always carried this angry heat in the air that all directly around her could feel, something that extended beyond the height difference. Standing in at over twenty feet tall, the few-hundred tons of jiggling, meaty bulk she carried around served more as a reminder to everybody how easily you could become one with her adipose than an indication of her laziness. Its main bulk gathered before her in her belly, amassed into a behemothic orb of blubber and muscle containing enough sheer mass to sag onto and engulf an enormous length of the ground ahead of her, its formerly white fur painted with the visage of a Pegasi knight grappling with a feral griffon before a coliseum of hundreds. All accented with expansive thighs containing the lengths to surpass her height and a super-magnified set of breasts pushing for freedom against the restrains of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and here I was, now the size of those teeth I feared being between so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the darnedest thing, meeting you here, too!\u201d Kelly rattled on. \u201cI\u2019d been in need of some help, just the kind a gal like you could give!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only thing I\u2019m gonna help you with if you don\u2019t fix this is gonna be an <i>ACK?!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Velma could hold up on her promise of strangling Kelly, the wyvern defended herself in turn by shoving the jar, me shrieking all the way, right into her maw, her teeth and pink flesh surrounding her jaws encapsulating me before she spat it back into her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d better hope you\u2019d cleaned this jar where you find out where it\u2019s going!\u201d She growled, her claws digging into and cracking the glass keeping me alive, but when a terrified shriek escaped me, one loud enough I almost thought it came from somebody else in the room, Velma eased up, realizing that something was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing me up to her face, Velma squinted through the strings of saliva before rearing her head back in surprise, incredulously looking back at Kelly. \u201cKelly, is that-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I see you\u2019ve noticed Gregory! Poor little guy was playing around with my experiments around the shop, and, well, you can guess the rest from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!!!\u201d I snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnywho, I was wondering if you\u2019d keep him safe until my in-shrink ray can be finished. Mind being a pal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...\u201d Velma mouthed, only able to take half of Kelly\u2019s story at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect! I knew you\u2019d understand.\u201d Kelly beamed, spinning for the door and strutting away. \u201cTa-ta, you two! Don\u2019t stay up to late!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelly, Kelly, wait. DON\u2019T GO!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut my pleas were too distant and too insignificant to stop Kelly from leaving, abandoning me to Velma\u2019s whims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, when I turned back to my newly appointed sitter, Velma didn\u2019t seem particularly eager to chomp me out of existence, but only in that she seemed too confused to be angry, unsure of what to do with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...hey.\u201d She plainly uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI responded with a very lethargic peace sign. \u201c\u2018Sup?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Any hopes Velma had of salvaging her sale were quickly ripped to shreds though, as the bat woman proved to be just as ill-tempered as Velma herself. The shouting match that followed was brutal and throughout it all, the bat woman made it clear she'd only accept one thing as an apology: a refund.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that Velma's temper was awful at the best of times, I had no intention of sticking around after she was forced to hand over a sizable chunk of cash. I tried to scale the walls of my jar prison, only to slide back down on my ass time and again. I even became so desperate that I went back as far as I could so I could charge the wall of my prison in a bid to knock the jar off the counter and shatter on the ground. Sure, it was practically suicide, but so was being around the big, bad wolf when she was in a foul mood. All my efforts were in vain though as Velma was finally forced to hand over her customer's down payment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told you were the best. Pathetic,\" the bat lady said as a final parting shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SLAM</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the wolf's eyes locked onto her newfound, miniscule human pet. A vein was throbbing in her neck. She bared her fangs. I gulped. Seconds later Velma was looming over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. Cost. Me. Money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No--NO! That wasn't me, that was Kelly who interrupted you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That dumb lizard wouldn't even be here if you hadn't been stupid enough to fiddle with one of her inventions and get yourself shrunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was lying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"NO EXCUSES!\"</i> the wolf roared. Literal slaver splattered the side of the glass, causing me to flinch. She grabbed the jar in one paw and began turning the lid with the other. I didn't know if I was lucky or not that the lid was stuck. On the one hand, it stalled my execution. On the other, it was only making her angrier. \"I hope--playing mad scientist--was worth it!\" she said between grunts. \"Because now--you're going to be--my personal--CHEW TOY! <i>ARGH! WHY WON'T THIS STUPID LID COME OFF?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Velma, wait! I'll pay you back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf barked out a laugh. \"YOU pay ME back? How? I make more in a month than you do in a year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Really? That's depressing. I need to talk to Holmes about a raise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were you, I'd talk to her about worker's comp... <i>if</i> you survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>POP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA-HA!\" Velma gave a triumphant laugh as the lid finally popped off. I squeaked as she grabbed me between two furred fingers and lifted me in front of her mouth filled with razor-sharp teeth. \"Any last words?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stammered out apologies helplessly in a stream, while my eyes darted around the shop, hoping for anything that could help me avoid my fate as a doggie treat. When I spied her discarded tools, before I could stop myself, I blurted out, \"I CAN BE YOUR APPRENTICE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What?\" Her expression made it seem like she couldn't tell if it was a joke. I wasn't sure myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your apprentice! Yeah,\" I said, having no choice but to commit to this half-baked idea. \"You can teach me everything you know about being a tattoo artist and I can help you with your customers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? How are you going to do that, shrimp? You're barely qualified to do your normal job when you're regular-sized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes--BUT! But, we both know that not all anthros are as, uh, big as you! Some are a lot smaller, some nearly human size! If you had a smaller apprentice to help you, I could do all the designs that you can't do because you're too large--not that there's anything wrong with being large!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not sure if Velma heard that last part. It was clear she was thinking. \"And you could help tattoo my clients in those hard to reach places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH! Wait--what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I get all kinds of freaks in here,\" Velma said. \"One wanted a tattoo on her uvula saying \"Welcome to Hell\". Another wanted human skulls tattooed on all of her toes. One lady? You don't even wanna know where she wanted ink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all sounded... horrifying really, but better that than dead. It'd also buy me time for Kelly to finish an invention to turn me back to normal... if she even bothered. \"Sure,\" I said. \"I could... help with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma leaned against the counter, thinking out loud. \"It's true that getting the smaller anthros in here could get me a lot of extra cash from my new customer base... but on the other hand it'd take a long time to train you... and there's no guarantee you'd be any good... and Dr. Olivia said finding an outlet for my anger would be healthier for me... You might just be more useful as a stress toy so I don't lash out at customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the money!\" I squeaked. \"Think of the money!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The money... right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma thought. I was kept dangling in front of her, while she tapped a claw on the counter. I waited with bated breath--which, if nothing else, helped me avoid breathing in the funky dog breath that washed over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she decide?</span></div></div>",

So accustomed to many morning where I told myself that the day was today, the one where I would meet my end in an Anthro\u2019s digestive tract, I shut my eyes and flipped through the cliched slideshow of all I held back at home, every smile of my family and every decision, whether it be happy, smart, stupid, or something all in between that guided me here, seconds from being plunged into the eternal black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but not really \u2018plunged\u2019, per se, when Velma instead lowered me downwards, claws separating to let me plop on something too soft and plush to be the floor, nor her fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening my eyes turned out to be another stupid choice when it was set in that I was placed in a chair, which, obviously conformed to her fat ass, stretched at either side like a red football field. Bending her legs, Velma squatted lower and stretched her arms down upon her colossus of a belly, carrying as large of armfuls of the gargantuan, colorful sphere as she could to hoist it up off its vast coverage of the floor, casting the entire seat beneath its shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d She grunted out through her labored grin. \u201cI\u2019m <i>definitely</i> taking my hour off for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVELMA, DON\u2019T!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>WHUMP</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">....</div>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma\u2019s fingers loosened slightly, but with the unfathomable weigh they were carrying, it was all the behemoth of muscle and flab protruding from her needed to descend upon the chair and its untied captive. The arms creaked and flexed against the colorful fur-covered paunch that forced itself into the openings along its design, and a pathetic squeal came from underneath her stomach that was quickly snuffed by all the air in his lungs getting squeezed out of him. The crush didn\u2019t kill him, probably didn\u2019t even break a few bones, likely the same science behind if an ant could survive a drop of several feet, but Velma neither lessened nor steadied in her onslaught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, the idea of eating the little maggot came into mind as she held him before her maw, one of many ideas that passed by which involved snuffing his life out like a candle\u2019s flame...but then again, ending his life wouldn\u2019t bring her the kind of satisfaction that came from feeling him struggle against her, that he knew she could do anything to him she wanted, and no amount of screaming or kicking would lessen his burden. It felt nostalgic, in fact; it brought her back to high school, when she was just ten feet tall, eight tons, and living in the heels of parents rich enough to buy the school into essentially giving her a license to squash and torment any human students whenever she so pleased. Hell, <i>teachers!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma couldn\u2019t even remember the name of the bat-lady from before, well drained of any anger of losing her next pay by that point. She allowed her hands to loosen further, forcing even more belly blubber down that fully enveloped what could still let him feel, and reduced the chair to stool by forcing on even more paunch that designed the arms and backboard entirely. When little movement Gregory possessed was completely paralyzed, still alive, but likely loosing the blood needed to stay awake. She could feel his breathing slowing, getting lighter and lighter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she let go entirely, leaning down with sadistic glee at a wooden crunch collapsing beneath her, followed by a deafening boom as her belly smashed upon the ground like a meteor from the heavens. The circle of floor impacted by her stomach engulfed the chair and its remains in its entirety, as if concealing any evidence of what she was in the process of, and yet, on top of the flattened wreckage, she could still feel the little heartbeat of life in him, just a shorter length of torture away from being annihilated in full...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Velma loosens up. With her anger drained, she does consider giving Greg a job. As a servant, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Velma pulls herself off of him, but she\u2019d not over with Greg just. She\u2019s got a <i>lot</i> more humble pie to serve him yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: <b>*Cartoony <i>squish</i> sound effect, followed by cartoony wah-wah-wah.*</b></span></div></div>",

She was focusing so much on the fun she'd have in the future that she didn't pay enough attention to the here and now, as the pressure grew worse and worse for poor Greg, as his lungs felt like they'd burst from the lack of air, as his skeleton gave way and--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SQUISH</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA subtle shift occurred under the wolf's prodigious gut. Velma noticed it and the goofy grin dropped off her face. \"God damn it,\" she growled. She leaned back and pulled up her stomach in great armfuls. \"Greg? Greg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma sighed and got up. She checked herself in the mirror and, to her non-surprise, a flattened, lifeless Greg clung to her stomach amidst a splatter of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Greg! I thought you were supposed to be tough,\" Velma snapped at the corpse, as if his death was his own fault. The wolf crossed her arms and huffed, annoyed at the loss of her new toy before her fun could even begin. She starred at the bloody remains on her stomach in the mirror. For the first time she noticed it looked... kind of badass actually. In fact... it was bitching! The red stain and silhouette of a small body complimented the rest of her tattoos perfectly. She couldn't have planned it better! Velma took a mental picture and went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy opening of business next day, Velma had a new tattoo among the tapestry on her body, one that all the other women who came into her shot complimented her on and asked for ones just like it. Turns out Greg helped her turn a profit after all, and Velma could think of no better reward than having a monument to the moment of his death tattooed on her gut for the rest of her life.</span></div></div>",

There was just pain. Just pain, color flashing in every direction, and the roar of the air whistling past my ears as I felt my body soar like a golf ball through what seemed like the furthest reaches of space, or at least, as far as the already spacious room was at a shrunken size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly realized I wasn't killed, going by the horrified scream that was running its way out of my throat throughout the entire flight, and none of my bones seemed broken by the way I flailed my arms and legs around in the air. Not that it would last, of course. Once the adrenaline had settled and free thought was once again possible, I fought my hands against the wind to curl my arms over my head, not wanting to see the floor. It wasn't a montage of my life passing through my head; it was all the thoughts of what'd be left to clean up afterwards, probably with a few disgusted guests sneering at my body, all broken and bloody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went dark even with my eyes clamped shut, and I counted off my last seconds, wasting them by wondering who and what I could possibly dedicate my final thoughts to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WHUMP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and it was pretty damn soft, not that the impact hadn't knocked the wind out of me. Every bone in my body was shaken up, my head too battered to register anything but the sudden whiplash, but I thankfully remained intact, and it was with a lucky grab in the air that I caught a hold of something, hanging off of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few panicked breaths, my brain accustoming to the fact that I'd survived, I looked around as I hung with my stomach against something wide, soft, and blue, my eyes still too blurred to make anything out. I could tell my feet were dangling over a whole lot of nothing, so I slowly pulled myself up along the lip of whatever I'd clung onto, avoiding the urge to look down as I brought my foot up and needled it into the pocket, then straddled up so I could work the next one in, following with the rest of my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Ah, fuck.</i> I silently realized, lest I make a sound. <i>...a</i> pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pocket to a pretty damn big pair of pants, I could tell, and even then they were tightly packed, with whatever contents I stood upon most likely flattened. Looking to the left, I could see the other orb to what I could tell was a truly titanic behind (now expanded into an awe-inspiring national monument to my shrunken eyes), the pants so taut around their owner's legs that the butt crack conformed between their cheeks threatened to rip them in half if whoever carried it had so much a wafer thin mint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also much darker, I could tell afterwards, and I looked downwards. I gave a whistle, legitimately surprised by Kelly's precision when I saw that my \"savior's\" ass was tightly packed into one of the Diamond Mines' mine carts, one larger than the one I was riding in minutes ago. The rat in charge of the controls actually struggled to push the door closed with her passenger's mass all bunched up against the walls, but with her cheeks puffed out, she managed to push the door in until it clicked shut, and wiped a bead of sweat from her forehead as she got back in her station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the motor was clicked on (the epidermis beneath the denim vibrating slightly), I thought over my plan as all of us were pulled out of the station, holding in the tempting urge to swear revenge on Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay...just wait around for the next stop, try and find a place to jump out, and find Kelly.</i> I thought over, but shook my head at the ending of that idea. <i>No, no...maybe miss Blanc? It probably the forever to get to her, and even then-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut my thoughts were interrupted when I saw a large, furred hand out of the corner of my eye that reached down towards the other cheek, their owner's thick, doughy fingers scratching along her behind. What came next was a great void despair that ate up every organ in my chest, and I shuddered at the realization, suddenly terrified at the notion of who I was adhered to...</span></div></div>",

She didn't have her mane tied back in a bun, allowing it to flow freely down her back, so I could clearly tell she was just coming back from work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she'd caressed herself to her satisfaction, she turned her eyes back on the tracks ahead, bringing her hand back up to belch into her fist. I could hear a wrapper to something be torn apart, and her body resonated as she gave a hungry moan, loudly biting into whatever super-sized junk food she'd ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, now.</i> I thought, not thinking of anything further than that. <i>Get out now. Get stepped on, maybe. Get kidnapped and eaten, sure. Just GET OUT. <i>NOW.</i></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in two large bites, her mouth was already freed to lick her fingers clean. She crumpled up the wrapper, and I held in a squeak as her hand came back around her back, coming towards my pocket with the balled paper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost drew blood as I bit my tongue, holding in a whimper, and I inched my way towards the very edge of the pocket, but at a snail's pace, too fast to doge her hand in time...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*WHUMP*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly's hand made it to the pocket and stuffed the wrapper inside, all the while feeling the shrunken human. \"What the hell...?\" Carly said plucking Greg's miniature form. Holding him from the back of his shirt, she held him close to her equine face. \"H-hey Carly... what's shakin...?\" Greg awkardly asks. \"Greg Wiltsead!? How did you get so small?\" She paused of a moment before resuming her qeustions. \"And what were you doing on my ass?\" Carly rubbed her rear. \"It's kind of a long story...\" Greg said. \"Wait, I think I know what's going on.\" The zebra woman gave him a slutry look. \"you do?\" The human asked back. \"I knew that you couldn't resist my jiggly booty, so you shrunk yourself and climbed on to it to get a bit of private time with it. But unfortunately for you I had to cut it short. It was only a matter of time that you saw me as your girlfriend, you sly dog.\" Carly smirked at Greg. \"Hey wait! That's not what happened!\" \"Deny it all you want. But action speaks louder than words.\" The zebra woman giggled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Could you take me back to Kelly so she could unshrink me?\" Greg asks Carly. She jokingly puts a finger under her chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm going to do that Gregkins.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Excuse me!\" The human yelled. \"I think I like you better like this.\" \"Carly, what are you talking about? I need her to unshrink me so I can work.\" Carly just looked at Greg. \"You're just a cute little human. What if an accident happened and you got caught in it? Nobody would be surprised would they?\" Greg couldn't believe what Carly was suggesting. \"And from that accident, you were no where to be found. Your dearest lover, Carly, found you and took you into her love and care. Where they both lived happily ever after together, doing whatever their heart's desired.\" Carly moaned a bit at the thought. The human was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly licked her lips. \"But for that dream to become a reality. I need you to... \"disappear\"..\" The zebra chuckled a bit sinisterly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was terrified. Not knowing what to do he tried his best to escape from her grasp. But try as he might, he didn't get very far. \"Can we talk about this?\" Greg asked. \"I don't think you're in a position to be making demands, my adorable little man.\" Carly cooed.    She resumed to talking after she caressed him to her cheek. \"And since I'm in a really good mood. I'll let you decide where you're gonna disappear. So many choices.\" She brought Greg closer to her maw, her warm breath ran over him as she open her mouth wide. \"A trip inside my mouth might be a good place to keep you.\" Carly smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She brought Greg away from her mouth and held him close to her big rounded tush. \"Or maybe since you like my fat booty so much, I could stuff you between. Would you like that?\" Carly gently pressed the shrunk human into one of her cheeks. \"But if that isnt your cup of tea...\" Carly swinged him over to her some what exposed cleavage. \"...maybe these mounds instead?\" The fat zebra brought Greg into a bear hug, squeezing him into her boobs. Greg was blushing as red as a tomato right now. What with the kind of treatment he's been receiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what'll it be? How do you wish to \"disappear?\"\" Carly held Greg out in front of her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I choose...\"</span></div></div>",

She opened her mouth, and Greg shut his eyes and shed a single tear, prepared to feel himself land on her tongue and be swallowed out of existence, but instead felt the very tips of her teeth bite into his shirt, dangling him so he was being choked by his own collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprised that <i>that\u2019s</i> what you\u2019re going for, sweetie,\u201d She mused through her clamped teeth, hands traveling underneath her mane to grab the neck of her shirt and yank it off, her cocky smirk intensifying at a few roots and whistles that whizzed past the car. \u201cBut I think we\u2019ll have plenty of time to get to know one another, soon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..and so close was Gregory to actually <i>begging</i> for her to eat him, an empty swallow running down his throat as she parted her breasts and needled him inside, trapped up to his cheeks in cleavage. All he could respond to her smile with was a sputtered grunt of anger before she pulled her shirt back down, the extra pressure around her chest pulling her mammaries in to seal over his face, enveloping him in warm, furry darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You know...maybe this isn\u2019t so bad.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, \u2018Snuggled between Carly\u2019s breasts\u2019 wouldn\u2019t have even made the bottom of Greg\u2019s list of the most relaxing places he could be in the resort, but considering all the other things he could\u2019ve been, many of which were conceived the moment he\u2019d landed in her pocket, or dangled right in front of her face...something about his fleshy tomb felt rather peaceful. Maybe it was the endless black, the empty void that was drained of any sight or sound that made him think that maybe, <i>just</i> maybe he\u2019d died before Carly could have her way with him, but regardless, he far preferred the comforting silence to the image of Carly\u2019s grin, allowing his perception of time muting to how long he\u2019d been trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the more painful it made it when gravity twisted around, and a window of light opened around him that flung him right back into the air, as though he\u2019d been subjected to a second birth. He couldn\u2019t breathe in enough air to scream all the way down as he fell one, two, maybe ten stories into a soft, warm surface that he bounced right off of, flinging him face-first into some wooly surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shifted about, accompanied by a dense, metallic groan that vibrates right into his bones\u2019 marrow, tingling all his nerves at once. Looking right was met with a blank white wall, but looking left, he spun over with a yelp and scooted away, never having been terrified of Carly as he was Jose w, even back at the mine cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer snout but a few feet away, Carly fluttered her lashes at him through a few locks of her freshly combed mane, eyelids now caked in ruby red mascara and a thick layer of eyeliner, while her lower lip was coated in a thick layer of black lipstick that resembled a fat leech wrapped around her muzzle. The metal groaning returned as she craned backward into a seated position, overtaking the foot of what he was horrified to realize was a bed, obviously hers, by how much it spanned. Even at his size, he doubted it was enough to contain her behind; the titanic, stripey globes cascaded over the foot and pooled up on the floor, completely swallowing the entire front of the bed, but Carly didn\u2019t seem quite as much like she was sitting on her bed as much as opening her legs and <i>engulfing</i> it between them, the metal frame actually denting inwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost terrifying of all, though, was what she wore...or, more specifically, what <i>little</i> she wore. All she had on was a purple bikini top, but her breasts overflowed so much around the cups that she looked like she was but a few pounds away from the black of her nipples peeking over, each forming a prominent lump beneath the smooth nylon. From the waist down, Carly was totally nude, censored only by her own stomach hanging low enough to rest on the bed like a stripey beanbag chair, one the size of a mountain to his tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Greggy-poo, I\u2019d say it\u2019s time for briefing!\u201d She crooned, reaching back to trace a finger around one of her buttocks. \u201cSeeing as you\u2019re so desperate me to get you back at Kelly\u2019s to unshrink you, it\u2019s sounding to me like you owe me a <i>favor</i>, but...well, considering the kind of woman Kelly is, it\u2019s sounding to me more like a <i>job</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dAny excuse\u2019ll serve a tyrant.\u201d</i>Gregory remembered, moving his lips as little as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...and, considering this is a <i>job,</i> I\u2019d say I\u2019m expecting some pay in return, huh?\u201d She presumed, pretending Gregory had no idea what he was saying. \u201cMaybe...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dJust get it over with, already!!!\u201d</i> Gregory shrieked, mustering all his rage into making it as loud as possible. \u201cThe only time your wasting here is <i>yours</i>, you psychopath!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...aptly put.\u201d She admitted. \u201cOf course. Anyhow, Gregory, seeing as the only goddess a man needs in his life is his wife, and considering all the \u2018free will\u2019 I\u2019d been giving you since we\u2019d been dating, I\u2019d say it\u2019s fair for you to worship a little in return.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She believes it.</i> Gregory observed, shivering. <i>I knew she was crazy, but by god... she <b>actually</b> believes it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say for two...no, wait...three? Yes. <i>three</i> weeks, I am officially your goddess.\u201d She decreed, angling her head back to flick her mane. \u201cAnything I say or do to you is final, no questions answered...no..you know what?\u201d She snapped her doughy fingers, eyes darkening significantly. \u201cYou\u2019ll <i>love</i> it. If I sat on you, you would <i>thank</i> me. If I made you drink from my titties, <i>ate</i> you, or just shove you so far up my own ass and clenched as <i>hard</i> as I could, you\u2019d be so overwhelmed with joy that you would reward me with a thousand kisses because you love me. <i>So. <b>MUCH</b></i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and right then, anything good that happened to him, any smile, love, happiness, no matter how small or massive it was, may have been but signposts leading towards an eternity of torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Can\u2019t!</i>...can\u2019t...\u201d Gregory squeaked, repeating the word over and over again till he wasn\u2019t speaking several octaves higher. \u201cCan\u2019t...can\u2019t you just return me to normal size first?!...I...I <i>promise</i> I\u2019ll come back, and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Carly\u2019s smile vanished, taken place by a bemused frown. She didn\u2019t say anything, but all the same, Gregory shielded his eyes, having never seen her lack a smile whenever she was near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe delayed in giving a response, letting him still in his fear for several seconds, but then hunched forward and hoisted her legs up so her knees were crouched upon the mattress, her asscheeks pushing against the ceiling and ripping cracks in the plaster. The sudden shift in weight flattened the front legs of the bed, and Gregory screamed as he rolled down the blanket, blindly grabbing with his fingers until he caught a snag and remained hanging, shaken but unbroken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...that is, not<i> physically</i> broken, especially upon seeing Carly bring her head closer to him, breasts and belly squishing around the mattress. Gregory let out a pained squeak when she jabbed her snout right into his stomach, leaving only able to flail his arms and legs around as he remained hopelessly pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, Gregory, I thought you of all people would <i>thank</i> me for this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarly, <i>please!!!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you thankful, Gregory?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...Yes, I am!!!\u201d He shouted back, giving up on beating against Carly\u2019s snout. \u201cI...I love it! I love it so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly\u2019s lips pulled up into a smile. \u201cOf course. I knew you would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...\u201d He exhaled in pain \u201cThanks...thank you, Carly, I love it... thank you so much...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly kept smiling, keeping him pinned down, but was only satisfied when Gregory winced and kidded her on the nose, following with a hug.</span></div></div>",

This caused him to wince a bit from the gaint hand picking him up. She brings him closer to her muzzle. Carly, going back to sitting on her bed, begins to slouch where she lays on her barely standing bed. With a wide smile she parted her lips, with her captive staring down into her gaping throat. Greg begins to get scared as Carly lowers him closer and closer. <i>Well... it was fun while it lasted.</i> Greg said to himself. He braces for impact waiting for Carly to drop him. *<b>SMOOCH</b>* All of the sudden his vision is filled with ebony flesh force their way onto Greg. *<i>POP</i>* as Greg was brought away from the lips of his self proclaimed goddess, his middle body and lower body partly cover is sticky black lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, maybe I'll gobble you up later after I've had some fun with you my sweetie.\" Carly smiled at Greg. The human of course was being creeped out by it. There was just something so... unnatural about it. \"As you wish Carly.\" He said reluctantly back. <i>It would be best if I just endure this BULL for 3 weeks and not get on her bad side.</i> \"Good boy.\" Carly caressed his head with a free finger. \"Mmm mmm mmmmmm, now how to let you worship my body.\" Carly hummed. <i>It would've been better if she just ate me already...</i> \"Oh I know!\" The giantess zebra places Greg on her night stand drawer and walks over to her dresser. This gave Greg the perfect view of Carly's gargantuan ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as it wobbled and jiggled about as Carly puts an extra pop in her walk. Carly hummed a bit as she rummaged through her dresser. \"Ah ha! Found it.\" Carly turns around and walks back with... a pair of panties? <i>I didn't think that she had any.</i> Greg thought to himself. \"Hmm they seem a bit smaller then I remember.\" The zebra woman said. <i>I wonder why that is.</i> Greg breathed. Carly brings the under garments to her feet before climbing into them and pulling them up. Not surprising that they were a bit of a tight fit. \"There, fits like a glove.\" Carly chirped. \"You look quite nice in that.\" Greg spoke. To be honest he was being half truthful with that. <i>It's nice to see her wear some <b>ACTUAL CLOTHES</b> for a change.</i> \"Aaaaaw, thank you so much sweetie.\" Carly cooed as she trekked back to her night stand. \"If you like it so much...\" she plucks Greg again and swings him above her rear.  \"...why don't you get a closer look.\" \"<b>WAIT WHA--!</b>\" with little hesitation Carly pulled her panties back and dropped Greg inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lands with a soft thud before Carly lets go of the band with a SNAP. Outside a small lump in her panties was visible on her left ass cheek, very close to where her booty crack is. Greg was left with his face getting buried in zebra booty. \"Ooh my, you feel delightful there Gregkins.\" Carly cooes at her \"boyfriend\". \"Why don't we see how much you can handle my fat, squishy ass.\" Carly began to bend over forward, causing her panties to increase in tension. This in turned planted Gregs face further into her ass. The giantess kept going, being surprisingly nimble for her size. \"Oh yes, further.\" She moaned. Carly continued to bend over, her hands almost touching the ground before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*RIIIIP*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer panties could take the strain any longer as a tear rips down the middle revealing a striped butt crack. \"Whoops.\" Was all she could say. \"I managed to tear my favorite, slash, only pair. Oh well.\" The zebra goddess slips the rips panties off and looks inside of them, seeing that her lover is no where to be seen. \"Greg? Sweetie? Now where did you run off to.\" Carly looked puzzled for a moment. \"Unless...\" The giant equine trots to a full body mirror and turns around, mooning the mirror. She could not help but laugh a bit once he was where Greg was now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did she find him...?</span></div></div>",

How did you know I always wanted a tattoo on my tush?\" Carly purred, wiggling her cheeks. Greg remained firmly stuck to her ass. \"I was scared of the needle, but now you've volunteered to BE my tattoo! You're <i>so</i> thoughtful, sweetums. Good thing I decided not to eat you, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low, painful moan from Greg was his only reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I didn't feel any bones break, yet, so you're alive and well,\" Carly went on as if Greg hadn't moaned in agony. \"And that's good--hate for our romance to be over so soon: we haven't even gotten to the first date yet! Oh, the <i>delights</i> I have in mind for that night...\" She let out an unashamed moan at the thought of that. Greg's shrunken state opened up so many possibilities--hell, even his current state as a butt tattoo would have been impossible before now. (She felt a flash of envy for the truly huge anthros who towered near hundreds of feet tall, but shook it off. Kelly had shrunken one human; maybe she could buy that gadget herself and shrink more to play with sometime?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg moaned again, his limbs twitching. He must have been trying to pry himself off...it tickled, making Carly bite her lip. \"Oh Greg; you're even giving your goddess's lovely booty a massage! I guess you can't get enough of that side of me, hmm? Well, have some more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====Greg's POV=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour or so I got more zebra rump than anyone should have to suffer. Carly flopped onto a chair and ground her massive rear on me, nearly crushing my bones to jelly--and almost breaking the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe danced around to some music, making sure to shake her cheeks enough to toss me around like a rag doll...while still plastered to her cheek as it jiggled beneath me. Carly even cracked her tail on my back like a whip for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clenched her cheeks and sandwiched me between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd various other ass-related torture methods I will NEVER speak of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd somehow, I survived it all. Still alive, still with all bones unbroken, and still plastered to my zebra stalker's gigantic ass. Nothing had loosened me or even shifted my position: I was stuck in the same spot on her left cheek the whole time. I began to worry that I had somehow been fused onto her flesh permanently--a living tattoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI carried such pleseant thoughts with me as Carly left her apartment and walked aimlessly--making sure to shake her hips with each step so I was tossed around by her jiggling cheeks. I tried to bite the giant orbs a few times to make her feel some pain for what i'd been through; but it just made her moan and sigh. Terrific, my attempt at payback was just making her horny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some walking--where my view was blocked by being embedded face-first into Carly's behind--I managed to pry my head loose and get a look around. I spotted the gleaming beaches of the Glass Tornado, with crowds of anthros in swimwear all about. None of them seemed to notice my plight...or care, what was one human's misery in a resort for anthros who saw humans as talking snacks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you like long walks on the beach, my little seat cushion,\" Carly purred, looking over her shooulder at me. \"It's just the first part of our little day out today. And you're gonna LOVE what I have planned....\" She winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mumbled a few choice words that aren't fit to print. Maybe it'd be better if she ate me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even a walus woman who stared at Carly's giant striped butt ignored the human plastered to it..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, did she glue that human there? That's frickin' hot! I've got to try that next time I catch one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're starting a trend, Greggiekins!\" Carly said with sickening sweetness. \"Guess I'll have to keep you there so I won't fall behind. I just might get on a magazine--with you on my big lovely cheek!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, lovely. Now I was a fashion statement. We'd have the clothes shops selling humans to sit on within a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly kept walking for some time, showing off the human plastered to her backside. She did some shopping, got an ice cream...and posed for pictures from passing anthros who were fascinated with her \"new accessory\". She gave out tips to anthro women on the best ways to keep humans adhered to their behinds, how to get the most pleasure out of sitting on them; the works. (Apparently, grinding from side to side felt better than just sitting still on a human; easing down onto the chair thighs-first was more survivable than plopping straight dow.

Peeling my face away from the all-encompassing booty, I inhaled and roared at the top of my lungs, trying to cut through Carly's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"KELLY! IT'S GREG! CARLY KIDNAPPED ME AFTER YOU SHRANK ME! <i>HELP ME, GODDAMMIT!</i>\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI screamed myself hoarse, praying my human voice would carry over the crowd of giants.

Last month, the last time I was assigned to the glass tornado, a visiting ambassador, that is to say a 60\u2019 tall cape buffalo woman, accidentally sat on me and I spent half the day plastered to her butt cheek. Since I took this stupid job, I\u2019ve narrowly avoided being eaten and/or squashed by fat giantesses. Even Ms. Holmes nearly flattened me during my job interview.\u201d The fact was that as a human, I was at the bottom of the pecking order around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least I was working in the sun today. The great and powerful lardass I worked for didn\u2019t specify what I was supposed to be doing so I just put on a tank top and bathing suit to head for the Glass Tornado. The Tornado was one of Gaia 2.0\u2019s best features. It was a perfect simulated beach complete with palm trees, sand, a wave pool and even rocky mountains with water slides. I must admit it was impressive to be able to simulate a beach during the cold weather. As I walked by, I saw two anthros I recognized right away. The first was Garnet Rhodes, the pear-shaped swan who is one of the few sane people in this hotel. Of course, if her mother knew that I was friends with her I\u2019d be in serious trouble. Sapphire was as big as a house and made her daughter\u2019s pear-shape look nonexistent. She was also a horrifying bitch who hated humans. I heard a rumor that she\u2019s only fond of roasted humans. What\u2019s worse was that she was trying to pass on her worst traits to her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also saw Gertrude Carmine speeding through the water. That killer whale lifeguard just didn\u2019t know how to relax and was always on the lookout. She\u2019s got the worst case of OCD I\u2019ve ever seen. Not to mention as a literal whale, it was hard to believe that someone who had to weigh at least 10 tons and was as big as a building could be so fast and graceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t care what I was supposed to do around the Glass Tornado but there were two people I really hoped I didn\u2019t see today; Kim and Olivia. Why is it that reptiles were so nasty. Alright, so what am I doing today?</span></div></div>",

I returned, but she didn't run up to me, either. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd easily lost track thanks to Gertrude and her swimming, though. She rocketed back towards shore so fast that she'd struck the beach in a vast explosion of sand and water, still skidding a several dozen feet along the coast until she slid past the beach chairs, halting with a lingering wobble. Even as she laid atop her monstrous belly she could probably look down on a house's roof, and the moisture clinging to her blubber gave her oil-black skin a slippery sheen under the artificial light from the dome's screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as far away as I was, I could hear her grunt as she pushed down on the ground and heaved herself up so she'd roll back and strike the ground with her feet, dusting herself off. As fate'd have it, she glanced toward my entrance and perked up, bulldozing a path of wet sand along the beach as she turned and stomped my way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Gregory! How're you, today?\" For someone as big as she was, she spoke in the sweetest, most babysitter-worthy voice you'd ever think a giant could speak in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Gertude. I'm doing okay, you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm! I'd actually called Miss Holmes for some help, today.

Down below, the mountain was tangled by a medusa of hundreds of colorful plastic tubes weaving around and through the few remaining slivers of rock face left visible, all tangled up in a crazed attempt to give every single girth class as much of the fair experience they could; Torpedo tubes, bowl rides, body flumes, funnel tubes, <i>every</i> possible variety, some big enough to pilot a yacht through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only ride that wasn't in action when Gertrude picked me up was a bowl slide at the \"fifteen-er\" level. They'd already had the ropes hooked up to the mouth's face, leaving me with only having to strap up into the harness and weave the cords through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, and rappelling down a 50 degree drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't mind? I'd do it myself, but...\" She looked down at her stomach, whose girth wouldn't last ten feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, somebody's gotta do it. Just not somebody keeping me from working in the White Brimstone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Gertrude gave an unwilling snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On my mark...going down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGertrude sat before the mouth, easing the main rope into the tube to keep it taut and even as I descended into the slide's darkness. The water hadn't dried out from the floor in the short while it'd been shut down, and from what little light I had to work with I could plainly see the shine of the slick surface I had to work on. My feet practically slid down on their own, but by the time I was in pitch darkness I'd eventually stumble on the journey along the pipe, and have to work on keeping my body nice and straight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may have been bad, but it was the trip back I was dreading, the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"HELLO? IS ANYBODY THERE?\"</i> Someone's voice echoed from the other end, but they sounded less panicked than they did demanding. <i>\"C'MON, I'VE BEEN STUCK HERE TWENTY MINUTES!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming, miss, just wait a few moments longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the growing light on the other end, I could see a flood of water lingering at the entrance of the bowl. When I was close enough that I wouldn't crack my head by jumping, I yanked the call cord three times, and the main went slack, allowing me to slide down into three feet of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waded into the round, gaping chamber at the tube's end, where the eager guest was trapped in the center, wriggling to free herself from the ride...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the expense of Stacey's patience, Gertrude took her time feeding a load through the pipe via rope, but after a full, painstaking minute I decided that twenty feet was close enough and signaled again. The barrel went slack and splashed into the water, floating by the cushioning tied around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wrenched off the lid and dug my hands in, scooping out two generous handfuls of petroleum jelly. \"Alright, we're good to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, HURRY UP!!!\" She screeched.</span></div></div>",

My training and all the times I'd dealt with her couldn't curb over my instinct, and in shock I slapped the array of junk food off her mammaries, sending them to be ruined in the water. The water around her body boiled into steam as she let out a furious squawk, thrashing so much that you'd think the bowl was some kind of straightjacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I'd seen my fair share of tantrums in Gaia, and hell, a good few of them were from Stacey herself.

He's almost within reach, he's just big enough. Now the question still remains... does he taste good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was terrified that Stacey just stopped like that. Something in the air was unsettling, and it wasn't all of the steam that she's created. \"<i>Heeeeeey</i>, could you come a little closer for me. I really wanna show you something.\" Stacey lulled at Greg. The human hesitantly inched forwards, unaware of the bird's intentions. \"Almost...\" she whispered. Greg inches more. \"<i>Alllmooost...</i>\" He was now right in front of her. \"<b><i>GOTCH 'YA!!!</i></b>\" Stacey yelled before grabbing Greg in one swoop. \"Hey what are you doing!?

I said I wanted to show you something... <b>MY STOMACH THAT IS!!</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Greg could protest Stacey squaked right before shoving her prey's head into her beak. She greedily swallows until Greg's torso was in her gullet. Since Stacey was a bird, she started eating like one. She tilts her head skyward and let's gravity work with her, all the while gulping the rest of Greg's legs. Two more powerful gulps and all that remains is her prey's feet sticking out of her beak. A bulge could be seen in her throat. Stacey quickly thrusts her head forward and snaps her beak shut over the last of her prey. She feels her throat with a loose hand before pointing at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Greg couldn't move. His body was constricted by the force of Stacey's gullet. \"Things cannot get any worse right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>*GULP*</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey swallowed hard and followed Greg's descent with a finger. She moaned when she felt him plop into her stomach. \"<i>Aaaaahhhhh,</i> that really hit the spot.\" She sighed, her tounge hanging and while pating her belly. Many shouts of colorful vocabulary escape Stacey's insides as Greg pounds away at her stomach walls. \"<b>STACEY YOU PAMPERED FATASS!!! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY ATE ME!!! COUGH ME UP THIS INSTANT!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy just giggled at her belly, watching the various lumps form on its surface. \"I'd watch that tounge of yours if I were you. I can make your stay in there... uncomfortable.\" Without any warning Stacey began to grunt as steam was wafting off of her feathers. The inside of her stomach began to feel more like an oven, and it was cooking Greg. \"<b>OKAY OKAY YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT!!</b> Greg pleaed. Having heard that Stacey stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe birb relaxed as she had her hunger stated. She kneaded and rubbed her belly, getting a bit excited when ever she felt Greg struggle about. This was the first time Stacey has had a living being inside of her, and she was really enjoying it.  \"Oh my. You we're quite the tasty little morsel...\" Greg pounded on her stomach wall. \"...oof, feisty too. I might have to do this more often.\" Stacey chipped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes later reinforcements arrived.  Gertrude was the first to enter. She approached Stacey and saw Greg no where to be seen. \"Hey where did Greg go?\" Gertrude asked Stacey. \"Who?\" \"The human that was with you.\" \"Ooohh.... hiiim. I don't know. And I couldn't care less. He has no respect for people like me. Beautiful. Charming....\" \"....<i>bitchy</i>....\" Gertrude said under her breath. \"Well whatever, let's get you out Miss Ghray.\" Firmly grabbing the top of the phoenix, Gertrude pushed down with all of her might, causing Stacey to pop into the pool below. The sudden movement jostled Greg's fleshy prison, getting thrown about as Stacey floats to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to climb out of the drop pool, grabbing any unopened candy bars that Greg smacked into the water and felt the weight of her previous meal weigh her belly down. \"And I still have my prize.\" Stacey lifted her pudgy tummy before dropping it, watching it bob up and down \"<i>LET ME OUT OF HERE!!</i>\" The voice inside of her yelled. \"Oh that won't be happening for a <i>loooong</i> time. Don't think I don't remember what you did. Smacking my food away like that.\" The Phoenix turns to look behind her. She sees her smacked away snacks floating. Most of them were soggy. Others beginning to sog. She stuffed the ones she grabbed back in between her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking a few steps she saw a crate with attached wheels and a note on it. Stacey inspects the note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Take this food crate as a gift of apology. Let's just keep what happened between you and who ever assited you.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely. T.H.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Free food! I'm not complaining.\" \"<i>of course you won't, fatass.</i> \"Watch it, pipsqueak. I can make your stay a living hell if I wanted to. You're at my mercy. Don't forget that.\" Stacey growled then punched her stomach, but smirked. She waddled over to the nearest showers. Approaching it, she gets into one of the shower stalls, opens her maw and sprayed cold water down her gullet. When it reaches her stomach the water trickles down and douses Greg, making him scrunch up from the cold. Once she feels like she's had enough, about half way, she stopped. Stacey feels all of that cold water sloshing around in her. \"Wow this feel greats.\" Stacey placed both hands on her belly, feeling how cool it got. The white phoenix grunts again she starts heating up her insides once again. This time the water she drank begins to turn to steam with no where to escape. Her stomach was now a hot box of vapor and cold water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the sauna in there?\" Stacey retorts, hoping to make Greg's stay as uncomfortable as possible. Greg had no idea how to feel. His bottom half was cool and his top half was warm. It surprisingly... felt amazing. \"<i>This honestly... feels great right now.</i>\" Greg spoke. Stacey's face was flushed with embarrassment. \"<b>NO! YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HATE IT! NOT ENJOY IT!</b>\" she yelled. Stacey was annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I'm not letting you out for a <b>VERY</b> long time.\" Stacey puffs out her cheeks. She stormed off pushing her gift crate with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid human... ruining my fun... I hate him...\" Stacey grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Stacey storm off to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Considering where he was and who he was inside of, all Gregory could think to do was curl up on to of Stacey's partly-digested breakfast before both he and it would sink down into her stomach juices, with nought but their sloshing around to keep him company as she trudged off somewhere else into the resort, probably her bedroom, leaving him but an afternoon nap away from ceasing to exist. Not wanting the darkness of an anther's digestive tract to be the last thing he'd see, he tucked his head under his arms, reminiscing of whatever trivial accomplishments he'd made that all carried a chance of lasting more than a decade. At <i>least</i> half of one, he hoped he was lucky enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be so sullen!\" Stacey teased, sensing his mood from the lack of movement inside of her. \"Couldn't some consider it an honor to become one with a body such as mine, to be immortalized as a few extra inches of curve on a figure that'll be seen and fawned over by countless people? How many humans have <i>you</i> ever known to live with such fame?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you say it like I'm going to magically remain sentient enough to live and see all this...\" Gregory thought bitterly. \"That leaves me, what, ten days after you leave the resort before you starve yourself sick for your next shoot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey tittered. \"Well, a good model has to maintain <i>some</i> bounce, so there's a chance I might leave you untouched!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a fucking deal.\" He deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Stacey had reached her room and drew her key card into the lock, and Gregory immediately thought the worst upon hearing a light <i>beep</i> before a door was swung open. Brimming with excitement, ready to escape into a deadly food coma and wake up with plenty of extra poundage on her engorged form, Stacey waltzed right over to her bedroom door, no sparing anything a second glance that could distract her on the trip to her next nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing, that is, except for the smell perforating her skull from the parcel she'd been carrying from the beach, even through the thousands of bars' wrappers. She plopped the box on her mattress and ripped through the tape with the point of her beak, the golden foil inside almost shining in their own heavenly glow with the bedroom's lights reflecting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>yes.</i>\" She growled, seeing at <i>least</i> twenty favors of chocolate just from the surface. \"Truly, you all offer the <i>best </i>of tastes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather then torture her tastebuds with too many seconds deprived of flavor, Stacey grabbed a mound of bars in her wings and bit straight in, beak and tongue slicing through several layers of chocolate, caramel, nougat, peanut butter, and marshmallow rich enough to stave off the taste of foil and paper. Cherishing them all in one gulp, she exhaled in bliss, but chortled in delight upon feeling the unchewed bars rain down into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering his head from the falling debris, Gregory drew out his lighter and turned on the flame, observing the slabs that he felt land on his lap. Surprised, he held the light up to the labels of Gaia 2.0 chocolate bars, some split in half, but some not even torn open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well...it's <b>some</b> compensation.</i> He thought glumly. Despite a thin glimmer of spit clinging to the paper, none seemed to have seeped in as he tore the foil open at one end and unsheathed the bar, its surface still nice and dry. Biting into the corner, he himself found it hard to taste one and imagine not immediately get as big as Stacey was from eating them, his teeth cracking through a brittle layer of chocolate and slicing through the soft, buttery layer of caramel underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, kinda doing a bad job of making my last moments feel...wait...\" Gregory stalled, thinking back on Stacey's attempt to fry him in the Glass Tornado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come again?\" Stacey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"H...Help!\" He yelped, trying to sound terrified. \"Help! HELP!!! <i>I'M ALLERGIC TO CHOCOLATE!!!</i> <i><b>SOMEBODY HELP ME!!!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor choice of a work field, then.\" Stacey mused, tilting the package back and licking her lips. She pulled her head back, them swung it own as hard as she could and frantically began swallowing mouthful after mouthful of chocolate, ones so big that her cheeks and jaw ached. She didn't acknowledge the growing tautness in her belly till was pushing the box away from her, having distended by an extra foot or so, but she merely rolled forward and dove up to her shoulders in the box, beak and tongue lapping up chocolate as fast as they could without her wings grabbing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>ARRRRRRRGGGGHHH!!!!</b></i>\" Gregory screamed through a mouthful of chocolate, scooping up as many bars as he could before they could land in her stomach acid. \"<i><b>AAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It helped that, if he didn't figure a way out of here soon, he really would be dying. And unlike a certain phoenix, he doubted he'd rise from the metaphorical ashes of Stacey's waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phoenix rolled her eyes and stopped snacking. \"C'mon, human. I may enjoy your internal massage but all this screaming is grating on my ears. Did you expect digestion to be a walk in the park?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand!\" Greg said. \"I'm allergic to chocolate! Just touching it is making me swell-up and break out in hives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cry me a river,\" the phoenix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who's going to be crying!\" Greg protested. \"Have you ever digested a human having an allergic reaction before? I've seen it before! It's not a pretty sight. Most anthros are up all night with stomach cramps--and there's gas! Terrible gas! Trust me, your insides are going to be tied up in knots before it gets through with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Really?\" the phoenix asked. She sounded interested. Greg might just succeed in getting out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear to God, it's true!\" Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long stretch of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease...\" Greg prayed under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey sighed. \"Fine. I'll let you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's heart swelled with relief! He did it! He was actually going to get out of here and this dumb bird didn't have a clue--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the bird's stomach contracted around him like a fleshy trash compactor. He felt air rapidly leaving the stomach. But any hopes to join it were short-lived as the phoenix let loose a world-ending belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"BBBBBBBBBBBBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPP!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh,\" Stacey sighed, patting her stomach, tongue lolling out of her ebony beak. \"Human and chocolate. Tastes just as good the second time around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacey? Stacey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry dear, when I said \"I'll let you out,\" did you think I meant you? Nonsense. I meant that burp. It's been building up for a while now, but I couldn't let loose out of the privacy of my abode. What would my adoring fans think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-b-but... what about what I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please!\" the phoenix scoffed. \"We both know you're bluffing. And if you're not? Well, I've had difficult meals before. I'm sure I can get through it,\" she said, kneading her stomach and pushing Greg against her fleshy walls. \"Time will prove which of us is right, though. Until then, I'm finally stuffed, and I think it's time for a well-deserved food coma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can, my dear,\" Stacey said, pulling open a drawer next to her bed and taking out a pair of noise-cancelling headphones. \"Now, be a good treat and keep up that squirming. It feels delightful. I'm sure it'll put me to sleep right away. And, in case I awake and you have shuffled off this mortal coil, I just wanted to say... You're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome for the privilege of becoming one with the most beautiful phoenix in the world. I assumed you wanted to thank me before the end. So, you're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg screamed and punched at her stomach with newfound fury. Stacey had to bite her beak to stop herself from giggling at his struggles. She leaned back in bed and put her headphones on, at once silencing her unruly meal. Within a few minutes, she was snoring softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes after she'd fallen asleep, Greg realized there was no convincing her to let him go. He might really die in here. He took the handful of chocolate bars he'd stopped from falling into her stomach acid and began using them to line the mound of food he'd previously been lying on. Already the food pile had shrunk, so making a buffer was the most necessary course of action. Afterwards, he sat down and tried to think calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to figure a way to get out of here on his own. Either that or wait for a miracle.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yo, Gregory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around. Standing some feet away on the sand was Mavis, waving me down with a small smile on her beak. Her massive, blubbery figure was packed into a bodysuit made out of thick rubber, which had two clear plastic domes visible over either shoulder along the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mavis. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, but I'm gonna need a hand with setting the Aurora up. Hop on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis shuffled around, flicking her back to fling open the unzipped chamber along her left shoulder blade. I grasped onto the plastic rungs built into the legs, careful not to make too much unnecessary contact with her colossal rump as I climbed over and clutched onto her pods's handlebars, reaching around to pull the chamber back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis tugged at the head of the zipper, sealing me within the cramped pod. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis waddled along the sand into a path signed for the Oceania: the largest swimming pool known to either of our worlds. It didn't have the illusory treatment as the beach pool did to look infinite, but standing on the edge, it's furthest ends still seemed to hang far in the horizon, longer and wider than a dozen football fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\" Mavis called back before tilting forward, and she dove so smoothly into the water that I didn't feel her body hit the surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet expertly paddled into the darkness of the deepwater, ignorant of how round the rest of her body was. Far around us, the walls of the pool were covered by windows and doors to rooms built within, like we were swimming through some sort of ancient city that'd sunk beneath the ocean eons ago, but a few lights coming through the murky haze nixed that image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light above the surface had trouble reaching us the deeper we got, and the water around us was as dark as midnight, save for a scribble of purple neon lights somewhere in the corner ahead. It got colder, too, but thankfully Mavis' natural padding felt incredibly warm beneath her body's plastic covering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we're almost there!\" Mavis called through the water. Even underwater, the doors to the club were given the complete treatment with a synthetic red carpet affixed to the floor, spotlights flanking the entrance, and a bright, enormous marquee overlooking the path inside with vibrant neon lights glowing on the borders, a pink set for \"The Aurora\" title plastered over in cursive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncer immediately stepped aside for Mavis. Inside, we glided through the underwater section of the club, which had tables, a bar and dance floor built into the ground, but Mavis swept up and broke the surface, paddling up to a staircase leading up to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, the Aurora!\" She announced, unzipping the suit and shaking the pod open so I could slide back down onto the icy floor. Her tightly compacted mass sprung outwards an extra two feet in every direction once the suit was removed, but foremost with her belly, which slammed onto the ground in a pompous, yet saggy globe of blubber covered in slippery feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights in the club actually came through the floor in a pale white glow, casting an eerie aura on the cavern-like chambers of the arctic resort. It wasn't just during the winter; year round, an chilled mist hung around the ice-coated walls, condensing my breath and causing me to shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an extra coat for you in the jacket hangar.\" Mavis noted, adjusting her waitress uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. So, how can I help things out around here?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The gigantic penguin waved an enormous, blubbery arm at the DJ booth, which was seemingly vacant for now. Most everything in the resort was reserved for residents of colossal sizes, and the booth was no exception. It was a monolithic plinth, decorated sparsely thanks to the ice, and fitted with equipment most radio DJs could only dream of at the least, the most sophisticated and state-of-the-art decks and mixers, and some not even on the shelves yet. Easily fifteen feet high by twenty or thirty so feet wide, and easily expandable thanks to the way the ice was molded against its framing, it was a monstrous obelisk of monumental decadence and achievement that befit the massive resort. I looked at it quizzically; certainly, I was a man of many talents so far as the resort industry went, but I wasn't particularly adept at mixing music and creating playlists for an entire clientele...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sound booth? But, Mavis, you know I'm not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her arm again, chuckling this time and causing her bulging mass to quake. \"No no no no! You've got it all wrong. I'll need your help elsewhere tonight, but right now, I could use your expertise and advice getting the new girl to fit in. It took a lot of finagling to get another human in here, and especially one that's pretty well known for being good at her job. Running the sound booth at the Aurora Nightclub is a specialized job which can usually just be filled by current staff but...I managed to convince Miss Holmes to get a much better person for the gig who can also help you out if need be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked. Another human? Seeing humans in this place was rare enough, at 500$ a pop for a VIP pass! Having another one hired was even more ludicrously rare, and you were more likely to find diamonds in a pig trough than to actually see one! Coughing slightly as I tried to get my wits about me, wondering if Mavis was pulling my leg this time, I motioned for her to lead the way and show me this brand-new addition to the resort staff. The massively fat fowl beamed at me before waddling towards the booth, footsteps shaking the ground ever so slightly as I followed after her. Her bloated rolls squished and rolled together across her leviathanic frame, a curtain of obesity that was known as the highlight of the Gaia 2.0 resort experience. I was curious, actually, to see the new 'girl' and see what kind of human they managed to hire to work down here in the Aurora...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis stopped slightly short of the podium, placing her huge hands on her even larger hips. I could hear something from the inside, rummaging around in the equipment, and the sight of a utility ladder caught my eye. That was one of the tools I used if I ever needed to clean much, since here, everything else was up-scaled for the colossal residents and staff. It couldn't be... \"Kalinka! Come on out and greet your coworker! I told you there was another human working here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Mavis! Wha-<b>MPH!</b> Buh...<i>chyort..</i>\" A soft voice called, a definite accent present from the eastern bloc of Europe, and I could almost feel my eyebrows sliding into my hair as I witnessed the newest addition. The girl crawled out, right around my age, but it wasn't the fact that she was small or that she was human that <i>really</i> caught my attention. It was her <b>clothing.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out from the chasm of the sound booth was a girl wrapped up in all colors of the rainbow, meshed together with a classical, almost 1920s-ish ensemble that reminded me distinctly of jazz and the Great Gatsby. Sunburst-colored hair, natural or not, flowed from underneath the flamboyant fedora, tied up with a mass of ribbons on the braided side, and wound through on the bobcut side, the fringe of her bangs shadowing two strangely-colored eyes, with rings of purple and yellow that filled the iris. They had to be contacts. To complete this absurd, punkish and clashing look were the bar tattoos, three of them, going across the bridge of her nose and the two tiny lip rings at the corner of her mouth. I was used to gargantuan furries parading around the establishment. This was the strangest thing I had <b>ever</b> encountered in my human existence  yet. Staring in utter shock, I hardly noticed as she took stock of me, her slightly unsettling eyes widening before she clapped her hands happily, grinning. \"Oh! So this is Mister Gregory you were referring to! Da! Sehr gut, sehr gut! So good to make your acquaintance! You have no idea how well-known you are, da, being the first human here and the longest-serving! I didn't believe Miss Mavis when she told me, but I'm so glad to meet you in person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er..pleased myself, Miss Kalinka...um...\" I stuttered, stunned at her appearance. Mavis chortled, a deep belly laugh that sent her mass quaking again. Looking back from her to the new girl in front of me, I sighed a little, gulping. \"So...er...Mavis. What exactly do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe penguin nodded, her many chins wobbling before she stroked them with thick fingers, looking down at her two coworkers. \"For starters, she doesn't mind the cold as much so you don't have to offer her a jacket. She needs a bit of help rigging some stuff up so she can reach all of the interfaces up there...a lot of them are holographic, but at the same time the controls are made for fat hands. She'll probably rattle off a lot of questions to you as well; that's pretty much normal. Er...I'm not so sure how the food really will affect her so...give her a couple warnings. Sure, she'll end up bigger eventually, but being a human, I really don't wanna know how badly it'll go if she lets too loose. She'll be doing the show tonight during hours, so keep an eye on her to make sure she doesn't vanish among the sea of flesh you know tends to come around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, still a little unsure about this. She was bubbly, eager to work of course, and was running a stream of jumbled sentences in several different European languages. How she could keep track of all the dialects and particulars she was going through, I had no idea. Still, I coughed a little to get her attention, those eyes locking onto me. \"Alright, Kalinka! Let's get started...\"</span></div></div>",

It still took around two hours to dig through over half of the workload, even with the two of us maintaining a decent, moderate pace with one another.

Even if the thin language barrier was a distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, how're you guys faring, so far?\" Mavis asked as she reentered the dance floor, having set up the tables for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good...\" I called back, kneeling in front of the podium to plug in a few more wires, while Kalinka inspected her 'studio' as she called it. \"How long do you think till we're done, Kalinka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon!\" Kalinka chirped, shooting us a thumbs up. \"We shall be up and singing in one hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear. And hey, why don't you guys take a break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I could go for one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Kalinka approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. Fifteen minutes, and here!\" Mavis reached into a bag hanging against one of her lovehandles and tossed us both a can of soda, pulling out a much larger one for herself as she trudged back to her side of the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Gregory...\" Kalinka leaned over the dashboard, gazing down on me with her chin resting in her palms. \"What is it that you do inside of the Gaia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm what's known to staff as a 'choreboy.'\" I explained, snapping open my soda. \"If there's anyplace in the hotel in need of extra staff, or if there's a guest with a special request in need of human interaction, they'd send me over to take care of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything, really. A spare lifeguard, a bartender, waiter, masseuse, pretty much every conceivable job known to man.\" I snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in a surprising flair, Kalinka crouched onto the dashboard and hooked her legs onto the lip so she could swing over the podium's mouth, dangling upside down over the ledge so she we could see eye to eye, her hair hanging loose in a waterfall of orange. \"Is there anything that I must learn about life in the Gaia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh...\" I scratched the back of my head. \"...well, you probably don't have to worry about it as much as I do, but with the size difference and all between anthros and humans, there's sort of a balance to maintain between how far and how far you can get to them, thanks to certain...well, <i>instances</i> that can happen when they're grabbing for things to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" Kalinka calmly agreed, expertly swinging back up to grab her soda from the station. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mavis also kind of wanted me to warn you about eating right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating right?\" She asked, cocking her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just that most food around here isn't exactly the healthiest to eat all the time, and with most of the VIPs we get around here, there's a bit of a tendency too...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with perfect timing, a loud belch rang from across the club, where Mavis sat drinking a barrel of soda. I merely pointed her out, making Kalinka giggle. \"Oh, I see!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent back up and slinked back into her new dugout. Curious, I got up and walked around onto the steps leading into the DJ station to join her, but I was surprised enough by the workspace she'd created for herself that I forgot what I wanted to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her DJ expertise, she'd laid everything out in a clean, gorgeously organized manner. The panels were filled with bright, colorful displays, turntables, sliders, and neon decoratives in a way that it looked like her own high tech laboratory, a loy more impressive than the wired mess I still had to work out. There were even controls affixed to the <i>ceiling. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How're you gonna get the ones up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That's</i> the question!\" She beamed, holding the body of the wheeled ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how long've you been in the DJ business?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many, many years, since I was just a small child.\" Kalinka explained. \"I'd been born to the string, but sometime many seven years ago, I'd uncovered the world of electronics, and it brought music to life beyond the string! It's the music of the mind, not the hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" I uttered plainly, walking along labyrinth-like array of audio controls and displays. I'd never been a huge of electronic music, but I'll admit I never thought of it that way. \"I couldn't even name the first thing about all this stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it needs a life of duty and passion to fully see!\" She noted. \"You can come in here sometime so I can show you a few, if you'd like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be fun!\" I actually smiled. She was actually starting to get a nice spot with me! \"Anyways, mind giving me a hand with the wires, when we get back?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kalinka had eagerly agreed to help me with the rat's nest worth of wires sitting underneath, which connected her sprawling, organized displays of audio units throughout the gigantic sound booth, chugging down the soda and using that apparently undiminished reserve of bubbly energy to assist me, plowing through the final tasks with ease as the day rolled towards the evening. As we were getting the finishing touches ready on the massive, almost starship-like interior of the booth, I noticed a few guests starting to trickle in, the ludicrously large, lardy, beefy patrons of the Gaia 2.0 Resort piling in for the evening's festivities. During the daylight hours, the Aurora was mostly empty save one or two getting specialty drinks at the bar which couldn't be made at the buffet, but at night, it turned into a stunning display of the most flexible and energetic guests as they partied into the early hours of the next morning. It was quite a sight to see, if at the least for laughs as the enormous partygoers mashed and flubbed together on the dance floor, coupled with the other bodyshapes interspersed between the sea of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here they come. What do you plan on doing? I mean, are you nervous about this at all, considering the clientele?\" I ask as we plug in the last few cables, the interior of the booth beeping softly before all the displays hum to life, LCD monitors and neon LEDs of all colors filling it in a swirling kaleidoscope of light, Kalinka grinned widely at me as she keyed up the main controller, soundboards, mixing and turntables coming to life with a small tune of affirmation, the speakers in the facility buzzing as power surged to their cores. If anything, she was certainly fearless! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I plan on giving them a show! And I won't hide at all. If you're out on the floor, look at the booth. Usually, the glass is mirrored, but I added a couple tricks to the interior, da? If anything, I'm going to be main attraction~!\" She brought the wheeled ladder beside her, spinning it lightly as she widened it to give the structure some stability. Sitting up on one of the rungs, she started to establish a connection with all of her keypads and materials, ticking it off the checklist as the Aurora Nightclub began to fill up. Initiating her chosen music media program to begin her show, she smiled at me again. \"If you are worried, don't be. This is better than former Yugoslavia, at the very least!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was wrong with Yugoslavia?\" I asked, raising an eyebrow and wondering if it was the brunt of a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deep bass freaked everyone out when it rattled the windows of eight or so street blocks. I got into quite a bit of trouble with that one~\" She stuck out her tongue before letting out a titter of merry giggles, checking the time on her main display. \"Oh, you better get going! Miss Mavis probably needs your help! I've got it under control here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod before extracting myself from the completely refurbished booth, the interior glowing like the heart of the Grid. \"Good luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave me a thumbs up before sliding on a pair of custom earphones, plugging them into the mixtable as she began the countdown to her show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI trotted over to Mavis, the blubbery penguin woman crammed into her uniform for the night and sucking down another barrel of soda, perhaps a bit nervously. It had taken a lot of work to get the sound booth set up in Kalinka's custom and specialized gear, and if something went wrong, it might as well be her head as well as Kalinka's being served on a platter. Toronto Holmes was not wont to simply fire employees, but her punishments were more than harsh enough that they wished they had been fired. Her mammothic stomach gurgled deeply in a bit of distress, a belch and hiccup escaping her beak while a plush palm rubbed at her overly swollen middle. I patted a roll of thigh that spilled next to me, looking up at Mavis with a bit of concern. \"That bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little, Gregory! First time getting another human on staff, and to top it off, it's her first night here at the Aurora. On <b>my</b> recommendation. I don't think it'll go wrong, but Murphy's Law has been known to rear its ugly head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged a little, looking towards the booth as the normal floor music filtered through the speakers, the lighting underneath the frozen floor illuminating to the beat. The overheads dimmed a little, music dying down as the spotlights and ambiance started to crank up, Kalinka working her best at the booth to get the right mood for her entrance. \"Well, I think she's resourceful enough. If there's something wrong, she's probably planned for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huff passed her row of thick chins as they quivered and she shoved a couple snack cakes into her maw to keep her nerves from getting to her too much, stomach whining as it reflects its owner's state of mind. \"Oh I hope so...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't to disappoint. Kalinka cracked her fingers like a piano maestro before she began to play, a melodic, soft, cheery tune rolling out from the speakers as she manipulated the sliders to get the perfect balance. The CD deck hummed happily as the lights begin to pulse and glow in time with the upbeat music, floating throughout the Aurora Nightclub. It was her own version of swing music, electrified for a more modern touch and given just a hint more bass so it didn't just get your nerves moving, it got your entire body moving to the deep rhythm that pulsed from the speakers. At first, it was like this, electro-swing and swingstep playing merrily along with a dance beat that couldn't be outclassed by regular everyday tunes I could pull from the radio. The sharp, distorted sounds of trumpets and trombones complemented the rolling bass which caused the facility to quake slightly with every beat, shaking the flesh of the patrons on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't stop there, I noticed, as it rolled into soft dubstep, drum and bass, and several other genres which slowly mixed and melded into a long, combined rhythm which electrified the room. Whatever her magic was, it certainly worked on the enormous guests which filled the club, smiles and laughter all around as the Aurora Nightclub really started to get pumping. I remembered what she said earlier, about watching the booth, and as I turned to face the soundbooth where she was supposed to be hidden behind a wall of mirrored glass, my jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must've installed a black light or something! A neon glowstrip or something, as a silhouetted outline of Kalinka hopped and danced to the beat of her own music inside of the room, her bangles, hair, and the brightly colored garments she had on flashing between each of the glowing controls, an occasional disembodied flash of her pearly whites breaking the illusion of a partying shadow. My foot was tapping to the music as she rolled from genre to genre, an endless cascade of satisfying jams which filled the air. I looked up at Mavis, grinning a little. \"She didn't disappoint, did she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have to say it's quite a lot different than what I expected! It certainly fits! It's almost as chaotic as she is. We'll see what the guests have to say afterwards, and if she did well, I'll treat her to something after work as a job well done on the first day,\" Mavis replied, eyeing me with a twinkle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but what if she doesn't do quite as well as you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pursed her beak a little, folding her blubbery arms. \"I'll get some training done with her, see if we can't make a personal mix for the nightclub...after all, I let her go wild here. Of course, Miss Holmes might have something a bit more serious in mind, but we'll cross that river when we get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, the flashing lights and sounds streamed into the night, the bottom of the gigantic pool alight with the funk and rhythm of the newest addition...for better or for worse, the morning soon came.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without the crazed hubbub of the partygoing guests that'd been flooding us, a silent whine seemed to hang over the club once the entire club was cleared out, save for a few littered cups left on the dancefloor, along with Kalinka and I scrubbing up the leftover trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what did you think?\" Kalinka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was great! You were amazing up there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Spasibo</i>! Thank you!\" She enthused. \"...and what had Miss Mavis thought?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She thought it was one of our <i>best shows ever!</i>\" Mavis squawked ecstatically, shuffling up to fast that she could've easily tripped on and rolled over her own gut. Kalinka and I were far apart enough that Mavis could grab us off the ground by either arm as she slid between us along the ice, victoriously skating around as she hugged us tight against her heaving chest. \"We'd made more sales from that show then we'd had the entire year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The entire <i>year?\"</i> Wow. Accomplished by <i>a human in Gaia? </i>Call the papers! \"That's amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I owe it all to you, Kalinka!\" I swear, Mavis sounded like she was on the verge of kissing her, she was so overjoyed. \"I'd done a great good in choosing you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just another walk in the park for me!\" Kalinka shrugged off, jumping between both a swedish and russian accent. \"But Gregory here was still an irreplaceable gift!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis settled down a bit, taking a few calm breaths, and smiled at me approvingly. \"You, too, Gregory. Couldn't have seen tonight through without either of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, just doing my job. Or job<i>s</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis gave an amused snicker. \"Sorry about that. C'mon, I'll take you back up and take care of the rest myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalinka and I each took a pod on Mavis' back on our trip back to the surface. By the time we'd made it back to the poolside and she'd let us disembark, the screens on the Glass Tornado's dome were emulating a serene night sky, with a full moon shining its reflection on the quasi-ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night, guys! Great work today!\" Mavis beckoned before diving back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you round, Mavis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, miss Mavis! I look forward to our further acquaintanceship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Mavis disappeared into the pool, leaving me and Kalinka alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good night, Kalinka! it's been really nice meeting you.\" I held out a hand for her to shake. She looked down at it and up to me, but rather than take it back, she stepped up to me and grabbed me in a friendly, yet surprisingly tight hug for somebody as short as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, mister Gregory! It's been wonderful meeting you!\" She beamed as she broke away, giggling at a blush I could feel warming onto my cheeks. \"You are a very cool guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...you're pretty cool yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more eloquently as it could've been, Kalinka nonetheless smiled and skipped off, waving goodbye at me. \"Bye, bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye!\" I waved back, watching her till she rounded a corner and out of sight behind some trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could better hear some mellow hula music playing somewhere in the distance now that I was alone, and I took a breath to finally settle down for the day, gazing up at the fake sky. It'd been pretty...interesting, to say the least, but at least there'd been plenty of color and excitement to relish in that I'd never seen for a while. On top of that, I'd made a new friend. A friend I could look in the eye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at the day's former energy, standing still in the plaza before I started for the route back to the employee suites.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A month or so goes by, and all is well with Kalinka settling into her job at the Aurora, I noticed. Her events drew the largest crowds, and even if she wasn't doing a full show, the ambiance she offered permeated the establishment and seemed to soak into the patrons, turning the environment into a club that's always buzzing with energy, even when the night was over and it was time for cleanup in the morning. Mavis was beside herself with joy at how popular an attraction the Aurora had come to be, with none of the hype dying out after a few days or a week or two as Kalinka kept the entire music stash she had fresh with new tracks when she could get them, as well as remixes done by her in order to make sure the club never got stale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did keep a close eye on her, however, to try and make sure she didn't blow up like the rest of the residents, as Mavis had asked. With the amount of successes she had, it was something common to see Mavis herself giving her a couple extras during the afterparty or treating her to a couple extra special snacks. Sometimes, the patrons slipped her one or two extra drinks as well, the occasional dessert or hors d'ouerve, leading to her having to take them in order to be seen as polite. I watched her as she tried to keep such a thing to a minimum, even posting a sign that said \"Please don't feed the DJ!\" to try and deter party members from slipping her too many extras. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't to last, I saw, as she steadily grew over the weeks. A button loose here, a popped seam there, a tug of the shirt down on occasion, and soon little slivers of soft flesh were pouring the gaps as I watched her walk away from the booth after a good night. Deep blushes and nervous giggles followed the sounds of her seams popping whenever it happened, and she took to hiding from both me and Mavis whenever incidents like that happened, and the next day she had a few more colorful patches covering the holes in her slacks along with newly-sewn buttons with plenty of play. Still, she grew bigger, and bigger still, I noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one day, Mavis and I noticed that she was gone from the DJ booth almost as soon as the night finished. The blubbery, bulging giant of a penguin lumbered over, more than a bit concerned as she watched Kalinka's habits grow odder and odder over the past few weeks, her even larger frame quaking with every movement. \"I could've sworn she was here earlier....I saw her light show over the crowd, and she freaked out quite a bit during one of her dance numbers in the booth. After that she seemed fine but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as the lights came on and she shut it off, she ran to the back really quick,\" I finished. I had noticed it. She skittered out with that newfound chub wobbling on her frame, hands clasped to her backside to shield it from prying eyes. I could only imagine what actually happened. So far as heading up to the surface, Mavis was the only one who could taxi me and her back at this point, with the underwater shuttle having shipped all the guests up at closing. \"I'll go look for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis nodded, her even thicker chins meshing with her bulk as she began to stomp away, fat feet causing the floor to shake. \"Alright, just be gentle with her...maybe I have been giving her a bit too much on the side...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and everyone else here. You like her that much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't say you don't like her too!\" She quipped back before going to get a broom, wanting to get the litter cleaned up off the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed a little before shaking it away, concentrating on finding the AWOL DJ who had obviously experienced something unsettling. As I moved my way back towards the storage area, where props and other party favors were kept along with the entrance to the pantry, I heard soft, musical muttering as well as a couple of hiccups, most of it panicked and nervous. Looking around the corner, I found a tall and a bit wide shadow hiding towards the back, Kalinka's obvious sense of style sticking out like a sore thumb thanks to all the flair. She was stroking her middle and grabbing at the newfound fluff, squeezing her soft lovehandles and fretting about her size. Something else was off about her as I stepped around the bend, coughing a little to make myself known. \"Hey there! You kinda had us worried...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger Eastern European let out a sharp squeak before turning around, blushing darkly underneath her hair. Turning around to face me, I caught sight of what had been causing her so much distress: she was quite a bit bigger than she was before, not just in girth but in height! She was taller than me, easily over six feet, and to add that, she was a good hundred or so pounds heavier which gave her the fluffy, pear-shaped frame she sported. Looking her up and down, I witnessed the shrunken legs of her slacks, her shoes starting to tear thanks to larger feet, and how she had been doing all she could to keep her clothes from riding up on her considerable new width. Despite all this, the silence was broken by her stomach rumbling, causing her to mutter a soft curse before she hung her head in shame. \"D-da...now you see why I've been hiding...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kalinka, you should've told Mavis! At the very least she'd listen to you, even with the guests trying to slip you drinks and food. You could've just put it all aside and eaten it later!\" I said, feeling my heart wince as she flinched a bit at my tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-in my culture, it's impolite not to accept gifts! E-especially from co-workers, supervisors a-and clientele! I-it's a sign of good faith! I-I'm paying for it, t-though...<i>verdammen,</i> I mean, I-I'm taller than you...a-and I know it's something you looked f-forward to, s-seeing someone your own height...\" Kalinka replied, fiddling with a couple of her ribbons on her arms, twirling them about her slightly thicker fingers as she looked away. She wasn't like the others here, that was certain; unlike most of the guests, who reveled in their absurd displays of gluttony and growth, the Euro girl was bashful, perhaps a bit afraid of her new size and maybe...worried about me? I sighed, rubbing the back of my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it's not that bad yet. Besides...\"</span></div></div>",

Kalinka looked a little stunned as I mentioned magic, but knowing this place and what it was doing to her already, she shrugged, grinning sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, <i>tovarisch</i>, lead the way!\" Kalinka cheered before feeling the breeze of the Aurora's cold environment brush across her exposed belly, multicolored eyes widening a bit before she giggled nervously, the thought of going out dressed in tatters of her old outfit a little more than embarrassing. \"Erm...do you mind if we get me something else to wear? I can't just go w-walking around like this out in the resort, da?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly realized the implications as I stared at her exposed figure, the fluffy pear-shape leaking through her pants and shirt as the front buttons were completely decimated by her newfound flesh, flashing the black bra she wore underneath, along with her puffed-up assets and fattened tummy. Staring at the muffin top a little while longer, I was lost in thought before she coughed, just a bit of a warning that I was debating a little too much and spacing out. \"Sorry! Yeah, let's go get you something else to wear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take horribly long to explain the situation to Mavis, who was pretty sympathetic when she realized that her own habits had been rubbing off too much on Kalinka, despite her words at the beginning of her gig at the Aurora. For a temporary fix, she gave her a large, white shirt fit for bartending duties as well as a wrap to keep around her waist to hide the tears in her slacks. The shoes we couldn't do much for, but so long as they still worked, Kalinka could wear them. Mavis taxiing us to the surface was also going to take a lot longer than we really needed, so we managed to catch a monorail up to the Aether Suites, where our destination lay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalinka had never been in the Aether Suites for any reason since she had been here, content to stick around her room and make sure to keep out of trouble, which was a plus for us. Seeing the vast building in all of its decadent glory nearly floored her, with the scope of the hotel stunning her into silence. It was made for clientele of much more towering sizes-Miss Holmes herself was around 50-60 feet tall! Needing height to match the girth of most of its guests, it was a colossal undertaking similar to the scale of the pyramids at Giza, or even the Roman coliseum. As I began to walk away from the station, I had to tug her along thanks to her awestruck mind, watching as her eyes swam at the grandeur and glamour of the residency. \"C'mon, we don't have time for sightseeing. It'll be better if no one catches us here. We'll be home free in Miss Blanc's room, but we've got to move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-da! <i>Ich bitte Sie!</i>\" She sputtered as she tripped over her own larger legs, a blush on her cheeks with her stumbles. The Aether Suites were usually no place for a human unless there was maintenance to be done-for us to be here now was certainly a troublesome occurrence, and if one of the guests besides the ones I was friendly with found out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was certainly going to be unpleasant for both of us. How unpleasant depended on Miss Holmes' mood that day. Thankfully it didn't take me too long to find Miss Blanc's quarters; her rooms were some of the largest thanks to her indomitable girth. Looking at the near hangar bay-sized doors that would open up into the massive moth's suite, I rang the doorbell gently, hoping that she was awake and not totally engrossed in a new RPG. With my luck, I heard the soft voice flutter from the speaker, a sigh of relief passing my lips. \"Yes? Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Blanc? It's Gregory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause. The sound of a drink being slurped. \"Oh, Mister Gregory! It's been a long time! I know Miss Holmes keeps you busy, but I've been missing your company. I liked our two-player free for alls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she hasn't given me much time to myself as of late. I'm the jack of all trades, what can I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scheduling a visit more often would be a start,\" she offered, giggling softly before clearing her throat. \"So what can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look around, watching Kalinka gaze at the corners of the massive hall nervously. I knew exactly what she was thinking too; after I told her about some of the things that certain guests of the hotel do to humans...especially to the other staff. Realizing that time was of the essence lest we get caught by the more unsavory members of the clientele, I replied, \"Miss Blanc, could you let me in first? I have a friend that needs a bit of assistance, and...well, I'd rather not get caught out here, especially with us needing to be on duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic moth woman paused as she contemplated this. I sweated a little, wondering if it was too much to ask a friend, especially of her status.Hearing the thundering footsteps of the colossal furry residents in the background, I was more than wholeheartedly going to resign myself and Kalinka to finding someone else's help at this point, not wanting to stress out Miss Blanc with another request like this. Grabbing Kalinka's cool, sweaty palm before starting to tug her away from the door, I heard a window-shaking belch erupt from the speaker, the leviathanic moth huffing a little and tittering. \"O-oh! Pardon me, Mr. Gregory! I was just finishing up a snack....here, let me open the door!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cry of relief issued from the tubbified DJ while I dragged the back of my hand across my slick forehead, relieved that she had just been eating. Loud clicks and churns come from the doors as the giant mechanism which operates the massive entryway starts to unwind, releasing the doors just enough to allow me and a thicker Euro girl through. \"Thank you so much, Miss Blanc!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe slipped inside without a second thought, the doors groaning before the mechanism began to slide them shut once more, hissing softly before creaking with the gentlest slam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic, overfed, plush mass of fat wobbled below the platform we stood on, a huge LCD TV extending from the ceiling in front of it, casting a bright, artificial glow onto our figures. Miss Blanc's face was surrounded by a mass of thick, beefy chin rolls, propping up enormously fat cheeks that quivered with every snack that she levitated into her hungry maw. Her bulk was covered by soft, fine fur, the volume adding to her already ludicrous size, and I could swear that she was growing bigger with every bite. I even heard the room creak softly, a testament to her ridiculous girth, and her bulky little hands pattered at the controls of her game, nearly nestled within massive pillows of flesh she called her arms. Kalinka was too stunned to speak, staring at the sea of impossibly fat moth. I could only assume that her mind was roaming at the possibility of her own body exploding outwards like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So! What brings you here today, Mister Gregory? I see you brought a new friend...and a human too! Though, she's quite a bit plumper than I expected...\" The colossal moth woman mentioned, smiling widely. I blush a little, and the colorful DJ manages to wave nervously, still thoroughly intimidated by Miss Blanc's immensity. Hearing her refer to Kalinka, however, I knew it was going to be quite a bit easier to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...she does, actually. She's been trying hard to keep a good diet, but unfortunately, Mavis' habits and the guests' gifts have sorta made her blow up. She was five-nine when she got here-now she's even taller than me! It's worrying her quite a bit.\" I motion towards Kalinka, who was now nervously playing with her belly fat. The mass of moth beneath us hummed quizzically, taking a bite out of a huge pizza that she was eating like a small bagel, her flesh almost seeming to puff up before our eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe answered after another minute, not unkindly, \"I don't see any problem with getting bigger, but I understand she'd be worried. She IS a human after all, and for her to be exposed to our meals like this is startling. I know a number of aethereal techniques which should be able to help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalinka was nearly floored with happiness as she bowed gratefully, nodding feverishly before she caught her hat as it tipped over. \"Y-yes! T-that would be fantastic, Miss Blanc! I...I would like to be small again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lilting giggle floated through the air which tickled our ears, Kalinka sputtering at the gentle sound which seemed to appeal to her auditory expertise. \"Then it's settled. Now, I can give you two things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A/N: Sorry for taking so long!)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...and I think I know <i>just</i> the thing you two would like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc swelled out her chest with a deep, heavy breath, gently shutting her compound eyes as she raised both of her arms, her stubby black palms facing us. From deep within her throat came a loud, swarming hum that resonated past the copious flab filling her body and vibrated through the air, tickling straight into my heart, and I assume Kalinka's as well, who visibly flinched at the same time as I.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Miss Blanc, the bookshelf that covered the wall rattled as numerous bottles standing upon the shelves shook in place. Miss Blanc's humming didn't seem <i>that</i> loud, I thought, but the assorted trinkets actually fluttered off their spots and floated through the air, hovering around in the air above her. A mixing bowl from the top shelf joined in, and the bottles poured their diversely colored fluids straight into the mixing bowl, which erupted a rainbow's worth of clouds of smoke between each addition. Miss Blanc's humming rose several octaves, and the bowl floated in front of us to see the clear pink fluid inside shivering under the buzzing sound waves, which actually seemed to help the ingredients bond with one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when her pitch reached its peak, the bowl gave an orange explosion that made me and Kalinka jump. When the subsequent black smoke drifted away, what was left was a pure, crystalline transparence tinted by magenta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...it is done.\" Miss Blanc whispered. She floated a ladle into her hand and took a scoop filled to the brim with the pink-lemonade looking potion, offering it to Kalinka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what's this?\" Kalinka wearily asked, swishing the potion around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing toxic. Just drink it in full, and by the night is done you'll be as good as when you arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalinka's mouth stretched as she brought the potion closer to her face, but she nonetheless threw caution to the wind and drunk it down in an impressively quick swig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed the ladle back to Miss Blanc, which froze dead in midair before it could hit anything, but she expectantly looked back down at her belly, clearly dissatisfied that it didn't deflate then and there. \"When will it happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it a few hours. Let it have a chance to know you.\" Miss Blanc noted sagely, turning back to a grocery bag stuffed with cheeseburgers, which she started stuffing down by the fistful. \"Anything else you guys would like? A drink, or a gaming session?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. Sorry, Miss Blanc, but technically we're still supposed to be working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Well, I guess you two better get back to it, then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. See ya, Miss Blanc!\" I bid, skipping a few steps on the platforms ladder as I made my way down. Kalinka followed, but with understandable difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Danke,</i> Miss Blanc! I'm in debt for your kindness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, you two! See you around some time!\" Miss Blanc waved goodbye, then whipped out a game controller hitting the power button to the console as we shuffled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything set, the two of us headed for the monorail station as swiftly and quietly as we could, but the bar was set pretty high on account of Kalinka's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly?\" Kalinka patted her distended belly, smiling lightly. \"It feels good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great to hear. Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConveniently, the monorail was just parked at of the station when we'd arrived, and the two of us managed to scrounge an empty car in the back, left alone for the journey back to the Glass Tornado...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours went through the usual procedure for hooking the place up, but with a nice amount of weight lifted of the three of us' shoulders, some more than others. But as the day kept going into the night, I could sense a bit of worry from Mavis as she occasionally glanced at the DJ booth, worried at each sight of a still unskinny Kalinka wiring the displays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...any luck with that friend of yours?\" Mavis asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said it'd take a few hours, so I'd say we'll see results any minute now.\" I recited. \"It needs to <i>know</i> her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm all for first impressions, but I still wanna know if one of my best workers is gonna be alright to work tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she'll be alright.\" Come to think of it, Kalinka'd been acting fairly \"alright\" for most of her weight episode, considering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done here, Miss Mavis!\" Kalinka cheered from her station, somehow to both Mavis' joy and nerves. \"I could play to my heart's content now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great to hear, Kalinka...Anything else I should know?\" Mavis pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not that I can think of, but...gh...<i>oh!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom across the club, I could see Kalinka clutch her stomach and hunch over, letting out a grunt in discomfort. I was a lot quicker than Mavis was in running over to the DJ booth to see if Kalinka was alright, '<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Kalinka, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I feel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never got the chance to finish as her body started to change. Underneath the coat she wore, I could see her body flatten out, for a fraction of a second's fraction filling me with joy at our little journey's success, but snapped back, to my horror swelling out past their former girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kalinka, what's happeni...\" I could hear Mavis run up behind me, but she fell dead silent, backing away from what I could only assume was today's worst possible outcome coming to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, but with a growing pace, Kalinka's breasts swelled out several cup sizes, even for her expanding scale as her body stretched up another few inches, the tips of her shoes shredding apart to expose two rows of pudgy toes with nails painted black. Her stomach bloated out further and further, growing until her marshmallowy flesh puffed out of her shirt till it was only covered down to the belly button. However, most strikingly of all, her butt just kept growing, and growing, and growing, and <i>growing</i>. Her leg's expansion dominated the rest of her body's as the weight of her ballooning thighs kept sagging on top of the almost elephant-thick girth of her calves, unleashing a symphony of tearing that shredded through a good dozen areas of her pants, exposing her dough-like skin to the Aurora's cold air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire time, Kalinka's eyes were clenched shut as what must've been an army of sensations clamored against her body, till finally she sputtered to a stop, barely clothed in the remaining tatters of her colorful getup. Her eyes innocently fluttered open for the first time since growing, able to see me and Mavis gawking at her, utterly horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Choice 1:</b> Understandably, Kalinka flips out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Choice 2:</b> Kalinka takes up a little curiosity towards her body...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a mercilessly long stretch of time, the arctic breeze whistling through the club was the only sound to be heard between us three. Kalinka's eyes pointed down her body, growing wider as she crawled back into full reality from the sensory overload she'd just endured, while Mavis and I could take the full brunt of what happened in absolute horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K...Kalinka?\" I spoke. \"...are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalinka's face went as awake as she could be, but despite all the (non-literal) blubbering we'd seen out of her, she didn't seem the least bit sickened by the sight of her new, oversized body. Curious, in fact. She'd finally expressed motion by moving her hands beneath the underside and lifting it up a few inches, then dropping it back down, popping off another button from her shirt in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe craned her head back to look down along her back, eyes going huge at the mammoth pair of buttocks that flared from her rear end, the fleshy globes tearing themselves a nice window into their shadowy valley by the tear growing at the very back of her belt look. She pressed her palms into her hips, partially touching the exposed skin jutting from the rips along her jeans as she took in that her behind was, indeed, the behemoth each of us were all seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Kalinka?\" Mavis peeped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then, against any remote sense of human logic or the absolute terror Mavis and I'd endured, she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...hmmmmmm!\" She hummed, fingers coming back up to stroke along the vastly exposed skin of her belly. \"This...I'm feeling great! <i>Moshchnyy,</i> in fact!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what the actual <i>hell</i> is going on here?!\" Mavis demanded, with me thinking just the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around a few times, Kalinka turned her attention to a row of barstools bolted into the ground. With surprising grace, she spun around and shuffled backwards towards the seats, lowering her seismic arse down on top of three all at once. Their heads were utterly engulfed by the soft weight of her but dropping down and squeezing through the gaps, crimping a bend into each of their poles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel with<i> great </i>vigor! I mean, back then I was such a small one, but now...\" She gave her belly a gentle smack, unleashing a ripple that tore off yet another button, flaring out more skin. \"...I have such <i>body!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis and I stepped up before the row of seats. She rose back onto her feet, and was going to say more, I could tell, but then she looked at me. She <i>really</i> looked at me, giving me an interest that she'd never given me before, even as friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe standing in my spot felt all the more stiff, especially as she came my way, coming incredibly close...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and you, Gregory...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and snatched me up to give me a hug tighter and squishier than any of the goodbye hugs she'd often give out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are absolutely <i>adorable!</i>\" She squealed, pressing my face right into her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mph! Klnkpha, hld mm!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...easy, there Kalinka...\" Mavis asked, trying to calm the shakes in her voice. \"...I'm sure you're having fun, but let's just take things one step at a time, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! <i>Entschuldigung...</i>\" Kalinka let me go for air, setting me back on my feet. I stood in place, watching Kalinka as she turned around and skipped away, humming, but my eyes didn;t suck in and digest the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I <i>could</i> digest a lot better was Mavis' face looming over me when I turned around, with enough of her face peeking over her belly and breasts for me to see her leering back with a hellish glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You...have...<b>killed me!!!!</b></i>\" She seethed through a clenched beak, bending forward with each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mavis, I'm <i>so sorry! </i> I swear, Miss Blanc's never messed up on stuff like this before! I had no idea <i>this</i> was gonna happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Miss Blanc's better know how to run a DJ booth, and own a forklift big enough to lug her ass around, 'cause what the hell can we do, now?! We go on in<i> twenty minutes!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! Just...just lemme think, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when I stepped around to face the dance floor, Kalinka did all the thinking for me. Mavis herself I could hear pausing at the sight, before shuffling her great bulk around to follow my lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, with all the grace of a ballerina, Kalinka was jovially skating around on the icy floor, spinning with a grace you wouldn't see from somebody half the size se was now exploring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...we might live through tonight.\" I observed. \"Maybe if <i>that's</i> how easy the show'll be, we might have an extra day or two for Miss Blanc to make an antidote. How's that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy words hung around as Mavis stayed silent, but I could almost see her face and shoulders drooping as she let out a tense, yet relaxed breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If tonight's a bomb, <i>you'll</i> be her weight trainer.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kalinka's upbeat personality after her abrupt transformation to an even more towering, bottom-heavy fatty was more than a shock as Mavis told her to get ready for the show, the auburn-haired girl agreeing far too quickly despite her recent change of circumstances. Her enormous, quivering moons bounded slightly along with her immense, rippling thighs that tugged at what remained of her outfit, the DJ not even shedding her torn shoes as she trotted towards the sound booth. Thanks to its overall size, she was a better fit than one might expect as her hips slid past the icy walls of the DJ booth. It wasn't long before she was readying up her station once more, her girthier backside helping her in reaching the upper decks while simultaneously providing a much better cushion than the seat she had could ever be. Still, I couldn't help but hold a sense of trepidation, sweating a little despite the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the leviathanic mass of Penguin waddled her way over to me, her rolls spilling across the icy floor as she folded her arms up. \"I seriously hope you're right, Greg. If this doesn't go well, it's <i>all</i> of our heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, nodding a little. I had some confidence in this plan, having seen Kalinka playfully shuffling about despite her much larger frame, but watching her squirm inside of the booth and try to get a bit more comfortable worried me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The show must go on,\" I muttered a bit glumly, hoping that tonight's show was as much of a success as her previous ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was a complete smash, if not even moreso thanks to the size of their musical host, I noticed. As I helped keep the bar running for Mavis while gigantic, lardy and beefy beasts tore up the dance floor to the rampant beat of electroswing, I kept glancing back to see what Kalinka would do with her much wider body, trying to fit it all in the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't disappointed by her ingenuity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking some spare neon paint that she had laying around so that she could see the buttons and consoles inside of the DJ's box, she had spread it with her chubby fingers across the vast expanses of her thighs and her stomach, her fluffy rolls adorned with swirling designs and eye-catching flair that quaked and quivered as she danced about as much as she could without destroying her equipment, a flash of pearly whites on a pudgier face letting me know that she was having just as much fun as before, if not more due to the bounciness of her fat. She partied it up with the best of them, Kalinka's thunderous steps rolling in tune with the music as she swapped tracks like a master, never missing a beat despite her lardaceous figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BRAAAAP!</b> Oooh, sorry, Greg. Seems like you were right though. Despite being much more of a fat ass than she was before, she's...well...still got it,\" Mavis finished lamely, having been chugging down soda like a woman possessed as she awaited the clientele's reaction to the much fatter European woman. She rubbed at her temples, slamming an empty can down on the counter near where I stood. \"Pleeeaaase tell me you have some aspirin or somethin'. My head's pounding from the stress egg I was nesting on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Mavis. At least it turned out well in the end, right? Well, besides the fact that she grew so huge,\" I offer, putting out a bottle of aspirin fit for someone of the penguin's stature. Watching her swipe it up and down it, I looked back at the DJ booth, the lights flashing and the floor lighting along with the melody pouring from the speakers. I was almost entranced by the wobbling waves of fat flesh that the sunburst-haired girl was displaying before I remembered what I was doing, turning back to the owner of the Aurora Night Club, \"Good thing is it buys us time until we figure out what to do with her. Next show isn't for a couple days, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive penguin nodded, slumping a little against the counter. \"Yeah...get on it, pronto. Since you're going to be helping for a bit until Miss Holmes calls you away, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThumping beats and the sound of a saxophone waxed across the dance hall as the night wore on, and the only thing I could think of is getting Kalinka to agree to go see Miss Blanc again.</span></div></div>",

She didn't even leave the booth after her victory pose for the finale, and just slumped down to brush up the dashboard as the party broke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis went off for some paperwork, far more easy headed than from our revelation some hours ago, giving me ample time to business. When I invited myself into the DJ's workspace, she was cleaning up the controls from a layer of hors d'oeuvres, drinks, and even whole sandwiches still sitting on their plates, and was only halfway through gnashing away at her \"gifts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even notice I was in the doorway until she gave me a stray glance from reaching for another plate, and smiled back. \"Well, what did you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were great! Gave Mavis a few thousand favors, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalinka hummed, swiveling her seat to turn back on the DJ board. I didn't speak, instead eyeing the white tracts of blubber that pushed free of her clothing. Along the elaborate design of bodypaint she'd slathered around her stomach, I could see cracks forming on the dried regions where her foodstuffed girth was pulling them apart, with strips of clean skin along the top and bottom as her shirt was pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I was ogling her stomach, I couldn't pull away from her legs when I looked down, where the gaping rips in her pants were torn even wider...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I was thinking that tomorrow morning, we'd meet at the lobby of the suites to check up on Miss Blanc. How's that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor just a few milliseconds, her hand faltered in bringing a burrito to her mouth, face dropping just the tiniest bit. \"<i>Da</i>, that sounds...fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her stomach, at its size and the colorful pattern she'd given it for quite a while before looking back at me, smiling sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I stay like this for a <i>little</i> longer more? <i>V\u00e4nligen?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little...what're you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun the seat around to face me, grabbing her belly by some of its folds. \"I've been in <i>hundreds</i> of shows, Mr. Gregory, and I'd toured almost every corner in the country of Europe...but <i>that?\"</i> She pointed a thumb at the window, back at the littered dance floor. \"That was the <i>best show</i> I'd ever had!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? <i>That</i> was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rapidly nodded, quaking her extra chins as her legs hoisted her up from the stool. \"I've never had anything like that before! It was...it was...<i>krasivaya</i>! Pure, singing music!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...okay, but how does you being this big help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got <i>bounce!</i>\" She cheered, smacking her buttock to unfurl a subtle ripple that shook over to the other. \"I've got size! I've got body!  I even have my very own billboard!\" She giggled, holding a hand under her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Kalinka, I know you had a lot of fun tonight, but this can't be healthy! I'm sorry, but we should really-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>please</i>?\" She begged, in an instant looking more like a child, even though she stood a head over me. \"Just a few more pounds? A little longer? It's all I ask!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a few seconds to respond, take back by her eagerness. \"Kalinka, listen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please?!\" She dropped on the floor, almost sending cracks into it as she laced her fingers under the biggest, most heartbreaking set of puppy dog eyes I'd ever seen. \"<i>PleasepleasepleasepleasePLEASE!?!!?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blubbering struck me away, pushing me back a few steps. I searched the back of my head for anything I could've used to respond, but came up empty. Somewhere on the way there, however, I scraped along to that flinch I felt when I scolded her this morning, where I could see that little break in her that was torn ten feet wide in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst all reasonable doubt... \"Just one show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" She gushed, nodding with a gleeful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to think a few days ahead, but couldn't go far, and just let out a tired breath. \"Alright. One more show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you! <i>Danke!</i>\" As though she weighed as much as she did a month ago, she rocketed back onto her feet, arms shooting out to wrap around my chest and faceplant me into her neck, where she rested her chin along my hair and massaged my head with a giddy hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Bmft jtht m mrr shw, alrght?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more show! I promise!\" Her arms relaxed, letting me break from her chins and feel the cold air again. \"I'll finish here, then help you. Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I...I think I'll be fine on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalinka went back to 'work,' nearly impaling the ground with her stool as she hopped over and jumped right on, grabbing for more of her feast. I stood in the doorway before I'd left, watching her hunch over and gorge herself with fatttening food before letting out a foggy sigh and going back to the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">~ The Next Morning... ~</div></b></span></div></div>",

She said it herself that she'd lose the weight, so we should be in the clear, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis groaned and threw up her arms, denting the necks of the stools behind her as sat down by falling onto them. \"Gregory, I hunted Kalinka down to help make our jobs <i>easier</i>, but I've had to walk the tightrope <i>two times</i> since she'd been hired!

Trust me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I spoke, Mavis' eyes narrowed a little more with every word she heard. When I'd finished up, she held her look in silence, but soon let her face soften out with a tired sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, it's just one more show.\" I repeated. \"After that, I swear, I'll take her hand right out off the booth and down to Miss Blanc's room, and everthing'll be right back to normal.

A lot can happen in three days, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, for example?\" She quipped, smacking a girthy arm along her ocean of a belly. \"I've put on <i>2,072 pounds</i> since all this started up! From <i>worryeating,</i> if you don't mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to retort, but it only died trying to come out as I took a closernlook at Mavis' gut. If it were even possible, it bursted out even further from her body with a great deal of bounce, a lot more than what I'd gotten to know. I didn't even notice it until then, but most of the buttons on her jumbo-jumbo uniform had to be undone to contain its cobstantly expanding build, and I could practically hear the next one geing choked to keep together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same goes for her, too. When she came in, she looked like she'd eaten <i>Olivia!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, I wanted to counter, but I only looked over at the DJ booth, instead. Kalinka was inside, going off the humming and rustling of wires, but she was too hunched over to see more than her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I couldn't help but feel that the two hills of her back fat sagged more loose from her shirt than before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" Mavis added. \"I'm no braniac on magic, so you're more in on this than I am. Still, this is really important, so I want you to be honest: <i>are you sure about this?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned my head back at Mavis, who looked me right dead in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yeah.\" I let out. \"Yeah, I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was still as serious as ever, not changing from my answer until she gave a single nod. \"...alright, then. I trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout us sharing another word, Mavis grabbed the table and grunted, using all her might to push her body's sheer mass back on its feet. I only looked down at the broom I was holding and kept sweeping around the icy floor as Mavis waddled back to whatever paperwork was waiting for her, the rattling of the seats lightening up the further away she became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just a few more days.</i> I repeated to myself. <i>Just have to sit around a few more days of what we've already been going through, just with a bit of a watchful eye, and then everything will be fixed up A-okay.

When I turned my head to the guest, it may as well have popped out of nowhere when I was smacked by the sight of the vast, white forefront some feet away from me of a wide, <i>wide</i> landmass of flesh with a deep navel in the center, a stomach so overblown that it swelled out over her legs and plopped along an enormous patch of ice in a towering orb of silver-tinted blubber that utterly dwarved my twiggy figure, probably even putting on a few notches for Mavis' belt alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reeling from the giant mass of belly for some seconds, I took some several steps back, trying to get a look at the overflowing mounds crammed into a yellow hoodie along its roof, but I felt something in my heart sink like lead when I saw a shark's snout poking through a head of straight black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips were crinkled up in a grin, sort of like the common sneer that most other sharks'd been evolved into, but something about hers seemed a lot more relaxed and cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing I hadn't answered, I went back to sweeping. \"Yeah. Yeah, I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would'n happen to know another human here named Kalinka, would you?\" She asked, speaking in an Australian accent as thick as Vegemite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped sweeping. \"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a fellow DJ wantin' to check up on some business, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh. \"That's not some kind of double talk, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark lady let out a snort. \"I'm guessin' you don't read Neo-pop monthly, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't, but when we heard a long, high pitch gasp being sucked in somewhere at the DJ booth, I could almost tell Kalinka was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of us looked over at the sound, Kalinka was now standing in view, considerably wider, like Mavis'd described, but her blubber-laden face was lit up in utter astonishment at the stranger in front of me, hands cupped over her mouth. She swished her fingers along her eyes and, proving my theory right, plucked out the contacts to stare and blink with blue, uncovered irises...</span></div></div>",

She stamped a foot down on the booth's panel (actually denting the metal down the center), thrust a finger out at the shark lady, and screamed...<i>something</i>, I couldn't tell it it was in German, Swedish, Russian, or even just English that was horribly butchered by her rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of whether or not she understood what she'd heard, the shark lady smiled in the face of Kalinka's anger, leaning against an icy support beam to revel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalinka rolled over the booth, now so big that the tips of her assceeks actually scraped against the roof as she passed through, and the laws of physics also seemed to forget that she weighed in at several-plus thousands of pounds as she strode over to us, each step she made rippling cracks into the layer of ice on the floor. I flinched and tucked my head down as she came to a skid just halfway between us, close enough that I expected to get smushed between the two of them as she slid on the balls of her feet, but she stopped just in time for me to stand right in the middle of the subsequent stare down, the shark casting Kalinka a wry grin as the suddenly belligerent European girl valiantly kept herself from foaming at the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!!!\" She screeched. \"<i>\u041a\u0420\u0415\u0422\u0418\u041d!!!

Name's Gregory. Nice to meet you.\" I added, letting go of my hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, where's my manners?\" The shark lady answered, taking a step or two back to offer me her hand. \"Cassie Stride, DJ for hire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How <i>dare</i> you imply contaminating him with your touch?!\" Kalinka spat, smacking Cassie's hand away before I could to dare shake it. Even if it wasn't directed at me, I found myself wincing at the coldness that now laced her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, c'mon, Kali, don't tell me you're still stale 'bout Bosnia, are you?\" Cassie sneered, a statement that made Kalinka's already flush cheeks even redder. \"<i>I</i> thought the audience seemed to be cheerin', don't you think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THEIR CHEERS WERE BIRTHED FROM<u><b> LIES!!!</b></u>\" Kalinka shrieked. She actually grabbed me under each arm and hoisted me out of the way, letting the face to face with their stomachs pressed together. \"<i><b>THEY WERE CORRUPTED BECAUSE OF YOUR CHARISMA AND MINDTRICKERY!!!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie snickered. \"Well, if it was<i> my</i> charisma they were fallin' for, then you're act must've set the bar pretty low for it to work, bud.\"</span></div></div>",

She was shaking from head to toe, blubber quaking at the boiling fury underneath that cuddly outer layer. The thought popped in my head that I would be witness to  the first real brawl that had ever happened at the Aurora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kalinka finally managed to control herself enough to speak fluently again, the grinding sound of her clenched teeth leaving the air, her voice left the room absolutely frigid. \"<b>\u010cern\u00e1 srdce podvodn\u00edk</b>...very well then!

A more appropriate way to settle this. I promised Mister Gregory here one more show before I go...ahem, to the good doktor and get checked out.

So far as prizes, I will consult with my <i>Tovarishchi</i> on the specifics and will let you know a day in advance of the contest. Honorable, <i>da?</i>\" Kalinka folded her meaty arms and tapped a fat foot impatiently,  staring at the shark girl with those hard blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too long before Cassie's upper lip curled and she started to snicker, breaking down into heaving belly laughs which shook the meaty, white expanse that lay upon the floor. The sound wasn't unpleasant; I was just wholly unused to her attitude versus other shark guests in Gaia. Sneering over her snout, she bumped her enormous belly up even further against Kalinka, staring down at the colorful DJ. \"Honorable duel, huh? Sounds like it'll be fun~ Ya better bring yer A-game this time, Kali, if ya want t'prove me wrong~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll hang around here for a bit anyway; see the sights, maybe get some info on how you've been doin', hm?\" The grandiose shark turned around, her tail bopping Kalinka's swollen middle a little as she began to waddle off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood next to the fuming giant as her nemesis left, the warmth returning as the object of her ire disappeared.

We'd gone to the same school, went to the same camps, had <i>many</i> sleepovers, and made even more music together, some being the very first ones I'd ever birthed. We weren't just friends...we were <i>familj</i>, never at a moment where one was too far to help when the other was in need...\" She shut her eyes, her face and chest deflating with a glum sigh. \"...I guess that's why I didn't notice the signs for so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The signs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When she brought one of <i>our </i>songs to school as <i>her</i> project.\" She replied, her voice warming with anger once more. \"That was the very first, but it went right over my head. As our piece, I thought that...that she had just a right to it as me, that it was one of those times where I had to just turn the other cheek and let it sail...I never told anybody, and didn't even ask when we met at lunch, with everything seeming just as normal as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but then it happened again.\" Her jaw fastened up. \"And again.

It was six songs or so until I finally asked, but she just...sneered at me with that little sneer of hers, the same that she used when she was puppeteering all the other students with her lies and trickery!

She hit a pause in her tangent, and the Aurora was totally silent as we just sat there together, me leaning back in shock of the sorrow that now graced the improbably jubilant titans at my side, sickened to hear the happiness in her voice disappear, replaced with what I could tell were years and years of repressed anger and sadness finally coming up to surface after so long. Probably then was the most scared I'd ever felt in Gaia 2.0 when I wasn't the prey of some massive anthro, even while I wasn't the one her anger was directed towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and <i><b>then</b></i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Bosnia?\" I finished for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>Madame Corsage.</b></i>\" She snarled, her head coming back up with that same rage as when Cassie was present. \"My idol!

We actually talked, chatting through our work sessions and on the train ride there, just like we always had. We had dinner together, got into our rooms, and I had trouble sleeping, I was so excited, unable to believe our greatest dream as a duo was to come true...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and it was a security guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A security guard?\" I repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalinka bared her teeth as she gave a feral growl, fists clenching and in desperate need of something to crush. \"That...<i><b>\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0435</b></i> wasn't even there the next morning to say it to my face! I left my room, searching every square of the grounds for her, only to be kicked out, my ticket claimed to be a forgery, and I was abandoned right to the fences, watching everything from a distance! She...\" She paused, still leering into space in utter rage, but was shaken up as she sucked on her own lips, eyes softening with a wet glimmer. \"She was performing <i>my</i> songs! Everybody was cheering for <i>her,</i> the judges shouting her all the praise a DJ can get, and...and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, it all became too much, and she ripped my beating heart right out of my chest by letting out a lone sniffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Madame Corsage...she called her a genius. They shook hands...and she got her reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rind of a tear started forming in her eye, and I attentively took her hand, unable to bear to see her cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...Kalinka, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't realize my vault was emptied out until I returned to my room, but by then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey...it's okay.\" I got up from my seat and stood before her, my hands carefully going up to take her by the shoulders. Kalinka gladly took the notion and swiped me up in her big, meaty arms, sinking me deep into the warmth of her oversized belly's mass as she hugged me close and tight, her chin resting on my head as she held me almost cherishingly. I felt something cold and wet drip down on my cheek that seemed to all from her face, but it was only that one tear, to my calm sense of mind. \"It's okay...I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th...Thank you, Mister Gregory.\" She whispered, her grip constricting me just a little bit more. \"I...You always seem so honest, so true, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, if I'd known what she'd done, Miss Holmes would've lobotomized me for what would've happened next.\" I quipped, something that made Kalinka giggle once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no, <i>Es tut uns leid</i>.\" She bade quietly as she let me go, a small smile having returned to her face as she wiped her damp cheek. \"Don't worry for me. It's not your problem at all, it's...\" But she looked back up at the door, then to the DJ panel, turning somber again. \"...mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and a guest's unhappiness is a fault on my duty.\" I recited, one of the few slogans Miss Holmes'd forced into me that I actually remembered. \"So not helping you would be a fault on my duty, as well. I know this is a big chance for you, but if just for my comfort, I want you to know that I wouldn't like going back to my room while knowing that you're just cooped up by yourself, working on this totally alone. Even if it's just for lighting and arrangement, I'm open for any help you'd need. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalinka's warm, kind demeanor came back in full as she smiled upon me. \"You...you'd do that for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's like Miss Holmes says. We're all here for the same reason!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Her legs jittered in joy, and she took me up in another hug that was a lot more mutual than the last, feeling much less tense and cold. \"You are so kind to me, Mister Gregory! <i>Danke!</i>\"</span></div></div>",

Kalinka's blue eyes opened as her enormously soft tummy rumbled slightly, causing her to gently grab me around the waist and lift me from my cushy resting place. Confused, I looked at her own puzzled face for a minute as she listened for it again, looking the smallest bit uncomfortable. Only a few seconds passed before her middle gurgled once more, her face flushing before a soft belch passed her plump lips. Looking at me out of the corner of my eyes, she giggled nervously, lowering me back down with a relieved sigh. \"<i>Sozhaleyu!</i> I think my belly's just a bit upset after all of that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke too soon as her body suddenly surged outward, her face falling in shock as the growth process began again. Her wide, soft face nearly doubled, then <i>tripled</i> in size, huge cheeks resting on top of a swelling set of neck and chin tires that tore apart the collar of her outfit within seconds.Those plump hands holding me up suddenly found themselves with much more girth, and Kalinka understandably panicked as she watched her arms fatten up even more, drawing her shirt sleeves tight before bursting them open like the casing of a sausage. The buttons on her vest snapped off before being followed by her shirt, exposing creamy expanses of blubber and a vastly overstuffed bra even for their relatively moderate size compared to her weight, her belly rolls surging upwards underneath before spilling out onto her expanding thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mister Gregory! I-I didn't do anything, I promise-!\" She whimpered as she grew out of control, deciding to lean over as far as she could and deposit me in front of her inflating mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only stare dumbstruck as the fattening moved towards her already obscenely huge lower half, Kalinka's plush hands attempting to hold some of it in to no avail. Fat feet ripped through what had remained of her shoes before her elephantine cankles rolled into blimp territory, topped by zeppelin-sized thighs and a massive, tanklike ass that put her previous size to shame. Backing up, I watched as her fat began to pulse outwards, giant rips opening in the sides of her pants before exposing her rolling tracts of pale fat which only seemed to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd <b><i>grow.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't just growing fatter; like before, she was growing <i>bigger</i> in every sense of the word. The waiflike DJ I had known days prior was gone, replaced by a bulking titan who was approaching the vastness of some of Gaia's biggest residents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her lardy body spread across the ice and her girth expanded to ever more ridiculous proportions, there was nothing I could but stand there and wait for the final result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of her growth spurt, Kalinka was positively behemothic in appearance...</span></div></div>",

I yanked off the phone and dialed a single '1', nervously beating my fist on the bar as the dial tone rung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mavis speaking.\" </i>Came her voice. <i>\"That you, Gregory?

She didn't sound the least bid mad, nor angry, but so tired, the most she'd sounded since Kalinka'd been hired. \"No, no, nonononono <i><b>NO</b></i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please tell her to hurry!\" Kalinka shivered, futilely trying to wrap her arms around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, just call up a water taxi, and...well...we'll think of something. First and foremost, though, we need a new set of clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething banged on the other end of the line, what I had a feeling sounded like Mavis' head hitting a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, Kalinka...\" Octavia chuckled nervously. \"I swear, sometimes you make me scared that the world's gonna run outta colors for you to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time since me and Kalinka'd waltzed into Octavia's boutique that the octopus fashionista seemed to let herself crack a smile, having gotten over the shock of seeing the young DJ as she now was, no longer the petite songstress she'd first met. Even more of a shock was seeing her come into the shop whilst in a massive tarp that was crudely dressed around her, now nothing more than a towel wrapped around her monolithic physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalinka seemed to be lightening up as well, with a slight giggle to be heard from outside of the changing room. The same that those of the more super-sized guests of the resort would normally use, but now it seemed cramped as both her and Octavia's robotic tank stood inside, what with Octavia having to take her measurements. Through the curtain, I could see her new figure silhouetted by the light inside, her truck-sized behind all but pushing against the walls of her new prison, the love handles resting along their cheeks totally visible while her shirt was off, the rolls left naked that formed between her chest and stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...a sight that I hated myself for chancing a glance at, blushing as I forced my sight forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, there was a loud <i>click</i> as the changing room's light went out, and the tank treads of Octavia's tank poked out through the drapes as she drove on through, the robotic arms giving a dramatic flair to the curtain as she bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and lo, she is <i>ready!</i>\" She enthused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA set of fingers, each one as fat as a pig's leg, peeked out from inside and wrapped around the curtain's hem, throwing it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, a pretty new-and-improved looking Kalinka stood nice and tall. Her paunch-rounded face somehow looking so strong and triumphant as she strutted towards the door, only for her eyes to bug out as her butt got wedged in the doorframe, making her spend a few more seconds huffing and puffing before she'd finally managed to pop loose, the weight of her behind nearly sending her toppling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was steadied, Kalinka's face firmed up once more, gazing out into the beyond with such determination. Seeing her out in the open made me all the more impressed with Octavia's skills as a seamstress; the outfit was a near-perfect reproduction of Kalinka's usual attire, albeit obviously blown up so the slacks could fit around a leviathanic ass that gave her backside a vast cliff of booty which consisted of two gigantic globes of flesh now compacted tightly together, the white dress shirt fitting comfortably over a profound gut that crushed down on the belt of her pants whilst a couch-filling pair of breasts laying on top. Even the fedora Octavia'd scrounged up was a decent match, at the expense of the usual buttons and feathers Kalinka would usual dress hers up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A nice, breathing material that aerates the skin, a crisp, sturdy weaving that doesn't compress under water or heat...\" Octavia narrated, circling around Kalinka with a prideful look on her own work. \"...top it all off with a super-stretchy design designed to last!...well, <i>longer,</i> I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalina smacked her own palm with a fingerless-gloved fist, cracking her knuckles. \"<i>In Ordung!</i> <i>Now</i> I am ready!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wasn't looking forward to working with the bar hostess, Skye Rivers. I wasn't sure that she liked me because she never spoke. I wasn't sure if she was mute or not but she didn't seem to notice me or humans in general. She was so aloof that I wonder whether or not she even likes humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI arrived at the bar to find Skye was already at work polishing a glass. Skye was a 30-year old and 20'11\" high camel woman with bright reddish-pink fur all over her body, two humps on her back and and long bright white hair at least today. For some reason Skye dyed her hair every 24 hours and at this point, I doubt even she knows what her natural hair color was. Skye was very fat as well, especially in her stomach and ass, the former being wider than she was tall. It wasn't exactly hard to miss because I've been plastered to it several times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was hoping that I wouldn't be having any trouble with Skye today, so I opened the door to the bar, but in the process accidentally slammed it against the camel woman's cheeks. The camel girl winced in pain and then glared at me. She snorted at me and rubbed her booty where I bumped her. \"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"Geez. No need to get nasty, you walking water tank.\" Skye just ignored me and went back to taking the inventory. I let out a sigh. It could've been worse. I heard a rumor that Skye had a human boyfriend before she worked at Gaia 2.0 but swallowed him whole after she caught him cheating on her. I really hope the rumor is just a rumor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was helping Skye get all the glasses in order, an anthro came up to the bar and I looked up to see exactly who I was serving first today. Probably some giant wine-o. Believe me, drunken giant anthros are not at all pleasant to be around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so who am I serving first? </span></div></div>",

She straddled a leg over the red barrier, despite its opening being just a few feet away, but she couldn't even put five steps on the icy floor without her feet zigzagging around, and not because it was slippery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye and I mellowed out of whatever scrubbing we were in the midst of and took a break just to watch the guest make some epic journey out of approaching the bar, without any semblance of a straight line in her path. Watching her was one of those moments where you truly learn how <i>long</i> four minutes are, a good portion of which I couldn't even tell what animal she was underneath the blurry smudge of brown she was turned to as she drunkenly wonked our way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when she was under the neon lights of the bar that I could see the white stripes of an okapi painted along the flanks of her beer gut, one bloated up so much that it swelled out just as wide as she was tall, yet she didn't even flinch from the cold as its bare fur plopped down on a stretch of floor almost as long, practically making her just a big, walking balloon of alcohol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't tell if she'd just tripped or actually meant to heave herself down to the counter, but she rolled forward so that her breasts slammed down onto the bar, overflowing over the lip to touch the mouths of the bottles on our side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme...Gimme beer,\" she slurred, smiling as she traced a circle on her breast with a finger..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of beer would you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...beer. You know, <i>beeeeeeer.</i>\" She answered, panning a hand as she stretched out the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what kind of beer? What brand? How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't...ngh...come h-<i>urp</i>-ere to<i> think</i> or <i>ponder!</i>\" She smacked her paws down on the bar, leaning through even more. \"I. Came. Here. For. <i>Beeeeeer!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, I understand, but you'll still have to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye growled and cut the conversation to a close by shoving a hose into the okapi's mouth, turning a crank on the connected keg with a frustrated sneer. The foamy, golden liquid flowed through with the hum of an electric motor, but our guest did most of the work herself by sucking the beer through with vacuum strength, and moaned under the sound of the rushing fluid as the fermented liquid passed through her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was thirty-some seconds of her chugging the beer into the pit of her belly till it was clear that, like magic, it was growing even bigger, rolling over more of the floor's glistening chill whilst her head was pushed higher towards the roof. The suction of her almighty lungs became all the more intense, and the beer flowed through the hose so fast that I almost saw the keg buckling in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the churning in the keg went hollow, and the very last dribble of beer was sucked away down her gullet, she spat the hose out herself, only to burp out a long, groggy \"Moooooooorrre...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, are you sure we should-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Moooooooore!!!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I really think you cou-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>MOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRREEE!!!!!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye's thigh brushed against me, enough that I was nearly knocked over. Passing me a glare, she brought out the hose for the next keg, inserting it into her mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nWhere the hell</i> is <i>everybody?!!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kept my eyes on the windows, searching for somebody, <i>anything </i>that could've scooted over as the next in line, whether it be Mavis or the company she was warning me about this morning. Even <i>Skye</i> got to a point where she was expressing emotion, showing surprise with a twinge of regret for leading on our beer-logged guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith seven kegs the size of SUVs worth of beer inside of her, her belly'd swelled out by ten extra feet, pushing her mammoth buttocks higher and higher into the air with her shoulders wedged into the entire length of the bar. Even her breasts seemed to enlarge, as if they were filled with beer and milk, leaving only the front of her maw to poke through under the roof as they flooded up to the ceiling, with hundreds of pounds piling on to pour in by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe patron spoke less and less to us, losing herself in her drunken feasting, but seven came as the lucky number when the tube went dry, and she didn't demand any more within five seconds of spitting it out. Her tongue just hung out, panting for breath, till the two of us could hear a pair of hands pressing down on the roof and pushing with a force that damn near tore it off. She rocketed back and onto her feet, giving her stomach enough momentum that she only barely avoided rolling all the way and fell flat on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be hic back...back i-urp-in one...hour.\" She mumbled with even more alcohol bleeding into her speech, and sauntered off with even more difficulty by the extra feet of belly her legs scraped around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell was <i>that?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye shrugged. At any other place, it'd be her go to to get out of a conversation, but here was one of the rare cases where she seemed genuinely baffled.</span></div></div>",

The rhinoceros giantess had bright brown skin and long bright white hair. On her thigh was a tattoo that looked like Africa and she had bright yellow eyes. She was wearing a black two-piece bikini that showed off her rather generous assets. She looked down at me with a very seductive look in her eye. She even licked her lips at me.

The last time an anthro seized me like that was Ms. Holmes and from the looks of it, the rhino girl was just as rough.

Okay, Greg. This sun is beating down on me, rather hard I might add and as a rhino, it\u2019s not like I have anything to cover all this bulk.\u201d Delilah smirked and held up her stomach and breasts that were jiggling. I saw that there were spiral patterns on the bra cups and I couldn\u2019t help but stare. I was shaking. Even though she was a rhinoceros, I was sure she was a predator, in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you come in, cutie,\u201d Delilah said. \u201cI need you to lotion all around me.\u201d Delilah jerked back and I yelled as I slid down her fleshy but rough back and landed next to a tube of SPF 500. I held up the tube and was baffled at the idea that it held enough to cover that fat rhino giantess.\u201d Before I could even think, Delilah wiggled her tail in front of my face and smirked. \u201cMake sure you get everything and you might be my date for tonight at the night club.\u201d Delilah then picked me up and then let out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to remember where I heard her name before. Surprisingly, Delilah was a doctor by profession. I read about her in a magazine. Her full name was Delilah Davidson and she was a very skilled surgeon. Maybe she was at this resort on vacation to avoid fatigue. I also read that she had a fetish for human men. Before I could say another word, the rhino smirked. \u201cAnd I think I know where you can start.\u201d Delilah then dropped me screaming...</span></div></div>",

I know how to be a good hostess, especially when my date--or pet--is as cute as you. Besides, you're getting a first-class seat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could protest, she winked and pressed her knockers together, enveloping me in squishy-but-rough rhino boobs.

I was trapped. \"Oops,\" Delilah said in a tone that proved she'd done it on purpose. \"Oh well, at least you're safe in there; can't fall out!\" She winked again and stood up, giving me one last sultry look before sauntering off to wherever. Each step made her breasts bounce, with me battered from all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And she wasn't just teasing, there was NO way gravity could save me. I was buried deep between her ample boobs, immobilized against her chest. No way was I gonna fall out, unless she went completely upside down. I couldn't slip out, either: her bikini top was strapped tight, leaving no gap for me to slide through. It was the perfect boob-based prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she <i>planned</i> this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah took her sweet time walking around. Every step made her breasts bounce, tossing me between them and getting me squished, me over and over againto the boardwalk. \"Now, where to go for our little date?\" Delilah mused, not looking at me. \"Since you put <i>me</i> in charge of our date like the little gentleman you are, I hope you don't mind if I pick a place that caters more to my tastes. Is that alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph!\" I yelped, muffled by her entrapping boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can pick ANYTHING I want? Thank you, little guy!\" she said, making up her own answer. She ignored my struggles and strolled along the boardwalk for a long while before she found a milkshake stand. \"Oh, perfect! I could use something to cool off from this heat!\" Humming a tune, Delilah sauntered up to the milkshake stand....</span></div></div>",

Her surprisingly sultry laughter jolted me out of my dizziness from the fall; I saw her crane her head over to look at me. \"Talk about starting at the bottom, hmm?\" She quipped, winking at me. \"Speaking of which, why not put that sunscreen on my bum first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...are you sure, ma'am?

Keep at it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me half an hour to completely cover her left cheek in sunscreen.

The fake sun was blotted out by her shoulders, nearly blinding me as I was overshadowed by a darkness similar to that of a solar eclipse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike some idiot from an action movie, I stood stock still, eyes and jaw slowly going agape as my brain tried to welcome itself to the image that was rolling my way. It was only when her head and shoulders disappeared beneath the horizon of her all-encompassing rear that my flight-or-fight instinct finally kicked in, and I leapt off her bikini and landed feet-first on the sand, breaking out in a stride as fast for the light of day as I could make, hyperventilating all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and again, like some idiot in an action movie, I'd probably sealed my fate by running <i>sideways</i> to the flow of traffic, rather than backwards. When I was about to leave the shadow of her booty, I thrust myself out and gracefully jumped out in the clear, ready to hear the resounding<i> boom</i> of her ass hitting the ground from behind. Indeed, it came, and was just as loud and deafening as I'd imagined it to be, but instead, it came from all around, thundering through every bone in my body. I gave a choked cry as I felt what could've been the Great Wall of China fall down on my back, and was promptly squashed and speardagled into the sand by the biggest, heaviest, and most immobilizing weight I'd ever felt sit upon me through my career in Gaia 2.0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could breath, I was immediately thankful for as the cloud of sand settled, and her body was <i>just</i> soft enough that I wasn't choking on my own blood, but only my head was allowed to move as it stood out in the open, reduced to only squirming jitters as the rest of me laid utterly flattened beneath tens of thousands of tons worth of rhino ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>MISS...HKKKR! DELILAH?!</i>\" I'd forced out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...?\" She hummed slyly, but barely cared for what her tiny hostage had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said something again, but it was too choked and strangled for her to make out, again, not that she'd even cared. She was just relieved that she didn't feel any of his joints get be twisted out of place when she'd landed on him, and could thus relish with an easy conscience over how<i> huge</i> she felt with his diminutive struggles squirming beneath her enormous hips. True, she may have towered over her other coworkers, maybe a head or so taller, but it was rare for her to feel all of those seventy-five feet at once, or put the ones along her ass to any use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mnn...\" She bit her lip as she caressed her thighs, never getting enough over how far they surged off of her figure when she was seated. For once, she felt like a true queen for her size, and finally had somebody to worship it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was only just from holding him down, putting his freedom down to her choice. There was so much left to do, and most importantly, experiment with...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Delilah pursed her lips, idly wondering what to do with her tiny--and charming, she had to admit--little hostage. The feeling of him wriggling under her rump felt...<i>wonderful</i>, but it was horribly rare that she got the chance to sit on humans; let alone in her favorite bikini, or in a place as ritzy as this. No, she couldn't just lay there on top of him; lovely as that was. She had to do something special. <br>\r\nBut what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought of her room back in the Aether Suites. If she could be away from prying eyes...and any of Greg's coworkers who might spoil her fun...then she could play with him in private! She giggled at the delightful ideas <i>that</i> brought to mind; wanting to spring up and carry her little human off right then and there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no...no reason she couldn't have a bit of fun before taking him there. <br>\r\nLifting her head to look at the tiny form of her prisoner, she found him just as she left him: pinned under her cheek, with only his head and neck uncovered. He tried to croak something out, but she didn't bother to listen; only winking at him before laying her head back down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, could you please-- *Urgh!* --get off me?\" I ground out, trying my best to sound polite despite the crushing weight of Delilah's rear. When most customers would eat you alive or step on you for looking at them wrong, you learn to ignore little things like being sat on, or called a snack. \"I can't apply the sunblock if you're...*Ugh*...sitting on me.\" I flash my best grin, putting on the charm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck. She just winked at me, returning my grin with a sultry smirk before laying back down, sighing in bliss. <br>\r\nGreat, she was getting off to this. I sighed, stopping my struggles to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and that was when she started wiggling her titanic rhino ass down on me, complete with a throaty sigh. I was pressed between her bikini-clad butt and the sand below, toss around like a ragdoll as her weight shifted around me; back and forth, side to side; every which way. Each wiggle dragged me further under her booty, eventually surrounding me in darkness as her cheeks completely covered my tiny form. I tried to shout for her to stop, but opening my mouth only got me a maw full of sand, rhino sweat, and black spandex from her bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween Delielah's crushing weight, the gritty sand, and the ever-present threat of her just straight-up farting on me (again, with giant anthros, that's <b>fatal</b> for us tiny humans! Don't laugh!), I was getting pretty clobbered. <br>\r\nWeirdly, she seemed to be keeping <i>just</i> enough of her weight off me to keep it from being fatal--no bones crushed into jelly or anything. I guess she <i>did</i> like humans after all. Enough to NOT kill me with her little forced dominatrix session, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one final wriggle, she stopped, sighing in utter bliss above me. By now I was pinned right at the apex of her ass, both cheeks pressing down on me. And I was face up, so unlike when only one cheek had landed on me I was getting the full force of her building-sized bum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering the threat of flatulence, I tried NOT to think about how I was at ground zero of any gas she might have....when the already-insane weight pressing down on me shot up. Her cheeks hinged upwards, pressing together and compacting me between them as I was flattened. Shouting--and getting another mouth full of rhino flab--I realized Delilah must be sitting up. Like the naive idiot I was, I assumed she'd gotten bored of sitting on me and was finally getting her giant butt off me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...No such luck. She wiggled her butt down on me one last time and stood up---with me pancaked against her hide like a sticker. I was wedged between her cheeks like a canned fish, adhered to her rear by sheer force and sweat. With her rear no longer pressing down on me, I could see the outside world through a thin slit of life between her cheeks....which let me see Delilah casually move her hands to her wide hips and press her cheeks together, locking me in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah; I wasn't getting out of this unless she wanted me to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thundered off to God-knew-where; effectively kidnapping me so she could have a toy, I could only think one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please don't fart...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well this situation was about as terrible as it could possibly get. Trapped between the butt cheeks of an amorous rhinoceros and being taken to who knows where. Sure, I'd been stepped on, sat on, and nearly digested before. They were all risks that came with human jobs at Gaia 2.0--and they didn't even offer hazard pay to boot--but that didn't mean I ever got used to the pain and humiliation. Or ever felt less fear that the next anthro client I came across would end up being my executioner. Especially if that anthro had successfully abducted me without anyone noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent half an hour locked in the prison of her behind, munched between her cheeks as she walked. It got even worse the more she walked, the bottom of her bikini wedging up into her butt crack, dragging me along deeper. It was sweltering inside. The heat and the long walk caused her to sweat profusely and the salty droplets would roll down, drenching me. Delilah passed other anthros as she walked. I would try to cry for help whenever I knew one was nearby but Delilah would just smirk and clench her cheeks until I was in too much pain to keep shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI assumed we were heading to her room. On the one hand, that was good. A room meant a telephone and a telephone meant I could call Ms. Holmes and tell her what happened. When she was done laughing she usually sent someone to help me... in an hour or two. On the other hand, being alone with a frisky giant had other dangers. She barely had any scruples on the beach in public. Who knows how far she'd be willing to take it in her room with no one to stop her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah reached her room. I heard her keycard unlocking her door. From what little of the outside world I could experience, it was much cooler inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, home sweet home! Isn't it beautiful, little man? Breathe it in!\" Muffled shouts came from her butt and Delilah faked surprise. \"Oh that's right. I forgot. You're too busy breathing in the scent of a real woman. Let's get you out of there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah dug into her crack and fumbled until she could find me. When I was finally released I gasped and took deep breaths, grateful to finally have some fresh air. I finally saw the room and my jaw nearly hit the floor. All the rooms in the Aether Suites were beautiful and fancy, but Delilah's room was the most beautiful and fanciest I ever saw. It must've cost a fortune! Especially since Delilah herself was so large, everything had to accommodate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you afford a room like this?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you know?\" Delilah asked coyly. \"Gaia 2.0's adding a healthcare facility for its clientele. I've been hired on as head surgeon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You work here?\" I spluttered meekly. That did not bode well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right cutie. Play your cards right and I can make it so we spend <i>a lot</i> of time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said it suggestively and I cringed. <i>\"I have a feeling if I spend time with her, I'll end up in a full-body cast in that new hospital,\"</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Davidson,\" I said respectfully. \"I'm very flattered at your... interest--But! I really need to get back to work. I don't want to make my boss angry--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Toronto? Don't worry about that, cutie. Ms. Holmes is a dear friend of mine! I'll give her a call right now. I'm sure she'll excuse your absence from work... You're... <i>prolonged</i>... absence,\" she said, wiggling her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh sweet merciful mother of marmalade, I'm a dead man.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI threw caution to the wind and just began struggling in the giant rhino's hand as she called Ms. Holmes. Her grip was too tight from me to escape from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toronto. Hi, it's Delilah! Yes, I love my new home, thank you for making the arrangements for me. I feel bad asking for another favor, but it's a teensy one. That human you have working for you, um...\" She looked at me, embarrassed for the first time. \"I sorry, cutie, I forgot to ask. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MS. HOLMES!\" I screamed. \"IT'S GREG! SEND HELP, PLEASE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg! That's it!\" Delilah said, ignoring my outburst. \"Yes I was hoping you wouldn't mind if I borrow him for a few... hours... Or days... What can I say? I have a weakness for weakness. Oh shush, like you're one to talk! I've kept a record on your love life. I remember that time when--oh, hold on a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah broke off her conversation with Ms. Holmes. I'd been screaming nonstop and begging for help ever since my captor got her on the line. It was a slim chance Ms. Holmes would help me out of this mess, but at this point I was desperate. My screams and struggles finally distracted Delilah enough to acknowledge me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, I know you're impatient. I want to play just as much as you do, but you're being very rude. I'm talking with a friend right now, so it'll be another few minutes before we can get started on the really fun stuff. Oh fine,\" she said, after mention of \"the really fun stuff\" caused me to double my efforts to free myself, \"I hope this will tide you over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI screamed in terror as once again I was brought to her massive behind. Only this time, instead of wedging me up the outside of her bathing suit, she pulled back on her bikini and dropped my into her ass crack. I slid between the sweat-soaked cheeks until I was wedged firmly between them, then trapped further as Delilah pulled her bikini further into her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where were we?\" Delilah said to Ms. Holmes, acting as if she hadn't just stuffed a human in her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so unfair. I'd just escaped the foul prison of her behind, only to be placed right back in, and now it was even harder to get out. I tried to wiggle my way to safety, but whenever I neared the edge of the fabric, Delilah would just clench her cheeks until I was pulled back into a secure position. Despite her claims that the conversation would take a few minutes, Delilah and Ms. Holmes droned on and on for an hour. Eventually I blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up...</span></div></div>",

And this bed was nice and soft; better than the tight place I'd been before--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it all came rushing back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Delilah, her trap with the sunscreen, being trapped under her gigantic ass; tapped INSIDE said ass, abducted back to her room...and her getting permission from Holmes to use me as a toy for God knew how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, <i>of course</i> I screamed like a litle girl. That scream died as soon as I opened my eyes, though, when I saw my rhino captress looming over the bed--<i>her</i> bed--aiming a sultry smirk down at my tiny form. She still had the bikini on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you enjoy your nap; Greg?\" Delilah cooed with mock sweetness. \"I hope you're nice and rested after that, I have soooo many fun things in mind!\" She bent down and winked at me, licking her lips. \"You ready to see what a real woman is, little man?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If you're a real woman, then no.</i> I WANTED to say that, or anything to refuse, but all that came out was a weak stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah giggled. \"Oooh, silent treatment eh? Perfect. Always prefer a man of action over a talker.\" She stood up to her full 75 feet, and then, <b>*Whump!*</b> A hand slapped down next to me. Slowly, streching out the moment, she slinked onto the bed; more muffled impacts announcing each limb and the bed creaking under her weight, until she was poised on all fours above me, her back arched and her hands at my sides blocking of any escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, she looked <i>bigger</i> now than she did standing up, like an amorous mountain looming over me. I now saw that Delilah was, indeed, an utter <i>bombshell</i> by any standard. She wasn't a stunner despite being fat, her girth MADE her beautiful--curves all around, kept just toned enough to NOT have any fat rolls or unsightly bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with my fear making me shake, I could see this rhino woman was <i>smoking hot.</i> Too bad she'd probably be the death of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, you look so tiny down there,\" Delilah purred. Her yellow eyes danced over me. \"That's one reason I love humans so much--you little things just make me feel all my 75 feet. And I can play with a human guy in ways I could never with an anthro man...ways like THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a scream, and the torment began...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You know little man; I'm proud that I don't eat humans,\" Delilah purred. \"I honestly can't see how other anthros can think someone who can talk back to them is nothing but food. It's kind of disturbing, really.\" She shook her head, frowning. \"Besides, I'm an <i>herbivore</i>! Why would I eat a human anyway, even if I DIDN'T see you as people just like anthros are?\" Her gaze drifted off to the side, like she was daydreaming about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked. Her terrifying seductive act had completely dropped. \"Uh, y-yeah; it's kind of terrifying, worrying about getting eaten all the time...I've had parents tell their kids it's okay to eat me!\" I nodded along, subtly inching out from under her shadow. Hopefully this swing in her mood would let me--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Thump!*</i> Her thumb lifted and slapped down on my chest, pinning me to the bed. <br>\r\nDammit. Guess she wasn't quite so distracted.<br>\r\nWell, at least I wasn't on my captress's menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But <i>so many</i> of my patients tell me how tasty humans are,\" Delilah went on, \"and even a gentle anthro like me has those pesky animal instincts sometimes...\" her eyes flickered and snapped back to me, her seductive look back in full force. <br>\r\nThen she <i>licked her lips.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No. No! NO! OH GOD NO!</i> I struggled beneath the rhino's thumb, but it didn't budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled, now looking VERY hungry. \"So, little Greggie; since our good friend Toronto said I could do whatever I wanted with you...and I'm ALWAYS ready to try something new, we're gonna have a little taste-test! I'll just spit you out once I've had enough; wouldn't want to be finished playing with a handsome thing like you too soon, after all...!\" <br>\r\nDelilah lowered her head toward me, her salivatting maw opening up to accept its human snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT! WAIT! Come on, Miss Delilah! I..I was just under your behind, remember?! You sat on me! Isn't eating something that's been down there unsanitary?! You're a doctor, remember?!\" I pleaded, futiley thrashing about like a madman. That line had saved me from becoming lunch many times before; after a hungry anthro had picked me off the floor or their foot. It would work with a health nut, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try, sweetie; but I washed you off with soap and water while you were out. You're clean from your time under my tush.\" <br>\r\nDang. She'd thought of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kept on screaming and flailing as the amorous rhino giantess's jaws enveloped my torso, leaving my legs kicking at the air as she rose to a sitting position with my upper half in her mouth. I got a face full of saliva and rhino tongue, nearly drowing right there. My ears were assaulted by a thuderous <i><b>MMMM....</b></i> within her maw: she must have found me delicious. With another moan, she slurped my still-kicking legs in like spaghetti noodles, fully trapping me within her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh lawwd...sho tashty...wahf haff Ah bem mishing...\"</i> Delilah moaned, sounding near delierious with pleasure. Even slurred from talking with her mouth full (of me), I could tell she was over the moon. <i>\"All thish dyme...\"</i> She purred, swallowing the flood of saliva as her mouth watered. It saved me from drowning, but that was the least of my worries. Her massive tongue slammed me against the roof of her mouth and she sucked on me (NO! <i><b>NOT</b></i> LIKE THAT!) like a human candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was carried by floods of saliva dangerously close to the waiting pit of her throat, then shunted into her cheeks where her tongue lashed at me from behind, battering me around like a sack of potatoes even as she enjoyed my apparently wonderful flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made as if to spit me out several times, only to stop short and leave me pressed between her lips and her gums. (And unsurprisingly, her dental work was flawless. Not a trace of plaque anywhwere.<br>\r\nI got a VERY good look at those pearly whites when her tongue bucked under me and tossed me onto her back molars. I screamed as the top teeth slowly descended, thinking I would be chewed into paste....but they only lightly pinned be down as she carefully chewed--painful, but it didn't draw blood or break bones. Still made her shudder and moan something fierce, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went on like that for...hell, I don't know how long. I was battered, scarred from her teeth, and nearly ran out air several times. (She let my head stick out from her lips every once in a while so I could get some fresh oxygen...then slurped me back into her mouth for more playtime.) All I knew was she kept it up until I felt ready to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, FINALLY; it stopped. I was left on my back on her mercifully still tongue, hearing her amorous; exhausted panting echoing around my prison. <i>\"Shweet...Jheezhus...vhat wash...imcrebible...\"</i> Delilah slurred. Something in her tone told me she was fanning herself as she said that. The whole affair must have aroused her something fierce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy yes, I DID find it hot despite all the torment. Hormones are fickle things; don't judge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...is it over, Miss Delilah?\" I groaned. After this, I was never taking an assignment on the beach again. Even being Holmes' secreary would be better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah...vhat's enuff...of vhat...\"</i> Delilah said, sounding a little more coherent. <i>\"Vo were tashty, Greg...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...I think.\" I managed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt her mouth move around my tiny form, and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At least until I realized I was moving backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Delilah! You're sending me the wrong way!\" hoping this was just a literal slip of the tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ah o.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue rose, sending me sliding to the back of her waiting throat like a giant waterslide. Groans came from the black abyss below me, a monster in the dark demanding to be fed. I desperately began trying to crawl back up her tongue, using her taste buds as handholds, but the pink surface was so slick with saliva and I was so exhausted that my grip kept slipping off. I would slip off only to make wild grabs to save myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ar ooh ivin e a las tashte, Eg? Oo're sho swheet.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slipped again, rolling head over foot down the tongue, eliciting a deep moan. I only just managed to grab a last handhold on the edge of her tongue. My feet dangled off into space in her throat. Her breath was hot and steamy like an underground volcano. The groans from her stomach turned into roars of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MISS DELILAH!\" I screamed, barely hanging on. \"YOU SAID YOU'D SPIT ME OUT AFTERWARDS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Arry, abee. Animuh instincshts.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU'RE A RHINO! YOUR INSTINCTS SHOULD MAKE YOU A VEGETARIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hoped those wouldn't be my last words as my grip finally gave way and I was sent plummeting down her throat. Delilah swallowed and, with a single finger, traced my descent down her throat, down her chest, past her ample bosom, and finally into the mountainous, gelatinous orb of her stomach. She laid on her back on her bed, fanning herself, and breathing heavily. I heard her smacking her lips to get the last remnants of my taste and heard a dull thumping as she patted her belly. My arrival trigged an expulsion of gas rising up her throat, which she let out as a genteel, <i>Urp</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardonne-moi,\" she said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flailed in her stomach acid as helplessly as a fish out of water. Spying a half-chewed orange slice in the distance, I paddled my way over and used it as a makeshift life raft while I caught my breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Greg,\" Delilah breathed. \"You were just so scrumptious!\" she squealed. She scrunched up her face as she heard muffled squeaks coming from inside her stomach. \"Sorry, sweetie. I can't hear you. Give me just a sec,\" she said as she rummaged through her drawer. \"Here we go!\" She pulled out a stethoscope and pushed it to her stomach. \"Can you repeat that, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU ATE ME!\" I screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Delilah rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sweetie,\" she said patiently. \"I thought that was abundantly obvious... but, maybe I shouldn't be so surprised. It's probably a traumatic experience to be swallowed whole. I guess I'm just lucky I'll never have to go through such a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky you,\" I seethed. \"Now get me out of here before I digest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal rhino let out a deep belly laugh. Unfortunately for you since you were inside that belly, and ended up being submerged and sloshed around by waves of stomach acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, sweetie. You're not going to be digested! At least, not for a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell do you figure that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a doctor, sweetie, remember? I've had plenty of anthros come to me with a human they ate not digesting properly. Based on the eater's preference, I can either extract the human... or give them something that can help move them along. Anyway, the point is that different humans have different levels of endurance, it's one of the reasons why you weren't crushed like a bug beneath my booty. In my professional opinion, you have at least Type 3 endurance. That's the second highest endurance level there is! Meaning you should survive at least for three days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Type 3? What makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm friends with Toronto, remember, Greggie? She told me all about you and the all those funny \"accidents\" that keep happening to you. She also told me about the time she accidentally ate you while you were on room service detail and ended up wedged in her hamburger. According to her, you survived three whole days in her stomach until a burp sent you flying out. Surviving that long means you're at least Type 3.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T CARE ABOUT A SCIENCE LESSON! I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you do, Greggie,\" Delilah said soothingly. \"But that's not gonna happen any time soon. You were just so delicious! I can't believe what I've been missing all these years. I wonder if all humans taste this good or if it's just you. But it's not just the taste either, it's the sensation! The knowledge that you're trapped in there, completely at my mercy, unable to escape unless I allow it. Your life is literally in the palm of my hand... actually, it's <i>literally</i> in the bowels of my belly, but you get my point... I can get used to this feeling... It's so intoxicating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI muttered curses under my breath. I knew she was insane but this was a whole new level of crazy. I didn't know I was especially endurable, but it did explain how I survived so long in the belly of my boss. I figured it was some kind of miracle. But special endurance or not, that didn't make me any happier about being stuck in the stomach of this rhino. Especially if she planned to keep me trapped in here for days on end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" I tried to say as calmly as possible, in the hopes it would hasten my release. \"May I ask when you plan to let me out, Miss Delilah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a throaty laugh, and said...</span></div></div>",

If more humans were like you, maybe us anthros wouldn't be so eager to squish and eat you littlee things.\" Delilah spoke sweetly, like an adult to a naiive kid. \"You'll get out, alright...\" She trailed off. Ominous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to fight the urge to snark back about her compliment: most anthros would crush or eat humans without a second thought, regardless of how much ass they kissed. If I had a nickel for every time I overheard some version of <i>\"Why do they let the food walk around like that?\"</i>, I could have bought Gaia 2.0 off Miss Holmes in a heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I think...\" I mumbled. My fleshy prison shook as my rhino captress laughed again, the waves of stomach fluids nearly capsizing my citrus raft. \"So, when will you let me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you're digested, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world stopped. Everything felt cold, numb. I went so rigid part of my brain was worried I'd been paralyzed. My mouth felt dry, and I had to struggle to get a word out. \"W-wh-what?\" I croaked, praying I'd heard wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, you'll get out after you've been digested. Like all food,\" Delilah answered, still in that 'talking-to-a-kid' tone. \"You were so delicious, and after finding out what I've been missing all these years...might as well go all the way. Sorry Greggie, but Doctor Delilah Davidson is going carnivore.\" She patted her belly once, and from within the pit it sounded like a death knell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT YOU CAN'T!\" I pleaded. \"YOU LIKE HUMANS! YOU'VE TREATED HUMAN PATIENTS! YOU SAID YOU DON'T SEE HUMANS AS FOOD! You--\" I stammered, grapsing at straws in my panic. \"Uh, you had so much fun sitting on me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, having you under my booty was great fun, and I did have a fetish for human guys, but...after tasting you, tasting a <i>human</i>; I realized what I'd been depriving myself of. And besides, all those times I've stepped on humans, sat on them, squeezed them between my melons; made them massage my feet? Those were just animal instincts. Same ones that made me swallow you. It's just what I am, so; like I said, why not go all the way?\" Her tone told me she shrugged her shoulders at that point. \"Besides, Toronto told me you signed all your rights away working here, so you knew the risks. It's just nature, sweetie. Food chains and whatnot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'LET ME OUT! PLEASE!! I'LL DO ANYTHING! YOU CAN KEEP ME AS A I'LL DO ALL THOSE THINGS! YOU CAN SIT ON ME ANY TIME YOU WANT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother throaty chuckle from Delilah. \"Sorry, I've made my decision. The Doctor is out, little guy. Goodbye, my little morsel.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a *click*--her putting the stethoscope on a table, sealing my fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MISS DELILAH! <i>MISS DELILAH!!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah ignored Greg's muffled pleading. It was cruel, but she didn't regret consigning him to his fate. He had been so delicious, his struggles in her belly so wonderful...she had to do this. No way would she back out of something this wonderful. She sighed in bliss, patting her belly as she pulled up a pillow. Greg kept struggling and squirming, and whenever he seemed to waver, she poked her belly and riled him up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt lovely. It felt...right. This was what humans were for. <br>\r\nWell, this and sitting on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=========Three Days Later===========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't getting out. Not the way I wanted to, at least. After three days in Delilah's gullet, I was delerious from dehydration, my orange raft had almost completely melted into sludge, and all my attempts to talk Delilah out of digesting me had failed. I'd begged, I'd bargained, I'd even offered to become her PET forever...she turned me down. I'd even tried to make her throw up somehow, but being a doctor she knew plenty of ways to calm a human-disturbed stomach. It'd all been for nothing, and she'd always used the same line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sorry Greggie, but I've made my decision. I'm a carnivore now. You're cute, but...I'm predator, you're prey.\"</i> <br>\r\nEvery time, in that same 'talking to a kid' tone she'd used when telling me I'd be digested alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hissing sound broke me out of my skulking, and I saw bubbles boiling around my new raft, a doughnut, as it sank into the mire of acids. There were no other scraps of food to leap to--on the third day, she'd apparently decided to finish me off for good and had only a protein shake for breakfast. No solid food lifesavers for me this time, and I'd hopped to a pizza crusts and bagels than I could count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this was how it ended. Eaten alive by a horny giant rhino woman, who decided to become a maneater on a whim after years of being kind to humans. God, I was an idiot to take a job at Gaia. The place was a deathtrap for humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe acid was already enveloping me. I ignored the pain and gave one last defiant shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HOPE I GIVE YOU DIAREAH FOR DAYS, YOU PACHYDERM BITCH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then I sank beneath the mire. It hurt. It boiled. It--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>urp.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah politely covered her mouth, silencing the (thankfully) genteel burp. She couldn't feel Greg struggling anymore, and that last shout from him had faded...she nodded, mentally patting herself on the back. Three-day endurance, just like she theorized. She set her clipboard on the counter and smiled down at her ample belly, giving it a pat. \"Happy trails, Greggie.\" She said. She knew Greg couldn't hear her--he wouldn't be hearing <i>anything</i> now--but it still felt right to give the first human she'd ever eaten a proper send-off. \"You were delicious <i>and</i> a gentleman--everything an anthro lady could want in a human.\" She idly licked her lips at the memory of his taste; the way he struggled in her tummy...it had been wonderful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting Greg digest turned out to be a great decision, Delilah mused. She'd caught flak from Toronto--in fact it had taken a LOT of sweet-talking her old friend to avoid getting fired for eating an employee--but besides that things had been looking up. Her friends had all approved, and even treated her with more respect. Heck, when she told her proud-carnivore sister, she'd hugged her tight and told her how proud she was that she stopped coddling humans and 'did as nature intended'. Then she brought out some humans she'd caught, and the two rhinos had laughed and snacked for a whole afternoon. They'd even sat on a few, but none were as durable as Greg. Her sister had to buy new couch cushions after too many humans had been reduced to red stains beneath their rumps. Still, that had been fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I ever coddle humans like that? They're cute and funny, but they're just food. Even gents like Greg.\" Delilah mused, but shrugged it off. Everyone did something silly now and again, right? And besides, going carnivore had been one of the smartest things she'd ever done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rhino doctor nodded to herself and patted her belly once more, then picked up her clipboard and got back to readying her office. She was going to have a lot of patients today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd hopefully she could talk Toronto into giving her some humans.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was it. Cow ass, zebra ass, hippo ass, the answer to the eternal question of which posterior-related oblivion the resort may have in store for me was being answered in the form of four stories words of rhino booty, with what were now certified to be my final breaths damp with the musk of air that reverberated off her buttocks\u2019 hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her asscheeks enabled to breathe, Delilah allowed my existence to prolong a little while further to caress herself, kneading upon their sheen with a contented grunt before her hands dove upon me, teeth opening through me as she carried me up to the butt of her tail. Rather than subject myself to the darkness of her cavernous behind, I screwed my eyes shut, refusing to let them open until the silence of death came over me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whap!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but my eyes bugged out in pain as my wrists were arms were forcibly stretched apart, an accompanying snap of rubber following after as I was smacked back-first into the very tip of her asscrack, bound in place with the lace of her panties tied around my wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm...\u201d Delilah hummed to herself, the bed\u2019s frame groaning in relief as she rolled off, planting her fat feet on the floor. Her back to a nearby beauty mirror, she bent over to grab the remaining strap or tie around my ankles, and with a churning of her mammoth thighs, I was gradually sucked into the flesh of her asscrack until she was once again \u2018clothed,\u2019 albeit with my painfully stretched body visible by a single tuft at the point her asscrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tested a few steps, her legs kneading my body around and earning a few winces and yelps of pain from my person, but any concern for my skeletal integrity wasn\u2019t apparent by the satisfied grin she was sporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll seventy-five feet of me...\u201d She echoed. \u201cAnd you know, some say that fashion is also the language of class?

Instead, her ass was rising, Iike bread dough, absorbing more of what little could still feel the air...she was growing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes, I see you\u2019ve noticed I\u2019ve had a bit of a full meal a while ago.\u201d She elaborated, noticing my increased agony whilst she navigated through her closet, peeling through several articles of dress ware before settling on a red dinner dress, which she unveiled and proceeded to pull over her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing her legs into required a while of straining to force their girths inside, on top of reaching around her expansive backside to feed the zippers\u2019 ends together, but getting herself dressed gave me some relief thanks to an open slit that ran along the roof of her behind, her pride to her widest asset likely too large to keep her from being to fancy for it to be somewhat visible, if enough for me to see and breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd while I\u2019m no doubt certain that you\u2019re eager to see me waltz around free and nude, dear, I\u2019d ask you to keep me clothed. I\u2019m not one to take humiliation well...\u201d She warned, opening her make-up case to begin touching herself up for the night, but followed with a crooked grin that scared me off the prospect of letting go than if she\u2019d came out and threatened to kill me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now get yer butt over there.\" Miss Holmes said before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groaned. The Fate's Hand Casino was the most expensive part of the hotel, occupying three penthouse floors of the Aether Suites. Only the really rich or famous could get in (or the staff, obviously). I had only worked there once before, as a bartender. A drunk, 80 ft snake woman sat on me, and I spent two days stuck to her ass. So I wasn't looking forward to working there again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the Aether Suites are close by, so I don't have far to walk. I cross the grounds and enter the lobby of the suites. I head for the elevator and hit the button for the first casino floor. The elevator zips up pretty quickly and I'm in the casino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I enter the lavish casino, I have to wonder who is in here today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope I don't run into Kim Pryce. That lottery winner was always lording her massive weight over everyone, treating thin people like dirt. If she wasn't tormenting them at the Glass Tornado, she was here blowing her money on the slots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I really hope I don't have to deal with Stacey. A former model is not fun to work with. That phoenix has ballooned more since I last saw her. And she's very quick to anger. I heard she didn't get the right meal she wanted, and the server was roasted alive. Yeah, I want to avoid her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder if Ivana is working today. She was a guest here, but she fell in love with the resort, and was hired as a lounge singer. If she is here but not working, she'll be in the spa, having her gargantuan ass pampered like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what do I need to do today?</span></div></div>",

Spanning for almost a hundred feet wide, the wheel paid its debt in tenfold for the insane hype that any commercial for the casino could've given its property, going by the murky crowds of gamblers huddled around its tables, whose displays hung along the rim and above in the balconies like some giant, sinful candelabra. Without the ball rolling around, the wheel calmly spun around on its own, winding the crank for the next game as the antsier guests elbowed against one another to place their bets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the rest of the table, a grid plotted by brass gilding laid the surface down with trapdoors, one for every spot on the wheel. All of the seats were empty, being at the last table of the day to be booted up, but the iconic red glow of the display quickly worked its magic on a few head that turned my way as they strolled past. One from a particularly pink owner gave me much more time, pausing from her pace before turning her monolith of a body around and jaywalking against the flow of the other guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thirty foot range wasn't something to sneeze at from the guests, nor something to really gawk over, but I found myself transfixed by the sheer level of obesity she was imprisoned by. Her stomach was <i>huge,</i> of course, but would've still looked wide for somebody five or ten feet taller, yet she didn't even bother renting out a belly cart after it'd long oozed out past her belt line and over her legs' entire length, plopped down along some dozen feet of carpet beyond her feet with only a layer of smooth feathers to protect her from serious rug burn. Her nightdress was a piece made of pure spandex dozens of belt sizes too small to look like anything other than a leotard, but her light pink hair was freshly combed, styled into a wealthy-looking jane with dark red dyes along the tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't even fully comprehend what species she was till she was close enough for me to see a black tipped beak poking out from a pair of cheeks that almost completely fleshed out all of the roundness of her entire face, which was pointed high above a boa of pudge around her neck whose topmost rolls were wedged by the straps of her \"dress'\" neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, flamingos tended to have such skinny legs, even as hefty as those we'd seen come by, but hers ballooned out some inches beyond the dozens of feet that pushed the curves of her belly apart, smushing together with an extreme pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blue eyes were cocked in a mix of surprise and disdain for the tiny little human running her table, but her face was weaved more by what I sensed was a look of hunger that never left her mind, partly thanks to an empty-bellied groan from her stomach that made her wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is a <i>human</i> doing in a place like this?\" She asked with a musky russian accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our policies and kindness towards guests extends to any and all species, Ma'am. Would you like to play on this table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer confusion didn't leave, but with a snort she stepped on up, zoning in on a seat at the end that could cater to her monstrous butt's width. Her fingers pinched into a dragon's hoard of chips that filled her cleavage, scrounging around until she plucked out a few gold \"thousand\"-ers and smacked them down on a square, melding them together in a tidy stack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"23 Black, six thousand.\" I read out, punching the numbers into the podium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother rumble ran through her stomach, and she drew out even more chips to stack on another square, like she'd expected the game to buy her a filet mignon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5 red, eight thousand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><div align=\"center\">NEXT SPIN <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 : 3 2</div></span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn't help that her bombastic curves were standing only a foot away from me when I shuffled myself into the path of her glow, gazing up as she played with a lock of her hair, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to two years of work I'd gotten used to any sight of our behemoth guests lumbering around in the halls, barely able to fit through a handful of doorways, but no matter how many times I'd see Ivana swaying around in the casino, I'd <i>still</i> get double takes. Not just because she was so big, but how <i>asymmetrically proportionately</i> she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the waist up she had the body of a supermodel: a flat stomach, nice, weighty breasts, raven black hair and a white coat that was never not pristine, (often courtesy of me) but everything below was the sole reason she'd blown up to the thousand-pound club. It wasn't even just gravity pulling down the belly fat and stuffing some junk in the trunk; whether or not it was a miracle of genetics or some weird kind of strategic dieting, Ivana's arse was utterly <i>gigantic</i>, a size worthy of being copied off any of the other usual customers and pasted on somebody thin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, she'd never weaponized it, like any other guests with a rump that big, or eyes that fluttery...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, it's wonderful seeing you drop by! How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fine, just...dandirino. You're the one who called me up, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm!\" She hummed, nodding slowly. \"Come, we'll work in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grace unhindered by her weight, Ivana spun around on one foot, letting her ass sway from side to side as much as possible as she strutted towards the other end of the casino, flicking her tail out so it'd coil around my head and tug me along her wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what'd you have in mind for me to be today?\"</span></div></div>",

The stairwell was just wide enough to fit her mammoth rear, which jiggled and swayed with every step. It was hypnotizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, we made it to Ivana's large dressing room. All the doors and seats were wide enoung for Ivana, and there was a large mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvana walked over to a sofa and sat down, the sofa creaking under her immense ass.

My neck felt stiff as I moved my head to look upwards at a platform standing right above the fate's hand, held afloat by six walkways arching over the enormous roulette wheel. A tower was stood in the center that was lined by a golden cage, the lights from the glass elevators inside shining through as they traveled up or down through the very roof of the casino, all an ominous mural that warned of the excessive grandeur laying above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, every step I made pushed the knife deeper into my heart, each one flashing another thought through my mind of every smack I'd receive from some heiress' tail as I weaved through the slot machines, dodged past drunk guests, twisted up the spiral stairway to the walkway, and made the final march over the bridge, the lights of the fate's hand shining under me as I was forced to watch the doors to the elevators come closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stood before the elevators panel, I cherished what little time left I had of my free well before I held my lighter up to the access scanner, which glowed a bright green as the doors parted, and I made my way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust four days shy of my old record with the Golden Suites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only a small touch of comfort that was brought to the space by the excessive taste of the room, the walls and furiture all bleached with white in the style of both the ornate lace of a rich Victorian estate and the sleek white surfaces of a modern spaceship. The light of a crystal chandelier falling on my back as I sat on a footstool in the foyer space, now dressed in a butler's suit with my jaw resting on my palms. The couches to a living area at my right stood along a curved staircase leading to the rooms above, their cushions devoid of any wrinkles implying they were ever sat upon, all bordering a circular region concaving into the room's floor, housing a neatly organized wooden case opposite of the seats for a super-widescreen TV. The dining table beneath the walkway to the guestrooms was all set for a large banquet, and even the pool table behind the sitting region was arranged and ready for a game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of it was too last, though, something that was almost sad to remember as I gazed at all the room's splendor. No matter how high end the most expensive people alive could try and spritz themselves up as, it was a rare occurrence to clean up a used room without finding at least <i>one</i> stain of something bodily on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten...nine...eight...seven...\" I whispered aloud, rising from my seat as the last few seconds of my life ticked away. \"Three...two...one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, I put on a winning smile and folded my hands behind my back.

I took it out and snapped it open, noticing a new text from Miss Holmes on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Visit the dove cage.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing what it meant, I wearily looked to my left, then my right, then twisted around and power walked my way through a nearby island of slot machines, ignoring the loud mixture of constant ringing, bubbly music, and screams of either sheer joy or pure fury. I kept my eyes open for anybody likely to look away from their games and notice me as I moved towards the elevators to the Golden Suites, always keen to walk behind the card tables and slot machines to stay out of view as much as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving not made myself interesting to anybody on my trip to the elevators, I ducked behind a trash can next to one of the platinum-plated sliding doors, pulling open a hatch at its foot. A duct opened underneath that was just large enough for a human to enter, and I needled myself in foot-first, making sure that they connected with the rungs of a ladder built into the wall. My stomach went in next, then my shoulders, and then my head, and I followed up by pulling the hatch shut and twisting the handle on the lock. A light at the roof of the pipe automatically went on, and I let out the breath I'd been holding before I proceeded to climb my way down, my steps echoing off the narrow walls of the passageway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd passed by ten rungs until my foot hit the floor, the tube widened enough at my right to make room for a knobless door. I laid my hand on the black clad near where the door handle would've been, then brought my face down to look straight into the eye scanner on the wall, cringing as the laser flared to life and scanned along my iris. A satisfying <i>ding!</i> rang out as the red light at the top of the doorframe turned green, and the panel slid open, revealing an elevator whose walls and floor were pure white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped inside and hit the only button on the panel, folding my arms behind my back as the door slid back into place, the entire elevator jittering slightly as it went into motion and began to rise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kira? Lisa?\" I called as I knocked on the door. \"It's me, anybody home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to Lisa and Kira's room sat at the other end to a short (relatively speaking) corridor leading from the elevator. The width of the hallway was the same to that of the Aether Suite's space, and the walls were painted the same shade of red and white, but the air still felt stagnant without any doors or window to give any of light to the space. Their room's door was so big that I actually had to knock just short of punching it for the sound to carry through, but there wasn't a sign of movement inside to show that I'd been heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brought my fist down to knock again, but I'd just made contact with the wood when a tiny pair of hands squirmed their way between the door and its frame, effortlessly pulling it open. It stoped just short of a lone figure who stood eye to eye with me, not seeming all tat pleased by my presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You</i>...\" He roughly whispered in my voice, slowly raising his arm to point a finger right at my face. He had my face, too, the resemblance between us so uncanny that even the parts in our hair matched. \"After all these years, I've finally found you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crossed my arms along my chest, silently judging his appearance. \"Like what you see, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You took everything from me!</i>\" He snapped. \"You stole my <i>life</i>, my <i>family,</i> my <i>home</i>, and you even took my <i>face</i> from me! You'd stripped me of everything I'd ever known, parading around with all I'd ever owned like it was yours, and now...\" His scowl rose into a twisted smile. \"...I finally have the chance for revenge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes, pointing down at his chest. \"Well, if <i>I'm</i> the imposter, then I must've done a really shitty job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned again, and his eyes went down to where I was pointing, at two massive breasts hanging off of him that he tried to keep hidden by wrapping them up in his arms. He tried to hold on to the angsty look for a few more seconds before smiling and raising his arms in defeat, letting his mammaries bob freely. \"Okay, but I had you going there for a <i>second</i>, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI briefly looked at the ceiling, then shook my head. \"Nope, not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little?\" He asked, pinching his fingers together. \"Not even the <i>teeniest</i> bit jarred?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but you really gotta work on my glare more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no fun.\" He pouted, but his mouth tensed up as his hand went down to his stomach, which I then noticed was starting to expand. \"Hey, you...you might wanna back up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the pressure in his voice, I did just that, and did it so hurriedly that I ended up tripping on my own shoes and falling right on my ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a second, his twiggy form was obliterated by an explosion of white that nearly doubled him in height, his clothes being shredded into ribbons as his stomach exploded through in an almost spheric mass of feathers that utterly towered over me. A mighty tremor rippling through the ground as it slammed down onto the floor, and her breasts and legs kept on growing and growing until they fit upon the form of a ludicrously obese female, the sudden rush in size creating a jiggle that lingered around in her overabundance of lipid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mask that she wore of me was grotesquely stretched so the mouth was gripping around a skinny pink beak pointing out from between blubbery cheeks, and she blinked in surprise before grabbing it and tearing it right off, shaking loose her long, brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was the voice good, though?\" She snickered in her true voice, smiling once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little high pitched, but you got the accent spot on.\" I admitted, getting back on my feet and dusting my pants off. \"So, what'd you guys need help with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in, we'll tell you.\" Lisa invited, stepping backwards and moving out of the door's way. </span></div></div>",

I'd known a lot about it before I got around to seeing it last sunday, and I can easily vouch that it still held up as a very strong movie that gives one of the most creative, yet also blunt and realistic portrayals of crime put in cinema. The story is absolutely fantastic in how the separate narratives and perspectives manage to perfectly compliment one another and smoothly intertwine together, with characters that are backed up by excellent writing and a fantastic cast that matches their personalities flawlessly. The cinematography is also absolutely fantastic; there are several shots of the movie good enough to be hung on a wall, but captures the cold and brutal winter snowing around them very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong story short, Fargo is very funny, very deep, very intense, and both a simple yet complex tale that warns about the dangers of greed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a seperate note, I am currently eating Boston Cream Pie ice cream. It tastes very nice, but I feel that the cake chunks mixed in are a bit of a chore to eat outside of the fudge and custard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, so I have no idea what to put down for the choices below, so I'll just let you decide.

Anybody home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallways down at Garnet's level in the Aether Suites was one of the very few that felt the closest to the comfort level of a human's, a section where all the rooms stood along the outside rim of a circular corridor, the center wall occupied by wide, collisseum-esque archways of glass overlooking a pool in the center. Against the red walls and burgundy carpeting at their feet, all of the doors were carved by hand from a rich black ebony that was matted by an exotic varnish, but were chiseled into a flawless likeliness of one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven enough time, however, it'd get pretty easy to tell the doors of the short-time guests' rooms from those of the money-crazy demigods who treated the hotel like their own personal condos, and Garnet's was no exception. Even from a distance, it was pretty easy to weed her room from a distance, mainly due to a red welcome mat sitting out in front of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat didn't seem natural this time around was how long it was taking for me to get a response. Usually, Garnet was eager to hitch our arms together whenever I had some free time to goof off, but now it was taking a while to even hear her footsteps leave the bed. I could tell she was inside, too, going off of something playing on her tv's speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garnet?\" I said again, knocking for what I thought would be my last try, but I finally got a response. The bedspring of her mattress groaned, but whoever sat on top took a pause, almost hesitating and pondering whether or not to answer before she stood up and came to the door. The knob turned, but the door was only pulled open a tad, held partially shut by the security chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou probably wouldn't've guessed Garnet was the heiress to a billionaire family just from looking at her. I'd never seen her wear anything that'd cost up to a hundred dollars, or really styled her hair beyond tinges of red dye at the tips of her black split ends, but today, she didn't look like she'd woken up till 10:30 in the morning, dressed in a white bathrobe while still ridden with bed hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet actually gave a tiny gasp when she looked down to see me waiting for her, then tried to give half of a smile. \"Hello, Gregory. How are you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Garnet.\" I answered, tilting my head to the side. \"I just got the week off, so I thought I'd drop by! Wanna do something for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet finally looked pleasantly surprised, but not as much as any other time we'd hung out. \"Sure, come right in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shut the door, unhitched the lock, and opened it all the way, inviting me in. Like with the doormat, the interior made it pretty clear that she'd spent a while making the space her own, as the walls were covered by posters of famous heavy metal bands, and hastily folded clothes sat around in the dresser's drawers. The bed was horribly made, and a projector sitting between the pillows shone a movie onto the ceiling, clearly some kind of campy slasher flick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh...\" I began, stepping around a few socks sitting around on the floor. \"Anything you'd had in mind to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd wanted to see the end of this movie, if that's alright.\" She said, plopping back onto the bulky layers of blanket on her bed. \"If you wanted to do something else, though, I'm open!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"Nah, I can watch for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted the other half of the bed, and I sat down myself. It wasn't made up as pretty as all the other room's bed, but any part of my body that touched the mattress felt as though it were released from the aches and pains of reality, letting in a soothing bliss that eased all of my muscles as I laid back, sighing contently as I watched the scene above. It was of some cartoonishly big-breasted cheetah screaming her head off as she ran straight through the bushel of a forest, her chest weighing her down as she was chased by some witch-masked guy slicing his way through the branches with a sickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I turned my head along the pillow to look at Garnet, I could tell from her eyes that she just wasn't getting into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright, Garnet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" She asked, tilting her head my way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem kind of...I dunno, off today. Something happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no...no. Nothing happened.\" She answered with a tone that definitely sounded like something'd happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled over onto my side, holding my head up with a fist. \"Garnet, C'mon. What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to spill it out, but whatever it was, she was taking her sweet time to get to the moment of truth. She took in a slow, steady breath, covering her eyes with her wings as she fearfully let it all back out in a shaky sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garnet?\" I asked, now filled with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...mother's coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gulped, practically forcing the rest of the words out. \"She called this morning to tell me that she'd decided to check up on me early, and she'll be Sapphire me to find out how Rhodes I'd been doing. She'll also be Sapphire Rhodes my sister to Sapphire Rhodes Sapphire Rhodes the hotel, and Sapphire Rhodes Sapphire Rhodes my Sapphire Rhodes Sapphire Rhodes Sapphire Rhodes and Sapphire Rhodes Sapphire Rhodes Sapphire Rhodes Greg? Sapphire Rhodes Sapphire Rhodes Sapphire Rhodes Sapphire Rhodes Sapphire Rhodes Sapphire Rhodes <b><i>Greg?</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huuuuurh...?\" I slurred, my jaw hanging agape until I snapped it shut. \"I-I-I-I...I-I-I'm sorry...<i>what?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat back up, resting her bill upon her wings as she folded them along her knees. \"She and my sister'll be here in a week, and they'll be checking up on my progress. You know,\" she stroked her feathered hands along her meager potbelly \"whether I'd made all the thousands of dollars a night worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that, my expectations of a carefree week of fun were all dunked headfirst into a whirlpool of terror and existential agony. Sapphire Rhodes. <i>The</i> Sapphire Rhodes, a name that I was terrified to admit I shared a sliver of the multiverse with was going to be in my country. In the same structure as I was, turning around all the same corners and trekking along the same paths I might've walked on the floors long ago, probably drinking the same water or breathing the same air molecules I once had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire Rhodes, the mastermind for a business that probably took in more corporates than employees, its arms reaching to grab buildings right out of the ground from across the world. Sapphire Rhodes, a woman with more power to do as she pleased than the queen of England herself. Sapphire Rhodes, one of the most outspoken (and successful) advocates against the fair treatment of humans under facilities owned by anthros, even if a quarter of her arguments were just venting on what piles of filth she saw them as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire Rhodes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...my...god...\" I mouthed out, eyes staring into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gregory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back at Garnet, snapping back out of my daze, but was hit with a double of worry when I looked back at her. Right then, I realized how close I was getting to finally seeing gone of my favorite guests in all the resort see herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe looked into one another's eyes again, showing each other a look of fear that helped us read one another's minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long, again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked away. \"...three days.\"</span></div></div>",

You're my friend, and I'm NOT letting that happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet looked confused for a moment\u2026and then everything was a blur and I felt myself getting yanked upward, faceplanting onto her ample feathery chest.. She was constricting me in a hug, her wings and arms wrapped around me. She craned her long neck down and nuzzled my head with her beak, cooing. \u201cThank you, thank you Greg. You can\u2019t imagine what a relief this is\u2026Mother would never let me off the leash again\u2026Oh, thank you!\u201d She choked out a happy sob, word failing as she kept nuzzling me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hugged her back\u2014and NO. I DID NOT \u201ctake the opportunity\u201d to cop a feel on her breasts.<br>\r\nShe\u2019s my FRIEND, goddammit. I wouldn\u2019t do that to her at a time like this. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this,\u201d I promised, looking up at her.. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet wiped a tear and smiled, picking me up toward her face. \u201cThank you, Greg.\u201d She said quietly. Then she brought me to her beak and kissed me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust for a moment, we allowed ourselves to forget everything. Just savor the moment, an anthro and a human\u2014no, <i>two people</i>\u2014keeping each other afloat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think it sounds mushy? Well screw you, we were happy.<br>\r\nAnd then we let it pass.

No fear, no tears. Good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe HAD OUR MOMENT,\u201d I continued, \u201cBut now we get serious. Sapphire sent you here to fatten up, we\u2019ll do it.

I was eager to drop by one of my favorite places to work in, let alone casually be inside; The Glass Tornado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the monorail zoomed out of the tunnel and out into the summertime dome, I actually flinched at the synthetic sunshine pouring in through the windows, overlooking a sandy beach against a wavy ocean with a bright blue sky above, a plaza with dozens of other pools and all kinds of shops, and a tall, rocky mountain right on the back end, with colorful water slides sprouting from the top and streaming into or around the rockface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monorail gently skidded to a stop inside a station perched above a horde of trees, conveniently built facing the beach, as I disembarked and headed for shore. For the crapton of stuff to do around the Glass Tornado, I just thought of starting simple and unfurled my towel onto the sand, opting to just lay back and watch the clouds pass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still pretty early, leaving me with plenty of space to claim. I could still see some giantesses in the very distance, including a familiar bulky green figure hunched over at the snack bar and another brown spot wading through the sand, but as things looked, I'd have plenty of time alone to just sit back at stare at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all the times I'd worked there, it <i>still</i> stunned me that it was winter outside. If you'd kidnapped me, carried me to the Glass Tornado's beach, and tore the bag off my head only there, I'd easily be convinced. The clouds drifted from screen to screen at flawless angles no matter were under the dome you stood, with no tangible shape or pattern to their design, while the \"sunspot\" in the ceiling drifted over the landscape in real time, casting light over the land that maintained the exact feeling of standing outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know, for somebody borderline megalomaniacal who had gladly sent me off into some insane schemes, it actually wasn't that hard for me to say that miss Holmes was a friggin' <i>genius.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they came too late for me to react when a set of footsteps stomped up behind me in the sand, the mountain-like body of its owner blocking out the light of the fake sun...</span></div></div>",

I sat up, watching her with contempt as she trudged off into the sunset, grumbling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the <i>hell</i> did she get a job here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" I turned my head to a tall, lanky figure standing behind me, one with bright turquoise skin. It was another dragon, one with short, scruffy brown hair and yellow eyes, clad casually in a black tank top and a blue bating suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you happen to work here?' He asked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's actually my day off, but if it's somethi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not asking for something, I just wanted to know...\" He pointed to Olivia. \"That dragon you were just talking with...what's her name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name?\" Wow. Someone actually wanted to expand their knowledge of Olivia Moenk's existence. \"Olivia. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia...\" He mulled over silently, and then, of all things, smiled. Without looking at me or saying anything else, he grabbed something from inside his pants' pocket and jammed it into my shirt's, quickly following the rough sand path with a vague perk in his step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The heck was that about?\" I pondered aloud, pulling out the tip he'd slipped me.<i> Well, at least I got a few-</i> \"<i>HOLY SHIT!!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my hands was a fan of five hundred dollar bills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The White Brimstone was a buffet of fatasses pouring over their seats anytime you'd walk in, the clamor of their ruthless chomping mixed with classical music played over the speakers. The shortest out of all of them were still tall enough that my hairline could meet their shoulders while they were hunched over the tables, whereas the others were huge enough to be held high over a house's room, and fill out just as much property, rarely even conversing as they always sat and stuffed themselves sick with twenty course meals laid on several white-clothed tables' worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, though, when you step in as a customer, the White Brimstone still looked like a damn good place to eat. The atmosphere was nice and clean, the food actually looked good enough for commercials, and the place smelled friggin' <i>amazing</i>. The giant christmas tree on top of the kitchen was a nice centerpiece, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Might as well visit Candace, while I'm here.</i> I mulled over. I weaved through the tables to get into the main kitchen, but I kept a weary eye around me, trying not to get too close or too far from the other patrons. I'd seen cases workers delivering meals so large to our customers that they'd accidentally get swiped up in the meal, more often than not getting swallowed whole, with a 50-50 chance of coming back to work the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Holmes would still chew them out for being tardy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully I'd managed to avoid getting snatched away on my way to the main kitchen, where the place was in its usual bustle during the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for Candace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace's station was perched in the center, right in the very bullseye of the restaurant. Normally when I'd come in she'd be completely mellow, easy to get a nice hello from, but now she was using the artillery of muscles throbbing within her body to constantly jump between three different cooking stations with impressive speed for somebody so big, with a frantic expression that implied somebody'd bomb the place if she didn't cook just right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Candace. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Greg! Can't talkie....must cookie!\" Candace tossed a handful of chopped onions into a simmering pan, which erupted in a cloud of steam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candace, is everything alright?\" I was actually getting worried. Candace was <i>never</i> the type to scare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you marry me?\" Candace blurted out, hunching forward to flaunt her behind at me. \"If you absolutely had to marry somebody right now, like if you had a gun to your head, would it be me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the <i>hell</i> is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll <i>tell</i> you what's going on!\" Candace spun around, thrusting a batter-laden whisk only inches from my face. \"<i>Blake Rainestone</i> is going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Blake Rainestone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the most beautiful....<i>thing</i> to ever grace the world with his presence!\" Candace said, dreamily, her voice cracking. She yanked down on a string that hung from behind one of the oven vents, unrolling a movie poster that overlooked her work station. \"...and he's gonna be in Gaia 2.0 for a <i>whole year!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poster was for some movie called Blades of Amber 2. I'd never heard of it, but sure enough, I could recognize the sole figure against the black backdrop. It was the same guy who'd tipped me on the beach, even if the action-star snarl on his face and the gun in his hands were a bit of a detraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, and a smudge of lipstick kissed against his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I saw that guy before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace instantly froze, her knife stuck in mid-chop. \"...you did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, in the Glass Tornado. He tipped me five hundred dollars!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace stared straight into oblivion for several second before, to my utter horror, she <i>sniffled</i>. \"He...he tipped you <i>five hundred dollars?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, Candace was bent over me, grabbing my shoulders as she barked an avalanche of questions into my face. \"WHAT WAS HE LIKE WAS HE BEAUTIFUL DID HE LOOK HUNGRY DID YOU KNOW WHICH WAY DID HE WENT SHOULD I SWITCH OVER TO LAUNDRY IF HE-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>CANDACE!!!</b></i>\" I screamed, surprised that I could instantly shush a muscle-packed dragon towering me by several feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...sorry.\" She said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright... but I just saw him for a few seconds.\" I explained. \"Olivia was giving me crap for having the week off and not her, but when she went off he came up to me, asked what her name was, and tipped me for telling him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace said nothing. Her face didn't change, gazing deep into my eyes with a completely blank stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Candace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...he asked for <i>Olivia's</i> name?\" She finally spoke, her mouth quivering. \"...and you <i>gave</i> it to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. No big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Candace looked like she was about to throw up. She weakly stumbled back up, clutching the nearest counter to stay upright. \"He's interested...in Olivia. <i>My sister.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, come on, he's only met her for a day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace's face still wrenched in disgust at the thought, slamming a fist into the counter hard enough that the cabinet beneath actually cracked. I could almost see hundreds of dreams shattering in her mind, a single tear trickling out of her eye, but her head slowly rose back up with a newfound energy in her face, her eyes visibly blazing orange in a terrifying snarl of determination. \"...that's all it takes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Candace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chauncey, Edward, I'm gonna need you on fryers A and F! I'm going on break!\" She called to two others working in the kitchen, untying her apron. \"Greg, I'm gonna need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help? With what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd met Blake longer than I have, so you can arrange things with him a lot easier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Candace, I think you're overreacting just a teeny little bit. How could I even-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Candace took me by my armpits and gently lifted me up so that our eyes were level, allowing her to give me the most soldier-serious look that anyone had ever given me in my entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you help me out and get me to meet Blake Rainestone, I'll make a deal with Miss Holmes that'll get you free food from the White Brimstone for the <i>rest of your life</i>.\"</span></div></div>",

Her lips mouthed out a long list of silent words, but her mind was filled with enough intrigue for them to be heard as a string of breathless whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"six thousand calories a day with eight thousand equaling a pound, and with every meal being approximately two thousand a double in consumption would be\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" I said, shaking my head as I left her lap and stepped out of the bushel. \"Nope, nope, nopity nope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, it's just a <i>few</i> <sub><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">thousand</font></sub> pounds!\" She argued, not asking me what I thought she was thinking. \"Just look around, it's not gonna be anything <i>conspicuous!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candace, listen.\" I turned around and grabbed Candance by both shoulders. \"You're my friend. There's a <i>really</i> short list of stuff that'd  to far for me to help you with, but listen, this shoots a straight hole through it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace snorted a tiny puff of smoke. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this isn't you, Candace! The Candace I know doesn't go around and pout about having some pop idol in her arms to cuddle with forever, or gain a crapton of weight to impress some guy that she'd never even met before! If anything, she'd be the kind to smack the sense back into anybody thinking about that kind of crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Candace pouted, folding her arms along her broad chest. \"You're no fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to say something else, but instead, I simply shrugged, walking away from her. \"Well, do what you want, but I'm not gonna be a part of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. How's Christmas and New Year's, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI froze, my foot stuck in heel-toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me out, and Miss Holmes'll give you the rest of the year off.\" She spoke with total honesty.. \"Heck, maybe a few days into January, if you wanna play around with your presents a little more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few seconds, I stood still in thought, then turned around. Candace's head stood over the bush with a serious, trustworthy-looking face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how's that sound?\" She asked. \"It sound nice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and here we are, the humble abode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick stop back at the Brimstone, Candace'd swapped her white chef's outfit out for a more casual light blue T-shirt and black jeans. Later on, for the something-dozenth historical landmark that was getting thrown at me for the day, I got to see Candace get the monorail to stop at her house's station in Limestone Ridge, a stop that the train'd normally plow right through on a normal run. It wasn't even much of a station, at least not as well built or streamlined as any of the other resort's stops, but let the train open right onto a stretch of dirt path that was blocked off by a metal gate a short walk from the train, stylishly held shut by a brass lock fitted on where the fences met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace's claws picked into the back of her shirt's collar and pulled out a loop of twine hanging around her neck, with one end tied around a similarly brass-plated key. She unlocked the fence and, with almost no visible effort, pulled the two towering gates apart with the raw might of her arms, inviting me to follow as she stepped through and entered her front yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nice vast as it looked, Candace's home wasn't exactly big enough to be a mansion for her, but stood more along the lines of a pretty rich-looking house somewhere in the hills of California, sitting on top of a long set of brick stone stairs. Like with The Glass Tornado, it'd be pretty hard to step into Limestone Ridge and adapt to the fact that you were still indoors, as the house stood at the very tip of a hill that was shrouded in a dense forest of oak, the backyard laid along the edge of a very deep, gorgeous ravine that was split down the center by a wide river, the half over yonder decorated by a small community of wooden cabin-esque manors visible through a mesh of pine trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking my bags with her, she lead me to the front door, where she flipped open a panel built on a metal pole standing near where the keyhole would've been. After punching a few numbers into the keypad, she laid her claw on the screen, which scanned its print by a thin green laser. The red bulb at the bottom turned a bright green, and I heard something mechanical click out of place with the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for the fun of feeling rich!\" She chuckled, opening the door and standing at the side, waiting for me to enter. \"Go on in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at her, then into the house, and I went past the doormat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I'd expected Candace's home to look, it looked like the home of someone with a considerable amount of wealth and prestige, but she didn't go all out and gold plate everything in sight, either. The foyer was a cavernous living room whose ceiling went up to the very arch of the roof, its slope punched through with a rectangular skylight. The kitchen and dining room were just two little buds that stemmed off the room's space, and a walkway traveled along the roof of the two that traveled past a wide expanse of window overlooking the back, accessed by a staircase sitting to the left of us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guest room's this way.\" Candace noted, guiding me to a hallway at the foot of the steps. She pointed to the doors she walked past. \"That there's my studio, which I'd appreciate you'd not go in, that door there goes down to the basement, where I think we'll be hanging out for the most of your stay, and right there's the library.\" but then we passed by a door held shut by a plethora of padlocks, and her face grew deathly serious. \"...and that's my hoard. <i><b>DON'T GO IN THERE.</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, ma'am!\" I stammered, saluting out of reflex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace saw the gesture, and her hardened look softened with a touch of guilt, and she continued to last one. \"...and this is the guest room, where you'll be staying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door at the very end, which lead into a more standard, yet homely-looking bedroom. The bed, dresser, wardrobe, and bathroom door all looked a bit scaled up for what a human would've normally lived in, but everything looked passable enough for me to spend a few nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad.\" I observed, nodding. I took my bags from her and set them on the table at the bed's foot, snapping open the latches. \"So, what happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer claw came down on her shoulder. \"As of now, Gregory, you're on lazy duty.\" She answered, her tone almost sounding like she was knighting me. \"You're here to cook me up some grub, and make sure I don't make <i>any</i> unnecessary movement. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" I replied, nodding once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I'd say right now's about time, or maybe the qualification round.\" She continued, smiling. \"Sound up to three firesauce burgers, and two platters of sugar fries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was. It sounded pretty much like just a scratch under the size most other customer's orders. \"Yes, Ma'am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Sure hope I chose right with you, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, Candace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she wasn't a man, Candace's basement had all the fixings of someone's man cave. The walls were all hardwood and decorated by movie posters, the tv was wired to a market of players and consoles arranged within the stand, and a mini bar sat along the wall behind the couch, all on top of a thick bed of maroon carpeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if I hadn't seen her eat anything, the bulkiness of Candace's muscles almost made her look fat by the way she comfortably sat within the armchair. Her tense abs almost gave her a bit of a pot belly, and hand in hand with a life of taste-testing, she already had a bit of roundness in her abdomen to start off with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Gregory! Just put it on the tray here.\" She answered excitedly, motioning her head to a poker table standing before her. The silver platter I carried in felt pretty weighty, holding three of the most expensive meal in the world and a heaping pile of one of the sweetest, most fattening side items to grace us with its presence, but for good measure, I threw in a tall glass mug of champagne soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Candace began, intently staring at the first burger she grabbed, taking a moment to savor the moment and hold it before her maw. \"...no turning back. Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she opened her mouth wide, and bit down on her first chomp.</span></div></div>",

Greg thinks to himself and looks at Candace. '...we're getting there.' It's true. Compared to how she was last week, one could see a difference. Candace's frame was a bit wider than usual, about 6 inches worth of fat accumulated around her body. Her belly barely fits in the shirt she's wearing and her pant were tearing at the seams. \"So Greg, how do I look?\" Candace rotates and shows Greg their progress. \"Um... bigger?\" Greg replied back. \"<b>Bingo</b>! At this rate I'll take Blake away from that <b><i>FUTURE-BOYFRIEND-STEALING-WITCH!!</i></b>\" Candace growled angrily at that last part, scaring Greg half to death. She looks back at Greg with her on her hips and smiled to reassured that she wouldn't hurt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>GRRROOOWWWWWWWWLLL</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low groan fills the room. They both looked around a bit before realizing where it came from. Candace looks at her protruding tummy and gave it a pat. \"Looks like the beast inside is hungry again.\" Greg chuckles a bit from the joke. \"So what it'll be today? Burgers? Pizza? Fish? Spiders?\" He sneered a bit when he said spiders. \"First off, Eeww. And second off, I wanna try something a bit more...\" Candace leans into Greg and picks him up \"...<i>raw</i>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her mouth and brings the helpless human closer. This terrified Greg, as a result, he starts to squirm in her grip trying to escape. \"Candace this isn't funny anymore.\" She didn't listen and was still bringing him in. \"Candace wait, we can talk about this. Wait! STOP!\" His face entered her maw. \"<b>NOOOOOO!</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg winced and held his eyes closed for impact. He noticed that he didn't move and opened his eyes greeting his own with Candace's eyes. \"Gotcha.\" Candace smirked. \"That wasn't funny I thought you were actually going to eat me!\" Greg yells at Candace. \"Come on, just because were friends doesn't mean I can't see you squirm.\" She said to Greg. After putting him back down Candace's belly grumbled again. \"Ok, what do you want...\" He looks dead into Candace's eyes. \"<b>FOR REAL?</b>\" He asked again putting emphasis on \"for real\". Candace thought for a moment before answering his question... with another one. \"Say... have you ever heard of a Great Gaian Tuna?\" \"No, what is it?\" \"The Great Gaian Tuna is a monster of a fish. It can grow up to 6 feet and its meat has the highest amounts calories on the fish market. But there's a catch to getting those calories. You must eat it raw.\" The thought of eating raw fish made Greg cringe a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo, what's your point?\" \"Well there's going to be a shipment of them heading to the White Brimstone today. I'm sure they won't mind if we took a couple of them.\" Greg couldn't believe what she was suggesting right now. \"<b>YOU WANT US TO STEAL FROM THE RESORT!?</b>\" Candace quickly grabbed Greg and pushed into her fat belly. \"Ssssssshhhh, not so loud\" Candace shushed Greg. After about a minute she released him. \"Candace we could lose our jobs for this. Miss Holmes might actually eat me alive if she finds out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fourth of July and Easter.\" Candace said. \"Huh?\" Greg said confusedly \"I'll add the Fourth of July and Easter to your day offs, Miss Holmes doesn't allow human-exclusive holidays so I'll convince her to add those to your day offs.\" \"........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...............<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now what?\" Greg asked behind Candace. The two of them made to the resort's shipping dock, both shivering under the snow despite the warm winter jackets they wore. \"Nooow, we wait. Then we take a few and book it. Here they come!\" A white truck with a blue fish on top slowly backs up. Two able bodied anthros jump out the truck. The first was a muscular bear anthro and the second a hefty cat, both male. They unhinge the lock on the truck's back doors and open them. Candace and Greg thought they would be out a rack of dead tuna, they were dead wrong. What the two anthros pulled out was a giant fish tank with many tunas swimming in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have got to be kidding me...\" Greg literally just fell to his knees. \"Oh stop over exaggerating.\" Candace picked him up and put him back on his feet. The two anthros left the truck, probably to get equipment. \"Okay now's our chance let's go.\" Candace perked and ran, with all of her expanded curves wobbling about. Greg followed behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them approached the tank seeing a ladder on the side. \"So who goes up?\" Greg asked. \"You go, I'll break the ladder if I go up.\" \"What no, you go up.\" Candace glared at Greg, then cupped a hand at the side of her face.  \"Huh...hear that? Sounds like organ music!\" \"Organ music?\" Greg asked. \"Yeah, just like the kind they play at the RainbowvDome's baseball stadium! You know, like near <i>the lemonade stand during the fourth of july!</i>\" Candace growled. \"...fair enough..\" Greg squeaked. He reluctantly climbs the ladder and makes it to the top. \"Okay Greg you can do this.\" He said to himself. Greg drove his arms in and grabbed one before tosing it down. Olivia grabbed it by the tail. \"Okay try getting one more.\" \"Oh come on!\" \"<b><i>LEMONADE, GREG.</i></b>\" \"the things people will do for love.\" Greg squeaked again. He grabbed another and dropped it. Candace grabbed it by the tail as well. \"Okay let's go.\" Candance ran to her place. \"Hey wait for me!\" He slid down the ladder and followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the manor, the two of them saw their fruits of labor. Laying there were two big tunas flopping about. \"Now what?\" \"Let's take them out back I know the perfect way to eat them.\" The duo each grabbed one by the tail and dragged the two fish to the back of Candace's manor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n..............<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg tugged one more time and made it out into the back. He saw there was a large swimming pool with a small diving board you can step on to. \"Are you going to put them in the water and live out your fantasy of being a shark?\" Greg joked. \"As fun as that sounds..\" Candace clapped. Upon doing so the pool drained in a matter of seconds and stairs unfolded next to the diving board. Candace walked down the stairs and into the drained pool. \"You are going to drop them into my mouth.\" She finished. \"Whatever you say boss.\" Greg tugs the two fish and brought one on to the board. He picks it up, practically hugging it, and looked down where Candace was. He saw that she's standing below with her maw wide open. \"Well, here goes\" He says before dropping it. The tuna slid down Candace's throat with ease and landed in her stomach with a bouce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace licks her lips. \"Okay drop the second one.\" She commanded.  \"Aye aye Captain.\" Greg said with a salute. He picked up the second one, hugging it again. \"Launching torpedoe in 3.. 2.. 1--\" As soon as he finished counting the Tuna started resisting, flailing about. This caused Greg to start losing his balance and lean towards the edge of the board... where Candace is waiting below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he regain his balance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, something about the fish tasted absolutely <i>heavenly</i> as it passed over her tongue, all the more motivation she needed to keep on choking it down a few inches at a time, what little musculature that was left to be seen beneath the paunch along her neck tightly clenched as she sucked in with the strength of outer space's vaccuum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe readied her mind for some kind of gloat as she her mouth clear past the fish's widest point, something to really outwit one of his usual quips once she was able to breath again...but her smile fell when she opened her eyes at a pait of shoes crammed in against the tailfins, right in the middle of one last gulp that swallowed the two whole, her face settling in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...okay.\" She exhaled, panic rising in her voice as she looked upon her newly bloated middle, a pair of hand-shaped protrusions sticking out along the surface that she had a hunch weren't from the fish. \"Okay. Okay. Oooooooooooookay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"CANDACE!!!\"</i> Came Gregory's voice from within, destroying any hopeful doubt in her mind. <i><b>\"GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Just hold on Gregory!\" Candace answered, the contents distending her stomach weighing her down as she got up on her feet, jogging in place as she looked for any kind of solution to her problem. \"I-I'll get you out, right away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, from the floor of the empty pool, there was barely anything in sight or reach that could've helped her out. Nothing, that is, until she caught a stray glance of the diving board, sparking an idea in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute...\" She barely spoke, lips mouthing out the first steps of a plan. \"Tell me if you feel this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Feel what?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace returned by giving her own stomach a good punch, her body's natural padding negating the pain. \"That!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, I felt it, but I'm not hurt, if that's what you wanted.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep you back against my stomach and keep perfectly still, then!\" She instructed, taking the steps up out of the pool. \"And, uh... try and stay on top of thr fish, too, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<b>Or,</b> maybe we could focus on me<b> SEEING THE LIGHT OF DAY AND ENJOYING THE SIMPLER MOMENTS IN LIFE INSTEAD OF YOUR STUPID Fi</b>...wait, what's going on?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diving board groaned slightly under Candace's extra poundage, the contents of her belly sloshing around as she gave a short bounce. Relieved that it didn't immediately snap in half, but still desperately hoping the pain of accidentally eating one of her best friends would outmatch that of the impact, she jumped forward and dived stomach-first into the air-filled pool, pushing out her abdomen to ensure it hit the ground first...</span></div></div>",

I got talked into making you fatter, stole from the resort, hauled very heavy fish, and my best friend here swallowed me whole. I say I'm doing okay.\"</i> Greg's voice erupts from Candace's middle. \"Look, I'm sorry I got you into this mess.

She yelled in her head. 'Miss Blanc! She has ALL sorts of knick knacks. Maybe she can help.' With that being said Candace waddles off the Miss Blanc's apartment with Greg bobbing below her. On the way there Greg thought it be best to start a conversation. \"<i>So Candace, I know this is going to sound weird but... how did I taste?</i>\" Candace hesitated before giving him an answer. \"To be honest with you, you actually tasted quite bad.\" She lied, not wanting to scare Greg away from her. \"Like a sweaty socks might I add.\" \"<i>Hey! I <b>MIGHT</b> taste good if you seasoned me up</i>.\" Candace practically drooled at the thought of that. \"Are you saying you WANT to be eaten again?\" \"<i>N-not at all. I just thought humans were delectable to some anthros.</i>\" \"Anyway we're here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace sighed to herself before knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>KNOCK</b>* *<b>KNOCK</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's Opened!</i>\" a feminine voice said from inside. Without wasting any more precious time, Candace opened the door and walked inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace was a bit shocked when she saw Miss Blanc. The white moth was enormous. She was playing her video game then noticed Candace before pausing it and turning towards thhe conflicted dragon. \"Can I help you Candace?\" Miss Blanc asked. \"Yeah, I kind of have a..... problem..\" Candace said. \"What kind of problem?\" Candace sat down in the nearest chair and inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Miss Blanc was caught up with the dou's predicament. Candace lied a bit about how Greg tasted horrible. \"So Greg is in there?\"  \"Yeah... He is.\" She lifted her shirt and showed of her Greg and fish filled gut. Many sparitic movements erupted from it. Whether it's from Gregory or the Tuna is up to you. \"Lucky for you I have something that can help you.\" \"What is it?\" \"It's in the bag on the shelf behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, when Candace looked behind her, she saw a bag.

Hurry!\" Miss Blanc Instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace, however, stalled in following through, pausing long enough that Greg soon began emitting another string of muffled obscenities. Considering the sheer variety to all the exotic foods she'd have at hand in Gaia 2.0's kitchen, it was rare for her to find something edible that she'd never seen before; she could've seen herself expecting it to be a rock at first sight, its texture the same smooth, glossy ebony of obsidian, but a stem poked out at the very butt of the fruit a leaf hanging on that was still heathy and green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" She asked, tapping the shell with her claw, and was promptly surprised that the skin was barely scratched. \"Is it dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my promise, dear, that upon eating it, you and Gregory shall be as healthy as you both were the moment you two'd met.\" Miss Blanc swore, shutting her eyes and raising a stubby palm. \"...eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Eventually' implying <i>what?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"CANDACE, WHATEVER IT IS, I DON'T CARE IF IT'S A PIECE OF POO! <b>JUST EAT IT!!!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a slight punch against the inside of her stomach, Candace held the fruit before her lips, only hesitating to nervously lick at the roof of her mouth before throwing her jaws open and tossing the nut onto her tongue, downing it in a single gulp so quick that she could only barely taste the skin's bitter flavor. A tiny belch followed after from the air she swallowed, one claw held to her mouth while she caressed the other beneath her projected middle, closely observing its size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's happening. What's that supposed to...\" But Candace's thoughts trailed off upon turning her head back to Miss Blanc, the massive moth's face turned away with a claw cupped over her eyes. \"You're...you're looking away. You're looking away?! <i>What did you just make me-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc cringed as Candace was interrupted by a sickened retch coming up from her throat, followed by a series of empty heaves that buckled in the once mighty dragoness, each choke coming louder and wetter than the last. She could easily imagine the pain on Candace's face as the struggle to keep contained the matter fighting to rocket out of her stomach became harder and harder, imagining her cheeks bulging out and eyes watering in pain, but her antennae shot back at the sound of Candace's knees hitting the floor, her clogged throat emitting a muffled utterance of pain before loudly upchucking something that landed on the carpet with a wet thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that the worst was over, Miss Blanc lifted her claw to observe the scene in discomfort, but looked a thousand times more calmed than Candace was. Breathing heavily, Candace held her mouth shut with her hands, lips stretched back in terror with her pupils thinned into the tiniest slits; whatever sat before her was the same height as Gregory, the same build, uniform, and even had the same dusty blonde hair, but Candace held close to her heart the dwindling hope that whatever it was wasn't so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirming with a low grunt, it slammed a clawed hand down into the carpet, what little skin visible coated by black scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G...<i>Gregory?</i>\" Candace squeaked. \"Is that...<i>you</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's me, the <i>other</i> human you ate.\" The newly formed reptile snarked, pushing off the floor with an exasperated face. \"What's that even supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you <b><i>do?!</i></b>\" Candace snarled to Miss Blanc in rage, fire spitting from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll wear off in a week or two, I promise! Just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...who did<i> what</i> that'll wear off in a week or two?!\" Gregory asked, awakened enough for panic to creep into his voice. Miss Blanc opened her mouth to speak, but uncomfortably held it in as Gregory's eyes crossed onto his now pointed snout. Sweating from his brow, Gregory's clawed hands tenderly approached his muzzle to feel the shape of his jaw, fingers shaking as they traced along its edge up to the fins flaring from the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Miss Blanc spoke the first letter to some sort of words of encouragement, Gregory darted over to a beauty mirror in the corner, but gave a girly yelp once he was close enough to see himself. A tangent of high-pitched squeaks slipped past his teeth with every detail that his hands explored, from his draconic tail to a set of white horns pointing out from the back of his head, and he followed up with a fiery scream that propelled him backwards in a stream of flame, rocketing right into Candace's stomach and knocking the wind out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b><i>WHAT DID</i></b>...<i>cough</i>...<b><i>YOU</i></b>...<i>huurk</i>...</i>\" Gregory choked out through mouthfuls of silver flame, limply being pulled back up by Candace, who stood hunched over in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cauldron berry.\" Miss Blanc explained flatly. \"Given that anthros' stomachs reject the meat of their own race, many humans in the days of old would carry them around in the event that they were eaten, thus-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever history lesson you're going to teach us, Miss Blanc, it'd <i>better</i> end on a way to reverse this!\" Candace snapped, holding a wheezing Gregory up by his shoulders. \"How do you expect us to explain to Miss Holmes that <i>Gregory's a dragon?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same way that you'd explain to her that she's got a member of her crew with all kinds of new, improved abilities, any that you, her most prized asset, may possess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in his pained, delirious state, Gregory found it hard to snap back at her words, and he felt Candace lowering him as she, too, took her words in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I deeply apologize for the sporadic nature of all this, but once more, you have my most assured promise that Gregory will wake up a short while from now as if he'd never stopped being a human, no pains or pangs.\" Miss Blanc repeated in her most earnest tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...<i>ick!</i>\" Gregory was cut off by another errant of flame spraying from his throat, Candace watching down on him in sympathy as he bent over in another coughing fit, patting him on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...of course, he may have to learn a few basics, I'd never been a dragon myself.\" Miss Blanc noted, showing pity as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace glanced back with a tense expression, prepared to give off some steam and unload another tirade on her, but some of her anger waned away as Gregory got a hold of his breathing again, the smaller dragon strengthening up enough to get on his feet. Seeing his legs shiver, Candace sighed and took both of his hands, coaxing him back up. \"He'll change back. You promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If not, I won't spare any defenses at whatever burns you may wish to inflict on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...thanks.\" Candace mumbled as she coaxed him to the door, Miss Blanc's eyes somber as she gave a weak wave of the hand. Gregory tried to add something in as well, only to caught it up in smoke.</span></div></div>",

Candace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia continued to chow down on whatever Blake was offering her. Blake just sat there in his seat, his face bore a smile with his head resting on his hands. \"Have I ever told you that you are the prettiest thing here?\" Blake said still entranced. \"Oh don't worry, I'm very well aware of that.\" Olivia sneered before biting back into her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>UUUUURRP</b> * Olivia belches, blushing from a bit of embarrassment before giggling a bit. \"Excuse me.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA subtle *PSSST* gets her attention again. She looks over and see her twin sister calling for her. At first Olivia ignores Candace and was about to take another bite. *<b>PSSSSST</b>* Olivia winced. \"<i>Oh for the love of-</i> Blake would you excuse me for a moment?\" She said as politely as possible, trying her hardest to hide her annoyance. \"Take all the time you need~\" Blake said sweetly. Olivia aggressively pushes herself out of her seat and storms off in Candace's direction. Candace stood there with her hands behind her back as Olivia got closer until she was pressed up against her face. Olivia growled as she got close to her sister. \"What do you want? This better be worth my time...\" Candace brings her hands in front of her holding the transformed human by the chest. \"I wanted to introduce you to my new friend.\" Greg just glared at Candace the entire time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia's eyes and mouth widened a bit before she smile in a slutry way. \"Oh, and who is this little hunk?\" Greg wanted to stop this ASAP. \"My name is-\" \"Gale!\" Candace cut in. \"His name is Gale.\" \"Gale..\" Olivia repeated. \"Sounds like a name for a warrior. I like it.\" She leaned forward towards Greg. '<b><i>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!</i></b> Greg mentally screamed. The person that hated him is now flirting with him. '<i>This cannot get any worse...</i>. \"Is he single?\" Olivia asked. '<i>OOOOH <b>FUCK</b>!!!</i>' Candace was quick to answer. \"He is actually, but seeing as you already have someone-\" \"You can have the blue pushover. I'm more interested in your friend.\" Olivia softly grazed the side of Greg's cheek with one of her scaly fingers. \"Well, here you go.\" Candace held Greg out to Olivia, who gladly took him into her arms. \"Candace, Sisteeer. I know we haven't gotten along well. But this is possibly the best thing that's happened since that time you humiliated yourself in front of that boy in high school.\" A vein popped up on Candace's head. \"Glad I could help.\" She grunted. With that Olivia walked off, hoisting Greg over her shoulder. His top half dangled along her back as his hands touched her jiggly booty, they sunk a bit into her flesh. 'Wow, they're actually really soft- <b>WAIT WHAT THE HELL AM I THINKING!?</b>' Greg shouted in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake saw that Olivia was leaving and rushed after her. \"Olivia! Wait, where are you going!?\" Blake soon slowed seeing how far she went. He looked down at the floor, eyes watering a bit. \"I thought I found the one who actually loved me...\" Blake sadly said. \"You have now.\" A female voice behind him spoke. Blake turns to see... \"Olivia...? No, wait. You're different.\" \"I'm Candace, her much kinder and fatter twin sister.\" She added the last part in. She held out her hand. \"I think we'd be great together.\" She said calmly. Blake rubbed the tears from his eyes and took her hand. \"Yeah... I think we might.\" '<i><b>Eeeeeeeeeeee</b></i>' Candace mentally shrieked. '<i>This is the best day ever!</i>' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia unlocked the doors to her living quarters. After opening the door she throws \"Gale\" on top of her bed. \"Now don't move I'll be right back.\" She blew his a kiss before entering another room. Greg jerked out of the way from the kiss as if it was a deadly disease. \"Candace... you. Owe. ME. <b>BIG TIME!</b>\" He quietly shouted. Olivia walks back out in due time wearing a black two piece bikini that left little to the imagination. Even Greg didn't know whether to be aroused or grossed out. She brought out with her a cart of different foods and pushed it beside her bed. Olivia climbed onto the bed too. \"I want you to feed me.\" Olivia said. \"Come again?\" \"Me, laying down. You, on my belly, feeding me from this cart.\" \"Is there any-\" \"<b>RRRRRRRR</b>\" Olivia growled. \"Fair enough...\" Olivia soon laid down belly up. Pointing Greg up to her belly. Not wanting to get on her \"date's\" bad side he complied. Up on top of her tummy he felt how soft and squishy it was. 'Wow, I could sleep up here if I wanted- <b>STOP!</b>' \"Gale\" argued with himself. Olivia opened her maw and poinys at it with a sharp claw. Knowing the signal Greg picked up what looks like a big slice of raspberry cheesecake and popped it into her mouth. Olivia didn't even chew it up and just swallowed. A lump down down her throat and into her stomach. \"More...\" she said. Greg complies and tosses more food into her maw and watches her swallowing it all down. *Hic* Olivia hiccups. The sudden movement jostled Greg's pedestal, luckily he regained his balance.

Their surprised eyes locked together in a second that seemed to stretch into an eternity, but the two were immediately parted by another shriek from Gregory's throat that sent him flying straight into the ceiling, his back denting intothe plaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Olivia mulled, licking at a few extra sparks of white fire sticking between her teeth. \"Minty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory's arm pulled free on its own, and the rest of him followed suit and peeled away before he limply fell to the floor, emitting a pained of moan. His wings unfolded on reflex as he rolled onto his back, eyes barely able to see the ceiling above past the stars fluttering around in his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...nor could he discern a certain pitch black shadow as it slinked its way into his view, but by the time he could recognize the predatory glint in its eyes, it was too late to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!!!\" Gregory screamed, but any air left in his lungs was forced back out when Olivia rolled forward and flattened his miniature figure into the floor. With either of his cheeks pinched between her cleavage, legs dying of blood loss beneath the unbearable weight of her stomach, he could only wriggle his head from side to side in one last attempt to free himself, limbs barely able to twitch beneath whatever plushness Olivia's scaly body still possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching him struggle, Olivia happily licked around the points of her teeth before she threw her head down and clamping her mouth around his lips, his jaws stretching painfully as her fat tongue was forced into his maw. This time, all Gregory could do was scream, the seal formed by Olivia's maw glowing a bright white, and she eagerly opened up her throat and allowed the fire to flow straight down her neck and into the pit of her belly. The pressure on top of him became all the more unbearable, her already enormous midsection swelling considerably, but all that ended up doing was force him to scream louder, pumping even more fire to make her grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he'd finally screamed our all the fire in his lungs, after Olivia's belly had expanded enough to push her backside another two feet upwards, the obese dragoness relented and pushed down to roll backwards, her belly jutting outwards so much that its overblown size nearly sent her toppling right back down. His limbs felt bonded to the carpet, but Gregory's muscles refused to move when he thought to get back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Snuffed already.\" Olivia observed, smacking both hands down at either side of her gut and rubbing in circles. \"Not a good sign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the pain in his chest, Gregory's thoughts couldn't form words, only a sputter of vengeance that made him grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuuuuuut I can get around it.\" Olivia teased, tail swishing about on the floor. Reaching down, she grabbed him by the ankle and swung him down around her shoulder, elbow gripping him by the waist. \"Nothing like a stop at the opticuluum to get those flames pumping again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory couldn't even think to move his arms to beat against Olivia's back, but managed to shoot a glare at the ground as she waddled him out of her room, hoping that Blake was a good enough man for him to take his place...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Olivia waddled down to the Opticuluum carrying her date on her shoulder. Greg's top half was left dangling over Olivia's backside still in shock over what happened eariler. His hands patting her butt with each step she takes. He realized Olivia was still in her black bikini. '<i>She didn't even change out of her get up earlier. I'll either look like the luckiest man, or the weirdest. Well nobody will know it's actually me, I guess.</i>' Greg lammented. Olivia brimmed with a smile on her reptilian face. She didn't care that people were looking at her funny. She was having a great time and that's all that mattered to her. \"Enjoying the view back there sweety?\" She asked. \"I feel your claws foddling with my jiggly booty.\" Olivia popped her backside a bit. \"Can't get enough of it. Living the dream here.\" The human-drake said sarcastically. Olivia giggled at his response. \"Don't act like you're not enjoying it. I stayed in this on purpose ya' know.\" She said seductively. Olivia tugged the back of her bikini bottoms with her free hand a good distance before letting it snap back. The force caused her fat jello-like ass to ripple and wobble a bit. The way she said that made Greg quiver just a tiny bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good trek, Olivia walked inside of the Opticuluum. Greg could only see everything through a limited window but was still impressed by the sheer awesomeness nonetheless. The inside was massive. It was a bit dim but it gave the place more atmosphere to it. The front concession stand held lots of many snacks, all jumbo sized or course. The walls were littered with posters of various movies of all types of genres. From Sci-fi to Fantasy. And from Romance to Action, they had them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I can walk just fine now.\" Greg told Olivia. The smitten dragon placed her love down as gently as she could. Greg struggled a bit to regain and was about to fall from losing his balance, but Olivia caught him before that could happen. \"Uh... Thanks.\" He said reluctantly. Olivia gave him a big smile, showing off her pearly white sharp teeth. '<i>Wow. She's actually kind of cute like that...</i>' Greg blushed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what exactly did you have in mind?\" Greg asked. \"Weeeell... I was thinking something a little... <i>Romantic.</i>\" Olivia emphasized the last part. In all honesty Greg wasn't much for romance. But if it meant making sure he gets out unscathed or whatever, he'll have to follow along with Olivia. \"Alright, whatever you want I'll go with.\" He submitted. Olivia just brought her date into a bear hug. Greg was pulled into a face full of dragon boobies. Partly covered dragon boobies might I add. Breaking off from the hug the two of you walk into a theatre room. To Greg's surprise it was quite packed with no seats that allowed the two of you to sit together. Olivia sat down to where she believed was the best seat. The seat began to creak as she was getting herself comfortable. Greg was a bit confused as there was nowhere for him to sit. Olivia saw this and began patting her lap. Taking the signal Greg hoisted himself onto her lap. He was taking by surprise as Olivia wrapped her arms around Greg affectionately making him blush a bit. They both got comfortable just as the movie started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie was a romantic musical about a male and female singer, star crossed lovers with many of life's obstacles in the way, but won't let that get in the way of their love. '<i>This movie is kind of stupid...</i> Greg said in his thoughts. Olivia on the other hand was eating it all up. She was on the edge of her seat, almost threatening to push Greg off her lap with her lightly gurgling belly. Most of the fire in her gut is now mostly digested. (Don't ask.) Greg was surprised to see Olivia like this. 'Never took Olivia as the romantic type. This side of her is actually kinda fun to be around with.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one moment that caught Greg's attention. And that was when the two protagonists started to sing \"It Only Takes A Moment\". (Look it up on Youtube if you aren't familiar.) That really got Olivia into it. She was practically hugging Greg like a teddy bear. 'You know what, I think I'm starting like Olivia.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie ended there was something you needed to tell Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Olivia?\" \"Yes my love? Did you enjoy the movie?\" \"Yeah yeah, I liked it. It's just... there's something I need to tell you.\" Olivia's interest was piqued. \"Well what is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Put me down!\" He shouted. \"If you say so ~\" Olivia said with a toothy grin. All Gregory could see while looking down was a sinister smirk on her face before she opened her maw wide and started to lower him into it. All he could do was protest and fight back by trying to use his arms to stop the inevitable. Olivia responded to this by using her free hand to keep his arms together like hand cuffs. All Gregory can do now was struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face has now entered Olivia's mouth and soon starts to go down her throat. With just one swallow, his torso was now starting to enter the sinister dragon's esophagus. Olivia working her way with Gregory one gulp after another until his legs were all she had to go through. With just one powerful and loud *GULP* Gregory was gone....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia confirmed her victory with a hearty belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n *UUURRRPP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aaaaaaahh. That was goooooood.\" Olivia said in a satisfied tone, rubbing and patting her squirming belly with her tounge hanging out from the side of her open mouth. She looked down at her already big gut, to see that it had bulged out a good 6 inches. As well as noticing that Gregory's squirming could barely be seen under her belly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OLIVIA LET ME OUT!!\" Gregory shouted at the top of his lungs. His voice could barely be heard as well. \"Oh nooo...\" she swore. \"I already told you, GREG. If Miss Holmes wants you off of work, I'm gonna give you all the free time you can have..\"<br>\r\n\"By keeping me in this dump you call a stomach!!\" Gregory shouted \"Yes... by keeping you in this dump I call a stomach.\" Olivia started to shake her belly violently causing Gregory to get sloshed and thrown around in there. She stops after a good 5 minutes of throwing Gregory around. And making him dizzy might I add. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Olivia!\" someone shouts. The fat dragon turns around to see her twin sister Candace. \"What do you want Candace....?\" she said obviously annoyed. \"Have you seen Greg anywhere? I need to talk to him about something, it's kind of important.\" Candace asked. \"Haven't seen him. But I think he's closer than you think...\" Olivia grinned and secretly rubbed her bulged out belly after what she said. Gregory begins to collect himself and recognized the voice that Olivia was talking to. He flailed and shouted as best as he can trying to get Candace's attention. But Candace just gave Olivia a weird look. \"Ok then..... I'll go ask Gertrude instead..\" she took four steps before ahe faces Olivia again \"Oh, and I have another question. Did you gain weight more around the middle?\" she asked before running off. If you could call it running... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angry fat dragon waited for her sister to leave the area. Whe Olivia thinks she's gone she looked back at her squirming belly, calming down a little after remembering what she just ate. \"Well, *UURP* there goes your chance of escaping my gut.\" Olivia mocked Gregory. She smacked her protruding gut a couple of times before saying....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a good amount of free time on my hands until I need to go back to work.

Times like these called for something <i>fun</i> in mind, to let the satisfaction of him keeping her filled last a little while longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eenie...meenie...minie...\" She spoke without focus, scanning her surroundings for the perfect time-waster. There was the spa, the ocean, the boardwalk, all fun choices for anybody on vacation, but Olivia wasn't one to spend thousands of dollars on the chance to be lazy; she was better off doing that herself, damnit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked all around her without finding anything particularly enticing, her lips pursing in disappointment, but it was when she looked <i>up</i> that her eyes shone. At the highest peak of Rapid Mountain, she saw all the colorful tendrils that slithered off the very peak, twisting into a mesh of flumes that tangled together like randomly covered strands of yarn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd tighten my swimsuit if I were you, Gregory!\" She cackled, following up by giving her own stomach a punch. It didn't hit him, but was enough of a jostle to shake him around even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?!\" Gregory snapped, pushing himself up from her stomach fluids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia looked down at her enormous belly, then opened her maw wide, ensuring it was filled with air before she closed her mouth and made an empty swallow. She took several more gulps of air as she went up on the first set of steps on the climb of the mountain, her already bloated stomach becoming bigger and bigger as it was crudely inflated with air. Her waddle became even worse as her legs were forced to navigate around its steadily growing size, becoming so big that her arms were pushed away by her own sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory just sat in silence, totally unaware of what was going on as Olivia kept walking. There was air coming in, enabling him to breath, but Olivia gave no indication that she was going to let him out, let alone make him comfortable inside of her. Weirder yet was how she kept on going up, up, and up, when no place in the area seemed to have such a large scalable height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo place except...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>HEY!!!</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growing pain of her taut belly became an easy payment when she felt Gregory's struggling intensify, and she hummed a peppy tune as she grabbed her sweatshirt and tossed it off, listlessly throwing it over the guardrail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...dear.\" Gertrude mumbled, but damned herself for cursing when she was so nearby. \"Hello, Olivia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the corpulent dragoness made it to the tallest slide that someone of her height could ride, she looked even more like a balloon than she normally did, her stomach engorged with so much air that its flesh truly did feel like latex that was ready to pop. Her arms awkwardly hung out by the way her breasts were pushed up, and her legs were reduced to stubs that could barely bend with its tautness getting in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, even when Olivia was half her height and a third her width, Gertrude was utterly terrified by her appearance, more than he'd ever been whenever the vile dragoness was near. Not just by the oncoming prospect of receiving one of her verbal lashings, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, good morning, my dear Gertrude! It's utterly <i>dynamite</i> to be able to cohort with you on yet another occasion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the fact that Olivia was smiling, and doing so with such <i>sincerity.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I...help you?\" Gertrude asked, so confused and unnerved that she forgot to step out of the way of the slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"GERTRUDE!!!\"</b></i> Gregory shrieked, having heard the jarringly soft voice come from the massive lifeguard. <i><b>\"HELP ME, I'M INSIDE OLIVIA!!!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just here for a little mindless entertainment, dear!\" She said firmly, hoping Gregory would hear. \"Was there anything wrong with this slide, or am I allowed to enter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh...no, nothing's wrong with it. Carry on.\" Gertrude replied, sidestepping away and sitting in her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, milady!\" Olivia beamed with as kind a tone that she could muster, traversing up the final set of steps into the slide. She slammed her massive, scaly buttcheeks down on the stream of water that flowed down the floor of the slide, grasping the pole above with a firm grip, ready to gain as fast a start as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of her, Gregory's desperation reached its full peak, resorting to anything, anything to clue Gertrude in on the fact that something inside of Olivia was alive, the seconds counting away as she carefully watched over the balcony for the signal to go...</span></div></div>",

On the outside Olivia was enjoying herself, she had Candace's friend right where she believes all humans should be. 'Aaaaw how cute, Greg thinks that he has a chance of escaping my gut~.' Olivia cooed to herself. Greg's hopes on getting Gertrude continued on, but were completely shattered as soon he heard the one word escape her lips. \"GO!\" Gertrude said. Olivia simply sneered at her response. She snickered to herself. 'With great pleasure~' Immediately Olivia pulls herself forward as hard as she can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia was having a blast coming down the slide, shooting past with the occasional shift and sudden turns. Greg, inside of her, not so much. He was practically getting tossed around in Olivia's air inflated belly. Every twist and turn threw him from side to side, often causing him to lose his balance and fall over, with Olivia feeling every bit of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia can it now, the end of the water slide was drawing closer and closer. She was a little sad that the ride was almost over, but immediately perked back up remembering why she did it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia now exits the water slide, comicly skipping along the surface about 3 times, before slowing down and entered a pool similar the to Lazy River. Her belly bobbing out of the water with her laying on her back at letting the current drift her along. \"Please tell me the worst is over...\" Greg groaned to himself aloud. Almost instantly Olivia let out a long and mighty belch reducing his fleshy prison by a hefty amount. If was were to look at Olivia after that, her tummy would've looked like it had a 3 beach balls in it. \"Does that answer your question, Greg?\" Olivia retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her belly not filled with so much air anymore, Olivia turns over and starts to swim for the exit of the pool. Greg punched the wall in response to Olivia turning over. \"Aaaw does little Greggy want to play in the water too~?\" She coos to Greg. Olivia puts her maw under the water and starts to gulp gallon after gallon of water for Greg to \"play\" in. Greg starts panicking thinking Olivia was gonna drown him, when the water stops filling up to the half way mark. Olivia reaches the ladder of the exit and heaves herself out of the pool, her sloshy stomach soon following. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaahhhhh, refreshing.\" She sighs with her mouth open and tongue hanging out, as well as her bulky arms behind her head. Olivia watches her sloshy belly bob up and down a few inches as her captured prey moves inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't funny Olivia, I thought I was gonna die!!.\" Greg's muffled yelling entered Olivia's ears. \"Do you know what Miss Holmes will do to me if she found out I did? Besides...\" Olivia lifted the bottom of her gut and let it fall with a *BWUMP* jiggling it in the process. \"I'm going to savior every single moment you're in my gut.\" She burps letting a fistfull of air escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is wrong!!\" Greg's yelling was again muffled by Olivia's belly fat. \"But feels soo gooood~\" Olivia licked her lips remembering the experience of swallowing Greg whole and tasting him for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at a near by clock. \"2:35pm...\" Olivia thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

Anthros walking by would see her wave to them and bid them a cheery day, easy to spread a smile on the faces around her by a look of utter joy as she hummed an upbeat tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll a stark contrast to the inside of her body, which was filled with grunts of pain and muttered swears of vengeance as Gregory violently punched and kicked against the moist walls surrounding him, his head and shoulders now utterly sopping wet as the water she drank was sloshed all around, the waves splashing against the ceiling whenever she hopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia heard every curse he uttered out, and a yearn to experiment popped up in her mind.

She came to a stop, shuffling around so that her side was aligned with the path, and she made a brief running start before throwing herself down, surprising even herself as she found she was able to do a cartwheel, let alone <i>three</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory's sense of up and down was shaken into oblivion as he felt Olivia's stomach spin upside down in less than a second, his body and face smacking into every side of her stomach as a smoothie of pool water and Olivia's stomach acid was washed all around him. He sank to the very bottom when her stomach was right side up once more, then flung his arms and legs around to find the surface, coughing as he dizzily got back on his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HOPE I HAVE TAPEWORM TO GIVE YOU, YOU <i><b>BITCH!!!</b></i>\" He hacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia said nothing. She was busy thinking up whatever way there was to walk in a flamboyant manner, and soon settled for maneuvering back to her side, and shuffled by with a cross between a strut and a dance, arms flinging with every beat as her legs crossed over with one another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, everybody! Time to put on our workin' shoes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia stood before a row of workout platforms positioned along the beach, hoisting her stomach up off the ground by both ends of a rubber hammock that was wrapped around its underside. Whatever anthros were there yesterday were turning their heads in confusion, looking for the actual obese dragoness that was chewing them out not twenty four hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, guys, let's get those tails in gear!\" She said enthusiastically, stepping back up on the platform. \"Let's get some aerobics in, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all stared back at her, still confused, but one by one shrugged and backed onto their platforms, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...jump!\" Olivia chanted, jumping up and landing on the ground. \"and...Jump!\" She jumped back again, this time leaping over the platform entirely. \"Altogether now, and...jump!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia began counting, forming a steady rhythm as she jumped up and down, expertly skipping past the platform each time. The audience followed suit, but at a slower pace, as Olivia's change in attitude stood in the way like a storm cloud sitting over the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese dragoness paid no heed. She never remembered a workday that was nearly as fun then, only taking care to ensure that Gregory didn't get killed, intent on keeping his thrashing going on for as long as she could...</span></div></div>",

You would think that having a bit of weight in a stomach would show a few signs of suspicion. But sadly for Greg, Olivia's sheer size and girth completely hides that fact that anyone is in there at all, thus nobody even batted an eye. There were times where all of that movement almost made Olivia belch Greg up and have his head enter her mouth, but all Olivia had to do was a swift swallow and have him going back down with a wet *GULP* before putting him back in his fleshy prison. \"Now I have an idea on what a genie must feel like.\" Greg grumbled to himself. As he gets tossed and turned in Olivia's sloshing belly, the onslaught of stomach water soup makes it quite difficult for him to even get comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Olivia can't remember the last time she had this much fun, but she'll make sure to let it lasts for as long as she wants to. \"Okay eveyone! It's time for a little something I planned just recently~\" She spoke in a sing-song tone. Everyone else just looked each other in confusion, others in fear. \"It's yoga time!\" Olivia said ecstaticly. Everyone just stared at her like she had lobsters coming out of her ears. (Just look these up if you need a better idea)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Alright now! Cat pose!\" Olivia spoke happily. Not wanting to anger their instructor, everyone else soon follows. Olivia starts with her knees and hands on the floor with her back arched like a cat, her tummy pressed on the ground. Inside her belly, Greg sank a bit with the sudden shift in movement, surprised to be actually feel hard surface for once. He gave no hesitation seeing this as an opportunity and struggles as much as he could. This makes Olivia's belly move around and have unnatural tiny bulges form. Oliva simply giggled as this only tickled her a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Nooow! Bridge~\" Olivia quickly said before shifting so her feet and head were touching the floor and her gut at an incline. This made Greg a bit disoriented. Olivia's belly sags towards her face from all of that water and Greg inside. With her head hidden behind her sheer size and girth, Olivia gave it quick peck unsure of why she even did that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that'll do it for today everybody!\" Olivia said in a cheery tune. Getting back on her feet with everyone else doing so as well. \"See all of you tomorrow, make sure to get a hearty meal~\" She turns and grins evilly to herself. \"I know I have.\" Olivia gently smacks her tummy, sending ripples on its surface before picking it up as high as she could before dropping it, letting it bounce a bit. \"If you forget that I'm in here and digest me, I hope I gave you the worst indigestion in the world!\" Greg loudly growled at Olivia.  \"I don't think you're in any position to be making statements like that, Greg! So don't tempt me.\" Olivia threatened back. As the session was ending, eveyone including Olivia, was leaving. She skips into the changing room, not wanting to walk around in sweaty clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking at herself in the mirror a few times, Olivia walks out wearing a black t-shirt, that's too small to cover her belly and only covers up to the top of her gut, and a very large pair of blue jeans. While walking around the Glass Tornado Olivia stopped when she  gets a few whistles from a couple of anthros checking her out, a male dragon and bull anthro to be exact. She was in such a good mood that Olivia humored the both of them by doing a pose. Olivia crossed her legs a bit, interlocked her hands behind her head, and exposed her protruding belly, while having a cute smile and her tongue sticking out. This brought more whistles and a few hollers from the two of them. Olivia chuckled to herself as she walks off, gently smacking her gut again, sending more ripples on its surface and sighs contently as she makes her way to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

She waddled of to find something else to do, her belly wobbling with each step she made. Inside, everything was sloshing around causing a bit pf discomfort for Greg there. \"OLIVIA WHEN MISS HOLMES FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS SHE'LL MOUNT YOUR HEAD ON HER OFFICE WALL!!!\" Greg exclaimed thrashing about. This went on for about a minute before he tired himself out. \"Hmmm now that is a problem... guess I'll have to keep you in there forever.\" Olivia smirked before lifting her belly again and dropping it. \"OLIVIA!!\" But she didn't answer, she went to an attraction similar to fountains. Olivia picked out a spot where the shade was just right where she laid back and relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was enjoying life. The birds were singing, the mist was cool, Greg is still thrashing and screaming his lungs out. It was paradise for her. Olivia simply giggled to herself feeling Greg's plight inside of her. It wasn't until she realized that there was a scarlet red dragon anthro staring at her, or more specifically, her protruding gut. \"Can I help you?\" Olivia asked impatiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, miss?\" He meekly said, pointing at Olivia's protrusive belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia just looked at her stomach for a moment before looking back at him. \"Let's just say I'd eaten something that's disagreeing with me.\" She smacks her gut again sending more ripples on its surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other dragon just quirked his eyebrow, and she turned her head aside and shut her eyes, expecting him to just walk away, but winced when his footsteps approached near her head and blotted out the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, uh...looking pretty bad there, miss.\" He told her eyes turned to the left as he scratched at his black, scruffy hair. \"Seems like something a, well...bellyrub could solve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia was shocked this guy just walks up and asks to rub her belly, but with her belly getting sloshed around as much as it was, it didn't sound like the weirdest thing to agree to. She shrugged. \"Knock yourself out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia returned to relaxing. He climbed to the top of her gut and rubs her tummy down. Greg took this chance to get his attention and thrash about with all of his might. This left the belly to wobble a lot, and he took notice. \"Holy...your stomach's <i>moving!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia panicked a bit inside her head but soon came up with the perfect excuse. \"Yeah well... I took the White Brimstone's Great Gaian Tuna Challenge.\" Olivia gave a cocky smile. The dragon looked at her with awe, his eyes twinkle and sparkle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two whole great Gain Tunas, <i>alive!?</i>\" He exclaims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I can still feel them wriggle around in there.\" Olivia rubs her belly in circles. It was the perfect crime, Olivia committed a grave taboo in Gaia 2.0 and disguised it as a hefty eating challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...<i>ahem</i>...You're an enthusiast on all things culinary, then I take it?\" The dragon asked, adopting an interested tone. \"I'm quite the expert, myself! Name's Salama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia.\" She answered curtly, resting her head on her elbows. \"Olivia Moenks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     About 20 minutes later, Olivia was resting in tranquility with Salama still massaging her from on top. A small smile cracked along her lips as she slept soundly, and Salama's heart fluttered whenever he caught the sight, totally oblivious to what lay just a few feet underneath his person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n What happens now?</span></div></div>",

The obese dragoness couldn't remember falling asleep on a <i>bed</i> as well as she had on the beach, thanks in no small part to her volunteer masseuse, whose pride in his work showed in spades as he remained laid on her belly, adoration splashed along his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalama rested his jaw on his palms, a dreamy smile floating on his face as her eyes finally opened, but was cut off by a tiny belch of air that bubbled up her throat and cut off her yawn, the two of them waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia blushed, wondering just how long she'd been asleep. \"Uh...hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Hey' back.\" He replied, looking aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two briefly hung around in silence before Olivia caught a glance of her mointainous belly. Curious, she gave it a slight jostle, and her mood improved significantly upon hearing a string of muffled obscenities from inside. Salama was none the wiser, falling in love with her all over as she happily opened her maw and gulped a mouthful of straight air, the plush surface beneath him growing a tad more firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss?\" He asked shyly, pulling back so she could only see his eyes over her cleavage. \"Pardon me for asking, but...would you be wierded out if I asked you to, well, swallow a little more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Olivia would've stormed off by half the time she'd been around Salama if she was being forced to interact with anybody else, but for whatever reason, she didn't really mind his presence all that much. Maybe it was just the massage, or the satisfaction of still hearing Gregory take the names of whatever gods he could remember in vain at her, but there was a strange charm she could feel coming for her from the skinny dragon, or, dare she say, her new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes with a smirk, she opened her mouth wide and sucked in as much air as she could, chest expanding to the poibt where wrinkles tightened in her shirt between her breasts, then shut her mouth and forced as much air as she could into her cheeks. She swallowed it whole, then puffed up another mouthful and did it again, and again, and again, her stomach filling with air to the point where it rose another foot. Salama hummed against her scales in delight, arms reaching out to grip what kittle they crould reach of her balloon-like middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need anymore, just holler!\" She teased, squishing her hands down along its front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalama's head shot up. \"Actually, that's something I'd been meaning to ask you about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia tilted her head to the side. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's lunch sound?\" He asked, scooting forward and sliding down her stomach so he was seated on her breasts. \"Whatever and how much you could want, I can pay, no questions asked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch?\" She repeated, surprised. Sure, she adored all the hoots and hollers whenever she was walking along shore, but it wasn't like any of them ever wanted to <i>date</i> her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, if you're not interested, I understand, I ju-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, just...just help me up a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure!\" He obeyed, jumping off and diving down undernneath her as she grunted and tried to rise up on her own, pushin up against her back with his own. The bloating in her stomach made it a slightly harder task, but the air made it light enough that she was soon back on her two feet, with many beachgoers nearby feeling the shockwave as it impacted the sand once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what do you say?\" He asked, fingers crossed behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boardwalk sound good enough for you?\" She answered, slyly licking her lips. \"Just in a fast food kind of mood right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, certainly!\" He said eagerly, holding in the urge to cheer. \"Anywhere you name, it's yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe urge became all the more harder to resist when Olivia yanked him in with her elbow, squeezing him against her side to the point where only his face poked out from her armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck, make me the size of a house, and I'll gladly be a private two-story all for you to keep...\" She flirted, casting him a half-lidded glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it be from the blunt impact of love or deprivation of oxygen, Salama didn't say anything else, eyes going cross as a crooked smile split along his muzzle. Olivia kept him held tight and started off for the boardwalk, Salama falling a few steps behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better have your good duds on, Greggo...\" She whispered to the muted cries for help, vengeance, and a towel coming from within her. \"We're going on a date!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She adds an extra pop into her steps, not only to make Greg as uncomfortable as possible inside her, but to also tease the much smaller dragon behind her. Salama was about three feet behind Olivia, watching her curves wobble about as she struts. He couldn't contain of of his excitement, hands clenched and shaking close to his chest. '<i>I must be the luckiest man in the world right now!</i>' he thought happily, not paying to attention what was in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia was quick to take notice of Salama. After giving a toothy grin she stopped dead in her tracks and thrusted her jiggly booty back, causing the scarlet dragon to get a face full of dragon butt. The force of her bum caused Salama to fall on to his. After regaining composure, Salama looks up an sees Olivia's back side eclipsing the light source in front them. \"Enjoying the view big guy?\" Olivia said with a smirk, shaking her rear a bit at him. The flustered dragon couldn't form a proper answer. \"I-I I um.. -well... uh- uuh.. <i>woooow</i>.\" Was all that came out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia giggled to herself. \"Come on, up an' at 'em.\" She chirps. \"I won't be able to stuff myself silly with you on the floor.\" She knew just what buttons to press. Salama jumped up to his feet . \"Well, I must not keep a lady waiting.\" With that they both continue to the boardwalk, with more teasing from Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of walking and belly shaking for Greg, the two dragons made it to their destination. There were stands as far as the eye can see. With many delectable aromas from all directions, it made Olivia drool. \"So what you like, m'lady?\" Salama polity said. The bigger dragon folded her arms and closes her eyes. \"Hmmm.\" Olivia sounded like she was making the hardest decision of her life. Which some people can relate to. '<i>Maybe I'll go for the burgers... no wait- the fries sound like a good place to start. Nooo- maybe pizza? Corndogs? Onion rings?</i>' Olivia practically can't make up her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was tired and couldn't pound away at Olivia's insides anymore. The whole walk there was torture for him. Olivia would taking any opportunity to make it hell for him. She would do things such as belly dancing and jumping, all of which would cause a cascade of stomach acid and water to splash him. \"Somebody get me out of here!\" He shouts, which got a glance from Salama. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Olivia, I thought I heard shouting from inside of you.\" Olivia just smirked and looked at her belly. \"You must be hearing my ex-boyfriend in there, oh my lovely little Logan, if only you didn't break up with me today. You might have lived to see tomorrow.\" She smacks her gut, making it jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lying dragon turns back at Salama, he was petrified and all of his body color went white. This made Olivia raspberry before bursting out laughing. \"Oh my goodness! The look on your face right now is priceless.\" She continues to laugh even going so far as falling on her gut. Her weight was pressed on to Greg. Salama regained his color and calmed down a little. \"So you didn't eat him...?\" \"Of course not, never had a boyfriend to begin with.\" That sentence made the scarlet dragon glad, he might have a chance with her. \"Okay, have you decided on what you'd like to eat?\" Salama asked. \"I have.\" Olivia stood back up and confidently put her hands to her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want five of everything here.\" \"Oh- oh my...\" her date meeped. Salama's face began to blush at the thought of his date even bigger. \"Oooh god...\" Greg mumbled aloud. Olivia brought her date closer to her. \"And you're helping me finish it.\" \"Oh, no no. I'm fine. You should eat it.\" \"Oh sweetie, you're thin as it is already. I could snap you in half just by sitting on you.\" Olivia gave her booty a slap, making it jiggle about. \"<i>woooow...</i>\" Salama said, mesmerized by her butt. \"O-okay whatever you what me to do, I'll do it for you.\" After he said that Olivia leaned forward and held his chin. \"That's a good boy.\" Olivia seductively said before kissing Salama's cheek. If his face wasn't red then, it certainly was now, a pair of smokey tufts spitting from his nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" Olivia turns to the stands. \"...let the feast begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them ate like there's no tomorrow. Olivia could be seen downing four buckets of fries. While Salama just finished his one bucket. They moved on to another stand when they finished and then another and another and another. Greg was getting pelted by a mixture of bits of chewed and unchewed food. Over time, all of that she's eaten starts to sink and pile up inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStand after stand the couple began gorging, Olivia mostly, until there was one stand left. Olivia's belly expanded at least by six feet and Salama's about three. Due to Salama being smaller he filled up more quickly than Olivia, but he didn't care. He wanted to make Olivia happy and he will do whatever it took. \"Just one more stand left. *huff* how are you holding up? Salama asked. \"I haven't felt this full in years *puff* oof...and you made it possible. Thank you.\" Salama smiled at her. \"Anything for a beautiful woman like you.\" Salama said. \"Awww, your making me blush.\" Which Olivia did. They waddle up the the last stand, which was selling popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner of the stand was a female pigeon anthro, at least twice Salama's height (5 feet, 6 inches). The owner bowed and greeted the two. \"Hello, and what might you two be wanting at my little ol' shack.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five orders of your delicious popcorn miss.\" Salama polity asked. \"You're in luck. I happen to have five buckets left.\" The anthro poultry reached under her counter and pulled out exactly five buckets of buttery goodnes. \"Oh this is gonna be great.\" Olivia said drooling as she licked her lips in anticipation. Salama was given three buckets while Olivia was given two. \"Having a good night you two.\" The lovely couple made their way to a table to finish their treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalama and Olivia had to scoot passed an already seated anthro wolf. He was about the same size as Salama. \"Hey! Move it thunder thighs, you're in my way!\" He so rudely remarked. \"Wrong move.\" Greg said inside the belly of the beast. Olivia got immediately pissed and glared at him. \"Ya know what Salama... I think I've found our seats...\" the dragon growled. \"Wait, what do you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>*CRUNCH*</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Salama could say anything Olivia quickly sat on the rude wolf, the chair breaking under her weight. The wolf looked like he almost disappeared. Olivia started grinding him under her butt for a bit before turning to her date and patting her belly, signaling him to climb on. He took the signal and climbed her bigger belly. \"Oooh yeah, that felt goooood.\" Olivia sighed. \"Now then, let's eat.\" She said before downing her crunchy snacks. Her date soon following her lead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n............................ <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both finish their last handfuls of popcorn, Salama rubbing the fat dragon's belly. Olivia was in heaven. She had never in a long time have eaten that much. She remembers that she ate Greg waaay earlier, she figured that it must be very cramped in there. What with all of that food she gorged herself silly on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUURRP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia let out a mighty belch, making her belly shrink from letting all that gas out. \"Aaaaaaahhhh...\" the satisfied fat dragon sighed. \"Man, I'm gonna be so chubby after all this breaks down.\" Salama said. \"And when I'm done breaking all of this down, there's gonna be sooo much for you to love.\" Greg panicked when she said that. \"She might actually digest me.\" He thought. Not before long he tried with all of his might to get Salama's attention. He began pounding on whatever stomach wall that is exposed. Many lumps and bulges became very visible that both Salama and Olivia could see. \"Wow, those fish are still alive.\" Salama said. Olivia felt bad for lying to her date and wanted to come a bit clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetie, can you keep a secret?\" The fatty asked. \"What is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those bulges... weeeell... I maaaay or maaaay not have eaten a human before meeting you.\" Salama looked at her belly then back to her. \"You're kidding right?\" Olivia just shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan Salama keep a secret?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Olivia just looked so much better with that extra sag on her belly. \"Well... I kinda like him in there to be honest.\" Salama sheepishly said. Olivia had a big smile oh her face after she heard that. \"You hear that Greg? Looks likes your staying in there for a <i>looooong</i> time.\" Olivia said while  smacking her tummy. \"<i><b>NOOOOOO....!</b></i>\" Greg wailed. Olivia let out a belch. <b>UURRRP</b> \"What made you to want him stay stuck in here?\" The fat dragon asked. \"I just like how... sexy you look with some sag.\" \"Aaaaw you sweety.\" Olivia brought Salama into a hug. Salama was very quick to embrace it. \"How about this. When I'm finished with work today I'll invite you over to spend the night at my place. Does that sound good?\" Olivia said. \"Oh I'd love to.\" The red dragon yipped. \"Alright. You got something to write with?\" \"Yeah, I think so.\" He rummaged through his pockets and pull out a black pen. Olivia quickly grabbed it and started to write on a napkin. \"Come to this address at this time. I'll be waiting.\" Olivia said seductively. \"Yes ma'am.\" \"Good boy.\" She gave him a deep kiss. But not on his cheek like the last time. She gave it to him right smack on his lips. Salama was taken by surprise. His face began to heat up as two big heart comicly grew on his eyes and tufts of steam whistled from his nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia broke the kiss and Salama went limp. Moaning infatuatedly before he fell to the floor. Olivia giggled before getting up. A gasp was heard from below her. It was the rude wolf she sat on earlier. \"Word of advice...\" She said before bending over towards the wolf. \"The last thing you should say to a woman is calling her \"thunder thighs\" you got that?\" \"Eat me...\" he said rudely to her. Annoyed by that remark Olivia snapped her jaws at least an inch away from his face. \"I can make that happen. So don't tempt me.\" The wolf was clearly afraid of her now. Olivia stormed off to where she work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything at Olivia's work was the same, except now she has an extra passenger with her. She made sure to make it as much of a hell trip for Greg. This went on for a good few hours before she got off work. She hastily made her way up to her room to wait for Salama. After opening the door she throws of her old clothes and slips into something she believes is more... comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalama was sheepishly walking through the hallways of doors at the place that Olivia is staying at. He repeats his pattern of looking down at the written on napkin then looking at the door numbers. The scarlet drake stops at one of the doors. \"This must be it.\" He said to himself. After giving the door a knock he waits for someone to answer it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's unlocked!\" He hears a familiar voice and opens the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in here!\" Olivia said. Salama walked into the room where he heard her voice. His eyes immediately bulge out and his nose begins to comicly bleed from what he saw. Laying down on the bed was Olivia wearing nothing but solid black lingerie with stockings to match. \"Took you long enough.\" Olivia calmly said. \"O-Olivia I- I-...\" \"shhhh\" Olivia sticks her pointer finger out and motions it towards her. Salama still stuttering walks to Olivia and sits on her bed. The fatter dragon positions herself to one side of the bed and pats the space next to her. The blushing Salama crawls over and lays next to Olivia. He was so entranced in her sheer size and girth he was in his own world for a moment. \"Can't get enough of this can you?\" Olivia quipped before rubbing her exposed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>YOU TWO BETTER NOT DO IT WHILE I'M STILL IN HERE!!</i></b> Greg shouts from within the belly of the beast. This in turn annoyed Olivia. She angrily snorted before she grabbed her gut and gave her stomach a quick jostle. \"Wait, what does he mean?\" Salama being oblivious to what to \"do it\" is. \"Don't worry about it.\" Olivia reassured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two of them cuddled up they began talking for a bit before Olivia yawned. She looked at her clock and saw that the time was 10:47 pm. \"I think it's time that we hit the hay now.\" Olivia groggly said. Salama was a bit disappointed but was with her nonetheless. Olivia turned off the lights, covered Salama and herself with her bedsheets before closing her eyes and falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around 1 o' clock when Salama woke up. He looked over to see his love in a deep sleep. Her mouth was opened with her tongue dangling out the side. She snored lightly and her tummy bobbed up and down with her breathing. Salama gently climbs on top of Olivia's belly. He started to pat the belly. \"Hey. Greg was it? You still alive in there?\" No response. Salama really began to panic an patted harder. \"Hello!\" He gently shouted. \"<i>What!?</i>\" Greg yelled back. \"Shush not so loud you'll wake her!\" \"<i>Olivia is one of the heaviest sleepers in Gaia! So you're fine!</i>\" \"Okay, sorry about leaving you in there.\" \"<i>It's alright you two were having a blast while I <b>WAS BEING DIGESTED SLOWLY!!</b></i>\" \"Okay I get it. I wanna get you out of there.\" \"<i>Thanks but no thanks. You two made me suffer enough.</i>\" \"Would you rather be shat out her back exit?\" The thought of getting shoved through Olivia's digestive tract was enough motivation. \"<i>Oh fine you win... what did you have in mind?</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was thinking....</span></div></div>",

Then you just have to haul yourself up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg groused. He didn't think much of this <i>plan</i> at all. Not only was he an inexperienced climber, but he knew from firsthand experience how powerful Olivia's throat muscles were. He'd have to pull himself all the way up her throat and hope she wouldn't swallow him again. He hadn't lied when he said the dragoness was a heavy sleeper, but he had to figure 97% of people would notice something squirming up their esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't <i>you</i> just wake her up and ask her to spit me up?! She already offered and <i>you</i> left me in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I c-can't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why. Not?\" Greg asked through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you didn't see the look on her face!\" Salama said. \"She looked so sad at the thought of spitting you up that I couldn't ask her to do that for me! It's hard for me to meet people, you know... it's not everyday I meet someone... special. Most women like Olivia see right through me. But I feel a real connection with her! I didn't want to jeopardize that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"OH, POOR FUCKING YOU!\"</i> Olivia let out a soft belch in her sleep and Greg had to restrain himself to keep from screaming at Salama at the top of his lungs. \"Are <i>you</i> in an awkward position? Seriously, I'd hate to make <i>you</i> feel uncomfortable. I suppose I can just stay here, be your wingman and <i>live inside the stomach of the biggest bitch on the planet forever</i> all to make <i>your</i> life easier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalama's normally gentle face hardened. \"Be careful of your language. The \"biggest bitch on the planet\" is the love of my life, and I won't sit idly by and let you insult her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg got ready to fire back when an ominous gurgling resounded around him. How long had he been in here already? How much longer could he last? This weird, little dragon might be his only way out of his fleshy prison. It was either that or eventually be melted down into extra padding on Olivia's thunder thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Greg forced himself to say. \"I'm just under a lot of pressure right now and I got mad. Olivia... has great inner beauty.\" Literally speaking, Greg knew that was a lie, but it was the best he got after an exhausting day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted. I'll go get the rope.\" The little dragon did as he promised, tying one end of the rope to the foot of the bed and the second end around--of all things--a glazed ham. Salama carefully perched on his sleeping love's stomach and raised the ham over her gaping, snoring mouth. He said a quick prayer and dropped the ham inside. Instinctively, Olivia swallowed it whole like a grape, and smiled in her sleep. Salama sighed wistfully at the sight of her. She was like an angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"UUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPP!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n... A bloated, gassy angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was so grateful for the rope he didn't even question why a cured deli meat came attached to it. He ripped the ham off and threw it over his shoulder into the gastric pool he'd spent the past god knows how long marinating in. He didn't waste a second in tying the rope around his waist and hauling himself up. The orifice that led out of her stomach and up her throat was clenched tight and Greg put all his strength in prying it apart, all the while praying Olivia wouldn't feel him. For the moment however, she remained asleep, and Greg talked to Salama to keep his mind off his fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Sal,\" Greg grunted as he squirmed through the hole and into her throat. \"Not to look a gift horse in the mouth--not when I've already been looking at the inside of a stomach all day--but you do know that she's gonna realize I escaped, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that happens, I'll just pretend I was asleep and never saw what happened. But she might not look into it. She'll probably think you just digested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she'll figure it out next time she sees me at work,\" Greg said, pulling himself further up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a second for Salama to put two-and-two together. <i>\"You work here?! Are you out of your mind?! You know what anthros do to people!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Sal, I have no idea. What would they do to me?\" Greg asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalama blushed. \"Oh. Right. Guess you already know... Hey wait,\" the tiny dragon said, sounding worried. \"You're not going to get Olivia into trouble over this, are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah, of course he was. The second he got out of here, he was going to make a break for it and tell Holmes all about what the dragon had done. Anthros eating the human staff was a big no-no... at least not unless the boss approved it, and in this case, she didn't. Olivia might not be fired over this, but she sure as hell would get a cut in her pay for a while. Naturally, Greg had no intention of letting Salama know that though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I won't, pal!\" Greg said and was immediately worried he sounded too transparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSal didn't sound convinced but Greg was the past the point of caring. He'd just reached Olivia's mouth, the disgusting maw that led him down her gullet in the first place. To think, she'd done all this out of jealousy that he'd gotten time off. If he knew then what he did now, he'd eagerly work an entire year straight with no time off if it spent not spending a second longer inside the gluttonous dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, no sooner had Greg crawled up on Olivia's tongue than she let out a sound that chilled him to the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no. She was tasting him in her sleep! Greg tried to crawl quickly but the massive tongue quaked underneath him sending him slamming to the roof of her mouth then worked into her cheeks. Salama watched in a combination of horror and fascination as the human was sucked on like a piece of candy. Her mouth was almost completely closed, save for the rope poking out of it. From inside he could hear Greg begging for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little dragon was transfixed by the sight for several long seconds before snapping out of his trance. He should help. He had to help... Didn't he? He shook his head. Of course he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalama reached towards the rope... but did he make it in time to save Greg?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) No. Greg is swallowed again and remains trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Yes. Greg is out of the mouth, but Olivia wakes up and Sal has some explaining to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rope was inches from Salama's hands when Olivia let out another moan. The look on her face made him pause. She just looked so... happy. So content, as if she was savoring the most delicious flavor in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So good,\" she murmured in her sleep, smiling as she sucked on the thrashing human who was only a foot away from salvation. Salama knew he should help, knew it was the moral thing to do, knew that no one deserved Greg's fate, but at the same time the love of his life looked like she was in such pure bliss, such unbridled ecstasy, that the mere thought of doing something to ruin her happiness broke his heart. The dragon hesitated for an extra second. Unfortunately for Greg, that second was the difference between freedom and imprisonment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia clapped her jaws shut. The rope snapped between her teeth and she slurped it up like a noodle. Salama watched numbly as Olivia sucked on her midnight snack with renewed vigor. She giggled in her sleep as the human screamed for help, but help was impossible now. Salama had had his chance to do the right thing and now there was nothing he could do but watch in terrified fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore a minute of sucking and slurping had passed, Olivia was working Greg back to the back of her throat. He was soaked to the bone in drool, and exhausted from both the hard climb and the relentless tongue-lashing Olivia was literally giving him. He looked over his shoulder and cried out in terror. The black pit of her esophagus was right behind him. As he neared, a prolonged gurgle came from her gullet. It almost sounded like the dragon's stomach was calling him home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed once and the next thing Greg knew his legs had disappeared down her throat. He clutched desperately for purchase on the slimy tongue, but couldn't get a grip. Olivia moaned happily in her sleep, Greg's kicks actually tickling her instead of disturbing her. Greg sobbed pitifully. Not again! Not after he was so close at escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia let out a breathy sigh. Her mouth opened a fraction. There was just enough light to see Salama staring at him from atop the flabby mountaintop that was her stomach. The little dragon met his eyes and shrugged apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELP M--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Gluck*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia swallowed again, and Greg was gone. Salama watched a thrashing, bulging form travel down the dragon's throat. It caught for a second and Salama was worried his lady love would choke, but she merely swallowed a third time and the lump that was the human known as Greg continued his journey without further delay. She devoured him with barely more effort than she had the ham. The little dragon could hear Greg as he landed back in the stomach. He wasted no time in thrashing against the walls and screaming curses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach groaned and, without waking from her slumber, Olivia let out an explosion of pent-up gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belch washed over Salama with the force of a hurricane. He had to dig his fingers into her stomach to stop himself from being blown off her belly and across the room. His eyes watered from the smell, a potent combination of ham, boardwalk food, and enraged hotel employee. The flavor combination was apparently a favorite of Olivia's as she smiled and smacked her lips in her sleep. The entire escape attempt had tried and failed and she'd slept through it all. Greg was right. She really <i>was</i> one of the deepest sleepers alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalama felt happy at seeing the look of pure contentment on her face. She was utterly and completely satisfied. The sight of her happy warmed his heart. He knew he was a lovelorn sap but he didn't care. Truly this goddess among women deserved to be happy every moment of her life, whether waking or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little dragon's good feelings lasted until a punch came through the layers of Olivia's flab and threatened to knock him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?!\" Greg screamed. \"I WAS RIGHT THERE! YOU COULD'VE PULLED ME OUT! YOU COULD'VE SAVED ME! I WAS RIGHT THERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was too risky,\" Salama said. \"If I reached out she could've swallowed me in her sleep as well, then we both would've been stuck without help!\" He felt ashamed lying but he knew Greg wouldn't understand. Clearly the human had never been in love before, otherwise he would've recognized the importance of making sacrifices for the sake of your relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's bull crap!\" Greg screamed. \"We both know you could've helped me, you just didn't want to! You want to keep me trapped in here because I add to her figure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true,\" Salama mumbled awkwardly. Ok, it was a little true. Salama really did only want Olivia to be happy, but he had to admit that the human was <i>somehow</i> the perfect shape to contribute to Olivia's physique. It was like they were two puzzle pieces that fit together perfectly. Salama couldn't explain it, but it was almost like Greg belonged in Olivia's gut forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of condemning a person--even one as foul-tempered as Greg--to an eternity imprisoned inside another person horrified Salama. He had always considered himself to be a good and moral person. He'd never hurt a fly. How could he even be contemplating leaving Greg to his fate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SAL! GET ME OUT OF HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh... I need to get rid of the rope before Olivia wakes up. I'll think of another way to get you out. You stay here.\" The dragon flinched. \"Sorry... guess you don't have a choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SAL! Don't you leave me! SAL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little dragon scooched off Olivia's thrashing stomach and cleared away the evidence. He delayed in returning to Olivia no matter how much he wanted to. He needed time to think. Olivia loved having Greg in there. Salama loved having Greg in Olivia. But it was wrong! He had an obligation to free him. It's not like Salama could come up with a way for Greg to live inside Olivia forever... Or could he?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hours had passed and there was still no sign of Sal. Greg wallowed in Olivia's stomach in despair. The hillock of food he'd been perched on had been reduced to a few pieces of junk food floating in the acid bath. Without it, he was up to his waist in the gastric lake. Greg had raged for a long time before accepting the little dragon wasn't coming back. All his fighting, all his attempts at freedom, had resulted in nothing more than the occasional bout of gas from the dragoness on either end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is how it ends,\" Greg mumbled, not caring who heard him. \"My family warned me. \"Don't work at Gaia 2.0, they'll eat you alive!\" \"No, ma,\" I said. \"That's just a stereotype. Anthros don't do that anymore. Times have changed. Nobody's gonna eat me.\" But look at me now, huh? Look at me now!\" he sobbed. \"Just another sap waiting to be digested. My whole life reduced to nothing but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pffffffrrrrrrrrttttt</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia let out a long fart in her sleep. The dragoness sighed in relief and lowered her leg back down on the bed, oblivious to the punchline she'd delivered to the cruel joke that was Greg's life. Greg heard it and didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He eventually settled on \"cry\" and began sobbing uncontrollably, hugging his knees to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg?\" The human's head snapped up at the sound of a voice behind the fleshy walls of his prison. Someone who could help! \"Greg, have you digested yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg recognized the voice and scowled in loathing. \"No, Sal,\" he hissed. \"Sorry to disappoint you, traitor, but I haven't been reduced to extra fat on the ass of your fatass girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell your upset,\" Sal said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Can you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't yell! You'll wake her--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T CARE IF SHE WAKES UP OR NOT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia grunted and rolled over in her sleep, onto her stomach. As if the situation hadn't been bad enough already, now the stomach compressed all around Greg on all sides. He thrashed and sputtered as the stomach acid washed over him like an angry tide. He managed to keep his head above it, but only barely. He was cramped and his head was pressed against the fleshy wall of Olivia's stomach. The outline of his head appeared on the outside and Sal addressed it in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've come to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you \"helped me\" last time? I didn't realize all you wanted was to give your girlfriend seconds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop being unreasonable and just hear me out.\" The threat of getting a mouthful of stomach bile was the only reason Greg didn't curse at Sal for calling him \"unreasonable.\" \"I bought something while I was out. They're Anti-Digestion pills from Kelly's Defense Bunker. They're used to stop anthros from digesting humans if they eat one accidentally... or if they did it on purpose but want to do it again. So long as Olivia takes one of these a week, you're in no danger of digesting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had heard Kelly talking about those. The crazy wyvern had the brains of a mad scientist, the charisma of a used car salesman, and the ethics of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought they were still in the testing phase?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah,\" Sal said awkwardly. \"Technically, the only way I could get Kelly to agree to give them to me was if I tested them for her to make sure they work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm the test case?!\" Greg snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Kinda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You son of a--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Belch</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSal coughed and wiped the fumes of his girlfriend's burp away from his snout. \"I'm sorry, I know it's not ideal, but this is the only idea I could come up with to save you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the idea of making her throw me up?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... can't,\" Sal said apologetically. \"I'm sorry. I just can't. Can't we compromise?\" Sal spoke over Greg as the human started to curse loudly again. \"Alright, alright, alright! How about this? You stay in there, I'll get Olivia to swallow these Anti-Digestion pills once a week, and in exchange, I'll pay you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pay me... Well that's fucking brilliant, Sal. What am I going to spend the money on? Furniture for my new home? Now Olivia's stomach looks like a dump, but a few paintings and a recliner <i>would really spruce up the place!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't pay <i>you</i>, exactly,\" Sal said. \"I'd pay your family. Kelly told me you send them some of your wages home to support them. I'll pay them triple every week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriple? Greg's jaw dropped, then closed quickly and spat as he tasted bile. He mulled the offer over as he sputtered to get the taste out of his mouth. He couldn't lie, that much money was tempting... But this was crazy? What was he doing considering this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if the pills don't work, Sal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly was positive they would!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But. What. If. They. Don't. Sal?\" No response. \"SAL?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll compensate your family for the rest of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can buy off your guilty conscience so easily?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little dragon looked away from the outline of Greg's face guiltily. His eyes wondered up to the enraptured look of his sleeping beauty, a smile on her face, her tongue lolling out of the side of her mouth contentedly. One look at her joy and all his reservations melted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Greg. This is my offer. Take it or leave it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg wanted to kill him, Sal and the big bitch who'd eaten him in the first place. But what could he do? The choice wasn't a choice at all. Either accept and hope the pills work, or refuse and be digested for sure. At least if he accepted, his family would be taken care of. Either way, there was no way out of this stomach... at least for the time being. If the pills did work, Greg had no intention of spending the rest of his life as the prisoner of Olivia's gut. The pills could buy him time, and time was all he needed to find a way out. He'd escape someday. Somehow. And then the two dragons would pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSal sighed in relief. \"I'm glad you saw reason. Hang on, I'll give her the first pill.\" Greg heard Olivia swallow in her sleep. \"Let me know when you get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white pill the size of a coconut fell and knocked Greg on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" he said murderously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pill bounced off him and plopped into the stomach acid, where it immediately fizzled and dissolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good... now all we have to do is wait.\" The little dragon was suddenly aware this may be the last time he ever spoke with the human. \"Um... Good night... I, uh... I hope to see you tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSal winced at how awkward that sounded. Even through the layers of flab encompassing Olivia's massive belly, Sal knew Greg was glowering at him. Sal coughed before climbing into bed beside Olivia. He thought it would take him a while to get to sleep after what he done but sleep came surprisingly easy for the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg, on the other hand, fought against sleep. The anticipation of finding out whether he'd live or die kept him awake. Olivia's stomach acid tingled and Greg gritted his teeth, not sure whether it meant digestion was imminent or a sign of the pills working. He managed to stay awake for an hour, even as his eyes grew heavy, even as his mind lulled at the droning of Olivia's and Sal's snores merging together. He tried to stay awake but he'd been up all day and been through so much. Exhaustion hit him all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please let the pills work,\" Greg prayed as he closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid they?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I don't know about you but I slept like a baby,\" Olivia said with her mouth full. She and Salama were still in her bedroom. Sal had woken up early and tried to talk to Greg, but there was no response. To take his mind off things he'd gone to the kitchen and prepared his beloved a mountain of food. She woke up to breakfast in bed and began scarfing down what he offered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night was magical,\" Olivia said fluttering her eyelashes at Salama. \"Easily the best date of my life. First you feed me at the boardwalk and foot the bill, then we spend all night talking and cuddling, and to top it off you give me breakfast in bed. I can't wait to see what you do for our second date... Salama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSal chewed on his fingernails nervously. He'd been nodded along with what Olivia said, but had been distracted. He couldn't keep his eyes off Olivia's jiggling gut, looking out for any signs of life from its unwilling occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh! Sorry! What were we talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Olivia asked, shoveling a stack of flapjacks into her mouth and swallowing effortlessly. \"You seem distracted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalama figured there wasn't any point in hiding it. The guilt was eating away at him. \"I... I was just wondering about... how Greg's doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia snorted. \"Oh? Is that all? Don't worry about him. He digested nicely last night.\" Olivia was surprised at the look of horror on Salama's face. \"Hey now. Isn't that what you wanted? For him to be sag in my belly? To fill out my curves in all the right places?\" Sal blushed in equal parts excitement and shame. \"I'm sorry, baby. Believe it or not I'll miss the twerp too. Feeling his pitiful struggles, getting to taste him again whenever I burped, making his life a living hell--damn I'm gonna miss it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more she thought about it, the more Olivia actually made herself sad. When she'd eaten the runt, she hadn't thought through the implications of it. Greg had been her favorite punching bag. Every time she was down in the dumps, she could always make herself feel better by making him suffer. With him gone, now what was she gonna do? She was like a supervillain without her archenemy. Killing him wasn't anywhere near as fun as hurting him every day. Life just wouldn't be the same with him reduced to a few extra inches on her waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing we can do about it now,\" she said. \"Let's not dwell on Greg. We need to look on the bright side. At least he filled me out in all the right places. And now there's even more of me for you to love!\" The dragoness showed off her big belly to Sal, lifting it up and giving it a playful smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her stomach smacked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SCREW YOU PORKY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia's jaw dropped. Sal let out a deep breath in relief. He wasn't a murderer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg! You're alive!\" Olivia grabbed her bloated gut and hugged it happily. Greg shouted as he was crushed in her flab. After a second Olivia realized what she was doing, blushed and dropped her gut, making it jiggle with Greg still inside. \"I mean... Surprised you made it through the night, twerp. Guess you're tougher than you look. Looks like you'll be keeping me company for a while yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?! How long do you still plan on keeping me here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However long I want, runt!\" Olivia laughed, resuming her customary cruelty. \"Food doesn't get a say. Besides, you're obviously immune to digestion. I should've known. You always were a freak of nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Sal said awkwardly. \"Greg didn't survive on his own...\" Sal came clean. After all, relationships should be built on trust. He couldn't live a lie if he hoped to win Olivia's heart. He told his love all about how he was afraid for Greg's life, how he bought the Anti-Digestion Pills from Kelly, and his business relationship with Greg. Olivia was silent for a long time after Sal finished talking. Sal braced himself for heartache. \"Are you mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mad? How could I be mad? I have the most perfect boyfriend in the world! You've given me the greatest gift I could ask for. With these pills, I can keep Greg trapped in there forever! Now I can spend every hour of every day making him suffer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Greg shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia laughed at her human prisoner's cursing. Sal felt uneasy about how blatantly cruel Olivia was being, but all those concerns vanished as his girlfriend scooped him up into her arms and planted a big, fat kiss on the lips. Hearts filled Sal's eyes and he was reduced to quivering jelly in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, dear,\" Sal giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you listen to me you psychos! If you think I'm just gonna stay in here without a peep, you got another thing coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaddup!\" Olivia said, shaking her stomach like a snow globe and sending Greg tumbling around in a vortex of stomach juices and breakfast foods. \"Salama told me you took his deal. He's paying your family good money for you to stay in there, and that's what you're gonna do! You're my belly-bitch now, so get used to it. This is the first day of the rest of your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS!\" Greg screamed, but he sounded more scared now than angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia only cackled. \"Why not? No one's caught me so far. Not even my goodie-goodie sister noticed you when you were right under her nose. Face it, you're not going anywhere. Now why don't you make yourself useful and give my big belly a massage from the inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, twerp!\" Olivia snapped. \"Sal's paying you, so you're going to earn your keep! You don't work for Gaia 2.0, anymore, you work for me! So from now on, you're gonna do what I say, when I say. Otherwise, one of these weeks I may \"forget\" to take my medicine, and you'll be nothing more than pudge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're bluffing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg blinked back tears. Escape. He had to focus on escaping. He'd get his chance someday, and then he'd seize it. But until then, he needed to do whatever was necessary to keep this psycho from digesting him. Greg approached her stomach wall and began massaging it, hating himself all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh... that feels good...\" Olivia moaned. She reclined in bed, letting her stomach spread out, basking in the magic touch of Greg's fingers. \"Sal, be a lamb and feed me more of that scrumptious breakfast you prepared. I'm eating for two now, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away, my love!\" Sal said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg ground his teeth as he was pelted with masticated eggs, waffles, cereal, and every other breakfast food item under the sun. Soon the food was pressing in on him, driving him further into her stomach wall and making it harder to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I say stop, slave?\" Olivia growled. \"Put your back into it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg resumed his massage, though it was much tougher now, and his arms were already tired. This didn't stop Olivia from gorging herself silly, with Sal catering to her every whim. As Greg worked he kept one thought in his mind. Escape. Escape. He had to escape. But would the opportunity present itself that day? And even if it did, would he manage to free himself?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time Olivia finished her breakfast, her stomach was larger than it'd ever been in her life. Greg was buried so thoroughly under the avalanche of food that he was forced to dig his way out like a mole. Just when he thought things couldn't possibly get any worse, he felt a tightness all around him as the dragoness's palatial insides compressed even more, closing around him like a trash compactor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell's going on out there?!\" Greg shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside Olivia was inspecting her reflection in the mirror. She'd just put on a new gift from Sal: a tight pink sweatsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Sal asked enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... great babe,\" Olivia said, not wanting to hurt her boyfriend's feelings after he'd gone to all the trouble for her last night. In truth, the outfit was hard to breathe in, and it was a struggle to pull down the shirt so that it fully concealed her belly. \"It's a little tight though,\" she admitted. \"And pink isn't really my color. I think I might go back to my old workout clothes for today--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but this outfit is special!\" Sal said. \"It was made for anthros with a more... lively diet. Notice how we haven't heard a peep out of Greg since you put it on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he mentioned it, Olivia realized that Greg was uncharacteristically quiet. He hadn't been digested because she could still feel his kicking and screaming inside her, but she couldn't actually hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soundproof fabric! It's another of Kelly's creations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg groaned at the mere mention of that name. What the hell was wrong with that wyvern? Didn't she know it was tough enough being a human without a mad scientist running around giving anthros new ways to make their lives a living hell?! Just like that his best chance of getting rescued was thrown out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the little dragon was droning on. \"I bought an entire wardrobe for you from Kelly! From business, to swimwear, to casualwear and dresses. Now you'll never have to worry about anyone discovering your little secret!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH COME THE FUCK ON!\" Greg screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him, the only one who heard it was himself. Kelly did take note of his increased struggles and let out an evil cackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is priceless! I love it! You've thought of everything!\" The front of the shirt road up a little and she struggled to pull it back down. \"Though, couldn't you have gotten a size bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, there... were no bigger sizes--let me show you another function!\" Sal said, hasty to change the subject. \"So I know we don't want anyone hearing Greg, but in case you ever wanted to check up on him inconspicuously, you can listen through this ear piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia slipped the ear piece in and, sure enough, she could finally hear Greg inside her stomach as he cursed Kelly, her inventions, and dragons of all kinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It works like a charm!\" Olivia said, laughing. \"You hear that, mincemeat? Now your new accommodations will be a secret between Sal, you and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laugh it up, fatass,\" Greg thought. \"I'll get out of here and when I do, I'm turning you into a suitcase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a comforting thought, but it did him little good towards actually escaping this nightmare. As he sat in the depths of her stomach, surrounded by the masticated remnants of her meal, he tried--for quite possibly the million-and-oneth time--to come up with an escape plan. Each one was more ridiculous than the last. When he realized his latest plan would only work with the help of a jetpack and a limbo competition, he decided to give it a rest for the time being. Outside, he made out Olivia saying goodbye to Sal as she headed off to work. Before she left, the dragoness planted another kiss on him and said she couldn't wait for their second date. Greg's world lurched as Olivia walked down the hall, her stomach swaying back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll count the seconds until we can be together again, beloved!\" Sal called after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg gagged at the sickening display. \"How whipped can one guy be?\" he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called being a gentleman, twerp,\" Olivia said. \"You should be taking notes. Who knows. Maybe if you act nicer to me, I'll go easy on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right away, your majesty!\" Greg said sarcastically. \"And how fares the Queen of Blubber on this glorious morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laugh it up, bellybitch. It's exactly that kind of attitude that landed you a permanent stay in my gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you kidding, fatass? I could've worshipped you like a god and you still would've scarfed me down the second you thought you could get away with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia thought about it then chuckled. \"Yeah. You're probably right. I guess some people are just destined to be at the bottom of the food chain.\" Greg didn't respond. He may be stuck in here but he didn't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing she was getting to him. \"Aww, what's wong wittle, Gwegie? No more insults for the Queen of Blubber? Ever since I ate you, I couldn't get you to shut up. Now you're staying quiet? Come on, speak up! I'm all ears--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator door opened and Olivia immediately bit her tongue when she saw who was on the other side. Her musclebound meathead of a twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Olivia,\" Candace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg recognized the voice and just like that he went back to his strategy of \"kick and scream until someone notices me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CANDACE! CANDACE I'M IN HERE! YOUR FAT, STUPID BITCH OF A SISTER ATE ME! I'VE BEEN TRAPPED FOR DAYS! HELP ME! GET ME THE HELL OUT OF HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia winced as all Greg's shouting went directly in her ear. She covered her stomach self-consciously to conceal his struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you talking to someone?\" Candace asked, looking around the space outside the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Olivia snapped. \"I was... singing a song while waiting for the elevator!\" Olivia said lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay.\" The two sisters stared at each other in silence for a long time. \"So are you getting on, or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh! Right,\" Olivia said, coming out of her shock and realizing she needed to divert suspicion. She wedged herself inside the elevator behind her sister and pushed the button going down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to sing in here, are you? Cause I have better music I can be listening to,\" Candace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Olivia growled, praying that the soundproof suit worked. And that her sister didn't catch Greg's cries for help coming from her earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen Greg, yet?\" Candace asked. \"I've been looking all over for him and I still can't find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia was starting to sweat. She clenched her arms around her stomach tighter to dampen Greg's struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I know where the little runt scampered off to? I'm not his mother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I'm just asking, jeez,\" Candace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator was going painfully slow. Greg was shouting himself hoarse hoping to get Candace's attention, but it looked like Kelly's sweat suit was doing its job. Not a peep could be heard except through the earpiece. Olivia watched as the floors counted down, growing more confident she would get away clean with her prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" Candace said, smirking. \"Nice outfit. I thought you hated pink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying something new,\" Olivia mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks familiar,\" Candace said, narrowing her eyes. \"I think I've seen guests wearing it before... where did you get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the confines of the dragoness's stomach, it seemed like Greg's prayers had been answered. If Candace remembered she saw this sweat suit at Kelly's Defense Bunker and put two-and-two together, it might just lead to his rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Candace remembers those clothes are used to conceal humans that have been eaten by anthros and finally figures out what happened to Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Candace doesn't remember but maybe something else happens?</span></div></div>",

She had to say something soon otherwise Candace would get suspicious. And if that pressure wasn't bad enough, Greg's frantic movements were causing a build up of gas inside her. Normally she enjoyed how her burps would fill her mouth with his taste, but now it was distracting. Without enough time to think up a complete lie, she told a half-truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--<i>URP</i>--don't know. My--<i>BRAP</i>--boyfriend bought it for me--<i>OOARP</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your meal not agreeing with you?\" Candace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've no--<i>URP</i>--idea!\" Olivia chuckled under her breath, then winced, afraid she'd said too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Candace hadn't caught her hidden meaning. Instead she seemed to be blinking in surprise as Olivia's earlier statement sank in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... boyfriend? You have a boyfriend?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace slammed on the emergency stop button and the elevator came to a screeching halt. Greg hoped that signaled the beginning of his rescue only for his hopes and dreams to come crashing down yet again as Candace let out a happy squee and threw her arms around Olivia in a hug without warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me! Get off me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia was terrified her twin would feel Greg moving about inside her--that one unexpected display of affection would bring an end to all her fun! Luckily for her, but not-so-luckily for Greg, Candace's hug was so strong that he was pinned amidst the walls of Olivia's stomach and the veritable landfill that had once been his captor's breakfast. He tried to move but literally couldn't. He settled for begging for help in a pathetic wheeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can...dace... help... me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's outfit did its job, however. The only one who heard was Olivia, and she was mostly preoccupied by Candace jumping up and down in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liv, I'm <i>so</i> happy for you! I never thought you'd ever--\" Candace realized how that sounded and broke off sheepishly. \"I mean. I never doubted that you'd find someone eventual--\" She broke off awkwardly again. \"Nevermind! I'm an idiot! Tell me, tell me, what's he like? Who is he? How did you two meet?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief when she realized her secret was safe. She began recounting all about how she had met Salama and the details of their date, conveniently leaving out that the entire time she'd kept a welcome third wheel tucked away inside her. Candace listened to the entire thing, asking questions and expressing happiness for her sister's own. She hadn't even mocked Olivia for talking through the burps caused by Greg's increasingly futile struggles. Olivia realized it was the first conversation they had in years that hadn't ended in insults. It was nice. If only her sister wasn't such a goodie-goodie and admitted humans like Greg were only good as snacks and slaves, they might actually have a real relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liv, that's wonderful news! Have you told mom yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, you know how she makes a big deal out of everything. I want to keep this under wraps for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you loud and clear. It'll be our little secret,\" Candace said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, sis,\" Olivia said, feeling genuine gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem... hey, listen, Holmes told me about a job opening she needs filled pronto. I wasn't sure who to give it to at first, but now that I think about it, I think you'd be perfect for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the--<i>brup</i>--job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holmes wants me to come up with new dishes to serve our guests, and I need someone to critique them to find out what works and what doesn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... want to pay me... to eat?\" Olivia said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her stomach, Greg was groaning. He couldn't take being buried under any more food. The thought that one of his only friends would be unknowingly contributing to his torture was too much to bare. He didn't even care that Olivia could hear any more. He started crying like a baby, pounding on the walls of his captor's stomach futilely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the dragoness heard Greg's sobs and her smile grew wider as she realized how much she'd broken him in just a short amount of time. First a new boyfriend, now the offer for a new job? Ever since she'd eaten Greg, her luck had been on the rise. Maybe the human was her own personal good luck charm? No sooner had she thought that then Greg's movements sent another build up of gas erupting out her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP PPP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace took a few steps back from the force of the belch. She didn't say anything but she held her nose and waved her hand in front of her watering eyes to disperse the smell. Olivia wasn't even a little embarrassed. Instead she patted her stomach affectionately like a beloved pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" Olivia said without shame. \"The old girl heard talk of food and got excited. Settle down in there,\" she said, grabbing the folds of her gut and shaking it as if she was talking to it instead of her bellybitch. \"You'll have plenty of company soon enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia smacked her lips at Greg's taste as it filled her mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...

She'd always been a little strange but there was no need to let her weird behavior get in the way of her good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia smacked her lips again and said...</span></div></div>",

She hated Greg and now hates him even more hearing that he was getting a week off, A WHOLE WEEK! 'Why are humans such a parasite?' Olivia asked herself. 'They're smaller and weaker than us anthros, yet we have to treat them as our equals. Well I say that they can all go get squashed for all I care.' Upon ending her thought she got an idea of how to \"dispose\" of Greg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Say Greg, do you like sandwiches?\" Olivia said with a grin. \"What the hell are you talking about?\" Greg retorts back. Olivia growled menacingly at Greg, showing her teeth. \"Just answer the damn question...\" Not wanting her to get more angry, Greg answered. \"Yeah, I guess..\". Olivia smirked. \"Well I like sandwiches...\" She let go of Greg and he fell with a thud. \"...sandwiching you between these buns!\" Greg flipped over to turn and see what she meant...and instantly regretted it. Olivia was coming down on Greg, booty first, at full force before landing on him with a loud *THOOM*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Greg literally just vanished, Olivia's size and girth hid Greg out of sight with only tuffs of his hair sticking out. \"Oh good heavens, that felt good~\" Olivia said with a sigh. Feeling Greg try to struggle to get free. It only left a few twitches appearing. \"orifia i shwear to got whe i ge oufa heer!!\" Greg exclaimed but it came out muffled. Olivia shivered in pleasure, feeling what's going on down there. \"My my Greg, I didn't know that you like me in that way.\" Olivia joked. \"Maybe I should return the favor~\" With tah she began grinding him and clenching her cheeks around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Miss Holmes gave me a shift off.\" Olivia smirked. \"So I have a lot of time before my next shift.

Olivia enjoyed the massage that Greg was giving her. She stood up for a moment and let the weight off of her captured prey. Greg seized the opportunity given by jolting his head out where he saw light. With a powerful thrust his head poked out between the dragon's rear. \"YES FINALLY FRESH AIR!!\" Greg proclaimed. Olivia giggled before reaching her arm back and touching Greg's forehead with a claw. \"Back in you go.\" She chimed. \"WAIT NONONO STO--\" was all Greg could muster before getting pushed back in with a squelch. Olivia pushed a bit deeper to make sure tgat Greg was secure in there before rearing back her arm. \"There.\" She said. Olivia looked at her arm and noticed that she was looking a bit pale for a dragon. \"Maybe some rays ought to be taken in.\" Olivia said to herself. She waddled over to a nearby shack that sold beach essentials. Beach balls, towels, shovel and pail for the kids. Her eyes lit up when she saw what she was looking for, a bottle of tanning oil. Taking it back to the spot where she lodged Greg in between her cheeks she sat back down, applying more weight onto the human trapped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia undid the cap and applied a few squirts on her hands before rubbing down her body. Her body sheened as she coated herself with more oil. However, she ran into a bit of a problem while oiling herself. She cannot apply tanning oil on her back side. Humming to herself she spots an anthro passerby. \"Hey you, the skinny one with the red scales!\" The figure stopped before turning to their caller. \"Could you come here and do me a big favor for me please?\" Olivia used her best sweet voice to lure the passerby closer. Which worked like a charm. The anthro stepped closer before stopping, it was obvious that the anthro was timid. \"Oh come on. Don't be shy little one.\" She cooed. Little was right. This anthro was on the short side being about 5 foot 3 inches. When the anthro came close to Olivia he meekly said. \"W-what would you like me to do m-miss?\" \"An eager one are we? Weeell...\" she turns and lays on her squishy belly, her jelly like rear wobbles from the sudden movement. \"I need a STRONG and HANDSOME dragon like you to coat my beautiful scales with this..\" Olivia hands the scarlet dragon the bottle with her tail. His face was flushed with redder-than-his-scales blush. Olivia snickered at this. <i>Must be that poor sap's first time handling a woman.</i> she slaps her butt making it wobble. <i>A <b>REAL</b> woman might I add.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n......................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the life for Olivia. She got her vengeance on that human, she got a man to treat her right, and she's relaxing while the sun bakes both her ass and the person between it. Greg was trapped inside a fleshy oven. It didn't help that Olivia's sweat was seeping into the crack and therefore onto him. He couldn't talk as his face was dug deep into one of Olivia's ass cheeks. He was literally getting cooked alive. Outside the scralet dragon went to work on making sure that Olivia's back was well oiled. Once he was done with that Olivia complimented him on the work. \"Now be a dear and rub down my glorious ass.\" Olivia cooed. The dragon anthro was very flustered at this point. He had never layed his hands on a woman's butt before. Not wanting the displease Olivia he does as he's told. His hand sunk into Olivia's soft and scaly flesh. He was clearly mesmerized by how squishy it was. He rubbed up and down the glorious booty as it shined from the oil. \"Do a good job and you might snag a date with me.\" Olivia teased. \"Yes ma'am!\" The red dragon said. He ran his hands over her thighs making sure that they were covered. When the dragon was done Olivia's body glowed like a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sofun dit me ow ah fear!\" A muffled voice came from Olivia's rear. This shocked the red anthro. \"I heard a voice come from your butt!!\" He yelled. <i>Damn parasite just had to ruin it...</i> Olivia lamented. \"Excuse me for a second. Wait right here.\" Olivia nervously chuckled before storming into a bathroom. She made sure the coast was clear before mooning herself in a mirror and sprwading her glorious globes. Greg's head popped out. He gasped as cool air blasted his face. He was clearly more red from all of the heat inside. \"What are you trying to do? KILL ME!?\" Greg asked coughing a bit. \"If it was that easy I would've done it by now.\" Olivia growled. \"Give me one good reason Greg why I shouldn't shove you back in between there?\" \"Because If Miss Holmes finds out about this. You might as well just pack your things now.\" Greg retorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she let Greg go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling Gregory struggle to free himself from between her asscheeks brought a whole new realm of possibilities for Olivia, opening an entire beach of ideas waiting for her to leave her footprints. She wanted to leap out and do so much all at once; a particularly enticing idea to just lay on the beach and absorb the sun\u2019s heat, giving her a nice tan whilst frying him into a nicely crisp snack, but the last rational tooth in her skull knew to keep herself in control, knowing the scolding she\u2019d be in for from Candace over attempted murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, the thought of eating him seemed so quick and easy compared to the thoughts blooming in her mind when she glanced at a nearby cliff, its tip garnished by a single shack but a rockslide away from tumbling over. A place Olivia would\u2019ve normally steered away from, considering what lay inside, but now its secrets sounded all too promising to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClenching her thighs together one last time, snickering at Gregory\u2019s muted screams of pain, Olivia sauntered over to a pathway leading up the rock face, leaping with an extra pop in her steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, if it isn\u2019t the lady of the hour herself, Miss Olivia Moenks!\u201d Karma chirped, her Jamaican accent merging with the reggae playing on her radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBottles hanging from vine ropes clinked against one another as Olivia\u2019s footsteps weighed upon the wooden floor to Karma\u2019s air shack, a tidal wave of herbal odors washing over her through the front door, a cacophony of exotic herbal stenches devoid of any native flavors to compare to, easier to compare to being a <i>planet</i> away than something just beyond the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and as if that wasn\u2019t surreal enough, there was her another of the many, many items of Olivia\u2019s eye, but a particularly clingy one of the bunch: Karma. Just seeing the shack from the outside and stepping inside to see her inside was a mystery in itself; the bright yellow parrot was already sat behind a desk several times too narrow for her obscene girth, her ebony beak sucking upon a rubber tube hooked to a gas tank hissing with steam. For such a large creature, her face was mostly devoid of fat, if only supplied by meager chub around her neck, but enough to amass around her chest in an ample set of breasts conformed into a pair of large, feathery orbs by a snug black t-shirt, which rode away from the front of an obese stomach that swallowed the entire front half of her swim suit, specks of blues feathers exposed to the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...all but a pimple sitting atop an impenetrable barrier of parrot ass distending several feet outwards from her backside, wide enough to bowl out the walls at either side of the shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in some of your business.\u201d Olivia returned curtly, sparing her any formalities. \u201cNothing more, nothing less.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, thank you for finally opening your eyes!\u201d Karma answered, fluttering the feathers along her fingertips. \u201cBelly, I take it? Breasts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy butt.\u201d Olivia answered, refusing to give her any satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarma spat out the tube, staring at Olivia\u2019s in an almost scholarly manner. \u201cWell, if it\u2019s results you\u2019re wanting, you\u2019ve come to the right place!\u201d She chuckled heartily, giving her own behemothic ass a smack to accentuate. \u201c...and you\u2019re in luck! We\u2019d had an ass special beginning just this morning, first come is free!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia didn\u2019t linger on the fact that there wasn\u2019t a single sign about such in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you say? Interested?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust do the thing.\u201d She grumbled, stomping over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarma nodded and pushed up from her seat, a small wooden chair remaining caught in her asscrack for a good ten seconds before springing loose and smashing against the floor. The parrot woman smirked nonetheless and spun around to begin working on the lock to a door right behind, whistling along to the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding just around twice Olivia\u2019s height, she gave the obese dragoness quite a view, her buttocks jiggling slightly as she both stomped her foot to the beat and struggled with the latch, but eventually reached behind her back to grab a key tucked into her swimsuit to unlock the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia only stared at the swimsuit\u2019s logo, forcing herself not to stare and give Karma any power over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a twist in the lock, once again, an overly forceful task that made her behind jiggle, Karma swung open the door and led Olivia into a room decorated only by a wall lined with tanks of various color and a single chair in the middle of the floor, eerily similar to some back alley dentist\u2019s office. She spun the chair around and invited Olivia to sit in, who gave the grinning parrot woman one last nervous look, questioning herself one last time before surrendering and taking a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarma turned a few cranks to the canisters and plugged a clear tube into a nozzle at the array\u2019s corner, soaking the tip into a tub of fluid against the wall and dried it off with a paper towel, handing it to Olivia. \u201cKeep this in you mouth until the pressure becomes to much, and I\u2019ll make it stop. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it.\u201d Olivia replied, doing as she was told. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving one last nod, Karma pulled a lever next to the tanks, an ominous hissing sound running through the tube as its air turned a leafy green. Watching the colored air come closer to her mouth, Olivia jolted when the gas passed out the tube\u2019s end and covered her tongue and cheeks with a cloud of lime-tasting air, covering her tongue with a thicker layer of spit than usual. She couldn\u2019t even tell if it was going into her stomach or lungs when the gas started forcing its way down her throat, building up enough in her abdomen that it began to inflate, the tolls along its sides disappearing as it became rounder and tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia tenderly stroked her arms up and down over whatever she could still reach over her growing middle, confused by how light she was feeling. It certainly felt strange, like some kind of effect was taking place inside of her, but it certainly didn\u2019t seem like her ass was getting bigger. She spoke something against the pipe, glaring back at a still-smirking Karma leaned up against the wall...but was answered by the lightness bubbling up in her thighs, her swimsuit suddenly feeling much tighter than before. True, upon looking down at her legs, she could see her hips growing around the chair, swallowing around the lip of the seat. She planted a claw on either thigh and hummed in delight, her fingers sinking into growing layers of paunch that pushed her hands further apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Gregory, he could barely tell where he even was the moment Olivia had trapped him, his only clue being a loud, foamy sound hissing around inside of either one of her buttocks. Not nearly enough to tell him what was going on, but enough to elicit a few more muffled shrieks as the pressure around him gradually multiplied, what little movement he had left shrinking even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone the wiser, Karma merely stayed at her station with her arms folded behind her neck, licking her beak as Olivia rose higher and higher on her ever growing mammoth of a behind, looking less like it was part of her body and more an expanding pair of cushions that she was merely sat upon, the chair gradually disappearing from view. Even her calves were transforming into but funneled tips stemming off her leviathan is buttocks, feet getting sucked into little nubs twitching from her enormous cankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her ass press against the floor whilst the chair remained inside, Olivia hunched forward and rolled to get back up, the chair uprooting and remaining trapped amongst Gregory. She staggered to get upright, having to carry around a few extra feet of booty at either side of her, bulging backwards with enough weight to send her flying back with a wrong step, and snapped her claw towards Karma giving a few grunts to command her to shut it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarma...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey...Gregory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil then, none of us'd said anything throughout our little gaming bash, nothing except for a few whoops of victory or defeated grumbles. I played on top of one of Yazuki's enormous, scaly legs, nestled up against the bulge of her profound potbelly. I couldn't tell if Yazuki noticed me occasionally glance down at her legs, whose massive girths were vastly exposed by a pair of blue gym shorts that were downright tiny compared to the lengths they were trying to cover up, but about halfway through our session, I couldn't help but feel a nag at my brain as her body's natural green slowly, <i>very</i> slowly, merged over to another hue. By now, it was quite clear that her body'd dulled over in to a bit of a light blue pastel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Yazuki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a...well, a little question to ask you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very last hint of green on her vanished, leaving only a very soft cyan. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see her head glance over at Miss Blanc, whose black eyes were watching the both of us with an expectant look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that you had some free time for the week, right?\" She asked, stammering ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Why're you asking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...if you had any other plans in mind, you don't have to, but...\" She gulped loudly. I turned my head back, looking up at her as her neck tensed before she shut her eyes, breathing in deeply. \"...w-would you be interested in meeting with me in the Glass tornado?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving looked away from the game, I ignored Miss Blanc's happy buzzing at something that happened onscreen. It wasn't her request that surprised me the most; I didn't exactly have a reason to say no, but there was something about her bashful tone that clued me in. Even though she was in front of me and Miss Blanc, of all people, it seemed like she'd suddenly gone back to the shy, neurotic lizard we'd met on her first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"I guess. How come?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well...\" She jabbered, eyes darting around. \"I just...you know, thought maybe we could just spend some time together, you know...hang out for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could hear her voice go into full-on geek at the last few words. I was about to ask a few more questions, even pointing up a finger, but as I quickly looked around the room and back at Miss Blanc, who once again was leaning in towards the conversation, I decided to let it fall back in my lap and cast Yazuki a gentle smile. \"Sure! Sounds fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?! You do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Just give a time, and I'm there!\" I said as I turned back to the TV, where Miss Blanc was readily setting up the next game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" I could hear Yazuki gush, the blue on her legs flaring out into a brilliant yellow, but she instantly quelled over as Miss Blanc's body wobbled with a humored chuckle. \"I-I mean, how does 10:30 sound? At the beach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fine. I'll make it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alright. Thank you.\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and with that, the three of us turned back to the game, going silent once again. Through the rest of our playing, I couldn't feel any more of Yazuki's jitters from on top of her lap, but the hue of its scales didn't let go of a vague tint for that same shade of yellow...</span></div></div>",

When I arrived at the Rainbow Dome, I saw various anthros of many sizes playing a morning game of baseball, although I mainly didn't care since I wasn't a big fan of sports myself. After a few minutes of searching the arcade part of the dome, I found Yazuki's room hidden in the Rainbow Dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter knocking and waiting, Yazuki let me in and we started planning on what to do for the day at the Glass Torpedo. From what I could see, Yazuki was in a nice and simple one-piece swimsuit that gave her plenty of room for her pear-shaped body to be free. While she was comfortable in the swimsuit, I saw her scales turn slowly red from embarrassment, most likely because she was probably worried that she wouldn't look good at the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" I said, wrapping up the discussion, \"I think that this day will probably be good, especially with our plans for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I think it'll be good today.\" Yazuki said, her scales slowly turning back to their original color of green. \"Especially since we'll be trying the newly revamped water slide for people around 30'. I think that's the slide that has two loops, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh who knows if your right or not\" I said. \"Either way I guess today will be good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting our stuff, Yazuki and I headed for the Glass Torpedo via Monorail, while enjoying the scenery. The Glass Torpedo was in perfect conditions today, with the temperature, water, and even winds being great.

The dolphin lifeguard's lips mouthed out a few silent numbers as she held the strip high over her head, often nodding in admiration as the very peak of each buttock still loomed over her eyeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"23'4'.\" She stated. \"You two check out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Yazuki said quietly as the lifeguard let go, the tape going slack from her legs, but she didn't leave her spot. The dolphin lurched back to a metal control pad that stood next to a wide, square black chamber that was sealed shut by a transparent door, which hissed open and folded away from the interior with the press of a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lifeguard stared at Yazuki, and Yazuki stared back, her scales fading out into a pale white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you two can get inside, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you.\" Yazuki whispered, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded as well, looking into the chamber, then back at Yazuki. \"...I won't hold you up, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aw, for...</i> \"Oh, <i>boy!</i> Let's go, Yazuki!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leapt up and grabbed Yazuki's hand, the sudden weight of me pulling her back down. She gave a yelp, but didn't stick around as I walked towards the chamber, my arm influencing her to sidestep through the door as I stopped at the base and spun along my feet, practically swinging her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer buttocks hit a stream of water from the roof that flowed down along the back wall, making her shiver. The trapdoor under her feet didn't give out underneath her gigantic weight, but I could see on her face that she could still feel only a few inches of reinforced plastic under her feet being her only protection from a straight up drop through hundreds of feet of tube and water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment I'd stepped onto the doorframe, she snatched me up and hugged me against her belly, pulling me in so tightly that either side of my face was squished firmly between her scale-coated blubber, all the way around my ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your arms in and legs together, with your back flat against the slide!\" I could make out the dolphin saying. With Yazuki already as tight as a knot, she only nodded and hit the button, but still shot me a thankful wink as the door slid back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then, the only other sound to be heard in the pod was the rush of the water, bouncing loudly off the walls of the small, enclosed space, but underneath the warmth of Yazuki's scales, I could just weed out the sound of a very rapid, panicked heartbeat beating away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Five.\"</span> A digitized voice counted off from a speaker on the roof. With each number, Yazuki gave a tiny squeak, pulling me in just a little bit more. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Four. Three. Two. One.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>K-CHUNK</b></i></span></div></div>",

As we were going down the slide, Yazuki was holding on to me like no tomorrow, and I could see her scales turn a dark shade of blue from her fear. After the first loop, she was holding onto me even more, and I was being pressed into her scaled fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we reached the bottom, we expected to reach the bottom, but we were stopped by a gigantic behind blocking the way. Due to there being barely any light in the tunnel, we couldn't clearly see who the bottom belonged to, but Yazuki and I were in a bit of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, were so stuck\" Yazuki said, worried. \"What if someone else comes down and ends up crushing us! Or what if this bottom won't budge and we'll be stuck forever?\" Or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Yazuki\" I said, trying to calm her down so she wouldn't get more nervous. \"I'm sure we'll get free sooner or later today. We just have to wait for someone to remove this person blocking us, and we can get out. And if someone does come down, it would probably just only push us into the girl blocking our way hard enough to remove her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm still a bit worried about this...\" Yazuki said. She was still nervous that something would go wrong, but I've seen Anthros get stuck before. Usually, the solution to the problem is to wait, so we continued waiting for someone to free us. Eventually, the Anthro blocking our way was free'd, and Yakuzi were free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were free, we looked at the person who was blocking our way, who was...</span></div></div>",

Amidst the colorful gush of fur, feathers, and scales that hurriedly poured out onto the station, we could make out a patch of black skin that elbowed its way from the train to the guardrail, eagerly pushing aside two anthros at the very end to look down at the beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashleigh!\" Gertrude happily called out to her, waving an arm high over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second orca looked our way, then beamed, letting out a squeak so loud that we could hear it loud and clear all the way down at the sand. She slinked back into the disbanding crowd, promptly shoving a string of bemused grunts out of any anthro standing between her and the spiral staircase that lead down to the ground, where she came running down six steps at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GERTRUDE!!!\" She squealed, charging right at us without any visible hindrance from how heavy she was. Gertrude came forward with open arms and a welcoming smile, but was nearly sent toppling over as Ashleigh jumped up with a mighty leap and pounced onto her with the velocity of a truck being floored, despite that she looked noticeably lighter and shorter. \"Ohmygosh, I'd missed you<i> so much!</i> What'd you been up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...<i>hk</i>...you know, just...<i>ngh</i>...same old, same old!\" Gertrude choked through her crushed ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee, sorry!\" Ashleigh giggled, letting go and sliding off of Gertrude's belly. She then glanced my way and leaned onto her side, curiously looking me and Yazuki over. \"Who're your friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashleigh, this is Gregory and Yazuki, two of my coworkers!\" Gertrude answered, pointing to each of us as she stepped aside. \"Gregory and Yazuki, as you'd probably guessed, this is Ashleigh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshleigh shuffled our way with a friendly smile, leaning down slightly. She was certainly big, I'd come to expect, carrying a prodigious stomach that wafted around plenty of the space below her chest, but it didn't reach the sheer bounce or roundness that Gertrude'd achieved with her bowling-ball figure, with quite a bit of her porky legs still left in view before it could drop onto the ground. \"Hello, Gregory! Hello, Yazuki! It's so nice to meet you two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYazuki stood up and gave a polite bow, holding out her hand. \"It's wonderful to meet you, too, Ashleigh!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, same here!\" I agreed. I held mine up as well, but Ashleigh ignored them and came down to scoop us both up in her mighty arms, squishing our bodies so deep into her blubber that Yazuki's legs dangled a few feet off the ground, kicking back in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so excited! I can't believe there's people like the three of you that get to work in such an amazing place <i>every single day!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's...<i>hmp!</i>\" I got out, wriggling my way up enough that my face wasn't getting smothered by her. \"It's certainly got its privileges, I can say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...he's right.\" Yazuki shyly added, grinning sheepishly. She was clearly eager to be let go, but Ashleigh took her sweet time in holding on, giving a warm hum that tickled us both before she finally let go, plopping us back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, if we're all ready to split ways, I'd better get back to work on the beach, but I'd still like to say I'm ver-OHMYGOSH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGertrude whipped out her whistle and momentarily deafened us all by blowing into it as hard as she could, face filled with panic as she burst out in a beeline towards the beach. \"DON'T SWIM TOO CLOSE TO THE BUOY, SIR!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYazuki scratched at the side of her head, eyes bugging out. \"Well, I'll just...get back to my work, then. You two have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yazuki, wait!\" I called after her, but only chased after her for a few steps as she went off as quickly, yet politely as she could go from the sounds of the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow alone, I turned back at Ashleigh, who kept staring down at me with her smile having never left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, her avatar came back to life and started charging at me. I was caught off guard, and before i could fire my gun, my neck was slit with a knife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha!\" Miss Blanc laughed at my loom of shock, her body quivering and jiggling as her gut rose up and down. \"Your out of your league Greg.

I have no idea where she came from, but as it turns out, she was just too on top of the game for me to win. Nut just how the heck did she defeat me so fast? Unfortunately, as I looked up, it turns out that I was about to learn the hard way, as Ms Blanc's head was grinning down at me in a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an unusual look on her face had not seen on her before, she slowly lowered her head into her valley of cleavage where she had set me down. The action was incredibly eerie to me, as she looked down at me in a way that I had only seen on the more...needy guests of the resort.looking like the most content moth in existence, she breathed in heavily and let out a great big sigh, letting her steamy breath roll over me in waves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Blanc then leans her face in a little bit more, to the point she was actually <i>nuzzling</i> me. Her smile cracked just a little bit wider as I tried to make some distance between her and me, but shifting my body around her massive breasts were easier said then done. \"You Know, Gregory,\" Ms Blanc said in an almost doting tone as she runs her pudgy finger along side of her right breast \"Do you remember the first time we met, when you came delivering me dinner, and I asked if you could say a bit longer to play a little? \" ms Blanc's tone of voice sounds slightly familiar to me. It reminded me of one of my first girlfriends as she asked me out on a date. The relationship didn't work out, of course, but the more I think about it, the more I realize she's also using similar words that my old girlfriend used, if not exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Ms Blanc's smile dissolved away all of the sudden, and scooted her face a couple feet away from me. \"Ugh,\" she groans. \"You must think I'm acting so weird...\" Ms Blanc then loots around he right side of her and grabbed a large handful of chips, shoving into her face. She didn't appear to notice the loose crumbs fly off into her valley of cleavage, including me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Ms Blanc pouted as she instinctively licked some of the loose chip crumbs of her fur, almost getting me. \"Look.\" She said, reverting a little bit back to what she was before acting weird. \"What I'm trying to say is...is that I like you Greggy\"</span></div></div>",

Now that you have the week off\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, how did you know I have the week off?\" I interrupted, trying to wiggle free from her entrapping cleavage. \"You said your crystal ball was broken...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't always need a crystal ball to know things,\" she said cryptically. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated\u2026don\u2019t make me say it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's magic, I don't have to explain it.</i> That was an inside joke we had. Miss Blanc HATED that saying: she insisted that magic had as many rules and laws as science, even if it defied science most of the time. I'd made the mistake of saying that when she tried to explain a spell that I didn't get...and spent afternoon under her ample buggy rump. Ever since, she used the line when I couldn't be bothered to do my homework on how her spells worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...so how DID you know?\" I ventured. I wasn't going anywhere, so she could explain it. \"What spell did you use? Scrying? Astral projection? Asked a ghost?\" Some of those were spells I'd seen in movies, others ones I knew she could actually cast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc grinned. \"I picked up the phone, called Holmes and asked if you were free today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Okay, I walked right into that one. The grin on Miss Blanc's face made me turn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't look so ashamed, Greg! It was just a little joke,\" Miss Blanc chided, laughing and giving her breasts a shake and knocking me around. \"And I'm not just stringing you along. I really DO like you.\" She tickled my face with her antennae. \u201cAnd, I\u2019ve been thinking:  We're not teenagers, Greg. Just sitting here, playing video games? I want to do something more...\" she cast about for a word, \"...social? Serious? Just something besides 'hanging out\u2019 like a bunch of  kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Blanc? Are you...asking me out?\" I gaped. <br>\r\nSurprised as I was, I still hid a sigh of relief. For a moment I'd thought she'd \"pull a Carly\" and force affection on me. But it looked like Miss Blanc was being more reasonable than that. And I liked the offer; she was one of my best friends in Gaia 2.0. Why not try and take our relationship a bit more seriously?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! What better way to get out and grow up a bit? And since you have some time off, why not today? I'm getting tired of this room anyway. Needs a cleanup, too...maybe you could help me with that as well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, why not? This had good vibes. \"I\u2019d love to. Date it is. Cleanup tomorrow, though\u2014gotta enjoy my week off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe buzzed happily, her wings fluttering fast enough to create a breeze. I hugged her huge chest and just enjoyed the moment.Then I blinked. \"Uh, so how are you going to get out? Your...uh, backside is kinda filling the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sheepishly pointed at her ample insectoid rear. It did indeed fill most of the room...hell, I'd never seen Miss Blanc NOT seated! Just how would she get out and about, if she LITERALLY couldn't get OUT?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc's wings fluttered again. \"Oh, I have just the spell for that...\" She produced a dusty, leather-bound book I could SWEAR seemed to be glowing faintly. She moved her hands in rapid patterns, chanting in a language I couldn't hope to understand. Light filled the room, and a massive flash enveloped us both. A crack of what sounded like thunder boomed, and my ears rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything cleared...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The space that felt so alive and homely for me on many days off felt completely naked without her crammed between the walls, the hollowed-out space from next door absent of anything but carpeting that was permanently fused to the floor from years and years of living underneath her immensity, tinted a few shades of red darker than what was able to see the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotally empty, that is, for a lean, healthy figure hanging in midair at the center of where she would normally be seated, slowly floating downwards till her feet gently contacted the floor. <i>Human</i> feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever was there a time where Miss Blanc\u2019s room, a quiet little zone that always guaranteed me a little space to unwind or just some friendly words of advice felt quite as much as being dumped in a stranger\u2019s room. She could do some pretty incredibly stuff with her magic; turning animal hair into strands of gold, see the dreams of anthros living across the resort without ever separating from the floor, even tamper with the fabric of space for no other reason than to open miniature voids to secretly store personal belongings into, but this? This was a new class all on its own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was just seeing a human face after a long, long time of seeing none outside of my own whilst flexing in front of a mirror, but whether to back away in fear or approach her in amazement, I didn\u2019t know what to do...but the latter a particularly tempting option. Curtained by wavy cascades of silver hair decorated by black spots along its fringes, much like the same that decorated her wings, skin a non-mammalian shade of white took the place of what would normally be fluffy, fragrant fur coating a thick epidermis, sheathed in a white sundress that encased a lean, but robust figure gifted with a rather motherly abundance in her breasts, and strong, healthy legs with enough berth to give her hips an attractive sway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyelids remained fastened, painted with black mascara that captured a faint sapphire glow when the light hit them just right. They twitched, then opened, her irises filled with a brilliant sapphire hue that no human without contacts could ever reach the shade of...and any regality to her posture imploded with a loud, haggard puff of air escaping her lips that made me draw back in fear, her arms shaking as they felt at the non-mountainous curves of her body. Even having a nose to breath through came off as an eldritch experience for her, her hand tenderly observing the alien appendage that now sprouted from her face as she tried to take a few baby steps, only for her feet to sweep around in splayed, janky movements before she toppled over with a startled yelp; likely a mix of going years without walking and realizing how it felt to have legs that weren\u2019t seventeen feet thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Blanc!\u201d I hurried over to help her back onto her feet, and feeling her arm hook over my shoulders to help brace herself, I was surprised by how heavy she still was; but a fraction of a decimal to her old weight, of course, but despite being human, she was still quite tall. Eight feet in height, I\u2019d estimate, and with her fit-and-firm frame expanded to such a size, she was still quite a haul to carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after a considerable amount of time spent with awkwardly long body contact, her hand  manly grasping my shoulder whilst my arms holding her upright by the waist, Miss Blanc managed to stand up on her own, but not without having to lean on me for support, still adapting to breathing with human lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike...what you see?\u201d She huffed-slash-chuckled, dejected that her first human words weren\u2019t as cool and collected as she would\u2019ve liked. Even her voice was different, yet somehow undeniably hers; Miss Blanc\u2019s voice was usually a mix of the young and old, kind and serene whilst aged finely by along lifetime of experiences and mistakes. Now it only carried the young, the type from a college waitress working to pay off her student loans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna...<i>mnt</i>...need to ride piggy-back, are you?\u201d I winced beneath her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I just gotta...get my sea legs back in shape.\u201d She set one foot forward, trembling slightly as she mustered the courage to take the next step, with me still wrapped around her the entire time before she managed to get into a shaky, albeit stable walk. Only when I was certain that she wouldn\u2019t fall over again that I let go, chuckling with A heat rising in my cheeks as I enabled myself to take in her view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take that it was an effort well learned, then?\u201d She teased, leaning into a more playful posture as the tremors in her limbs began to subside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you could\u2019ve used this spell to get out any time you wanted? Why didn\u2019t you ever do this before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose her hands like they were carrying a game controller. \u201cBecause no offense, Greg, but human hands are absolute ass for beating Battletoads with.\u201d She joked, both of giving a chuckle at my specie\u2019s brief expense, but her smile thinned out as a more serious tone came to her features. \u201cThat, and...other reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clamped her hand down on my shoulder again, not for support, but to get all the assurance she needed that I heard every word I was going to say, those ocean-blue eyes locking in on mind, effectively gluing my feet in place. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to put a job on top of our date, Greg, but as long as I have this spell active, I\u2019m really gonna need you to be my guardian angel for the next four days. Until the spell wears out, I cannot, and I repeat, <i>cannot</i> risk eating too much in this form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOy...\u201d I eyed Miss Blanc\u2019s now-flat stomach, well aware of how quickly she could gorge herself with enough time, snacks, and an addictive enough game to splurge on. \u201cHow come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause until I\u2019m back to my old form, I absolutely <i>can\u2019t gain any weight right now.</i>\u201d She warned. \u201cI weigh over nine-thousand times as much a moth as I do as of now, and if I get any heavier before I transform back, that weight will multiply to accommodate for my change in size, so just gaining a few pounds\u2019ll translate to a several extra <i>tons</i> for when I change back, so getting even a little bit plump could very well mean I\u2019d outgrow this room. That\u2019s assuming I\u2019d still be small enough to fit back into the <i>hotel</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...and any bigger, your head could bust through the resort\u2019s roof?\u201d I stated as more of a fun exaggeration than an actual concern, but Miss Blanc gave a nod that took it as a legitimate threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help that humans have a sense of taste and smell ten times as potent as a moth\u2019s. Plus, I don\u2019t have any access to my magic till I change back..\u201d She added, snapping her fingers to demonstrate the lack of magic at her disposal. \u201c...and I was already addicted to this place\u2019s food, so without anybody around to watch what I eat, I could turn to the dark side over a single dorito.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Certainly</i> a job, as she\u2019s put it before; considering Miss Blanc\u2019s snacking when the two of us interacted, putting a dampener on her appetite could very well be like pushing a freight train with only my own bare hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...but try not to worry about it to much.\u201d She enforced, stooping down on her knee, and I let out a rather non-masculine squeak as her other arm hooked under my knee so she could hoist me up and carry me like I was her newlywed bride. \u201cIt\u2019s a date! We\u2019re here to have fun, get to know one another, and see the world! I don\u2019t want you to spend the entire time fretting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole \u2018D\u2019 word still had an odd taste to me for it to be between us, but I nonetheless smiled and hooked my arms around her neck, getting close. So, so odd...but I liked it. It was a whole new realm to explore! \u201cSo, what part of the world did you have in mind first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The Glass Tornado. Plenty of beach to walk along, water slides, maybe a little greasy food on the boardwalk to tempt them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The Diamond Mines. She\u2019s interested in going around in something more trendy than a sundress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: The Rainbow Dome. Gaming on a TV wasn\u2019t enough; she wants to check out the arcade!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: The Fate\u2019s Hand Casino. She wants to see what the <i>really</i> high life in Gaia 2.0 is like!</span></div></div>",

So, let\u2019s hit the Glass Tornadao. Finally, I can see a real beach, with a friend\u2026\u201d Miss Blanc\u2019s alarmingly blue eyes got a faraway look and she started humming a reggae tune, still holding me in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2026<i>might</i> have let her space out for a moment because I realized how pretty her human form was. Or maybe I had fond memories of that game too and shared the nostalgia trip. Maybe. Won\u2019t tell you, that\u2019s for sure. Whatever my reasons, I gave her a poke after a bit, startling her out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you aren\u2019t just going there because there might be campfires?\u201d I joked. \u201cI mean, you ARE a moth\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc laughed and dropped me flat on my back onto the giant bed. \u201cCareful, or the first job you\u2019ll get after I change back is Seat Cushion! And it\u2019ll be an overnight shift!\u201d she mock-scolded, wagging a finger at me. \u201cAnd no\u2014in this form, I don\u2019t have my all my moth instincts. So I won\u2019t go walking into a fire. Never heard the expression \u2018like <i>humans</i> to a flame, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed at the joke, but Miss Holmes HAD assigned me that job once after I\u2019d irked her temper. To this day, I don\u2019t know how I survived having a giant cow woman sit on me for eight straight hours. \u201cGot me there,\u201d I said as she helped me up. \u201cBut there\u2019s just one problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tilted her head, sending her hair askew. \u201cProblem? What\u2019s wrong, Greg?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do we get down from here?\u201d I gestured across the bed that was as big as an office tower for BOTH of us now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Right\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>===</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne improvised controller-cord-as-a-climbing-rope later, we were lying in the sand soaking up the artificial sunlight with some fancy bottled water in hand. (We changed into our swimsuits along the way. Apparently Miss Blanc had some human-sized clothes saved for just this occasion). We\u2019d picked a spot away from the shops and restaurants so no anthros would bother us. Just lounging there, watching the giants splash around and enjoying the heat, seeing all the luxury and the perfect beach, not a care in the world\u2026damn, it reminded me why I <i>loved</i> this place, despite the mortal danger I was in most of the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a swig of water. \u201cIt\u2019s almost unreal to go to the Glass Tornado for FUN for once. If I can go a hundred <i>years</i> before I have to rub sunblock on an anthro woman\u2019s ass, it\u2019ll be too soon!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, really? They make you do that?\u201d Miss Blanc blinked, eyeing an 80-foot rabbit woman nearby. A gecko employee half her size was carefully applying sunblock. By his twitching eyes, the poor guy had to be fighting trying raging hormones screaming at him to touch some bunny butt\u2026or just reach someone twice his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rose my water bottle in sympathy for the poor lizard. \u201cYep. You think that guy has it rough? Try having to WALK ACROSS someone\u2019s back to reach everything. I\u2019ve gotten \u2018accidentally\u2019 sat on or stuffed under bikini bottoms more times than I can count\u2026and don\u2019t even MENTION kiddie pool day!\u201d I shuddered. Anthro adults could be scary, but anthro kids? Hell. On. Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc suddenly wrapped me in a hug. \u201cWell, just in case some fat-rumped hussy tries to slam her butt on you, why don\u2019t we get <i>our</i> butts off the beach! Show me around!\u201d She got up and started hopping from one leg to another, like an excited kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, no more tanning? Alright, first we'll hit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Already starting to psychoanalyze me?\" Miss Blanc giggle at her response. \"Oh don't say it like that. I just thought because well... water slides are so high up. And you've only ever really been on the ground so...\" I trailed off with that sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc gave off a confused \"Hmm?\" But soon quickly inhaled when she figured put where I was getting at. \"Aaaw~! You're worried that I'm afraid of heights aren't you?\" She cooed. I just chuckled in embarrassment when she said that out loud. It was cut short however when Miss Blanc suddenly grabbed me and hugged me close to her chubby body. Because of how much taller she is, she hugged me face first into her belly. There were many times where I had sat on her big ol' gut when she was still a moth and we'd lounge around her room, so this should be any different... but... for some reason I was flustered. I guess the swap from white fuzz to pale skin can make that big of a difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc released her grip and allowed my some breathing room. \"That's really sweet of you Greg. It really is.\" She said as she looked down at my blushing face. \"O-of course. After all, you're one of the only anthros here that is concerned about me and doesn't gets kicks from sitting on me.\" The human moth would lean in when I said that. She'd give me a sly grin before speaking. \"Are you so sure about that?\" She asked. \"Well... most of the time.\" \"Oh you, I'm just messing with you Greg. Now come on! I wanna feel what it's like to flow with water at high speeds!\" And with that, Miss Blanc didn't waste any time in hurrying to the slides. She held my hand the entire time. She looked like she was having the time of her life. And you know what? That makes me happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we've arrived at the slides, Miss Blanc was having a difficult time choosing one. There were so many variants with so many colors that she looked like she was getting a bit dizzy from frantically looking. \"Hey settle down Blanc. There's no rush. We've got all the time in the world.\" Miss Blanc shakes off the dizziness and breathes deeply. \"Thanks Greg. I needed that.\" \"Good. Now then, take your time and choose.\" She nodded. Putting a hand on her chin, she looked at the slides again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne them was yellow and had many swerves and tight turns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next one was red, and was pretty simple. You ready yourself at the top with an inner tube and ride it down into a lazy river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the last one. It was black and completely covered. Apparently, the inside is dark but at some points they allow light through small holes to give of the illusion of stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, I've made my decision.\" Miss Blanc spoke up. \"Sweet! Which one?\" Miss Blanc points. I looked up and I was pretty surprised but scared at her choice. Miss Blanc pointed at the black slide. Not wanting to give off the wrong impression, I nodded. \"Alrighty then. Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for us there wasn't much of a line. Which wasn't much of a surprise given that this slide had some crazy rumors about it. Apparently, an anthro was riding through it but never exited out. It's even been said that if you managed to reach a certain speed you'll get poofed into a different universe. Did I believe them? Not really. But... there still could be a chance that they are... After about 15 minutes of waiting it was our turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg?\" A familiar voice said. I looked up to see that it was a rather friendly looking Orca sitting on a stool next to the entrance of the slide. \"Hey Gertrude! Long time no see.\" \"Yeah it has been. How are you?\" She leaned in and propped her head up using an arm. \"I've been great. Especially since Miss Holmes gave me the week off.\" \"Miss Holmes? Are we talking about the same one?\" The Orca chuckles. \"I know it's crazy but it's true.\" \"Well good for you Greg. You deserve it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGertrude would then see that Greg was with another human, one that she's never met. \"Oh! And who's your friend here?\" \"Well... thing is...\" Greg started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[One explanation later...]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huuuuh!? Is it really you Miss Blanc!?\" Gertrude asked. \"Yep!\" Miss Blanc spun around to show Gertrude her form. \"How do I look?\" She asked. \"Um... Different?\" Gertrude said. \"Well yeah. Duh.\" Miss Blanc playfully chirped. \"But yeah. I'd like to go down this slide. It's my first time on any of them.\" \"Wow... what a choice.\" Gertrude said. \"<i>AHEM!</i>\" I cleared my throat to get Gertrude's attention. Once she looked my way, I made a cutting motion at my throat to signal \"<i>cut it out</i>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, you two have fun. I'll be stuck up here if you need me.\" The Orca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc looks to me and I look back. \"So. Who's going to go first?\" Miss Blanc asked.</span></div></div>",

That price being the chill of a mirror whose glass buckled under her behind\u2019s weight, her brown eyes locked tight with her luscious visage that sat just above the canyon of the planetary, jiggling orbs that compromised the immensity that was her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays like these were the ones made for days off. Clear weather, a burning sun, cool drinks and a nice bamboo cabana all to herself. Thus, any day under the Glass Tornado\u2019s glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, you motherfucker, break. Break...\u201d She grunted through a clenched jaw with an extra flex of pressure onto the bullet-grade glass. That damned fool Kelly had the gall to cay a mirror was \u2018indestructible\u2019 thinking it wouldn\u2019t last Point-blank against the zebra\u2019s monumental ass. Credit due, it was strong.

If three guys couldn\u2019t hold out under her most forgiving torment, a slab of glass wouldn\u2019t. Hoisting the frame, she pulled with all her might to induce as much pressure on the mirror that she could, a shaky huff of air slithering through her teeth both in euphoria as her ass\u2019 shape was compressed and satisfaction at the first little cracks as the mirror hit its breaking point. And then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror didn\u2019t so much \u201cbreak\u201d as spontaneously vanish just as powderized glass rained from the ceiling. Her held breath escaped in an full-on roar of pleasure as her ass sprung through the empty frame to freedom. Not a single laceration to bloody her precious stripes, either, so in victory she dislodged the frame from behind and snaked it through her thighs, showing the doomed product a last smile of gleeful sadism as she squeezed, hearing an agonized squeak from the metal framework as its skeleton was warped out of recognition between the magnitude of her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like three guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that the deed was truly done, Carly beamed and rose back up, ignoring those few seconds where the frame lingered between her legs before slipping loose. Another question to her dominance had been put down, and with order restored, Carly leaned out the cabana\u2019s window, able to relish in the soothing crashes of the waves hitting the shore, the merry sounds of happy beachgoers and the merry Air of summer and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK. <b><i>YOU</i></b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...which could\u2019ve been the nicest thing to come out of her mouth right then, considering the wave of bile in her stomach that yearned for escape. There at the board walk, a needle of skin amongst a haystack of fur, scales and feathers was her only one, her kind, young, handsome swooner with his neck bitten into by some sun-bleached floozy with a bad dye job, the two mingling at the salad bar where she was assembling her one monthly meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes blinked out of sync as her fat fingers splintered the bamboo windowsill, wet hacks of choked gibberish heaving from her lungs that her mind translated into the most sophisticated and poetic strings of vulgarities and cries for blood. The incorruptible had fallen to darkness. Her centerpoint for the universe was knocked askew. The crystalline lake that was her mind was polluted with a murky cloud of black oil, tainting her perchance to reason with blueprints for revenge and depravity. Anything as convoluted as death traps, petty as mere pranks or as soulless as physiological warfare bloomed and blossomed in her brain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but then she settled. Why not try a little poetic justice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, Greggy.\u201d She crooned, the anger mellowing out of her voice. Her fingers release, hands cupping under her chin as she watched the lovebirds find a table with a villainous glint. \u201cIf it\u2019s me or her, by the end of the day, I\u2019ll be sure you have a big, beautiful woman all to yourself...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Miss Blanc, what\u2019s it like to be a human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused from playing with the carb-less leaves of her salad in disinterest to see me, emitting a tiny laugh. \u201cYou need <i>me</i> to answer that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, yeah, I did.\u201d I answered. \u201cAnytime I ask an anthro what it\u2019s like to be one, they say they don\u2019t know, because they don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be a human, and can\u2019t tell the difference. So now that <i>you\u2019re</i> one, how does it feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc\u2019s smile fell, then she nodded at that sentiment. A few more seconds of silence followed as she stewed up an answer, her breathing a tad louder to feel the crisp, tropical-scented air in her lungs, her hand coursing over the skin on her other arm. Her palm turned over, arm extending with her digits opened so her eyes spearing through the double-vision of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlat.\u201d She described, enunciating that word with such full assurance. \u201cCompound eyes see a lot more of the world than you guys do, where it\u2019s kind of wall-eyed, but a lot more crisp and really colorful. When you\u2019ve got two eyes, it\u2019s a lot more like staring at some moving painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHearing\u2019s kind of the same way, too.\u201d She describes. \u201cWhen you hear the world through antennae, you can hear everything. Anything big, anything small, it can be as tiny as a bug landing on the window, and you can hear it like somebody\u2019s voice. It\u2019s not even that it makes a sound itself that you hear, it\u2019s like this...\u201d Her hands shuffled, much like I assumed her nerves were in trying to find the proper words. \u201c...motion. This movement in the air, some sort of presence that only you can feel and understand, that you know every little thing that goes on in the room. But now?\u201d \u201cNothing. Like this big switch in the universe has been turned off and there\u2019s a big part of reality that\u2019s just gone, and even if you don\u2019t particularly know what it is, you\u2019re always aware that something\u2019s missing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn.\u201d I snorted back. \u201cSo I really did get the shitty draw in the species raffle, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Her hand snapped around my own. \u201cDon\u2019t you <i>ever</i> say that about yourself, Gregory. Don\u2019t ever, <b><i>ever</i></b> say that again, okay?\u201d She demanded as stern as she\u2019d ever gotten at me. \u201cCompound eyes don\u2019t make a species better than those that lack them. Neither do wings, claws, or even magic. It\u2019s that those species had the courage to live in a world that sought out to kill them, living in spite of all those that were left extinct to time or couldn\u2019t even survive past the void to exist. It\u2019s that in a world millions of years in the making, kinds like ours fought and survived to live in the age where they can shape the future of the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stunned silence she\u2019d left me in allowed her to continue. \u201cBesides, when you live in a body where you can see absolutely everything, and can hear every footstep outside your door, <i>every</i> heartbeat, and <i><b>every</b></i> grain of dust hitting the desk,\u201d With the edge in her voice softening, she learns to smile again, a tense breath staying in her lungs allowed to leave. \u201cYou learn to find beauty in the world through a mortal\u2019s eyes. I\u2019m proud to be a moth, and I don\u2019t want to be buried in any other kind of body, but sometimes it helps the soul to shed your powers, just to feel a little trust in the world and let its waves guide you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swear, even when I wasn\u2019t asking, Miss Blanc could never say the wrong thing. Steeping in that mindset, I cupped my hands over hers, smiling right from the heart. \u201dThank you, Miss Blanc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime, Greg.\u201d She answers, winking. \u201cThe world teaches a lot when you\u2019ve lived a few centuries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Greg has to use the bathroom, and ends up leaving Miss Blanc for just too long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Before their date can continue, an angry set of hoof-falls can be heard approaching their hut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo, this is your idea of <i>not</i> sitting around all day, playing video games?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019d seem that regardless of whether they were human or compound, Miss Blanc\u2019s eyes were always drawn to the flame of a video game screen, and no place in the resort gave her quite as much eye candy as the Rainbow Dome\u2019s arcade, a place for anthros who thought it \u2018to real\u2019 to live in a world where they could bathe in hot tubs filled with champagne. Even the rarest arcade cabinets in the world were but the entrance to the very corners of the gaming world that the dome explored; the screams of anthros fighting hordes of zombies or face-ovulating aliens in the virtual world were mixed with glorious electro-synth music booming from the speakers, the glowing floors pumping to the beat amongst the colorful light shining off of gaming venues that descended from countries where there apparently lay circles in wizardry for gaming, where immersion existed far beyond the limits of a game controller, or even even VR helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefinitely not my first visit, having worked many a shift selling tickets, but for Miss Blanc, who\u2019d finally promoted me from being carried around like a baby to holding me by the crux of her elbows, arms hooked underneath my armpits, her look from just standing at the entrance to the dome was that of a pure soul basking in the light of heaven\u2019s gateway shining onto them through the darkness of purgatory, her mind opened too wide to contain the will to move forward, focusing instead on standing around whilst rocking around on the balls of her feet with a jubilant smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong deprived of contact between the floor and my feet, I snapped my fingers in front of her face, yet her eyelids barely flinched. \u201cWanna go in while we still have four days left of you like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes turned downward, lips closing into a smirk. \u201cCan\u2019t. This form\u2019s brain is too primitive right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, ha ha.\u201d I dryly remarked, but Miss Blanc only chuckled lightly before setting me back down, ruffling my hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ve got all the intel, where do we start?\u201d She asked eagerly. \u201cWhat\u2019re the best games? The rarest? The craziest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019ll follow me, I\u2019ve got the best source in the arcade.\u201d I offered, beckoning her as I turned to the doorway. \u201cNo lines, no costs, not even other customers to share it with!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d She said in half doubt, half amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took her by the wrist, gently taking her in with me. \u201cCome on in, and try not to give into any temptations. Alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us traversed past the entrance, and Miss Blanc\u2019s head was mechanically pulled left and right by the screens that surrounded us, so high-definition that moving about what little space existed between the machines and their bloated players was akin to wandering about some non-dimensional plane decorated with portals to the infinite realms in the multiverse, her non-occupied hand occasionally reaching out at the various controllers and buttons that were near enough to tempt her away, but being immunized to the dome\u2019s hypnotic contents enabled me to coax her away from getting to close, having to constantly juggle between searching ahead for our intel and looking back to make sure she wasn\u2019t going to rip a controller from somebody\u2019s mitts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll a task that was working its mental scars by the time we\u2019d reached the furthest end of the dome, but relief came at a certain bloated, scaly rear hunched over the access panel to a downed gaming station, its owner\u2019s fat frame crammed inside of the machine\u2019s innards. \u201cYo, Yazuki, it\u2019s Gregory! Can you hear me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled \u2018Gregory?\u2019 Came after, and she pulled her scaly fat rolls free from the access hatch, dusting off her shirt. \u201cOh! Hello, Gregory, what\u2019s up?\u201d She asked, then noticed I had company. \u201c...and who\u2019s this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Miss Blanc. \u201cThis something we\u2019ve got to keep a secret, or...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I\u2019d tell her.\u201d She answered. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want her to think there were <i>two</i> guests who can beat her record in Pac-Man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Blanc?!\u201d Yazuki jolted back, to Miss Blanc\u2019s mischievous delight. \u201cBut why, and how did...oh, the word \u2018how\u2019 never existed to you, did it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, can\u2019t say it ever did.\u201d She answered, then yanked me back up, hugging me close. \u201cBut as for the \u2018why,\u2019 let\u2019s just say me and Greg decided we should really get on the same ground for once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame ground? What do you...\u201d Yazuki tilted her head away slightly, lips quietly narrating her train of thought, then her entire body blushed pink in adoration, her large eyes glittering. \u201cAw, you guys are on a <i>date?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc nodded, squishing our faces together so we were cheek to cheek. I merely rolled my eyes, grinning. \u201cTotal equals,\u201d I echoed dryly. \u201cBut listen, Yazuki, we\u2019re really sorry to show up and have our day off while your on the shift, but I was wondering if you\u2019d let us in on any imports you\u2019d have. Got anything new?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImports?\u201d Miss Blanc asked openly, setting me back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYazuki\u2019s scales merged from pink to an excited yellow, the experience of her import closet on an innocent mind always a delight for her to witness. \u201cCome on, follow me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Miss Blanc and I stood crammed in the hidden elevator with Yazuki, I could see the anticipation in her eyes dying in tandem with the techno beat that was fading from above us, looking about the bland, white walls for any sort of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, what goes on down here is light years beyond anything up there.\u201d I insisted, noticing the that childish light in Miss Blanc\u2019s eyes die down. \u201cNo lines, wait times, and you see things down there that not even Miss Holmes has access to yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Thing,</i> sadly.\u201d Yazuki emphasized. \u201cI\u2019d only gotten one item for my first shipment of the season, but if it\u2019s any compensation, and if my research is correct, what we\u2019ve got here is a <i>holy grail.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as somebody who\u2019s seen her fair share of holy grails over the century, I\u2019ll be the judge of that.\u201d Miss Blanc insisted, folding her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator rattled to a stop, and the doors parted open to darkness, Yazuki slipping out to switch the lights on for a cold, concrete room lit by fluorescent lights along the ceiling, its wall containing nothing but air stale with the scent of dust, but against the wall across from us sat a single, yet bulky machine, another switch on the wall activated by Yazuki turning on the screen to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: A VR Post-Apocalyptic racing game, a la Mad Max?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Some funky import that\u2019s not in English! (Losing injects you with a fattening serum?!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Some dusty relic of a game, occasionally sparking with green lightning? (A game with some kind of eldritch, unknown power to it, only now to be known?)</span></div></div>",

I could barely hear Yazuki's stammered apologies over my ringing ears as she hurriedly adjusted the volume to something more bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYazuki helped us up, her colors shifting around from green to blue in concern. \"Whoops, forgot about those new speakers...sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's one heckuva first impression,\" Miss Blanc quipped. \"But what sort of game is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced, still feeling my ears ring. \"Not a deafness simulator, I hope....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's not that--<i>Deaf Sim 2020</i> hasn't shipped yet. This beauty is <i>Helldrivers: Wasteland Champions</i>!\" Yazuki slid beside the machine, grinning. \"It's a full-immersion VR racing game in a post-apocalypse--you feel like you're really there, tearing up the track in a car cobbled together from junk! Anything goes, the cars are armed to the teeth with guns and bombs, the drivers are all insane--you never know what's gonna happen next!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnscreen, a sports car decked out with spikes and skulls stylishly drifted around a desert canyon, leading a pack of racers....until it was blown to bits by a rocket fired from offscreen, the driver's flaming body thrown from the wreck. He was then splattered by a semi truck on tank tracks--that was also on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc was grinning like a loon. Hopping from one foot to another, she looked ready to jump into the game right then and there. But the gruesome fate of the driver made me hesitate--at Gaia 2.0, where the few human staff were fair game to eat, crush, or enslave; danger was everywhere. \"Is it...safe to play?\" I asked. \"We won't get shocked by our VR sets or something, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Marc, live a little!\" Miss Blanc interjected. \"I know the developers--they wouldn't make a game that's dangerous to the player. We're safe...though the VR is pretty realistic, so it'll get scary if you get blown up.\" Before I could disagree, she hopped into one of the car-shaped cabins and strapped on the VR headset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYazuki applauded, smiling. \"That's the spirit! And I have to say, Miss Blanc looks...really pretty as a human. Anyway, how do you two want to play? You can race against each other in separately cars, or cooperate in one vehicle--one drives, the other is a gunner and mans the weapons. You can switch out at any time, so no need to argue over who does what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Miss Blanc eagerly await in the cabin, hands clutching the steering wheel and ready to race, my hesitation vanished. We were here to have fun, so that's what we'd do!</span></div></div>",

A smile ran along those catty lips of hers as my eyes were bewitched by those orbs of fine sapphire that sat in her sockets, but without the wide span of face in between that kept me from seeing into both at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer throat rang with a melodious chuckle, then she dipped me down so she could plop me back on my feet, taking a few steps backward so she could pose with a confident flare of her arms and wings. \u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a much less heavy and flab-weighted variation of Miss Blanc\u2019s that came from the <i>imitation\u2019s</i> lips. It was those black and white-spotted wings of hers at that flanked the simulacrum of my aged, mysterious friend, and those same eyes of azure that shimmered like orbs of glass, but the mountainous protrusion of insectoid lard that once substituted her stomach no longer sprawled the floor of her room, just a flat strip of blue and orange fur with no paunch tp addle her abs, those breasts that lived so enormous and round to her old age took a much more modest shape, feminine but mostly sized by the white fluff that encompassed her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervous, I slighted the space separating us, but that first movement enabled me to approach her and take her right arm, the moth not smacking me away when I tested the smooth, ebony-black limb with a gentle pinch before lifting and letting it drop, light as a feather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Blanc...?\u201d I journeyed my hand back from down her bicep to her clawed hand, and observing her flat stomach, I silently asked permission with a look in her eyes, and she permitted with an amused nod. Grazing my fingertips over her abdomen first, I then allowed my palm to contact her toned abs, feeling all the evidence I needed that this wasn\u2019t some form of illusion. \u201cDid you lose all your weight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I was flung back on my ass in surprise and sheer force as her stomach rocketed back out in size, hundreds of pounds exploding off of her abdomen with the force of a runaway train. Miss Blanc howled with laughter, form quivering at a size that, while still outclassed out of existence by her old weight, to her scale looked like five or six hundred pounds of lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve displaced it.\u201d She insisted as the last fits of laughter exited her voice. Setting her hands over her reformed stomach, she gave a squeeze that shrunk it back down, forcing its mass through her ass and breasts, giving herself a more hourglassed figure, \u201cit\u2019s a spell that allows me to store my bodily mass into the ether, so as long as it weighs less than I do at my true size...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sentence paused as she took my hands And cupped them together, her right leg kicking up to launch her into a flip that landed her in my palms with a grayish blue, Tiny and round like a basketball. \u201cI can have any body shape you want! Be it as small...\u201d With a wiggle she popped free of my grasp, but her hitting the ground saw me launching dozens of feet in he air, caught in her own hands as she grew to hit the ceiling, slim once again. \u201c...or as big as you\u2019d need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted size the fifth time in a minute, swapping back to her slimmed form. I was dropped on my feet, but her little butchering of reality nearly had me crashing right back down all over again, and she shot her arm out to catch me by the shoulder. If I needed her just to keep myself standing, it was impossible to speak with the mess of questions that were in my brain, to her, myself or the writers of the laws of reality, but there was, however, a certain word of hers that caught my attention...\u201d \u201c\u2018you?\u2019 Any body shape <i>I</i> want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs skinny, fat, tall or short you want, I\u2019m all game...\u201d She offered with a beaming smile...a smile that she suddenly let fall, face going quite serious. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re sure to be in this room by two days, alright? The spell takes a ton of magic to do, so we\u2019ve got to make sure it wears off someplace I\u2019m okay staying for a long, <i>long</i> time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuuuuut enough of future things, the only time that matters is now.\u201d Her smile flashed right back. \u201cSo, anything particularly tempting, right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory wants her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: ...to remain slim.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took you longer than you thought it would for you to formulate your answer to Miss Blanc; she asked you what body shape would be the most 'tempting,' the most seductive, enticing, provocative. She was asking you what your fetish was; however, there was an obstacle that prevented you from giving the moth your answer - you didn't know. You never were very explorative of what exactly you had obsessions over; you knew you had them, but work, before and during Gaia 2.0, had always kept you focused elsewhere. But now you had the week off, and your little 'fixations' can shine, and as you pictured various images of what the three-hundred-year-old moth can look like, one caught you by surprise. The preferred body shape of your friend's body that sent your hormone glands into production was...how she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...oh God, this is going to sound stupid, but...\" Miss Blanc's smile seemed to grow larger as she watched a deep blush rose to your cheeks, giggling as you tried to think of the right way for the words to come out of your mouth. \"Do you mind if you grow to a smaller version of what you looked like before you did your spell?\" The moth opened her mouth a little bit in surprise, but her grin didn't dissolve. That wasn't something she was expecting you to say; if anything, she figured you might want her around the same size as you were. But who was she to deny your request, especially when you struggled to meet her eyes as you fumbled with your hands in that oh-so-adorable way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Gregory. I suppose after spending all this time at Gaia that you've developed an affinity for the soft stuff, no?\" Miss Blanc playfully teased, already beginning her transformation, taking the time to do it slowly with it so she could witness your growing flusteredness. Her toned-muscled abdomen dissolved into a gelatinous sphere of fuzzy lard, bouncing with the consistency as her bosom grew to rest on it's top. \"Or is it that you're more comfortable with me when I'm a big fat bug that can pick you off your feet with ease?\" Then the blubber-laden moth started growing upwards as well as outwards, her slightly smug grin on her puffed-up face looking down at you as your heartbeat quickened. She rose to more than twice your height at an impressive 14 feet and 3 inches; from hip to hip, she was ten feet wide, but almost twelve from the furthest edge of her buttocks to the front of her looming stomach. Her weight settled to no less than fifteen tons, her many, many thousand pounds of insectoid adipose packed on a frame that could carry it all with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...a little bit of both, maybe? It's hard to think of you without a bit of 'meat,' and...yeah, I guess you could say that I like soft things.\" You smiled, more red blood coming to your face, making you look like a tomato to the massive insect you were failing to make eye contact with. Before speaking further, you clenched your fists and bit your lower lip, trying to squeeze the awkwardness out of you. \"I guess I'm weird like that, always have been. I just like soft things. There, uh, cozy and relaxing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to relax on a fat girl?\" Miss Blanc smiled teasingly. On instinct, you swallowed a wad of saliva that was collecting in your mouth down the wrong tube, and the next five seconds were spent trying to cough it back up, your body shivering with embarrassment the whole time. You looked up at the gigantic blob of a moth, giggling at the scene, making her whole body slosh and quiver. Despite the shame you were feeling from humiliating yourself like that, you couldn't help but laugh with her; it was infectious. \"That tells me more about you then what you just said.\" Taking you by surprise, she bent down as two chitinous arms shot out to grab your sides; before you knew what was happening, you were already off the ground. Her fingers interlocked behind your back as she gently pulled you into her fatty torso, your head reaching to where her massive breasts met her stomach as the rest of you sank into an ocean of warm, fuzzy lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly little human, you don't need to be so embarrassed about your wants; although it is fun to see you act like a clown when you are.~\" She hummed as she held you against her stomach. The sound of her heartbeat reverberating slightly through her flab, which you had to admit, was sort of soothing. \"Now, for our first date, I think I know the perfect place for us to go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd where was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The Diamond Mines. Miss Blanc's newly mobile body won't stay for long, but that doesn't mean that clothes aren't a priority! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Limestone Ridge. Hiking and golf aren't things you thought Miss Blanc would be into, but you can't say that you know much about her other than she likes video games and practices magic. Hiking and golf can now be added to the list of things you know Miss Blanc enjoys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: The Opticuluum. A trip to Gaia 2.0's movie theater? As long as it's not another Jack Splatt film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Fate's Hand Casino. Years and years of playing video games have made her want to try some more traditional forms of entertainment, and playing cards have been around forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 5:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKKpP9Ooc9U\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKKpP9Oo...</a><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not that they ever did, or had they <i>always</i> been answering? When humans prayed and groveled for the mercy of the heavens above, what was it that they sent down? Those scarce lucky days of freedom spent without being squashed by an anthro in mercy? Those many days of getting squashed in spite?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo muscular flippers sworn to the penguin kingdom\u2019s royal guard acted as mammalian vises around Jack Splat\u2019s wrists. The blood sank from his arms as each were held high over his head, three feet of air between his feet and the ground that robbed him the dignity of walking himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it were some fatassed hippo, or cow or whatever with him at their disposal, it would be but the course of nature. A painful, sadistic cycle from which there was no escape but his mind\u2019s purchase for insanity, but it was a pattern, pathways that he could at least chart for and embrace. The iceberg\u2019s best men, however, were neither fatassed or sadistic, too muscled to fight against with faces forged to masks of resilience that saw no allowance past the needs of the mission. Their free will matched only the brain of their kingdoms, thousands of minds whose dispositions shifted like liquid to the shape of time and change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow pelted the guards and their prisoner in loose balls of white, wandering into a mistress fog that only murky shapes could be seen for a dozen feet. Just another bag over his head to let him writhe in the mystery, alone to a grim fate that completely eluded him, his surely last moments staring ahead into a white oblivion with nothing to scrutinize at, nothing to prepare for, nothing to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO, <i>GOD!!!</i>\u201d He wailed. \u201cOH, <i><b>JESUS CHRIST!!!</b></i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree foggy shadows appeared, three pillars aligned at a chasm that gave way to the uncaring crashes of the sea. The center one moved, a penguin minister reading a few runes between two wooden posts with human-sized shackles chained to their ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne guard took the other arm, the second penguin marching over to his new bindings. At arm\u2019s length, the frantic kicking of your legs didn\u2019t even get a glance at his captor as he was chained to the very end of the island, the ocean infinitely deep and wide beyond the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon letting him go, the guards watched him struggle to slip from his chains, the ten seconds of him struggling to no avail satisfying them. With a nod to the minister, the elder penguin flipped through his book, tracing the line with his finger as his aged voice narrated its words. An ancient text encrypted with syllables that defied human alphabet, vibrating over the roar of the blizzard and to the very reaches of the sea, resonating to the depths of the icy waters below...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the ocean exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the surface. Not in a geyser of foam and water that erupted from beyond. The entire ocean disintegrated and flew hundreds of feet above in a deafening shower of droplets, the are dropping some several dozen degrees from the water reemerging from deep below. The facade from both the minister and his cohorts vanished, running of so as to avoid joining Jack Splat in his sacrifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the epicenter of the blast came the magnificent hull of a creature forged by flesh and metal, welded together by the piercing fires of hell\u2019s deepest pits. Its body the hull of a monolithic ship with white cabins and four smokestacks shooting up from its spine, their gouts of ashen smoke alit with an orange glow from its burning heart. Through metal rusted at the bottom of the sea for centuries came streamlined fins attached by crudely woven tendrils of bloodied flesh and muscle, the very nose to the godly vessel shorn off so the visage of the ocean\u2019s mightiest carnivore could commandeer the ship instead, beams of red puncturing through the eyes, nostrils, and soon mouth as the shark\u2019s head bore open its maw and emitted a roar forged by the screams of the damned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loudest scream Jack Splat could make became but a drop of red dye diluted by the tsunami of sound, stood at the outmost point of the iceberg, the very point of impact of the abomination\u2019s second tussle with death at the collision of ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, not its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swell of music, the thumping of mighty drums. Jack Splat\u2019s face stayed locked in a death mask of fear and despair as the unearthed titan soared in an arc ending right on his own perch, rows and rows of teeth bared to ensure it wouldn\u2019t be the shock that killed him. The Earth rattled, the air shook, Jack Splat\u2019s eyes wrenched shut milliseconds before plunging into his gate way to oblivion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen black. And, with a stinging riff of heavy metal,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>JACK SPLAT 37: RISE OF SHARK-TANIC</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd everybody in the theater passes the litmus test of stupidity with flying colors, breaking out in the kind of non-ironic applause reserved for a fine work of art. Some even shoot an offended glare at the one soul to see the movie for what it is and guffaw in her seat, Miss Blanc\u2019s contagious laughter violently wobbling your perch against her cleavage about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc reclines, the many, many tonnes of adipose around her legs squeezed inward by the arms of her chair, spilling black leg fat against the tubs of nachos and popcorn that fill a seat at either side of her. Rolling against her back a little, a faint pop is heard that allows her to let a relaxed stream of air our through her lips. \u201cHeavens above, when you spend so much time sitting around, you can\u2019t imagine how great it feels to lay down a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Which is probably the fattest thing I\u2019d ever hear somebody say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hush.\u201d She scolds, but scoops a paw through her popcorn bin and holds it temptingly at your side. After watching you take some yourself, she shovels the entire salty, oily handful into her chops and chases it down with her drink, a fizzy concoction containing enough citric acid to dissolve a corpse. It evens no matter where she is, in her own bedroom or out in public, there isn\u2019t a word to describe Miss Blan but \u2018comfy,\u2019 always so content with life and the world as long as she has a nice, warm blanket and soft seat to melt into, the cat-like curl of her lips giving her what an air that she was always in total nirvana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Comfy\u2019 a word to describe her in more ways than one, as in both her cool, relaxed state of life...and how she felt. Once again she\u2019s completely unopposed to a human sitting between her breasts, her fluffy exterior, flowery scent, and the warm, supple titfat that conformed and blanketing your body with the tenderness of a mother\u2019s touch, putting you in as subdued a mood as your friend is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also helped that apparently she could read minds, as much like her perchance for advice, Miss Blanc\u2019s paw delicately clamped over your chest so her thumb could prod around your spine, graceful as a massage but firm like acupuncture in a way that untwists the stress and tension of the job. A dopey grin invades your face as you nestle yourself a bit deeper against the fatty floor, pulling up a few tufts of fur around yourself as a sort of crude blanket, and her body once again quakes as she titters lovingly at your descent into tranquility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc was right about many things, reading your need for her old size as a love for the soft things in life, or bodies more round and full as opposed to thin and starved. But the one thing she hadn\u2019t touched, as well as you hadn\u2019t come to think of it, was the one thing that meant the most to a human in the world. While anthros being friends weren\u2019t uncommon, just rare amongst the sit-hungry majority, sometimes the friends lacked the appetite or ego of all gluttons of the world, instead satisfied with shorter statures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Miss Blanc, possessing that lovely size, shape, and compassion all at once, she could make you feel what meant so much to a human in a giant world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafe in a world of frequent, guaranteed death, satisfied with a life that could pass by without your control.  Even if you knew life would presume as normal in a few days, they would be spent feeling protected. Not that a date with Miss Blanc was ever an immediate revulsion to you before, and the way she\u2019d passed the request came off more as an outing offer than a declaration of love, but thinking back on her, back on her smile, skill, even the day she\u2019d sat on you for calling magic \u2018gay science...\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it possible? <i>Did</i> you love her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a look back for some form of guidance, but Miss Blanc was too engrossed in the movie, with Jack Splat and Shark-tanic sharing the screen. Jack just stands before the hellish leviathan, an easily movable object in front of an unstoppable force that is nonetheless paused before the human, two beings existing not as \u2018god\u2019 and \u2018man,\u2019 but two beings sharing the same plane of existence, sharing neither contempt or need for the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHungry for communication, Jack Splat opens a hand before Shark-tanic\u2019s snout, inviting him in without stepping any boundaries, but Shark-tariff still leans in, pulling the two in conversation absent of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc watches this all with her full attention, but her sight is interrupted by a human hand popping up in front of her face, palm similarly open. This glowing, foggy pupils in her azure eyes crosses on you, ate your smile and offer for companion ship...and her body gives another bounce with a single titter coming out of her, eyes shutting and smile widening as, leaning her head in, she nuzzles the center of her face into your palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Marc confesses his feelings to Mis Blanc, and big moffy cuddling ensues. :3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Miss Blanc can sense his feelings on her own, and invites a few more tons of fat onto herself for him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Some asshole behind them starts talking in the movie, and Miss Blanc deals swift justice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You suddenly found it very hard to breathe as Miss Blanc butts her head into your tiny hand, the world around you fading away while time slowed to a standstill. The monumentally fat moth let out a soft purr, or the insectoid variant of one, her lips parting ever so slightly for a soft exhale to roll out across your body encased in the valley of her cleavage. \"The answer is yes, by the way.\" She opened her eyes a little, not all the way, the smile on her face growing outward against her puffy cheeks as she spoke. You involuntarily tilted your head in confusion to her remark, prompting another giggle to come from her lungs. \"You're wondering to yourself if you have feelings for me. And I'm answering your question. Yes, you do.\" That was all the warning you had before she pressed her head further into your palm, not stopping until the back of your hand was against your face, and as you lowered it to the top of her left breast, you were given your first kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour entire body stiffened up in surprise to the action, but the moment only lasted for about a second, and then you melted into paradise and returned the kiss, bringing your arms to Miss Blanc's puffed cheeks in a sort of embrace. It was a bit of a surreal experience, being kissed by someone big enough to fit you in between their chest with ease. Admittedly, it was a clumsy experience, but as time went on, you and she came into an instinctual pattern. It wasn't perfect, but that wasn't stopping your brain from being flooded with dopamine and oxytocin, rewarding you for finding someone you could realistically spend the rest of your life with. Even though now you were having an even harder time breathing, and your mind was hazy with pleasure, you knew she was right: you loved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie went on in the background, but it was given no focus from you or Miss Blanc, totally lost in each other. However, they were conscience enough to keep themselves quiet while they proclaimed their feelings for each other because even though they weren't watching the movie, that was no excuse to ruin it for the others. The kiss ended after what felt like hours, but it still seemed too short. You were mentally cursing yourself for not having seen before what you were seeing in the moth now. You were silent after that, content to close your eyes and listen to the dull noise of the movie behind you, her heartbeat, and her breath washing over your form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long...\" The silence was broken some minutes later, you finally coming down from your euphoria enough to formulate a sentence. The moth opened her left eye lazily, patiently waiting for you to finish your question while her smile never wavered. \"How long have you thought about me like that?\" The 'that' was a reference to the kiss that had changed your life twenty times over in half a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since the day I first met you.\" Miss Blanc opened her right eye before grabbing another fistful of popcorn with enough butter and salt to send a family of five into the hospital for separate heart attacks. \"I mean, there have been other servants at Gaia like you who I thought was cute, but you stood out. I can't even remember what I called you into my room for the first time for, but I remember how...different you were. You weren't trying to be 'professional,' but whatever it was I had you do, you were confident and intelligent in doing it, like it was a field of science you were an expert in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes while a blush rose to your cheeks. \"I was fishing for your remote controller after you threw it against the wall, and it got stuck in your butt.\" Miss Blanc mirrored your blush as the memories came flooding back. \"We both agreed it must have ricocheted because the dent in the wall where you threw it was above your stomach, so I spent around an hour trying to find it in a place where it wasn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...I remember now...\" Miss Blanc giggled to herself. \"Great belly massage, though. But it was more than that, it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you MEAN you can't find it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc stopped when she heard an obnoxiously pompous voice coming from somewhere behind her. She shrugged and continued. \"...it was how open you were and how easy it was for me to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were we even talking about?\" You asked, still blushing. \"I think we started with the level in the game you got upset over, and then we moved on to the game itself, and somehow at the end, we were in a competition to list off all the micronations we knew existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, thank you for reminding my victory over that.\" Miss Blanc smirked. \"But another thing about you is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if you don't locate that office key as soon as possible, then I'm screwed. You know he only keeps one key for security reasons, so you should've kept better track of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc was cut off again, this time the source of the yelling made itself apparent as a Doberman was walking up the aisle behind them, taking the seat behind the moth while his phone was clamped to his ear. She shook her head and continued. \"I noticed that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would it be in the janitor's closet? Use your head, you fool! If you used it more often, we wouldn't be in this mess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others in the theater were now shifting their attention to the dog behind the moth. Miss Blanc waited for a moment before trying to talk again. \"I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, NO! I don't want any excuses. If you - yeah, tell that to the boss. I'm sure he'll understand. No, you idiot. I was being-\" The Doberman grunted and unclamped his phone from his ear to address Miss Blanc. \"Hey, lady, can you move over? I can't see the movie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moth took a deep breath, trying to keep her composure. She pretended not to notice him and -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! My best suit is in there. I need that suit before this evening. I want to- Hey, hey blob. I said, MOVE! ... No, no, no, why are you looking in the bathroom for it? ... Oh no, if it got flushed down the toilet, I'm so getting demoted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole movie theater collectively wanted to plunge the sun into the earth if it meant the Doberman would shut up, including you. Miss Blanch, however, tried to soothe the anger she was feeling from you. \"Ignore him, sweetie. It's just us here, no one el-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check the lockers. The LOCKERS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... no one else-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's not there either? ... Wait, say that again? What? I can't hear you; you're breaking up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I have an idea.\" Miss Blanc's peaceful smile dissolved at the last of her nerves was frayed away. There were no more attempts to get a word in after that\u2014only silence. But you and her communicated on a non-verbal level, nodding in agreement to the plan that was being made. Miss Blanc simply stepped up from her seat, signaling to the Doberman that his incessant complaining has worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, about time...\" the doberman grumbled, turning his attention back to his phone as he started to step forward. \"Hey, hello, you still there? HELLO? ... Great, call dropped. What the hell is wrong with this-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was his turn to get cut off as about six thousand pounds of insectoid blubber appeared on the moth's suddenly 18 feet tall frame while she let herself fall back into her now too-small seat. The reinforced plastic and steel that struggled to keep Miss Blanc off the floor before warped and broke under her weight. The moth's rump spilled over the remains of the chair's back support rapidly as the Doberman began to drown under two walls of fur and fat. He lost grip on his phone, which went tumbling to the floor, where it starts ringing. After a much irritated exhale, the moth resumed from where she was interrupted, though her face was still menacing. \"I noticed that you, much like me, have limits to their patience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after spending around two hours trying to find a 'needle' in a moth that size of my childhood house, I was a little aggravated.\" You shrugged. \"I mean, I was a bit scared I would never find it. Miss Holmes does not have a high tolerance for failure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were ignorant of the applause that was occurring around them, thanks to Miss Blanc's valiant efforts. Miss Blanc nodded understandingly. \"So...lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You asked. \"But what about the movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, I don't know. From what I've seen so far, this is just a re-tread of Jack Splatt 18 - Dawn Of The Succubus' Revenge.\" Miss Black nodded. \"But first, I think we should be good citizens and help escort the noisemaker out of the theater.\" She smiled slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Someone overhears Miss Blanc's comment about the movie. And they take it very, very personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: For Lunch, A Trip To The White Brimstone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: For Lunch, A Trip To The Diamond Mines</span></div></div>",

Seeing her reel in its effects, I needled out of her cleavage and up to her face, stroking her forehead in comfort till the last little grunts of pain slipped out of her, her features relaxing so her eyes could flutter open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...eyes that refracted a deep brown, as opposed to their usual sapphire blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Blanc?\u201d I repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill recovering, her eyes focused act and forth between the back wall, the air in front of her face, and everything in between before settling on me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then her eyelids slackened in a sultry gaze before a coy grin appeared along her jawline, licking her lips before she snatched my shoulders in her claws and yanked me in, forcing the knowledge of what moth spit tasted like on me. I shrieked into her mouth, arms instinctually flapping about to smack and/or push away at her in an attempt to get some air, but relief only came when she pulled me away, then held me against the center of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, whatever dream this is,\u201d she decreed, \u201cI can\u2019t say it\u2019s a nightmare as long as you\u2019re here, my little Greggy we-\u201d <b><i>grwwwwwl...</i></b> \u201c...ugggggggh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with random yet thankful timing that the full reality that her body entailed had struck Miss Blanc, her decades and decades of accustoming to the gradual increase to hundreds of tons in bodily mass seceding from her demeanor. She sickly clutched at her mountainous stomach as it growled its usual symphony of bodily functions, wrenching about in panic as her immobilizing proportions kept her bonded to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-My body...what\u2019s happened to me?!\u201d she barked in fear, \u201cMy...My voice! What happened to my...\u201d but she went cross-eyed at the center of her face, fearfully pawing at the empty, flat skin above her lips. \u201cMy Nose! <i>What the fuck happened to my face?!</i>\u201d Her hands continued feeling around her head\u2019s shape till they met her antennae, her hair, then traversed back down at the mountainous curves of her immobilized form, till she was only able to scream on repeat \u201cWhat? <i>What? <b>What?! WHAT?!</b></i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer little hamboning episode opened a large window for me to shove myself backwards in a very bouncy trip down her belly, springing off her mattress and gracelessly hitting the floor face-first, abandoning her for the door and pulling it aside at a torturously slow pace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then I leapt out of the frying pan and right into the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly thin ribbons of light from the corridor could make it past the figure waiting at the door, my face level and in kissing distance with a deep, fatty naval, the striped fur of its shapely surface billowing from its clothing like a Jell-O-filled weather balloon hastily stashed in a ill-fitted black tank top. Miss Blanc also went mute as a particularly smug looking Carly Sorvitz invited herself into our room, inviting with her the plateau of enormous, jiggling adipose hanging off her backside, wafting with air invited by the window crudely scissored into the butt of her tight pants. My own self crumpled to the floor, scurrying away from her like a cornered spider...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and the tense lack of getting chased, trampled and squished by Carly Sorvitz followed. She even waylaid blowing me a kiss, more interested in observing me with mere curiosity, leaning forward so her stomach\u2019s exposed face could smooch the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Carly asked, \u201cHow do you think she suits me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question lit the tinder. Miss Blanc\u2019s crazed behavior? The softer tone in Carly\u2019s dialect? The fact that Carly\u2019s eyes were now blue? They belonged to... \u201cOoooooooh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc winked Carly\u2019s eye at me. \u201cSorry I had to choose <i>her,</i> Just a matter of short notice. Anyways,\u201d She opened a hand for me to take. \u201cshall we be off, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Be off?\u2019 What do mean \u2018be off?\u2019\u201d Carly mimicked, but her fur and antennae frizzled up with realization. \u201cWait a minute! You guys\u2019re Just leaving me here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, you behave while we\u2019re gone, Carly, and we\u2019ll be back in a week.\u201d Miss Blanc answered as she got me back on my feet, only to take me from the floor instead and scoop me up under the armpits, making an effort of showing Carly to me as all doubt was robbed from her that we had every intent of trapping her here. \u201cYou get hungry, there\u2019s some snacks under my...sorry, <i>your</i> tits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking a few times at the confirmation, she wrenched around to free herself, anything short of rolling off the bed, but the weight of Miss Blanc\u2019s body kept her legs fused in place. Reaching for the phone at the nightstand gave her fingers contact with a transparent force field, blocking her only means of calling for help. \u201cY-You can\u2019t do this! Please, don\u2019t leave me here!\u201d She begged, \u201cGregory, please, I...you\u2019re my boyfriend! <i>I love you! <b>Please don\u2019t leave me!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy guilt was probably palpable enough that Miss Blanc noticed, if her watching me with intent was if she was waiting as I genuinely pondered letting Carly go. Yes, <i>Carly,</i> but it wasn\u2019t like leaving her trapped alone in a hotel room for a week with no way of leaving was going to make her any less of an absolute monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I though back on the shit she pulled with the K-shrink and probably saved my own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuh-bye, Carly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>WAIT!!!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Carly was only screaming at her former backside until we were out the door, locking it behind us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Eh. Sure, Carly\u2019ll be alright.</i> I thought to the last eight brain cells working to keep me from abandoning her. <i>Yeah. Yeah, totally! She\u2019s trapped in a five-star with all kinds of food, all the tv and games she can play, a ton of books, and all kinds of potions, and...Miss Blanc\u2019s spell books...Shit. <b>SHIT!!!</b></i> \u201cCarly can\u2019t learn your magic, can she?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout as much as you could, given six...maybe <i>seven</i> decades of mental training. At most.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...you seriously think I could learn magic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018At most\u2019 being \u2018hell no.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That's not Oscillate!\" Toronto said into the staff ear piece across the system, I could see security make they're way to the stage discretely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I bet none of you even care.\" The figure spoke in a digitally distorted voice pointing the rifle into the crowd \"None of you care that this is going on! You're too busy stuffing your faces, and living in corpulence! Well I've come up here to bring you pigs back to earth with the rest of us! Where the real hand of fate is quite apparent.\" They shot off they're rifle into the ceiling and the crowd ran for the doors only to be stopped by another shot near one \"NOBODY LEAVES!!!\" They screamed \"You live up here in Shangri la! BUT DO YOU DESERVE IT!?\" They screamed as they shot a slot machine<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T THINK SO!!!\" hit a button on the stage, normally meant for performers, as it put a light on Oscillate, she was tied to a support beam with her mouth gagged, the figure walked towards her \"Pretty isn't she? Now watch! Watch as I strip the beauty from your \"heavenly forms\"!\" The person said sarcastically taking out a ray gun that fit in  they're hand while keeping the plasma rifle in they're other hand trained on the guards, The figure put the gun to Oscillate's head and she winced in fear as the Figure charged the gun, it shot a fast beam into Oscillate's neck, she flinched as the gun lost it's glow the figure looked at Oscillate before growling \"WHAT!? Why isn't this fucking thing working!?\" They yelled, but the guards rushed, but the figure raised they're rifle at the guards again \"STAY BACK!!!\" They yelled, as they put the ray to they're own neck \"I'm not giving you the satisfaction of holding me captive again.\" The gun charged and fired off into they're neck, the kick from the gun was so forceful it sent the figure back and into the back drop and sent them falling on they're face, the guards grabbed them tying the person up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a meeting of the staff, it was truly rare that we went into miss Holmes's office but this seemed to be priority one \"I want to know what I just saw.\" Toronto said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have no idea how they got through.\" Someone from security said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace stepped forward \"Why is it Gregory is here? What part could he play in this?\" Candace asked Toronto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was there, the very day I put him on the floor we get attacked by a mask manic.\" Toronto said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying I had something to do with it? Because I'm human?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it. But I'm not ruling out the possibility you've been compromised. That somebody's managed to copy your access and used you as an in.\" Toronto said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how's that possible?\" Olivia asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I knew then we wouldn't have a crazy person in the meat locker. A crazy person that asked to see Gregory Wilmont specifically, by name.\" Toronto said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were all shocked me especially \"We have no reason to give into they're demands.\" Candace said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we don't we can't find out what just happened in my casino.\" Toronto said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I get a say?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to keep you're job you'll see them. But don't worry, while that whack job was passed out we took any remaining weapons they had, but obviously we didn't find any identification on them.\" Toronto explained \"Also they're chained up, so I doubt you'll be in much danger.\" Toronto said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, I went to the meat locker where Candace was ready to open  the door for me, at my nod she opened it and closed it behind me per the stranger's demand \"Okay, I'm here. What do you want with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore me was the stranger, from now I could tell it was a woman with a more feminine shape then I remembered, she sat on her knees with her arms over her head held by chains on the ceiling made to hold entire cow carcasses, she had long hair, it was blonde with a streak of pink that started from the top widened and dominated the whole bottom end of her hair the further down the streak went, as she glared at me she had snake eyes, despite a fuzz on her face she looked mostly human, she glared at me and spoke \"Why do you- what...\" she said in disbelief \"What-what's happened to me!?\" She demanded to know<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're chained up. You just tried to kill somebody.\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BODY!!!\" She yelled \"I don't sound anything like this!\" She shook angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surprised by that \"Okay, I have to know, why are you here? What do you want with me?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at us! They're up there living like gods! You and me down here in the real world, our lives dominated by them. We have no purpose without them and they enjoy it that way!\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things can be tough but... I have some friends here.\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends!?\" She laughed \"But are they equals? Who is the master in the relationship?\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... okay they're in charge but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT NOTHING!!! We live and die by they're hands, anything in between is of they're will and our consequence.\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look um... what's your name?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three, Seven, One, Five.\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the only name I've known. It's on my arm.\" She pointed her eyes at the bandage over her arm \"By now I'm guessing you know I'm a test subject. A lab \"rat\" if you will.\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been experimented on your whole life?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo.\" She said coldly \"When I could escaped I did. I came here to destroy the heart of this horrid world at it's heart.\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It-it's not all bad.\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GREG!!!\" I heard a yell from my ear piece<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Holmes?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of there right now! Oscillate's just reacted to the effect of that ray gun and that freak used it to! Get out now!\" Toronto said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd it do to her?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToronto as said it I could see the changes happen to Three Seven One Five and I could see her change in a more animalistic way but more frightening was...</span></div></div>",

She didn't feel any warning from another that shook her again a few seconds later, printing her naval onto the front of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace and I watched, boring deeper into awe as our captive shook from another burst, then another, and then another, her stomach taking longer with each one to stop jiggling through the onslaught of spasms as it drooped closer to the ground.  Patches of green scales blossomed along the smooth tracts of skin that started pouring out of her clothing, distorting the skeleton of wherever they grew along her body into distinctly reptilian joints and features. Her skull melded her nose and mouth together into a rigid snout that stretched into the point of a dragon's maw, bearing razor sharp teeth that were clenched through her transformation, while spindly appendages poked from her shoulder blades that webbed into a modest set of wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet clattered onto the icy ground as pudgy claws, her chained fists rising higher and farther from the pipe as the growth of her shoulders pulled their reach of one another apart. The cuffs dug deep into the flesh of her wrists till they were torn clean apart, but by then, her stomach'd been wracked with so many pangs that its extreme weight kept her helt in place as it lowered onto the floor in a big, scaly ball, swallowing most of our view of her legs. Her arms ballooned too wide at the bicep for them to bend past her breasts, and without the bindings that held them up, she fell back onto her ass, shaking the ground and the some of the frozen meat hanging around us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food...\" She rumbled, but her voice still as high pitched as ever, despite the beast she'd become. \"I want...<i><b>fooood...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the<i> hell</i> just happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spun away from the two, hitting my earphone. \"Miss Holmes, can you read me? We need help  in the meat cooler!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Gregory? It's me, Mavis!\"</i> Came her much-more-welcomed voice. <i>\"What's happening on your end?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, did  Oscillate just grow really fat in a bunch of short jumps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere at Mavis' end, I could hear a faint \"<i>DON'T LOOK AT ME</i>\" scream from the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That'd be a yes.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here for the captive. What should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, right now, we've got a mob forming in the lounge. Mind checking it out while we send somebody to the kitchen?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on it.\" I switched off the phone and ran for the door. \"Candace, you stay here till help arrives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help? Wait, where're you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Aether Suites. I'm on riot duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe classical music played in the Aether Suites' lounge was snuffed out by the chatter of a colorful, furry mob of anthros crowding around the center desk, which had its windows barred out by a spiral staircase winding around. A round platform stacked on top with a microphone shone as the brightest spot in the room, thanks to the chandelier hanging right above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody grew antsier the longer it dragged on without me getting up onstage, making it all the harder for me to work through. \"Coming through! Pardon me, I'm the speaker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of seven minutes to make it to the steps and run up onto the platform, where I lowered the microphone by four feet. \"Attention, Gaia 2.0 residents!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clamor didn't waver in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention, Gaia 2.0 residents!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a handful of guests noticed me, and started elbowing their friends to look, but they couldn't plug the drain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, I stepped away from the mike by some feet and let out a loud whistle, burning the air with an unholy screech from the speakers. The sound cut through their bickering like butter, unleashing a symphony of surprises screams and hands being smacking over ears, but thankfully nobody's were bleeding as every eye in the lounge gave me their full, undivided attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention, Gaia 2.0 residents...\" I continued. \"...as many of you may have guessed, I'm here on account of the events that'd transpired a little over an hour ago in the Fate's Hand Casino. It's now that I can verify that, although motives are still being investigated, all responsible for the commotion have been captured and are being held in legal custody. Certain areas of the casino are to be closed due to investigative reasons, but let it be known that all facilities of the hotel remain safe enough to remain open, and nobody at this point is required to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if there are any questions, I'll answer them one at a time, and within reason.\"</span></div></div>",

All the sound seemed to have been drained from the room, with only the buzz of the air conditioning hanging around as I stood in wait of an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally blinking, she leaned the other way to pinch a ham leg as thick as her head off the food cart, baring her teeth as she opened wide and took a bite big enough to rip the meat right down to the bone. \"...no. I'd like to be alone, if that's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" I nodded as I turned the other way, but I didn't let my eyes leave her as I walked for the elevator. \"The window doubles as a TV, and there's some remotes and game controllers in the cabinet near the bathroom, if you get bored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill looking ahead, she took another bite, leaving only a tiny gristle left hanging on the bone. \"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" I nodded. By then, I was just a step away from the interior of the lift, but I gave myself a few more seconds to stick around until went in and hit the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the doors began closing, I looked back to see her head was angled to see me by the window's reflection. \"You seem...kinder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then, the doors'd closed in enough that I could only give her a gentle nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Jesus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any sound, music, or even movement going on in the Casino outside of Mavis and I unhooking one of the destroyed slot machines from its island, something in the air of the place just felt <i>wrong</i>, somehow even <i>more</i> than when there was some plastered anthro belligerently chasing me around. The place felt even more still once I'd told Mavis the whole story, who hoisted the machine off the ground with a somber look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Miss Holmes' already making more of her guns, right after<i> that?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it'd take her<i> lot </i>more time if I'd heard all this before,\" She snorted as she singlehandedly waddled it down to a cart with a pile on one corner of the stage, whereas I struggled to move just one around on the moving truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that's it? It's gonna be on the market, no questions asked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the machine fall on top of the pile and let out a deep breath from the workout, only shrugging. \"Don't know. She's already keeping me in the dark about this stuff, but all I know is she's already trying to get the blueprints laid out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...wow.\" I mumbled, looking back down at a stray cord coming off a machine that I gave a small kick. \"I 've had my quips about Miss Holmes...but <i>this.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis looked down at her vest, towards a large, silver plated badge hanging on the collar. \"I can almost feel my arm rising , ready to rip this off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only nodded, not saying anything else. Mavis didn't add anything else, and we went on with our job without speaking to one another, only sharing a few stray directions to break away the utter silence returning to the casino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but speak an hour later, when my phone began buzzing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, great...\" I muttered as I whipped out my phone, cringing at the caller ID before I answered the call. \"Yes, Miss Holmes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gregory, that you?\" She asked, her voice urgent. \"Listen, things'd got diff'rent 'round here, what with what happened. Ah've got a big job for y'all when ya get down ta the office, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the closest I'd ever come to saying \"no\" right in her face. Not close enough, though. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fer a while, ah'm gonna have y'all workin' on...</span></div></div>",

The entire floor inside was covered by a red bikini whose cups were so large that they couldn't fully unfold as I pulled them out by the straps and held them out as wide as my arms could go, their crux bouncing along the carpet as I walked back to the bed. \"Try this on. I know the <i>perfect</i> place we could start off of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClawdia's took the straps from my hands by the tips of her talons, but they didn't go up any father than her neck as her eyes scanned the swimsuit from head to toe, clearly struggling to find any kind of clue to the first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...do I have permission to make slight bodily contact?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...yes, you do.\" She replied, her voice softening out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled a stool out from under the minibar and slid it into place next to the bed's headboard, right behind the left cheek of her enormous, scaly behind. She didn't fight me off as I got on top of the seat and stood along her shoulder blade, but I tried not to not let my chest squish too much along her back as I gently pushed her arm aside, reaching under her pit to take the strap from her claw and thread it down her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arm was so thick that the strap went snug when it was just halfway up her bicep, so I gave the latch enough slack to pull it up the rest of the way and comfortably center it along her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now the other half.\" I breathed out as got down and scooted the stool to her right shoulder, but her hand gently shooed me back. She was staring at the other strap with the same intent as before, but finally found the urge to move as she pointed her hand inside and weave in in herself, successfully pulling it down her arm until it grew to tight on its girth. She struggled to bring it the rest of the way, but I came back up and widened it out, helping her fit it in place until I could snap both of the straps' latches together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped off, moving to the foot of the bed.\"Well, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face looked surprised and confused as she looked down at her partially clothed self, but didn't she seem unwelcoming, and most importantly looked a thousand times more presentable than before, save for a shadowy lump at the front of each breast that bulged under the red nylon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels...<i>strange,</i>\" she vaguely replied. \"Strange...but doable, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give it time. With enough walking around, you'll forget you're even wearing them! Now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes flickered at the side of her belly, where her bare hip was pouring out over the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...how good are you with spoken instructions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Ah...<i>eeh!</i> Ooh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't Clawdia's weight holding her back as the two of us walked out of the Glass Tornado's monorail station and onto the beach's hot sand. She'd flinched when we stepped out, stalling take in the startlingly fresh air as the full wash of the dome's synthetic sun hit her scales, but she was still reduced to an awkward shuffle as each step constantly reminded of the black bikini bottom snugly bound around her legs, her arms frozen in kind of a tyrannosaurus pose as she scuttled a few dragon paces behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this...<i>oh!</i>...a thing of...<i>eep!</i>...beauty?\" She gritted out, her eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just not used to wearing it, yet. We've just got to find something to help you break into them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what exactly did you...<i>oof!</i> Have in mind?\"</span></div></div>",

That just meant more time till they were done experimenting on you.\" Clawdia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean to harp but this isn't the lab. You don't have experiments or um... other things...\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awful things... by those monsters.\" Clawdia said seeing some anthros poolside while she and I sat at the top of one of the water slides, I had a feeling she might cause a problem, good thing I had the foresight to have this slide closed off till she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you had a... terrible past. But I-I mean that's behind you I guess. You can move on- if-if you want.\" I said meekly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back at me with a sad frown \"I don't hate you. We've both suffered under them. And the last thing I want to do is cause harm to one of my own. Or was one of my own...\" She looked sadly at the stream of water going down the slide \"Well fine, I'll try this slide.\" Clawdia said with reluctance. What I didn't expect was her to grab me and stuff me against her stomach and breasts and wrap her arms tightly around me as she still down screaming the whole time before crashing into the water like a cannonball, I saw her with her eyes clenched shut motionless as she gently floated back up still holding me as close as she could before she started panting for air<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was it?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd... I didn't think there would be a need to move via your butt. Though I'm surprised how effective it was.\" There was quiet for a bit until Clawdia noticed an armadillo float by on an innertube<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that thing?\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh an innertube. Did you wanna try one?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" She said like she was in a sushi bar with no clue what was on the menu<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get you one if uh you let go of me.\" I said motioning down to her thick arms still firmly restraining me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down in surprise \"Oh-oh yeah. Sorry.\" She let me go and soon enough I'd gotten her an innertube. I went over to the staffer running the booth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg! I don't like being left out of the loop on new money!\" I was displeased to see the rental desk was manned by Stevie Bormstan, a well meaning dolt who by any right would be unemployed for his crass and lack of professionalism, of course with his cousin Jeff Bormstan manufacturing and supplying much of Gaia's Spa products Mr Bormstan was very easily able to convince Miss Holme's to hire his inept cousin. That situation of course was a balancing act, Stevie gets into incidents which forces Jeff to give Miss Holmes Discounts from time to time to smooth things over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part he was shifted from place to place hoping something would stick with this dog, but it never did \"She's not new money, Stevie, she's an inventor. She was a scrawny human this morning till she made a gun that turned her into that.\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think there was a market for guns that make you do the dinosaur walk.\" Stevie quipped rather happy with himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be careful around her. She really doesn't like anthros.\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've got some steel that'll change her mind.\" Stevie thrust his hips confidently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Steve, she, is, trouble.\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Challenge accepted.\" He said running his hands through his hair and brush the tuft of his chest fur<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I just get an innertube?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on it!\" He scampered to the back stumbling back with an innertube but also knocking down some oars in the process<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't hit on anybody here have you?\" I asked worriedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfff they've been hitting on me. I saw this Orca-or-or was she a dragon? An aligator?\" Stevie asked himself still trying to remember<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are three wildly different girls, Stevie.\" I sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dismissed it with a wave \"Anyway this one girl was totally wiggling her butt at me. I knew she was down to fondue.\" He said confidently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me you didn't do something crazy. Cadnace was very upset when you put your dick in that eclair.\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey she was totally signaling!\" Stevie said in his defense giving me the tube<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean jump to dicks in pastries.\" I said flatly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well miss dino walk's been all over you. She was following you on the beach this whole time.\" Stevie said as if he made a dramatic revaluation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm her liaison.\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why was she holding onto you so long after you came out the slide? I see everything, Greg!\" He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wasn't holding on that long. Besides you sure don't see when girls aren't into you!\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Chameleon seemed to like me.\" Stevie said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yazuki only liked you because you have a weird almost encyclopedic memory of golden axe.\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyris calls a dragon to burn all the bad dudes!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't a particularly pleasant sight to return to the pool and see that Clawdia was gone, particularly after having to drag the inner tube all the way there. \"Clawdia? Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I take it that this is a nutrient exchange reciprocal?\"</i> I could hear her say from somewhere behind the tube. I let it fall over and saw her standing at a food stall a few paces from the pool steps, towering over the cashier with her hands still seized up in a snatching pose. \"What do you have available?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'What <i>don't</i> I have available?' is a better question!\" The cashier, a portly zebra girl with a beaming smile, boasted. \"If I can't sell it, you win a free table at the White Brimstone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...\" Clawdia observed, scratching at her chin. \"In that case, I'll have two hundred grams of sodium benothhyzate, and thirty of pectrozorite methodolinade. Maybe throw in a few bits of meat produce, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zebra's smile fell, and she grabbed a bottle out of sight, reading the nutrition facts. \"Uh...will that be table, or booth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have two tornado fries, and two medium sodas.\" I butted in, squeezing between the counter and the front of Clawdia's gut. \"Barbecue seasoned, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That</i> I can work with.\" She said gratefully, grabbing two potatoes and loading them up in a spiral cutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of slang was that, which you'd just spoken in?\" Clawdia suspiciously asked, backing away to give me space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slang? That wasn't slang, that's just one of the things that they sell here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like utter gibberish, to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even more than 'pesticide emporium,' or whatever you'd just asked for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" She said simply, then looked over at the counter, which she searched around with her hand for something. \"And where's the needle, anyhow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What needle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The blood needle. They'll ask for a blood sample in exchange for our nutrition, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no, we...\" I started to answer, but decided then that I was getting sick and tired of bringing up the lab, and instead brought out my card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, they're ready!\" The cashier announced as she pushed a second potato off its skewer and onto a plastic tray, sliding them both through the window before she turned around and grabbed two bottles of grape soda, setting them down on the counter. I wordlessly slid my card through the reader, and she nodded as a receipt began printing up inside. \"Have a nice day, then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you too!\" I replied, taking a tray and soda for myself. I handed over the other two for Clawdia to take, and she took a chance to silently scrutinize it before she pinched them up in her claws, holding them before her snout to observe them much closer than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than explain to her the process of eating a fried potato, I just broke of a piece of mine and dipped it in ketchup before casually eating it, walking back towards the pool steps. When she didn't follow after, I stopped and turned back, watching as she turned the fry over and over in her tray, to the utter confusion of the poor zebra girl. I took another bite, hoping to drive in the point, but she didn't notice. Then I took another, and another and another, and it was only at the fourth did she notice what I was doing, and she cautiously eyes the tornado fry before pinching and breaking off a tiny bite-sized piece. She gingerly dipped it in ketchup and twirled it around in her fingers, holding it an inch away from her mouth before her tongue snapped out and pulled it in. She briefly swished it around on her tongue, noting its flavor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then I saw her face go ripe with amazement, but only for half a second until she grabbed and slathered the potato in as much ketchup as possible, and she promptly wiped it out of existence in two bites. Next went the soda, which she uncapped with her thumb and chugged in one quick, painless swig before recklessly tossing the tray and bottle away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo quick did it go that she could barely believe what she'd just tasted in the wake of it's flavor, and she promptly spun around and scared the zebra back into her hut as she smacked both her hands over the counter, ducking her head in through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I WILL GLADLY SUPPLY YOU WITH COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF MY BLOOD, SKIN, AND HAIR IF YOU PROVIDE ME WITH MORE OF THESE!!!\"</i> She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and this is a burger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time around, Clawdia didn't bother asking or analyzing what the ingredients to it were, and she tossed the entire thing in her mouth, chewing once or twice before she gladly swallowed every bit of it. A chill went through her body at the sensation, enough of one to nearly knock me over. \"Oh, that was marvelous! I <i>love</i> burgers! Give me more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI unwrapped another burger from the pile sitting at my side, and I daintily held it out by the tips of my fingers to keep them from getting chopped off as she swiped it away, scarfing it down just as quickly. On top of her stomach, all that remained of our trip down the rest of the boardwalk's stalls was the bag of burgers, and I could tell it was only a short time away from joining the pile of trash and wrappers stacked on the inner tube hooked up to hers, which she contentedly laid back on as we floated down the lazy river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More!\" She bellowed, a begging smile between her bulbous cheeks. Truth be told, there was actually a fair bit of comfort to finally seeing her smile, and I found myself easing up a bit whenever I wasn't about to hand her something. It was what started to help me let loose some of the trials of the day, to forget about some of the stress of being around her presence, fearing having to step in her bounds...</span></div></div>",

Be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Holmes, what's goin-\" But the line clicked shut without a single answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy legs almost gave out, but I somehow mustered enough willpower to keep myself from going catatonic right on the floor, allowing me to stir up a storm's worth of questions in but seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf anything the call could've been for, of any broken meat grinder that could've had somebody's wedding ring jammed inside, this was the first thing of the season I'd woke up to. Miss Holmes' office was the one door in the faculty hall that never opened, but still towered over all the rest, perpetually overlooking those of the tiny worker chambers lining the other wall and its walkways. She never stepped foot outside, and nobody but the <i>dumbest possible</i> workers would go in, more often than not dragged, kicking and screaming up a show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe'd never see them till a few weeks later, sobbing. Out of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the briefest of moments I actually wondered how easy it'd be to smash through the window and somehow tunnel out the Glass Tornado's dome, but then I noticed the clock hanging on the wall, and how long my wallowing had taken me. 7:05, leaving me only five minutes till Miss Holmes'd probably send some sort of personal army to get me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, with a heavy feeling of terror flooding around my heart, I managed to regain control of my leg muscles and headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody I knew was in the row of worker's she'd called up along the platform that hung from the ceiling, with bridges hanging from either side that bore through the walls. Each of us stood stiff, our legs together and hands at our sides, but even while staring straight ahead I could pick out a minor twitch or whimper from anybody at either side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouldn't blame them, really. Hell, I was probably doing the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was just the fear coursing through me, that I didn't see her in such a long time, or if she'd spent every hour of the time since I'd been hired stuffing herself without relent, but of any of the daydreams or nightmares I'd had at any point of getting remotely punished by Miss Holmes, she was <i>bigger</i> than anything I'd ever imagined. She wore a white business suit that was too clean to be old, a dead giveaway she'd torn through her old one and recently been fitted, but this one was already straining at the buttons and seams. The front drooped noticeably lower than the back to conceal as much possible of her belly; at first glance, you'd think she was doing a crappy job of smuggling around a 50-foot wrecking ball underneath, but the occasional jiggle in its shape and the white-and-brown furred wall of flesh drooping past the bottom and onto the ground warded off any doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver for a cow, her breasts were absolutely gigantic, but I tried my best to avoid glancing away from her stern, blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alr'ight. With christmas comin' n' under two weeks, ah hope ah don't need ta remind y'all that we're gonna need the resort running at it's best for the holiday rush.\" It was chilling to take her in. Miss Holmes spoke with such a booming voice, but anything seen or heard of her was mostly through posters and phone calls, so seeing her moving and speaking in person almost felt surreal.\"...and we've gotta lot of loose ends to tie up, just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long silence passed among us till one of us spoke. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raine.\" She said simply. \"We can't have any freeloaders dirtyin' up the joint at its busiest, so we've gotta taker her out. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of us let out the breaths we'd been holding. Miss Holmes noticed, and narrowed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...anyways, she'd had her little fun 'round these parts for too long. By the twentieth, she's gonna be gone. which I know y'all're gonna pull through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to the right passageway and nodded. Mavis waddled in, pushing a cart with a row of guns laid out. My heart nearly plummeted at the sight, but then I realized they looked a bit too plasticky for a real gun to be, and the spare clips laying near each were bright orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis whispered to each worker as they'd claim a gun. <i>\"Hi, gregory.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hi, Mavis.\"</i> I whispered back, grabbing myself a weapon. Sure enough, it felt way too light to hold lead ammo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These guns're loaded with high-octane tranquilizer darts, a kind that're used by the police. Anybody shot with 'em is gonna grow nice and fat ta roll around, and by the twentieth, she'd gonna be thrown out to the snow. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody hollered a mishmash of yeses. \"Yes, Miss Holmes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, get to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all ran single-file off of the platform and down one of the bridges, but after passing into the hallway we ran in any direction we saw fit. I lingered in the work lounge for a while, observing the gun in my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least I wasn't suffering a severe case of bovine booty, but it was still a pretty high request. Raine was one of the staff's biggest mysteries in dire need of solving; we didn't even know how long she'd been hiding out on us, let alone her actual name or even how the hell she'd snuck into Gaia 2.0 in the first place. It seemed like one day, out of the blue, guest or staff just started seeing some Raccoon sneaking around the halls and swiping little trinkets left laying around, only to vanish just as quick as she'd been found. She never talked to anybody, she'd never left any messes to clean up, she never left any demanding notes, hell, if anything, she'd actually been caught grabbing unsteady ladders or yanking staff out of a stampeding anthro's way, so her petty thieving was long repaid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut either way, she'd been a thorn in our ass for too long. Miss Holmes' ass, mostly, but she was generous in passing on the pain. She'd demanded our best in weeding her out, even if she had a freeloading lifesaver on her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute.\" I spoke. \"Lifesaver...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gregory, are you sure about this? You could get killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure, but I'm <i>also</i> sure that I'm not gonna get killed, because that's where you'll come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Gertrude's face craned against her blobby neck as she scanned her gaze around the beach, observing the anthros we'd distanced ourselves from. \"I mean, Miss Holmes already freaks out at anyone <i>accidentally</i> messing up on the job. What'll she do if it's intentional?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's to catch Raine, so I'm sure she'd understand. Hell, if everything goes well, I bet she'd give me the day off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're <i>absolutely sure</i> about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive. Besides, even if it got too worse, I'm sure Raine'd just show up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGertrude gave me a long, concerned look before letting out a resigned sigh. \"Alright. What do you need me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep at the sidelines. I'll approach somebody, ask if they need something, then mess up to see how they'll react. If it gets too bad and Raine doesn't show up, I'll yell 'Santa's got a brand new bag!', and then you'll intervene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Santa's got a brand new bag. Got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Now...\" I shielded my eyes from the Glass Tornado's false sunlight, trying to weed out any of the beach's potential berserk buttons. \"Choices, choices...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, Mister Wiltsead, can't say I'm all mispleased of someone with your...well,<i> limitations</i>,\" Within her drawl, I could hear an implication for every letter in that word, \"and all things considered, I'm feelin' a <i>lot</i> more optimistic than I was an hour ago, but I'm still required ta ask - what made y'all wanna come this far for the position?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the interview, I couldn't keep my mind focused between forcing a smile and absorbing her lengthy values, morals, and codes of conducts for the resort all at once. Even if they didn't have any faces, all the rooms accessories, the paintings hanging on the walls, the chandalier swaying from the ceiling, and even just the coffee mug, books, and stapler on her desk all seemed to be cast over with a shade that looked down on me with this judgemental edge. Even the chair before the desk, while not uncomfortable, felt unwelcoming as I cleanly sat in the crack of some invisible, yet leviathanic butt whose cheeks' imprint were still embedded in the cushion's leather, each crater as large as a mansion's front yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust being alone in the room would've been unnerving, but I wasn't. At the desk's other side, without me even having to stand up, I could see what I couldn't believe wasn't some gigantic boulder that'd been carved out of the largest of mountains and, for whatever reason, painted white with continent-like brown spots, with some gigantic, large-breasted woman standing behind with her maroon suit hastily buttoned over it all. The only clue that she wasn't legitimately someindoor  landmass was a constant wobbling that shook through her gargantuanly round figure any time she leaned over to grab whatever it was on a glass tray on the desk's corner, whether it be stacks of fudge, doughuts, cake, or even burgers, not one of them looking veggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut somehow, despite having one of the roundest, blubberiest heads I'd ever seen, Miss Holmes still had a face that looked like it'd been carved out of stone. Behind her tiny eyeglasses, her eyes narrowed, and I gave a tiny gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, i'd just always had a fascination for a work experience for Gaia 2.0, Miss Holmes!\" My smile felt faker just by saying that. \"I think in the future, picking up the traits of this job would help me out a lot in the long run, and I could see myself benefitting from the training for a <i>long</i> time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her glasses off, folding them onto her suit's lapel. \"So what you're sayin' is, when you were on the way to my office, ya didn't have your face pressed against the monorail's windows to look fer celebrities? You were just walkin' down the street, headin' for some job interview?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes.\" I let out, giving a stiff nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath all that pudge, the look on her face showed she was pecking the flesh clean off the bones of that claim, but she didn't say anything. She only folded her hands on her desk, looking down at her interlocked fingers. \"Well, from where I stand, there's not much sayin' y'all <i>can't</i> come in, 'cept a few more hours of paperwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very good to hear!\" I said happily, genuinely feeling more relaxed. \"Thanks for saying that, Miss Holmes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill looking down, she raised a hand. \"...<i>but</i>, there's still <i>one last thing </i>we've gotta understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly turned around and pushed herself forward, with all the loose little trinkets of her room rattling as her booming hoofsteps moved around the desk. Her stomach projected off of her so much that she couldn't even face me as she sidestepped towards the chair, giving a strained grunt as she bend down on one of her mountainous legs to grab one of the chair's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but she never came any lower. Instead, with one hand, she pulled the entire chair up off the floor, nearly shaking me off my perch on the very edge as it'd rose enough for her to hold the seat with her other. The stoic look on her face wasn't fazed as she felt the legs dig into the top slope of her belly's flesh, bringing me in so close that her snout was only a few feet from snapping down and swallowing me whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This is a job.</i>\" Her voice was chillingly calm and still, but still quaked the air enough to stiffen every pore on my body. \"Yes, y'all're gonna have a few <i>occasional</i> days off ta run around in the resort. Yes, y'all're gonna meet, maybe chit chat with <i><b>a few rare </b></i>guests who could've written a single ya heard, but always, <i>always </i>remember that y'all're gonne be here for<i> them</i>. <i><b>Not</b></i> the other way around. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" I squeaked, hugging my own legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...<i>and</i> that ah expect y'all to appear where I want,<i> when </i>I want, and how I <i>want</i> y'all ta look, no questions asked, all liberties signed away. <i>Got it?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...okay.\" I peeped, even quieter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.\" She leaned in even closer, her eyes narrowing as she came in enough to feel the bathing warmth of her breath. \"Before we go past the point of no return, this'll is your last chance ta turn around for a<i> long </i>time. Takin' everything into account, tell me honestly: <i><b>are you sure you wanna do this?\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes didn't twitch away, not even blinking as she stared a stare that could've tunneled its way to the Earth's core. In that moment, all the walls of the office melted into some hazy void, and I could barely remember most of the job's details as I sat right int he center of her crosshairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and in my daze, the first thing that came to ind was how much the plane ride'd cost. \"Yes. Yes, I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still lingered her sight on me, her lips pursing a little, but she then nodded. \"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs gently as she'd picked it up, she'd lowered the chair back down on the floor. She loudly shuffled her way back to the desk, brushing a few papers away laid on top of a contract that she pushed towards me, the signature's space hanging over the lip of the desk. \"Sign away, if that's the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line was smaller than any of the contract's fine prints. A human-sized ballpoint pen was clipped to the very bottom, and not wanting to waste any more of her time to hesitate, I took it out and scribbled my name across in cursive. \"...done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the paper back, closely observing the microscopic signature. Folding it neatly, she slid the sheet into a slot on her desk, then gathered up all the other documents to square them up, stuffing them into an open drawer. \"Welcome aboard, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe typed away a few words on her computer's keyboard, and the printer started whirring. \"My assistant Mavis'll be here in a few. Just wait outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then, almost forgetting I was there, Miss Holmes quickly lost herself back into whatever paperwork she was getting ready. I hadn't even move out of my quasi fetal position until she took a pen from a coffe mug and clicked out the point, catching sight of me in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means you can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh...oh, right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy legs sprung back out, and I ran along the cushion to a set of rungs that were dug into the leg of the chair, trying not to look down as I grabbed the top one and let my body slide off, my foot luckily catching hold of one below. The room went back into the sounds of a keyboard being mercilessly pounded and a printer churning out a whole stream of papers as I climbed my way down, carefully taking a whole second with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very moment my foot hit the carpet, I burst out into a brisk run, heading straight for the skyscraping barnyard doors ahead.</span></div></div>",

It felt amazing, especially as all the tension in my muscles was let loose as I let my back hit one of the doors, sliding down on my legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm in!\" I whispered, then pumped a fist up in victory. \"I\"M IN!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I quickly pulled it back in when I heard a soft, feminine chuckle some distance away. I shot back on my feet, shamefully dusting myself off as another set of footsteps came my way, ones pretty loud, but nowhere near as weighty as Miss Holmes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt scared to look at who it was, but I angled my head their way, looking them in the eye. She, I could see, wasn't even close to Miss Holme's size, but still lugged around a huge belly-to-body ratio that swelled off of her like some oversized beach ball, one covered by a smooth sheen of black and white feathers. Her uniform also opted out for a blue shirt that covered just a fraction of her stomach below her titanic breasts and a pair of black sweatpants stretched along girthy legs that funneled off her body like weather balloons, each thick enough to crush the hood of a car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost surprising, however, was that she approached me with a smile along her beak, her eyes friendly and blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Gregory, aren't you?\" The penguin lady asked in a far more welcoming tone, holding out a flipper as thick as a pillow. \"My name's Mavis, Mavis Thymes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is!\" I genuinely smiled as I took her wing, but mostly recieved a good shake. \"Heh...sorry about that, I'd just really wanted this job...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't worry about it. It's not every day you get to see a human come in here!\" She chuckled, then fished into her shirt's collar to pull out a clipboard. \"Anyway, the first matter of business is a tour of the resort, which'll be split into today and tomorrow. We should wrap up tonight by 9, then have you situated in your bunker. Follow me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to turn herself away, pointint the other direction with her shoulder. \"Then after that, we'll begin your training, which'll ease you into the actual job itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm.\" I nodded, my hands folded along the bac of my neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the next page. \"So, getting into the swing of things, I think the best place for us to start off with would be...\"</span></div></div>",

Since this<i>IS</i> part of the resort and all.\" Mavis said. \"Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.\" Greg already become a \"yes\" man. \"Well then, let's not dawdle about anymore and get this tour started!\" Mavis happily said. Greg gave a smile before hopping into a cart with her and going down the trail with her. \"First things first newbie, this place's name is the Limestone Ridge. Pretty hard to forget a name like that.\" \"Yep it sure is.\" Greg said back. \"You can drop the act now, As fun as it is to see you be a complete boy scout. It gets annoying after a while.\" The penguin smirks. \"oh right, uh sorry...\" The human lurched back in embarrassment. \"Oh don't worry about it! You don't need to be so formal with me, I'm not like Miss Holmes.\" Greg sighs a bit from relief. Anyway we're almost at our first destination. The trail become a tad less bumpy as the two now start to drive on cut grass. It was a cool emerald green with much bigger patches of lighter greens up ahead. Mavis stepped on the brakes before coming to a stop. \"This here is the golf course, you don't need much explaining for this one. But what I will say is this place is great for a good old fashioned relaxing game of golf. Greg nodded in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then a white projectile whizzed past Greg's head into a tree behind the two. Mavis and Greg both turn in unison to see a smoking hot golf ball lodged into the side of said tree. \"<b><i>LOGAN I SWEAR TO THE MIGHTY FORCES ABOVE IF YOU RUIN MY SHOT AGAIN I'M GOING TO STUFF YOU IN A BOX AND SHIP YOU TO AFRICA!!! </i></b> A clearly angry voice behind them said. The duo looked to see a fuming Ox anthro yelling and clenching his fist at a bear anthro. \"It's not my fault you suck at golf.\" the bear calmly retorts back. \"<i>I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW THAT I WAS THE REGIONAL CHAMPION WHERE I COME FROM!!\"</i> \"Yeah clearly because everyone else was worse than you.\" \"<i><b>WHY YOU LITTLE--!!!</b></i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      [THE FOLLOWING SCENE WAS DEEMED NOT SUITABLE FOR HUMAN VIEWERS AND WAS THEREFORE REMOVED FROM THIS CHAPTER]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one life scarring experience later the two decided that they would rather go down the trail by foot. \"The next stop is to the cabins, a cozy part of Limestone Ridge that accommodates guests that just feel like getting away from the modern looks of the resort.\" \"Neat.\" Greg said back. The human and penguin walk into the cabin village and were met with plenty of friendly faces that welcomed them. They may have been more of the staff but it was still nice to get greeted in a friendly and polite manner.  \"I think now is the time we had ourselves a little break, what do 'ya say?\" \"Yeah I could go for one after happened..\" Greg shuddered. \"Back there..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat down in what looked like a cozy sort of cafe. Ordering themselves some coffee for Mavis and a hot cocoa for Greg. \"So what made you want to work here of all places? Gaia ain't the type of place that's... gentle to your kind.\" \"I..\" Greg thought for a moment before speaking again. \"I saw that the pay was good and needed little no skill to do. If that makes any sense.\" \"I guess, but do you know why humans don't last very long here?\" Greg shook his head. \"Well it's because some anthros feel like humans are beneath them, and take that very literally.\" The penguin sips her coffee. \"Okay then I'll be careful.\" Greg said. \"You'd better be. \"Cause I\"m already starting to like 'ya.\" Greg blushed. \"As a friend newbie, as a friend.\" \"Oh right- of course.\" he blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying for their drinks Mavis and Greg continue with their tour through Limestone Ridge through another trail. This trail however had far more foliage to it. \"Oh and one last thing, be careful when you walk around here alone. There have been reports of people going missing around and those missing people were all around the same size as you.\" Mavis said. Greg nervously chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------- 10 minutes of walking later ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did you end up with this job?\" Greg asked Mavis. \"Let's just say I have certain connections within the resort and leave it at that.\" Mavis giggles. The forest around the two was pretty dense. Someone who doesn't know their way or follows the trail could easily get lost. Maybe that's how the people <i>ACTUALLY</i> went missing. \"Anyway the next stop is just up ahead.\" Mavis chirped. \"Right.\" Greg said. He followed close behind Mavis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...?\" Greg stopped dead in his tracks. He looked around his surrounding before looking back at the trail. \"Mavis did you hear...?\" Greg asked but saw that Mavis was no where to be seen. Mavis warned him about being alone, her words ring in Greg's mind. \"The noise... it sounded a bit like...\"</span></div></div>",

I did. How <i>couldn't</i> anybody who's ever turned on a radio? <i>\"She'd went 'n gotten engaged a month ago, and she's want'n both the ceremony</i> and <i>honeymoon right here, so y'all're gonna be adding 'wedding planner' to your resume.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wedding planner?<i></i>\" I sputtered, shooting up again. \"B-But I don't know ho-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"All freedoms signed away!\"</i> She rumbled warningly. <i>\"Y'all signed yourself to this words with your own blood, didn't you? Ah've still got that conversation on tape, ya know!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, but I really don-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<b>Exactly.</b>\" </i>She gritted, cutting me off. \"And since you agree, y'all're gonna be down at the lobby when they arrive in two hours, with a tour and bottle of champagne ready for 'em. Holmes out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, <i><b>wait!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Holmes. Out.</i>\" She growled one last time, and the phone was hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...a wedding.\" I muttered, my back at all the security cameras, guests, and anthros at the front desk that could've seen my scowling. \"The hell kind of place for a holy union is <i>this</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd force myself back up into a smile, though, any time the revolving doors to the train station would begin turning, before whatever guest was coming in could be able to see me sulking. The cold air and snowfall would always whip through my coat as they came in, constantly intruding on the warm, compassionate air that greeted anyone entering from the blizzard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still couldn't believe it. Sure, I may have known how to set tables in ten different countries, put up floral arrangements, and maybe perform a few magic tricks here and there when a gala was being held, but why the <i>hell</i> would Miss Holmes vote <i>me</i> as the one to set up a billionaire's wedding? All I could think of was having to live through one of those terrifying brides-from-hell reality shows, where the brides-to-be thought that <i>everything</i> could apparently get thrown in jeopardy by their dresses being a little too high on the ankle, the steeple not having a nice view of the sea, or even just a mint tray being too many inches to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and here, the Gaia 2.0 edition was coming. Set in a world where you could get sat on for not being totally familiar with some British sitcom filmed twenty years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened again, and I plastered on that grin, and I kept it on my face as I saw the next guest lumbering their way in, and went over to see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI easily recognized the mass of white that popped free of the revolving door by the vibrant splashes of blue from her hair, eyes, and the tips of her wing's feathers as they were freed up, her face going wide with awe as she was struck by the sight of the lobby's vastness and gold-plated lore all at once, looking every way between tall, arching ceiling, the fountain and garden trickling loudly in the center of the chamber, the large walkways looming over with balconies accented with shimmering brass. I hurried up as she continued absorbing her first taste of the Gaian experience, not wanting her to look down before she realized nobody was there for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and you would be Miss Grove, I assume?\" I asked as I raised up the chilled champagne bottle, despite that she was clearly shivering while clad in an overly fluffy white coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unzipped the jacket, pulling it off and holding it out by the collar for a unicorn assistant at her side to take. On the surface, she looked just about exactly the same as she did when she was onstage; a lot of guests usually had this vague difference between how they looked in front of the camera or an audience, thanks to makeup or digital retouching, but Melanie had an almost flawless resemblance between her as a singer and her as a guest, almost uncannily so. She was guarded in front by a truly titanic belly that hung off of her with all the weight of a gigantic wrecking ball, one that somehow wobbled about with every slight movement she made, but her overfed body still seemed very well-groomed and properly dressed, with little rolls or cellulite left to sag her airy roundness. For an outfit, she was dressed up in a white blazer that could only remain intact by a single button keeping it held around a black undershirt and a truly colossal pair of breasts, squeezing her cleavage up towards the chin of her snout, and had a white skirt more or less bandaged around the belt of a pair of tights made from enough lengths of nylon to carpet a whole living room twice, and yet they were still tight around the joints of her mammoth-sized legs, with wrinkles of strain formed around the crack of her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Her head pointed my way, having heard me approach her. She slowly lowered her great big butt onto the floor, craning onto her side so she could get a look at me, and seemed rather pleased by the sight. \"Oh, they have <i>humans </i>working here! How adorable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may have been demeaning for her to hear that, but somehow, the way she said it seemed to warm my heart a little, almost easing away some of the nerves I'd had before. Just her speaking voice alone had this ringing, lustrous quality to it, let alone her ability to <i>sing,</i> and I couldn't help but smile up at her with a fair deal of honesty. \"Pleasure to make your acquaintance, Miss Grove, my name is Gregory Wilmont. I trust you've enjoyed your train ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was <i>wonderful!</i>\" She gushed, rising back up. \"...and if the train ride here was such a thrill, I can't possibly imagine how much better it could get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're the next of many before to say that!\" I added slyly. \"And I can guarantee, all of their expectations have been more than shattered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!!!\" She squealed, and I'll admit, I came pretty damn close to doing the same as I watched her hold her blubbery cheeks in utter excitement, smiling with the sheer glee you'd only see on a child. I'll admit, I was actually getting to like her! \"I just can't believe it! I'm getting <i>married</i>, I get to stay at <i>Gaia 2.0</i>, this'll be the <i>greatest three weeks of my life!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I guarantee, I'll do everything in my power to see that through!\" I nodded. \"Would you like to see your room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie eagerly agreed, hoisting up most of her bags herself. As she followed me down to the front desk, five-so more assistants came in through the doors who had all her bags gathered up on a bag rack, and they were tailed by another figure. They were fairly wide, not nearly as big or expensively dressed as Melanie, but as they eagerly bustled over to the two of us with a sandwich in hand, I had a feeling that I knew them as...</span></div></div>",

It was how <i>honest</i> she felt, something that made me look and double-take at him as he loudly munched on a handful of cheese puffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only bags he brought in were vast hoards of wrapped junk food that he carried underneath each arm, clearly attesting to a large gray potbelly that bulged out from his shirt and hung down over his belt, crimping up the fly of his khaki shorts. He was just a plain horse without any wings or some other kind of whimsical feature, with a silver coat that melded with black along his head and arms, and his portly appearance only seemed more like some average beer gut than the trophy of a wealthy lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was truly disturbing, though, what <i>really</i> irked my mind was that, from the moment he'd stepped into the lobby, he barely raised his head up to embrace his very first moment of being able to breathe in the air of the most expensive spot in all the world, instead looking down as he thoroughly licked the cheese off his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This, as you can see, is Peter Bestwick!\" She leaned in with her lips puckered up, but it took some time for him to notice her as he struggled to rip open up a new bag of chips, and he merely caught her out of the corner of his eye before turning his head to give her a quick peck. \"...soon to be Mr. Grove!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked my way and gave a curt nod before burying his snout back into the chip bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...of course.\" I spoke, shaking off my doubts and putting back on my charmer tone. I pulled out my lighter and flipped open the screen, typing her name in. \"Well, Miss Grove, if you'll follow me, I'll lead you over to your room.

Even her assistants stalled as she went right in and made herself known to the suite, her smile becoming almost <i>illegally</i> adorable as she gleefully took in all the red leather cushioning wrapped around all the room's the furnishes, the deep crimson hardwood floors, and a highly modern chandelier that sat suspended over one half of the room, overlooking a little living area with a brick fireplace and a wide plasma screen tv, the other half a kitchen and dining table suited up with the most pristine marble countertops. All of the wall away from us was made out of windows, an arching balcony outside that gave a spanning view of the Glass Tornado's pseudo-ocean. The sunlight alone shining through the veranda and skylight enough that the room was decently lit with all the lights off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's <i>beautiful!</i>\" She swooned, flaunting an impressive ability to easily move around as she swayed her way over to the balcony door. \"It's even <i>better</i> than what I'd been hoping for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter, who was finally finishing off the last survivor of his sugary hoard, gave a listless nod as he stuffed a solitary snack cake into his maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suspiciously glanced his way, then shook my head. \"...and it's even better when it's <i>not</i> just a good view!\" I added with a smirk, hitching up some of their bags from the baggage cart. \"If you guys want a tour, I'll just get all your bags laid out, maybe give the two of you a little while to get stewed before we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\" Melanie said thoughtfully, still looking out at the balcony. Her face had gone from utterly ecstatic to inquisitive, her eyes narrowing in tense concentration as she took a step back and held her arms out, forming a vague rectangle with her fingers. \"...I think I want it here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tour?\" I asked. \"Well, I guess can give you a little run through of all the stuff available here, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the <i>tour</i>, silly!\" Melanie giggled. \"The <i>ceremony! </i>The balcony would be a <i>perfect</i> place to hold it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI furrowed a brow. \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out, Peter!\" She said enthusiastically as she slid open the door and went outside, while Peter slowly obeyed and followed after. \"I can imagine it right here! The altar, the seats, all the seats and tables, it could all happen right here, right next to the view!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" I asked, coming out and going to her side. \"I mean, there's a whole lot of other sights to see around here, and not even at the Glass Tornado! You don't want to see them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be nice, sure.\" She shrugged. \"But right now, I <i>know</i> that this is exactly what I want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...if you insist...\" I answered, voice tapering out. I looked over to Peter, wanting to observe his reaction, but he almost seemed utterly devoid of sensation when there wasn't food on hand, with nothing left to satisfy his apparent tastes. Again, he hadn't even acknowledged the view as he went up to Melanie's side, taking her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want more, dear?\" She asked. Peter nodded, but he didn't seem excited, or even smile. \"Of course. Gregory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have some lunch served up here, would you?\" She poked Peter in his stomach, which had rounded out enough from his feasting that its gray fur was partly exposed from his shirt. \"Don't wanna keep my hubby waiting!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With the legs of the table jacked up a few notches, her head sat comfortably level with a five course meal of hay-burgers, hay-stew, hay-lasagna, hay-chili, or whatever other variations of fatty foods existed that could've been stewed out of hay, her shoulders shuddering as she felt the flavors hit her tongue, but she didn't lose control over the first bite. She eagerly began cutting herself the next hunk of faux-meat, but still took the time to swallow her meal and continue at a leisurely pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs large as her section of the feast was, however, it seemed huddled into a corner by the sheer amount that she'd had ordered for Peter. As the two ate at opposite ends of the table, watching him in action made it harder to hide the growing feeling of confusion within me; Peter hadn't given her any sign as to what he wanted or how much of it he wanted to eat, but once something edible was placed in front of him, he just reached in with his hands and scooped up whatever was on the closest plate with his bare hands, eating it up like he was living through a famine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you enjoying the hay-ratatouille?\" She'd ask, or some other stray comment along those lines, which Peter would respond to with a grunt. \"Me, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath all of her belly blubber, the weight of the food she'd eaten was barely visible up until she'd knocked over the first half of her meal, where I could squint and see a vague, yet considerable food baby growing within her stomach, but the minor layer of pudge that rounded Peter out couldn't disguise how grotesquely bloated he was becoming. His stomach ballooned enough that his shirt rode up under his chest, exposing fur that thinned out along a layer of skin that was painfully red, but he either ignored or wasn't aware of whatever agony it was in and tortured it by sending in more. He didn't even seem pleasured by the food, his eyes still locked in that same bored look that now seemed totally indestructible; he just ate, his arms mechanically going through the motions of going forward and back from the plates like it was some natural reflex that was all his brain knew how to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two didn't speak, but Melanie watched him gorge himself like he was giving her the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, all the plates in front of him were licked clean, the ones down in the center too far for him to reach and he bent forward against his distended gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, sweetie, let me help you...\" Melanie offered, rising up from her seat. She grabbed the crank for the legs on her end of the table and wound it up, making them rise so the entire table was on a slant. All the plates slid down towards Peter's waiting mouth, and he did an impressive job of keeping the flow coming towards him in control by shoveling in whatever was about to pile up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing all the empty plates bunching up in front of him, I sprung into action and dove under the table, grabbing at whatever fell off before it could shatter on the floor. I grimaced at how clean the plates were; all of them were utterly devoid of smudges and stains aside from a thin layer of saliva that coated them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was two whole minutes of plate catching until I finally heard Peter breath <i>out</i> for once, leaning back on his chair with a winded sigh. Melanie's hands came down from behind him and pressed deep into its tender flesh, letting her fingers run through her fur as she stroked it up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmn...oh, <i>Peter,</i>\" I could hear her bite out. \"Just let it all in, and let yourself rest it all off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grabbed at his stomach, pulling up to coax him to rise out of the chair. The two went over to the living room, with Peter's walk reduced to a stagger as the weight of his overly bloated stomach hung down on him like he was cradling a medicine ball. When they were out the couch, he let himself fall down into the cushions on his side, his face pointing away from me as Melanie sauntered over behind the couch, eyes low and loving as she reached down and massaged his tight middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gregory?\" She said distractedly. \"Why don't you go ahead and take a break?\"</span></div></div>",

They're absolutely magnificent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Peter, are you still hungry? Don't worry, I'll just order up another lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another rip? Don't worry, dear. In a place like this, that <i>can't</i> be the first time that's happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all of a week's work of gushing, praise, and sensual rubbing, Peter never answered with anything louder than a distracted snort or a low nod of his head, often still left with several plates before his mouth was free to move. Give Melanie credit, if all her constant pandering was genuine, she certainly wasn't a gold digger; never once did I witness Peter act remotely charming or romantic towards her, and yet she returned his munching with all the love that her heart could give, always standing near him with a twinkle in her eyes, like his mere presence was a rare privilege.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the two of them be with one another drew on into more of a chore, however. Nothing insufferable, mind you, but most of the days went by in total silence as the two of them just stood around with Melanie always squished against his back, nuzzling him from above. I'd tried losing myself in the wedding preparations to find any kind of a distraction from them, but without any direction as to what they specifically wanted the ceremony to be like, being forced to stay in the penthouse for such a long time got all the more tiring. Melanie never broke out of her infatuation enough to tell me what her specific desires for the arrangements were, and with Peter's stomach getting bigger and bigger, none of the suits we'd had tailored for him never lasted any longer than two days, and he showed absolutely no emotion as he ripped his way through both Octavia's patience and thousands of dollars worth of material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lower...lower...lower...lower...\" I instructed to Miles. He stood on top of a super-reinforced metal stepladder sitting beneath the wedding arch, one hand busy feeding him a burrito while the other was held over his head, carefully lowering a bouquet of plastic roses down in front of the archway's crux. \"lower...lower...lower...aaaaaaand...<i>there!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped his arm, then held the burrito in his mouth to use both hands to fasten down the bouquet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Looks good!\" I approved, shooting him a thumb's up, then turned around to observe the rest of the scene behind us. \"Looks...well adjusted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, were it not for the fact that it was being held in Gaia 2.0, the wedding looked insultingly plain, the arrangements probably not even mounting up to a thousand dollars. The railway of the penthouse's balcony was all wound up by vines of bushel that were periodically dotted by pink roses, and the empty flooring was spanned by a wide semicircle of plastic white chairs that surrounded the altar. One end of the balcony was reserved to a dining area made up of similarly bland tables and chairs, draped by white table cloths with the plates, utensils, and floral centerpieces all laid out, while the other end was a dance floor complete with a DJ booth, lights, and two tables sitting against the guard rail, a long one for the buffet, and a round one for the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles came to my side, joining me in looking over the preparations as he pushed the last of the burrito down his throat with one finger. At any other time, a job as easy as this would've been something out of a wet dream of mine, but as it all sat right in front of me, I couldn't help but feel disturbed by the cheapness of it all, to see it in a world where bottled water came with golden leaves floating inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind going through a quick brush-through, Miles?\" I asked, and the immense goat gave a nod before walking towards the dance floor, already tearing open a bag of pork rinds. I made my way over to the sliding doors and into the living room, listening for Melanie's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Another popped button?\" </i>It came from over at the master bedroom. <i>\"Oh, well. We can visit Octavia tonight, then.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Grove?\" I spoke, going their way. The door to their room was wide open, the lights inside turned on. \"We've got the preparations set up for the wedding, and I was wondering if you wanted to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Anyways, you should <i>definitely</i> try one of these churros!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two didn't notice me as I came up the doorway, continuing as I stood frozen in place. Peter didn't answer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, what's the matter, sweetie?\" She asked, lips pouting slightly. \"Don't you want something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and he stood facing one another, Peter with his arms outstretched while dressed up in a new suit, and Melanie with her head shaking slightly as she looked down at a few button's that's been popped off along his stomach, exposing a sliver of the gray, piling ocean of mass hidden within, its middle darkened by his belly button. He was still a deal shorter than her, but ever since switching from the real world's food to that of Gaia 2.0's, his weight'd skyrocketed in record time, and thus his once humble potbelly had quickly exploded out into a unyieldingly monstrous gut that proudly amassed in a massive orb that had a garment straddled along its underside that kept it from getting dirtied up, overwhelming all of his entire being's shape from the ponderous hills of his chest to a wide expanse of the wooden floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least give them a taste, then. Wouldn't want these to go to waste, would we?\" There was still that sing-song essence to her voice, the kind she used whenever she was showing her affection, but something about it was now laced with a hint of aggression, like part of her was daring him to say no. That wasn't what shocked me, though, what truly chilled me to my bone about the scene playing for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that, as Melanie held a silver platter of churros in front of his face, he wasn't opening up and downing it all down. In fact, he seemed <i>intimidated</i> by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Peter took the plate back, clearly at ends on whether or not to eat it, I caught my guard back and sidestepped back into the hallway, clearing my throat. \"...Miss Grove?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hm?</i>\" I could hear the floor creak under her footfalls before she leaned partway through the door, smiling earnestly. \"Yes, Gregory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd, uh...wanted to talk to you about the wedding arrangements!\" I answered, having to remember why I wanted to see her in the first place. \"Would you like to have a look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to!\" She merrily replied, coming out all the way. She lead herself down to the sliding doors, eliciting some giddy squeal as she saw all the floral decorations ready for the big event, but it was partially turned to white noise as I halfheartedly followed behind, gaze lingering on the light coming from their bedroom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mn...\" I groaned. \"...I give up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stress of the wedding was eased up by Melanie's approval of all the decorations, and what'd I'd seen happening with Peter was only a vague afterthought by then, but for whatever reason, my bed just wouldn't let me fall asleep that night. I'd spent hours tossing and turning around, trying to find that magic position that I could never quite remember, but it remained as elusive as ever. I was wide awake when I just decided to get up and leave the bed behind, deciding to take a break from the darkness of the butler's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quietly as I could, I strode across the penthouse and over to the balcony doors, the sky of the dome outside having been converted into a starry night as I made my way out. The pseudo-moon cast enough light to see all the decorations as silhouettes, their shadows visible along the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went over to the guard rail and, careful not to disrupt the bushel, folded my arms over the rim and stared out at the ocean, the moon's reflection refracted into a swarm of shimmering lights. It was rare sight, to see the Glass Tornado in nighttime mode, and I gave a smile as I took advantage of the privilege, taking in a deep breath of the crisp, warm ai-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>THUMP</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...huh?\" I turned my head over to the noise, looking down near the other end of the balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>THUMP</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound came again, but this time was accompanied by two burly arms bursting through one of the penthouse's windows, making me jump. Their hands waved around till they both found the wall outside, and they pushed down, the owner's head and part of their chest wriggling their way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell?\" I swiftly ran over to them, still trying to make as little noise as possible, but I nearly stumbled when I was close enough to recognize who it was, despite it being so dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Peter, his chest's mounds keeping him wedged firmly within the window as he tried to force his way through. His eyes were clenched shut, teeth gritted as he pushed against the wall, but it kept him held tightly in place, and he soon resigned with a tired sigh as his shoulders drooped. An almost hopeless look crossed his face as he caught his breath, his head hung low, but then his eyes twitched my way and went wide as he realized I was standing there, watching him in utter confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...hey, hey fella! You've gotta help me!\" He desperately pleaded to me. \"Listen, <i>you've gotta get me out of here!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't immediately answer, still reeling in the fact that I was hearing him speak for the first time, and all the questions in my mind all came out as one. \"...excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started trying to push himself through again, speaking through a clenched jaw. \"Gotta...get...out of here! She's <i>crazy!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" I rubbed my forehead. \"I'm sorry, sir, but you've gotta explain to me a little more. What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's friggin' <i>crazy,</i> is what's going on!\" He explained, shooting a thumb behind him. \"I'd just met her last week! I hadn't even heard of her before, but one minute later, she's always hanging around me, treating me like I'm her boyfriend! I'd used to be a friggin'...</span></div></div>",

His fingers dragged along the wall's molding till they were dearly clinging to the windowsill, and he gave one last fearful whimper before another yank tugged them loose, pulling him all the way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The <i>hell?!</i>\" I thought aloud, hearing a tussle inside that was minced with his pleas for help. I took a fondue pot off the buffet line and set it down on a chair, then got up on the tabletop to watch in on the scene, having to stand on my tiptoes to see over the windowsill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter grabbed for anything in reach as he got dragged along the floor by his ankles, Melanie with a bemused look on her face as she threw him back onto the bed, sinking an elbow down into his belly to keep him pinned on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, sweetie,\" she began sternly. \"You know I won't be comfortable being around you if we don't look issues like these right in the eye. If our marriage is going to stay intact, then we need to found a relationship that's built off of communication and mutual respect! Don't you understand that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't gonna marry you for <i>shit,</i> you bitch!\" He spat at her. \"The fuck kind of relationship you looking for when you've gotta pin me down to the bed, anyway?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie reared her head back, but not out of surprise. She seemed more <i>ashamed</i> than anything, her head shaking out of pity. \"Sacrifice is the backbone to every good romance, Peter, and I'd like to think I'd given plenty of myself to make you happy. I'd gotten you into Gaia 2.0, of all things! Is it too much to ask for anything in return, to see a little bit of effort on your part? Where is it, Peter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but you sure as hell ain't gonna find it<i> here!</i>\" He retorted, rocking about to break free of her. \"C'mon, just...lemme <i><b>go</b></i>, you psycho!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie's frown deepened, and she reached both hands behind her back. \"Well, I'm sorry, but I don't like us being as far as we are if one of us can't trust the another. However,\" She pulled her shirt up, stripping herself into to a lacy black bra. \"I can fix that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she threw the shirt down on top of his stomach, and as he craned his head up to look at his topless captor, Peter froze. The darkness of the room helped cover up the seams, making it look as though Melanie's body really was mostly naked, but as both of our eyes adjusted to the dim light, we could both see that she was actually dressed up in some slim-fitting garment that closely matched the color of her fur. The anger on his face ebbed away into a look of remembrance, a realization whose implication seemed to bring on a slew of terrible memories that filled his heart with a great well of fear, distracting him long enough for her to take off her pants and throw them on top of him, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" He sputtered, his lip quivering. \"N-No...no, please! <i>DON'T DO IT!!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a deep breath, dear.\" She spoke evenly, her tone devoid of any sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun around, bending over so that her big behind was hovering just above his face. He desperately pushed against her cheeks, trying to wrestle himself as though she were about to smother his face, but she didn't lower it onto him. Not <i>yet</i>, at least. Whilst humming a merry tune, she brought her hands down to the root of her tail, fidgeting with the head of a zipper that traveled along the valley of her butt crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled it down, and when the zipper was unzipped enough that her compacted behind was able to freely push its way through, she churned out a moan of overwhelmed pleasure as the lower part of her corset was thrown off by her legs exploding in mass, instantly transforming her body's shape into that of an enormous, white pear that was wider than the bed. The weight of her newly gigantic butt cheeks was enough for them to hang low and swallow up Peter's head, his arms and legs thrashing about as he tried to let loose some muffled screams, but Melanie still made sure to let herself lower down and bring all the crushing weight of her body on top of his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring his thrashing, she flipped open a tiny beauty mirror and began to check up on her make up, and through the entire debacle, I just stood still in terrified silence, ignoring the pain of standing right on the ends of my toes as I watched, unsure of what to do. The movement of his limbs eventually began to simmer down, as did the urgency in his voice, and I feared the worst as he briefly held them up with what looked like the last errant of his strength, keeping them erect in one final pose of resistance before they slumped down, limp at his sides. Having noticed he'd stopped moving, Melanie looked over her shoulder and got back up, the weight of her buttocks still resting on top of him even when she was standing up nice and tall, and she actually had to reaching down with her hands and hoist them off of him, straddling to the side. With Peter's head allowed to breath air again, his eyes were wide and drained of emotion, but to my relief, his chest was still rising and falling from his breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie came low, and with her stomach and breasts as large as they were, she had to do so by rolling onto her back, the extra padding on her behind angling her feet up as she brought her muzzle to Peter's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me very closely, dear.\" She spoke, making his ear twitch. \"You want to eat. You <i>have</i> to eat, to eat everything in reach at every waking hour, always getting bigger and bigger. Try as you may, though, you're never full. You're <i>never</i> big enough, never satisfied. <i>Always</i> hungry for more. Do you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter sucked on his lower lip, than gave a single nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" She said approvingly, coming in to give him a kiss on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got up on her feet, picking up the downed half of her corset, I saw my cue to duck, maybe scram over to Miss Holmes' office to beg for help, but the notion of making a single sound terrified me too much to move. To even breathe, which I didn't know I was holding in until I caught myself and, as slowly as I possibly could, bent my legs down to slip away from view...</span></div></div>",

It's just that no one expected her to finally settle down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she did have good taste. And this woman was quite beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bride was a leopard woman, in her mid-twenties and somewhere between 15 and 18 feet tall. She was covered in orange fur with black spots, had black hair reaching her mid-back in a ponytail and green eyes. She might have been smaller then Melanie, but she was still huge. Her breasts were like overinflated beach balls, barely contained in her top. Her belly was twice her breasts size, and like Melanie's, it wobbled with every little movement. Her hips were nearly 10 feet wide, and her butt stuck out like a shelf. She was wearing a black jacket with a blue top under it, white jeans, and a pair of blue platform heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was looking around the lobby, clearly impressed by the opulance around her. Her smile was reaching from ear to ear. I decide to walk over to introduce myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there.\" I say in my most professional voice. The woman looks down at me \"My name is Gregory. I'm assuming you're Melanie's soon to be wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nodded. \"My name is Tina Blake, soon to be Tina Grove!\" The woman said, in a cheery Louisiana accent. \"I ain't never really been to a place so grand lookin' before! It's amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do pride ourselves on giving out guests the greatest luxary possible.\" I say. \"I will be assisting you and Melanie with your wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's my blushing bride!\" I hear Melanie say as she walks over. She kisses Tina on the cheek, then looks at meet. \"I see you've met Tina already.\"<br>\r\nI nod. \"Is there anything I should know to make this the best three weeks of your life?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one thing.\" Tina says. \"I have Gannett's Syndrome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd heard of that. It was a rare condition tha caused the infected to perpetually gain weight, even if they don't eat. There's another guest here with it, but from the looks of it, Tina's far nicer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" I say. \"We'll make your stay as comfortable as possible. Now, where would you like to go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie and Tina looked at each other, whispered to each other for a second, then looked at me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie was the one to answer. \"We'd like to go...\"</span></div></div>",

Please follow me to the monorail.\" With that, I turned and headed in the direction of the monorail station, Melanie and Tina following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nIt took a few hours (Limestone Ridge is a bit out of the way, even for Gaia 2.0), but we did arrive at Limestone Ridge's station. The three of us got off, and left the station quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to admit, I always did enjoy visiting the Ridge. Home to probably the worlds only indoor mountain, Mt. Ciel Divis\u00e9, everything was made to be beautiful. I'd even heard rumor that Mt. Ciel Divis\u00e9 was here before Gaia 2.0, and is hiding a lost platinum, but no one's found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Limestone Ridge.\" I said in my most professional voice. \"Now, where will the wedding be taking place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ski Lodge 12.\" Melanie said. \"It's supposed to be half-way up the mountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and motioned for the two brides-to-be to follow me to the sky trolley, which was connected to the station. The three of us got in, and the trolley started to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if I may ask, how did you two meet?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Tina started. \"Melanie held a contest. Whoever one would get to visit her studio. I was the winner. I went, and Melanie took a liking to me.

Just then, the trolley stopped. \"We've arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stepped out of the trolley, and made our way to Ski Lodge 12. It was actually the smallest of the lodges, but still huge. It was also the newest lodge.<br>\r\nWhen we got to the lodge, a male gecko man greeted Melanie. I assumed he was one of the wedding planners.

The latest and greatest of our accommodations at Limestone Ridge, Lodge Twelve!\" I made a sweeping gesture around the lobby, and couldn't hide my smirk at how the two women's eyes lit up. The whole place was a huge timber cabin, with one wall dominated by windows that gave a fantastic view of the mountains outside. As for the interior, the wood floor was polished to a sheen; even reflecting the plush seats and old-timey rocking chairs by the roaring fireplace. The chairs circling a glass-top coffee table neatly decorated with flowers and candles. A massive flatscreen TV rested on a classy wooden shelf, tuned to a jazz channel for atmosphere; on either side of the shelf were large bookshelves packed to the gills with literature.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Holmes may have been a ruthless, hard-driving heifer of a boss; and made no secret that she found humans delicious, but she <i>knew</i> how to decorate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelainie smiled at the promise of a warm fire, and she scooted over there almost immediately, Tina following her. They sat close to the fire and warmed their hands as I kept schmoozing it up: \"Lodge Twelve is our smallest lodge, but that doesn't mean we skimped on amenities. You ladies will find all the comforts of our larger lodges here...with an added benefit of privacy. Less chance of papparazzi, or fans pestering for autographs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both chuckled at that. The whole lodge was empty save for us--the brides-to-be must have rented out the whole place for their special day. There wouldn't be <i>anyone</i> in here besides the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clapped my hands together. \"So, ladies...make yourselves at home! You can rest assured we'll make your special day unforgettable!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got a little applause for that, Tina leaning down to nuzzle me. \"Aww, you practiced that little speech just for us; didn't you?\"<br>\r\n\"Such a gentleman!\" Melaine added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd actually made it up on the spot, but they didn't need to know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ahem...\"</i> <br>\r\nWe all turned to the voice. It was the gecko wedding planner who'd come in with them. \"I hate to interrupt, but; uh, we have some details to clear up...starting with the music.\" He brandished a clipboard, looking nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sized the guy up. He was on the scrawny side, wore thick glasses and a grey three-piece suit that didn't quite look right with his green scales. The outfit looked so fresh he might have bought it this morning--the creases on the pants looked sharp enough to shave with. But what struck me the most was his size: 9 feet tall, give or take a few inches. Most anthros I'd seen at Gaia 2.0 were BIG--some \"only\" as tall as a street light, others could look an office building in the eye. Hell, the resort's maximum allowed hieght was 100 feet...and I'd heard we were planning some expansions to cater to anthros even BIGGER than that! So, when you've been around anthros who could LITERALLY hold you in the palm of their hand, seeing one who'd be at home on a human basketball court is a bit odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(And no, I wasn't spacing out or staring. All that went through my head in a flash. With my job, you learn to think quickly.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the music, Mister...erm--\" I trailed off. I realized none of us had caught his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Larry Izzard. No relation to Eddy Izzard the comedian, and yes; I know that makes my intials 'L. Izzard'.\" He provided, nervousness falling to roll his eyes. His jittery mood returned as he looked at the clipboard, and the two larger ladies. \"Uh, Miss Tina did request the playlist be largely composed of Melainie's 'greatest hits'. But it seems there was an issue with timing and rights; so...ahem, our DJ put a substantial number of COVERS on the playlist.\" He winced, looking like...well, like a HUMAN who just pissed off a giant anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina's cheery mood fell like an anvil. <i>\"What?\"</i> she hissed, claws coming out. Melaine's eyes widened, Larry and I took a step back. \"Covers? Covers?! It's our special day, and the DJ won't even play my sweetie singing her OWN MUSIC?! We get some karaoke?! I don't--I can't--That's---UGH!\" She stomped her foot, making her ample belly jiggle and wave. \"That's ridiculous. Fix it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tina's anger delfated, and she hang her head in shame. \"Oh, listen to me! I'm throwing a fit like a bratty child; and over something so trivial! I'm sorry for snapping...\" Melanie hugged her and we all assured her it was fine; eventually her bright mood returned and she was calm again. <br>\r\nBut in the pit of my gut? I knew this was gonna be rough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing about those \"brides-from-hell\" shows I mentioned? The brides who KNEW they were being Bridezillas were WORSE than the ones who thought they were right. They could swing from a screaming fit to crying apologies at the drop of a hat. And that just primed their mood to be on MORE of a hair trigger, even if they were normally friendly and pleseant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry gulped. \"Ah; it's okay ma'am. We'll get it sorted ASAP, you two just relax.\"<br>\r\nI nodded along with him, helping to get the pair settled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so later the pair were off skiing, leaving Larry and I alone in the lodge. We'd set out charts and plans for the wedding, trying to get everything organized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd our first order of business was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gaia 2.0 meets universal acclaim as one of the most ambitious vacation spots ever made, but only for the wealthiest clients. Our story begins on December 15th during a particularly brutal snowstorm for the winter, yet guests are still able to find means of trickling into the suites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the highest of the highest 1% could afford to live more than half a day, that being anthros, the highest of the social circle in the world. Any human wanting a peek inside can buy a $500 visitor's pass for an hour inside. That, or they're hiring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">The Tour</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Aether Suites: </b>The main hotel, built with beautifully furnished rooms, fine dining, a spacious courtyard complete with a swimming pool and a tennis court, and easy and quick service willing to step up to every desire at every moment. The Aether Suites connects to every facility in the resort, with miniature tentacle locations built in the Glass Tornado and Limestone Ridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The White Brimstone:</b> The resort's most famous restaurant, boasting a five-star rating that even then can't match anything served. Every single ingredient down to the condiments is made and farmed from scratch, making anything on their menu impossible to recreate. Their most expensive meal costs 10,000 dollars, and their least 300.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Glass Tornado: </b>Not just the pool facility of the resort, but also a perfectly simulated tropical island beneath a dome that constantly maintains a warm environment, even in winter. A wave pool surrounds the entire body of land, crashing waves along its sandy shores, while the heart of the island is a mountainous landscape built with numerous boardwalks, pools, saunas, spas, cantinas, and a diverse waterpark descending from its tallest peak. Their deepest pool is not only over 200 feet deep, but features underwater suites for more aqua-savvy guests, along with an air-filled alcove deep below containing the Aurora night club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Aurora Night Club:</b> An arctic-themed exclusive night club at the very bottom of the Glass Tornado's main pool, open nightly and available by regular water taxis that travel down from the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Diamond Mines: </b>The basement for the Aether Suites, and also a cavernous shopping mall that's home to the biggest collection of brand names, beauty services, and (of course) food chains in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Opticuluum:</b> A gigantic movie theater that houses screenings for everything from films that'd been classic for decades to films whose releases aren't due for <i>months.</i> The deluxe theaters screen films with all the style and service of a gigantic opera house, using projectors that perfectly replicate the scratches and dirt of classic film, but some of the newer theaters host act as one of the rare market for the groundbreaking video tech known as Cinevie<sup>TM</sup>, one of the most expensive, yet immersive feats of seeing ever invented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Limestone Ridge:</b> Like the Glass Tornado, Limestone Pastures is a mountainous indoor region under a dome that conjures a perpetual springtime season, giving guests wanting a hike the freshest air you could find indoors, or even let them test their hand at a gigantic eighteen-hole golf course. Aside from a branch of the Aether Suites built inside, guests also have the oppurtunity to live in enormous cabins, one of which is actually Miss Holmes' mansion and office. (Created by The 12th Doctor (non canon))<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Rainbow Dome:</b> A vast, skygrazing sports multiplex in the upper regions of the resort (positioned on top of the Glass Tornado and near the Fate's Hand) where guests are allowed to spectate or participate in a wide variety of sports from around the world. There are stadiums inside dedicated to everything from baseball to (via virtual reality) skydiving, but for guests who aren't interested in games on the field, there's also an enormous video arcade that hosts some of the most immersive, addictive, and creative mediums of virtual gaming in existence. (Created by Keroro04)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Fate's Hand Casino:</b> Easily the most expensive circle of the hotel to get into, and of course the most expensive to be be able to stick around inside. The casino occupies the five-story penthouse of the Aether suites, and is so immersed in its sinful luxury that even the <i>hot tubs</i> have poker tables, but it's also a hot spot for its drinks and stage acts. However, as flashy and luscious as the place looks, it's generally the most feared by the staff to work in, given the occasional rowdy or drunk gambler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's rooms local only to the casino that are the most expensive out of all the hotel's other rooms, the Golden Suites, which all share their own pool and cocktail lounge in a dome at the very top: the absolute highest point in all the resort. It's also home to the world's largest roulette wheel; the Fate's Hand, breaking the record at 115 feet wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Monorail:</b> A high speed tram system that transports residents or workers on a cycle through every facility in Gaia 2.0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Worker's Quarters:</b> Although it's the only place in the entire resort where customers are forbidden, they aren't really missing out. This section is nowhere near the luxury of the Aether Suite's rooms, but is still clean and furnished enough that workers don't want to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Characters</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><u>The Good</u></b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gregory Wiltsead</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 5'11\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 22.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main character of the story. Gregory was one of the poor, poor souls who sought for a Gaian job in the hopes that it'd be just like one big vacation, blissfully unaware of what lay inside until his first job at the White Brimstone. Being a Gaia choreboy, he's an expert chef, bartender, blackjack dealer, translator, bodyguard, swimmer, masseuse, musician, singer, hairdresser, and even magician thanks to months of training and experience working in the resort, but those skills alone won't guarantee his survival. On the job, he tries to give off a very charming demeanor around customers and an obedient dedication to his duties, but in the coffee room, he's just as cynical as anybody with every job known to man could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis job consists of anything the resort needs; a spare cleaner, waiter, clerk, lifeguard, or even just a servant to pamper any of the guests for a certain time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Garnet Rhodes</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Swan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 7'4\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 24.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet isn't really \"skinny\", given enough pudge to give her a distinct pear figure, but she's still a perky little twig compared to a vast landslide of Gaia 2.0's patrons, or the twenty-so generations in her family line. Being the daughter of the infamous billionaire Sapphire Rhodes, she was sent to live in Gaia 2.0 at the wishes of her mother to put on a few (thousand) pounds to live up to the family image, a task she'd sadly neglected her entire stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the two being so closely related, Garnet is the sheer opposite of her mother. She has no immediate desire for fame and fortune, and is instead more content to just sit around and play guitar in her room, with little taste for the fashion or luxury from the lifestyle of a wealthy family. She'd taken a strong fondness of Gregory for his easygoing personality against the resort's insanity, and the two have managed to form a strong friendship...a friendship she lives in great fear of her mother coming across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite a great resentment for her mother's hateful attitude, she still manages to care for and respect her as family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Candace Moenks</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Dragon (European.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 10'5\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 89 (36, by dragon years.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace is the head chef of the White Brimstone, and a muscle-packed titan that'd make even other dragons turn head, with dark brown scales and jet black hair that two red horns peek through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile already a friendly and laidback soul, she has a special respect for Gregory for being able to hold his weight as the smallest member of the staff with nary a (visible) complaint, and thus is always willing to offer him a few words of advice or meal out of her fridge. Her talent for cooking is unmatched by many, one of her specialties being the use of her own breath to roast her dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a dragon, Candace has the rare ability to solidify fire. Aside from being a great ingredient for her meals, it also boasts extraordinary healing properties, in a way making her an unofficial nurse of the resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Miles Brillcott</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Goat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 10'4\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 25<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother choreboy, but one nowhere on par with Gregory's weight class. Miles is an absolute behemoth in mass even by the standards of someone with his towering stature, but his enormous weight is downright skinny in the wake of the vast amounts of food he consumes without relief throughout an entire day. It never seems like he's ever full or satisfied, perpetually shoving down large handfuls of junk food that he somehow keeps hidden on his person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eats even in the most tense or dangerous situations, but when he hears the call, he's still a hard worker and loyal friend who unquestioningly throws himself into the line of fire to save others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rarely feels the need to speak, but when he does, he does so in an incredibly soothing, articulate manner, and with a ripe British accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Miss Blanc</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Moth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 24'9\" (Is always seated, full height is hard to estimate.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 318.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot many of the staff know much about Miss Blanc other than that during however long she'd been a guest, her thorax had somehow grown to the point where it completely occupied what was once the room next door, while her staunch obesity renders her unable to stand up or walk around. As such, she leads a very lazy lifestyle of reading and snacking that only fattens her up even worse, but recently had been able to taper off into a more manageable speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to her insectoid senses, she can perceive or interact with things that are impossible for mammal eyes to see. While the other workers tend to steer away from her, Gregory took an interest in Miss Blanc for her mysterious, yet gentle nature,  and she in turn gladly welcomes him to the lonely confines of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spends most of her free time studying on ethereal arts, but she also loves playing video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gertrude Carmine</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Orca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 28'9\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 26.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lifeguard at The Glass Tornado's beach pool, and also a kind, albeit whistle-crazy neurotic that goes into panic mode at even the tiniest act against the pool rules. While some wouldn't be surprised at how colossally fat she is, given she's literally a whale, she's an extremely fast swimmer that can slice through water at neckbreaking speeds, able to stop and turn on a dime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mavis Thymes</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Penguin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 9'11\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 36.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Miss Holmes, the owner of Gaia 2.0 owns and operates every inch of the resort's flooring on her own hand, Mavis is her vice, manager, and extra hand for the Aurora Nightclub. However, while Holmes is quick to send in any of the staff to get a job done, Mavis seeks to lessen their workloads and actually tends to hire <i>herself</i> for most of the jobs in the club, rarely asking anybody to help her out unless she thinks it's absolutely needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis is very fat to keep herself warm in the coldest areas of the resort, but is still a very skilled swimmer, not unlike Gertrude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Michelle Orrid</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Cockroach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 10'9\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 27.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA relentlessly fussy maid stationed in the Aether Suites. She may be enormously fat, but if there's anything she's not, it's a slob; she refuses to leave her room if she isn't totally convinced every inch of her body's been properly rinsed and loofa'd, and can't step foot into a room without finding something to snark over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has high standards of hygiene whenever she's working with others, but tries to make up for it with enough wisecracks and praise for her coworkers to enjoy being around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kalinka Tuporev</b> (created by Iruiel)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 5'9\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 21.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA radio DJ and radio/electronics/electrical specialist from Eastern Europe. She's bubbly, friendly, and is good with her music, but if a client wants specific styles, is willing to go to great lengths to make perfect soundtracks for a night or two. For this, getting a gig, even if not permanent at a place such as the Aurora Nightclub at this prestigious resort is a big deal for her. If not fit for that duty, she's certainly got a lot of heart and can do most menial tasks easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtremely flamboyant thanks to her attire, which generally consists of a pair of normal slacks, white dress shirt, but a hand-stitched vest of a myriad of colors and patterns, coupled with handmade braids, chains, and ribbons adorning her arms. She wears loafers or high-tops, depending on what she's doing, and on top of her head, she wears a put-together fedora complete with several feathers of varying colors-depending on the day or how she's feeling. Orange-auburn hair, with braids on one side and a bobcut on the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Raine</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Raccoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 8'6\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: Early twenties, by estimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nickname given by Gaia 2.0's staff to a very heavyset Raccoon who lives somewhere between the walls of the Aether Suites. Nobody knows who she is, where she's come from, or even how long she's been freeloading in the resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn person, she's a very quiet, yet quirky and creative soul who enjoys taking minor trinkets left laying around in the hotel for herself, assembling them into elaborate sculptures or inventions she houses inside her hideout. For somebody of her weight, she's actually very agile and stealthy, and also a brilliant escape artist who can think her way out of almost any tough spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile there is a great effort by the staff to hunt Raine down and kick her out (all of which have been met with failure), she doesn't mean any harm towards anybody inside, and actually has a knack for yanking people out of harm's way, even carrying them to her hideout safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Katrina Reinhart</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Kitsune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 9'11\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 30.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she's rather fat, Katrina was an ambitious and lively prodigy in her theatre classes prior to her employment, and had a close shot at making a name for herself as an actress but certain financial troubles forced her to put her dreams on hold and find a job operating one of the Diamond Mine's mine carts, one of the resort's most common jobs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's deeply ashamed of her job, and doesn't go out of her way to chat it up with others, but she has a deep sense of compassion for workers who get the full brunt of everything the resort throws at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lisa Meroni</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Dove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 10'10\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 28.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second half to Kira Irnov, the most famous magician to perform at the Fate's Hand Casino. Despite hailing from the bronx of New York when Kira was born in Russia, the two of them can be transformed into perfect doppelgangers of one another with the right makeup and clothing, and are frequently paired as body doubles to make their illusions all the more impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's existence is sworn to secrecy by Kira and the staff, only able to leave her room if she's in disguise or posing as Kira. While a lot more laid back and mischievous than Kira, Lisa can still strut around with the same amount of grace, vigor, and even acrobatics as the true showman of her routines. She even has the same ability to compress her massively obese body to that of what'd be a skinny human's build, another talent that's often exploited for their shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa has a nature far more caring and humble than that of her artificial twin, but tends to rely on muscle memory alone to prepare for her shows, being quite fond of just laying around and vegging out instead of practicing. It's only at the last weeks or so that she meets her deadlines, a habit that never fails to grate on Kira's nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Karen Asbrooke</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 5'8\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 46.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst taking the title with humility, Karen is the world's leading expert in breeding feral gryphons, a rapidly declining species that were thought only to be mythical for many years. She seems just as sociable and polite as any normal human would seem on the outside, but she's actually received massive funding and fame for her success in rejuvenating he population enough to grow independently, and stands as one of richest humans to ever live (if not <i>the.</i>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her demands aren't high, she doesn't go anywhere without her pet gryphon, Milna, whose life she values like she would a person's. Karen spoils and pampers Milna at chance she gets, to a point where she constantly overfeeds her. Thus, while still considered healthy, Milna is considerably larger and heavier than the average gryphon tends to be, and absolutely <i>despises</i> the feeling of being left on an empty stomach, even if it's just for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she can't speak, Milna is almost as intelligent as a human, and absolutely refuses to let anything get in the way between her and her next snack...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ivana Tonalo</b> (created by The 12th Doctor (non canon))<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Tiger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 8'10''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 27.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvana works in the Fate's Hand Casino as a lounge singer. She's known for having a sultry voice, whether singing or not, and for having a gargantuan ass. Her upper body is slim, but her ass can fill an entire couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she isn't singing, she can be found living in the lap of luxury. Everything for her is to be expensive and top-of-the-line, but she is still friendly with the staff, especially Gregory. She's also obsessed with her ass: she has it pampered every minute she isn't singing, and is often seen caressing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Felicia Comelo</b> (created by The 12th Doctor (non canon))<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Bee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 9'6''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 40.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia is the beautiful queen of a traveling bee hive. She is unusually tall for a bee, as most are usually 5 or 6 feet. She is also absurdly large breasted: they're at least as big as wrecking balls, and just as heavy, so Felicia needs workers to help lift them. Her chest size is a symbol of status: every queen before her has had huge breasts, she's simply the biggest so far, a good thing since she's obsessed with her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being pampered her entire life, Felicia wants to try and be more self-reliant. So she's left a temporary queen at the hive (a friend of hers, who's also responsible for creating new bees) to go on vacation (though she still needs two workers, Hailey and Miki, to lift her breasts). She comes of as demanding and a diva, though she doesn't mean to. She has a ways to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yazuki Barimoto</b> (created by Keroro04)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Chameleon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 26'5\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 27.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYazuki is a brilliant electronics specialist who works as the resort's lead technician. She's the main source of tech knowhow who equips and accessorizes the resort with all the rare, state of the art technology that plays a big part in the luxurious Gaian experience, and also acts as the electrician who keeps everything in top running order. She often prefers to tinker around or work alone her room, and tends to be pretty nervous around others, but meeting Gregory and the rest of the staff have helped her learn how to be more open. She's not lazy, either, but a lifetime of sitting around and studying up on tech magazines helped lead her to slowly (but surely) put on incredibly massive amounts of weight, most of which amassed in her thighs, ass, and tail, supplying her with a fantastic pear shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYazuki lives in an apartment hidden in the Rainbow Dome, and spends most of her time fixing up the arcade games built for guests 20' and up. Being such a huge gamer, she's one of the few who routinely visits Miss Blanc for gaming sessions, and is often around when Gregory drops by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer scales' natural color is green, with black hair, but they tend to shift based on her mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Octavia Aaron</b> (created by Keroro04)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Octopus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 16'3\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 31.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia is the owner for a clothing boutique down in the diamond mines, where she lives in her own personal water tank. Sadly, she doesn't always have time for herself to lay back and have fun, but she's still a friendly and peppy soul around everybody she meets, whether they're a worker or customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin is bright pink, and she's fat enough to ticken out almost as wide as she is tall, but her weight is carried mostly above in her breasts and her hips underneath, which are composed of six <i>very </i>thick tentacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gwen Teverton</b> (created by The 12th Doctor (non canon))<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 15' 3''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 24.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen is a grey-colored spider woman with long black hair, 6 red eyes, a human mouth with fangs, and a spider-like lower half. But her most notably feature is that, like Felicia Comelo, she is absurdly large breasted, but not as heavy (she can move without help).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen is the daughter of Teverton Tech CEO, Carla Teverton, and the heir to Carla's incredible fortune. However, unlike her outgoing mother, Gwen is extremely shy and withdrawn, preferring to stay inside with her science-fiction and fantasy books. She is also extremely embarrassed by her breasts, always trying in vain to cover them. Her mother has brought her to Gaia to hopefully make Gwen less shy, though so far it hasn't worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Carla Teverton</b> (created by The 12th Doctor (non canon))<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 35' 6''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 47.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla is Gwen's mother, a Black Widow spider with short white hair, 6 red eyes like her daughter, and a spider-like lower half. Her human-like half is incredibily obese, but still beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla is the CEO of Teverton Tech, and one of the richest women in the country. When not running her company, she's often out with friends, flirting with whatever guy or girl catches her eye. She's divorced from her husband, but still on speaking terms with him. She's at Gaia for a vacation, and has brought Gwen with her to make her more outgoing, but has been failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Salama Dalamander</b> (created by Aegislash13)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 5' 3\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 21<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalama Dalamander is a scarlet red dragon anthro with green eyes and jet black scruffy hair. He is an Athletic Runner that competes in many Olympic styled races. He has a toned body type but is skinny over all. Salama sticks out like a sore thumb because of how much skinnier he is compared to the rest of the anthros in Gaia 2.0, due to how little he eats due to his occupation, and has many sponsors because of how well he performs from various sports related products. Salama was given a vacation ticket to Gaia 2.0 because he was competing in too many races and is required to take time off and let others get a chance. He doesn't like to share this but he has an affinity for bellys, big protruding ones. *nudge, nudge* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia Moenks</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Dragon (European.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 98\u20197\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 597 (Still in her prime)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe richer-than-chocolate mother to Candace and Olivia Moenks. Amelia is objectively the greatest chef in history, in both past and likely future, having invented cooking techniques that pioneered the way for cooking today, and owning hundreds of restaurants and TV shows known throughout the world. Centuries spent in a lifestyle of constant taste-testing and indulging with no abandon have transformed her into a Titaness of scaled lard, like a (more so!) giant, overinflated version of her fatter daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile sharp as a tack for somebody that\u2019s technically an elder, having to live for nearly eight centuries and at such a size has severely impacted her ability to process age. Anybody who\u2019s less than a hundred years of age she can only see as teens, and anybody less than half her weight as being severely malnourished. At the brunt of this is Candace and Olivia, whom she can never ignore being \u201cto skinny\u201d or not having a boyfriend. Olivia is surprisingly affectionate towards her mother (and cooking,) but the more fit-built Candace seems more than a little eager to stray from her mother and her addicting meals...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gaia Holmes</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 99\u201911.9999999\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 28.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToronto Holmes\u2019 much-adored eldest niece, and the anticipated heiress of the Gaia 2.0 fortune. With Toronto coming in herself at second, Gaia achieves a distant victory as the biggest member of the Holmes family tree. Not only does Gaia loom head, shoulders and chest over her beloved \u201cAuntie Tee\u201d, she carries a catastrophically round, heavy body that makes the tremendously Miss Holmes looked starved in comparison, with a particularly large amount of weight focused in her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it\u2019s only the sheer difference in size and age that separates Gaia from being a perfect doppelg\u00e4nger to Toronto, carrying the very same southern accent that is engrained in her aunt\u2019s words. But its their physical forms where any semblance ends. To Miss Holmes, a Mathematical and capitalist genius whose high IQ has left her cold, stone-faced and aloof, Gaia is her total opposite: kind, smiley, warm, and as dumb as the dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><u>The Bad</u></b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sapphire Rhodes</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Swan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 20'7\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 48.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aforementioned mother of Garnet, Sapphire is the head of an incredibly popular fashion line in the UK, but is still feared by many in reach for her brazenly large ego and burning distaste for anybody outside of her species...<i>especially</i> humans. She'd spent so much time indulging herself with a wealthy lifestyle that she's the size of a house, which, while boasting an enormous stomach and bust, is above all known for a body that swells her ass out into an enormous pear shape, which she always dresses up in expensive fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire has such a desperate need to fill her family's image that she'd sent her daughter to live in Gaia 2.0 to gain weight as she had, but still has a genuine love for her as a daughter and does everything she can to support her, unless such goals cross the streams with her desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't actually live in Gaia 2.0, but may be due for a visit, soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Olivia Moenks</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Dragon (European.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 10'5\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 89 (36, by dragon years.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia is the lead instructor of the Glass Tornado's beach gym, and Candace's identical twin, save for one<i>...simple</i> difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia's known to be incredibly mean or rude to \"slackers\" during her workouts, despite the fact that she herself is ridiculously obese, constantly eats junk food, and is so lazy that she always moves around on a reinforced metal panel with wheels screwed in (and is quick to retaliate on the fools who point it out...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Candace are constantly at one another's throats; Candace for having gotten Olivia the job in the first place when she'd been unemployed for years, and Olivia for constantly being \"nagged\" on by her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kim Pryce</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Alligator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 17'7\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 27.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim is a lottery winner and a monstrous fatass thanks to constant chowing down at the snack bar, but also hulks with muscle thanks to working out at the Glass Tornado. She loves every ounce of her size and gets her kicks out of tormenting 'skinnies' on the beach, whether it be by wrestling with them or just kicking sand in their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...just minus the fifteen minute a day workout ad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stacey Ghray</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 15'8\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 29.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey was a popular supermodel characterized for her semi-monochromatic appearance: she has a white coat of feathers specked with black along her chest, ash-colored circles around her eyes, an ebony beak, short black hair, ruby red eyes, and even white flames, making her a famous trademark for many fashion boutiques. However, she's been retired as of six months, and has used part of her amassed earnings to live in Gaia 2.0 for over two years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the life of a model, she'd never been allowed to pamper herself with a nice, hearty meal, but after discovering the life of overindulgence had quickly become addicted. Now eating is the only thing she ever wants to do, ballooning her once lanky figure so much that she has almost doubled in height in under a month, and it only gets worse as the ride goes on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's quick to enrage, should any of her demands not be met. Not that miss Holmes doesn't mind sending people over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Velma Krueger</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 26'5\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 25.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma is a renowned specialist in tattoos, dying and branding (two furred/feathered equivalents to a tattoo), and operates her own parlor in the Diamond Mines almost on her lonesome. She holds numerous records for being able to print incredibly intricate, colorful, and vast expanses of body art in short amounts of time, but her most prided achievement is a heavily detailed mural of her own design along a stomach that she'd needled herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only part of her body with any natural color left is her head, with fur fading to black on her ears beneath long, rust-colored hair, but anything from her cheeks to her feet is as white as snow. She's incredibly large and fat, but an abnormal majority of her weight hangs in front of her on her belly, and has no qualms about making it bigger to supply herself with more canvas to work on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile not one itching to bite into someone's neck, she has a hot temper whenever she's working with anybody under her skill level, or dealing with a customer who questions her talent. That attitude tends to reach a peak with humans, who she feels can't match the precision of an anthro coworker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kira Irnov</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Dove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 10'10\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 28.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA world-renowned magician who performs monthly shows at the Fate's Hand Casino. Kira was once a highly skilled circus performer who could perform incredible feats of acrobatics, magic, and physical comedy despite being so obese, looking almost weightless when she was flying about in the air. She always makes sure to keep her old talents in top working order, but also has a rare natural ability to compress her massive form into a much more minuscule build, able to change her body shape into anybody else's, as long as it's smaller than her true size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira absolutely hates the feeling of not being in total creative control of her shows, and refuses any kind of feedback or opinion that stray out of her artistic vision. She values the artistic integrity of her shows so much that she can actually be <i>rudely</i> modest, never thankful or interested whenever she's given praise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't hold high regards for her body double, Lisa Meroni, her temper quick whenever she ends up putting in the most effort during practice and performances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Madame Seraph</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Parrot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 18'9\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 39.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive (literally and figuratively) fraud psychic who shamelessly squeezes a fortune for herself by selling phony predictions to the grieving and financially desperate, putting use to her (only) skills for charisma and artistic flair. She's traveled every which way through the country in a truck with a handful of followers (sometimes accomplices to her shows), eating her way through the most expensive restaurants. She speaks in a very wistful and soothing tone, but it's all the same charm that she uses to scam her audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Blanc was her grandmother's mentor, and she doesn't have much to say about her aside from an endless line of failures and disappointments...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Denise Kratt</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Cape Buffalo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 48'7\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 43.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrogant CEO of a bodybuilding program known all across the world. By college, Denise Kratt was only four feet tall, a far cry from even the skinnier of her species, but she got fed up of her size and splurged herself into as many of whatever weight/muscle gain formulas she could hunt down. Within two years, she was already over twice her old height and weighed several tons, and the media was quickly drawn into her life story  and yearned for an article on her techniques, so she ended up ripping off all the \"fitness\" works she'd been relying on and meshing them together into one big, overpriced set of fitness dvds, claiming herself as the true founder and always flaunting her success in everybody's faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes any chance she can to show off what a large creature she is, even it comes down to pushing others around who are fall smaller than her. On the outside, her stomach is the largest part of her body, her limbs also swaddled by enormous oceans of blubber, but half of her body's excess weight resides in hulking amounts of muscle underneath, and she can move around pretty easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Melanie Grove</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 18'11\" with corset, 25'1\" without.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 24.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA truly titanic pop singer who may seem very sweet and endearing when she's onstage or signing autographs, but is really an insatiable beast who gets through life solely through her ability to temporarily brainwash others into doing her bidding, which is initiated by sitting on their faces. She even makes use of this skill on her parents, manipulating them into twisting their wealth and social ties around for her benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn public, she wears a special corset in public that makes her look smaller than she actually is, even it still leaves her looking outright massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Valerie Denmor</b> (created by The 12th Doctor (non canon))<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Panther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 12'2''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 31.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie is one of the 1 out of 5000 who suffer Gannett's Syndrome, a condition that causes her to perpetually gain weight at a slow weight, even if she goes days without eating a bite. She'd squeezed a fortune out of well-meaning scientists for permission to research her defects, but ended up sapping them of all their funding and closing them out for business. Not that she really cares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she's no entrepreneur, she demands royalty out of the staff of Gaia 2.0, and flies into a blind rage at anybody who stares a split second to long at her tremendous body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Varia Estille</b> (created by Keroro04)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Vulture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 90'5\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 21.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaria is the spoiled brat and heiress for a family of wealthy business tycoons who never don't see her as anything but their precious angel, always showering her with food, praise, and money to blow off as she pleases. She eats so much that she's over nine times as tall as her parents, and so grotesquely obese that her thighs each are both 40 feet wide, but the true dominance of her weight lies in her breasts, which dangle almost all the way down to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has no idea how to do anything herself, she won't bother to learn, and she relies on the service of others to get things done. Even if whatever staff is helping out is agreeable, she's never satisfied, and tends to lash out if she doesn't feel she's being treated perfectly right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><u>The Ugly</u></b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Maia, Athena, Hera, Hestia, Aphrodite, Demeter, Artemis, Iris, Nike, and Nemesis.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 9'8\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 23.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy some miracle of birth, all of them were born into a litter of ten, and consist the entire waitress staffs of the casino and White Brimstone. They look so identical with one another and act so similar that nobody can tell who is who out of them, aside from themselves, by means unknown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of them are incredibly fat, with black-and white fur, blue eyes, and silky brown hair, and spend most of their time clad in assigned maid uniforms that they love to flaunt. While they're good enough at their job not to get in constant trouble, they have a weakness for being <i>extremely</i> flirty, especially to those much smaller than them. Of course, given they all have the exact same interests, they're highly prone to a few \"disagreements...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Marlon Simmons</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 8'3\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 46.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA singer who draws in massive crowds in the Fate's Hand, and lives in his own personal suite in the Golden Rooms. Nobody, not even Miss Holmes herself knows the true name or background of Marlon, a flawless impersonator of the legendary 50's swing singer of the same name, but nobody asks questions due to the crowds he draws in. He bears a perfect likeliness to the charm, fashion, personality, and (most importantly) <i>voice</i> of the real deal, despite that the real deal has been dead since 1989.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's a pretty nice guy if he's treated well, but lives in a constant delusion that he truly is the real Marlon Simmons, and he (and, as a result, Miss Holmes) demands that he always remain in an environment that never contradicts that outlook. Workers in his person often have to act like they're in the 1950s themselves, and thus are forced to pretend to be waiters, dancers, backup singers, or even other celebrities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Patricia Larogue</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Coyote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 12'4\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 237.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may look like she's in her middle ages, but Patricia is practically a self-made immortal from constantly having her body splurged with every concieveable method of plastic surgery known through history, not leaving a square inch of her skin untouched by a scalpel or needle. What little remains of her natural body is relatively skinny, but her breasts weigh up to four tons <i>individually</i>, and her legs, which standing together are almost as wide as she is tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hasn't had a job in a hundred years, living off of her success as a world record contender, but is deranged into thinking that she's still some sort wealthy aristocrat back in her old time period, and never feels satisfied by her body's appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kelly McRallis</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Wyvern<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 19'10\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 67 (28, in wyvern years)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince birth, Kelly was raised to become the ultimate spokeswoman; to always be smiling, screaming, and thrusting her merchandise into the faces of potential customers whenever possible. Kelly is the face, owner, and lead inventor to a self-defense shop in the Diamond Mines that specializes in gadgets and disguised weapons that can keep expensive clientele safe in dangerous encounters, and frequently calls for help to aid her in public demonstrations of her craft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly has been rendered permanently obese due to an experiment of hers that had gone terribly wrong, giving her body an enormous pear shape that's constantly getting stuck in doorways or knocking things over when she turns around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Carly Sorvitz</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Zebra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 16'2\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 23.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly is a frequent cashier at many of the Diamond Mine's fast food chains, which she has decided to use as her main source of food, rendering her incredibly fat. Her body possesses an incredible pear shape, and while she may seem all smiles and cheer to whoever is in front of the register, she likes to cut out the backside to all her uniforms' pants, rendering her gigantic ass totally bare, unbeknownst to her customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the dectuplets at least <i>try</i> to get Gregory to play with them, Carly straight up insists that he's her boyfriend, despite that he knows barely anything about her, and can't resist rubbing against him whenever the two are working together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Toronto Holmes</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 67'4\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 42.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToronto is the owner and founder of Gaia 2.0, who spends all of her time in her office/bedroom blazing through the mini-country's paperwork. Contrary to her masterpiece's eloquence and beauty, she's an absolute pig that stuffs herself with anything feasibly edible in reach with a body that's an absolute <i>mammoth</i> compared to her kind, even as fat as they tend to be, but still holds tight to her heritage with a thick southern accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe treats her workers with machine-cold demand: if something needs to be done or a guest wants something, she'll immediately send somebody off, no matter how crazy the job may be. On the inverse, with the vague chance that she encounters a potential customer, she's quick to treat them with complete kindness, doing everything she can to help them enjoy their stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly enough, despite her tightfisted control, she'd never fired a single employee during her entire career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd sure as hell <i>punished</i> some, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>General Rules (Don't worry, we're almost done!)</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Gregory cannot grow or gain weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Maximum character height is 100 feet. It's a big place, but not limitless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- All characters must be at least 21, but no elderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Gregory is always the main character. I'll start the story off in first person, but I don't object to other perspectives, as long as there aren't any tug-of-wars over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Original characters are more than welcome. Should you wish, hit me up with an email an I'll add their bio to the front page. (On the subject, only <i>original</i> characters; no fanfiction.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Mythical creatures are allowed, minus humanoids (i.e. harpies, centaurs, etc.) Humans are also allowed, but I would still like the focus to be devoted to Gregory and the anthros he meets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Like with characters, I'm open via email to ideas for new places in the resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- No gruesome death scenes/futa/tgtf/underage/torture/necrophilia/rape/scat/sharting/insertion/watersports/diapers/hard vore/non-oral vore/vore involving children/zoophilia (non-anthro).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Anthros cannot die, nor eat other anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Male characters are allowed, and are free to be fattened up, but (with no disrespect intended) I want Gregory to remain straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- No sapient quadrupeds - the only animals that can talk are anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Any amount of weight gain or means of weight gain is allowed, as long as it's paced to let the reader take it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Each entry must be at least 15 lines long. I'll be looking for solid attempts at story and detail here, so any chapter whose length or content I don't approve of will be banned on sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reserve the right to edit or delete chapters on certain reasons. I'll try and be nice, but keep in mind that I don't warn when I delete a chapter that breaks the rules.</td>",
