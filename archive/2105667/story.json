The guests are posh. The art is very modern. The star piece is a cat-shaped amulet carved from a rare rainbow gem found only in Wakanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick Fury director of SHIELD has good reason to believe that the Black Cat will attempt to steal the priceless amulet and so he's assigned Ant-Man to guard it after the show is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnt-Man arrives shortly after the viewing party wraps up. Where does he hide himself to await the Black Cat?</span></div></div>",

Ant-Man gazes up at the cat-suit clad giantess above him and hides behind the 'head' of the amulet. He's barely a millimeter tall standing in it's shoulder, far too tiny for the Black Cat to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow the predatory look in her eyes makes him feel very nervous even though he knows she can't see him. Of course to even see her face he has to gaze up past the swell of her mountainous breasts, barely contained by her cat-suit! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Cat casually reaches down and plucks the cat-amulet from it's pedestal. Immediately alarm sirens go off but Black Cat's smile merely broadens. She'll be long gone before the police arrive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drops the cat-amulet into her cleavage, places her finger on top of it and slowly presses it down, watching the amulet sink into her cleavage. Once it's 'submerged' she slowly pulls her finger out of her cleavage. The amulet it completely buried in her heaving breasts, invisible from sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnt-Man feels nervous as Black Cat picks up the amulet, but he almost panics when she drops it into her cleavage! Suddenly he finds himself i na valley of heaving pink flesh with the Black Cats smirking face looking down at him! What a view!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her finger slams onto the head of the amulet and it begins to slowly sink into Black Cat's 'valley' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'uh oh!' Ant-Man says to himself as Black Cats breasts spill over the amulet's shoulders and slam him into the side of the cat's head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's squeezed against the amulet by tons of hot pink flesh! Black Cat's breasts really are like mountains to him at this size! And he's caught in an avalanche! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnt-Man feels himself sliding away from the amulet as her skin's friction drags at him. He clings tightly to the amulet not wanting to become lost in Black Cat's cleavage! <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her trench-coat stretches and strains for an instant... and then bursts! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the trench-coat she is wearing a gold and black jumpsuit trimmed with leopard-print. The costume shows off her massive shoulders, heaving bosom, and powerful legs. The bank patrons stand stunned for a moment then chaos erupts, they flee the bank screaming and calling for the police!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe security guard draws his sidearm and opens fire, but by the time the first shot strikes Giganta she is already kneeling to keep from bumping her head on the 30 foot ceiling. The bullets do nothing against a woman of her size! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks and casually swats the security guard.
