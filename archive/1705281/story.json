You suddenly wake up because something sharp was poking you. You look down and you see a young girl no taller than your index finger was staring at you holding a spear in her hand. <br>\r\nYou try to reach for her, but the girl runs and trips over a rock flat on her face. You quickly grab her in your hand and you get a closer look as she sits on the pom of your hand. She looks about thirteen years old wearing some kind of Indian outfit. The young girl is terrified of you and stutters \"Ppp...please don't eat! I'm sorry i ppp...poked you with my spear! I...dd.... don't taste very good! I'll....
