        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">As a fan of both the manga <i>Negima!</i> and of shrinking/giantess stories, I've been thinking about starting a Negima shrinking interactive. Now that I've created one, I hope to have everyone's support in making this shrinking interactive one of the best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those of you who don't know, <i>Negima!</i> is a manga about a Ten-year old wizard named Negi Springfield who become a teacher at an all-girls school in Japan, following the adventures of him and the rather unusual class 3-A. For information about the characters:<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://negima.wikia.com/wiki/Characters#Main_characters:_Mahora_Girls.27_Jr._High_Class_2.2F3-A\" target=\"_blank\">http://negima.wikia.com/wiki/Characters#Main_characters:_Mahora_Girls.27_Jr._Hig...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote that this is primarily a SHRINKING interactive. I might consider adding a giantess section later on, but for now I'd like to keep it as a shrinking story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Things I like/allow</u><br>\r\n-m/F<br>\r\n-f/F<br>\r\n-Butt<br>\r\n-Breasts<br>\r\n-Mouth play<br>\r\n-Vore (non-lethal)<br>\r\n-Insertion<br>\r\n-Feet (Don't care much for it, but I'll allow it, just leave a thread open)<br>\r\n-Gentle/Playful interaction<br>\r\n-Justified violent interaction<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Things I will NOT allow</u><br>\r\n-Extended interaction between shrunken people and normal sized males<br>\r\n-Unjustified violence<br>\r\n-Excessive OOCness<br>\r\n-Killing main characters<br>\r\n-Random tangents<br>\r\n-Threads that end too quickly<br>\r\n-Unacceptably poor spelling/grammar (I won't delete posts if I can edit it into something reasonable)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will give 100-500 GP for quality additions. Hopefully I should be able to update this story more often than my previous interactive, but I am counting on additions from other writers to help this interactive reach it's full potential.</td>",
