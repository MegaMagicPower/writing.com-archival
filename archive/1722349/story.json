Her father was a multi-millionaire, with several businesses and establishments in his name, and her mother was a retired model who now ran her own fashion magazine. Carrie had grown up in a manor outside of the city, with everything she could have ever dreamed of. Her bedroom was easily the size of an entire apartment, she had so many designer clothes she never had to wear the same outfit twice if she didn't want to, and the latest gadget was on her doorstep a good week before it was available to anyone else. Carrie had an extremely good life, and she knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just left school, Carrie's next step was college, one of the most prestigious colleges that her father could pay for her to get into. As a treat for all of her hard work, her parents had insisted on taking one last family holiday together, an eight week cruise around the tropics. Carrie had hesitated at first, it meant she would be stuck on a cruise ship for two months with both her parents and her bratty younger sister, but the moment she had learned just what type of cruise ship she would be going on, she jumped at the chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe S.S. Anne was one of the more luxurious liners out there. It had three swimming pools, one outside, one inside, and one under a glass ceiling that lit up at night. The cabins were more like small apartments, elegantly furnished and boasting the latest technology there was. There were a grand total of seven bars, ranging from a classy establishment with soft piano music, to a neon lit place with the latest music pulsing through the speakers. Then there was a deck filled with shops, another deck with a beauty parlour and a spa with all sorts of treatments available, along with a gym that looked out over the ocean. Cinemas, dance studios, the list was endless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the food deck. Packed with restaurants catering for all tastes, every possible food was available there, and they ranged from all you can eat buffets, to quiet places that served only the finest dishes. It was easily the pride of the S.S Anne, it was somewhat of an ongoing joke amongst the staff that a lot of the passengers left a great deal heavier than when they had stepped on board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie, a tiny size six and proud of it, was more concerned with the fact the ship had a fast internet connection so she could keep up with her friends back home. She ran her fingers through her long hair, examining herself in the mirror with a satisfied eye. Carrie's hair was blond and just a little wavy, tumbling against her bare shoulders with a delightful contrast to her already tanned skin. Her eyes were green, and a little almond shaped, bought to life by the eye-liner she carefully applied to them. Her pretty face was heart shaped, and her breasts, while small, filled out the top of her bikini nicely. Her long legs were the envy of many a person, along with her perfectly flat stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie nodded at herself in satisfaction, she really did look gorgeous to her eye, and that was what mattered most. Now that she knew her turquoise bikini looked nothing short of perfect on her, it should have at just over $1000, it was time to finally get out of her cabin, and see what the cruise liner had to offer her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To her delight, Carrie had been informed that because the S.S Anne was over national waters, the drinking age had been lowered from twenty one to eighteen. She had tasted alcohol now and again, they always had wine with dinner at home, and she had tasted cocktails before, but this was different. She didn't have to be supervised by her parents, she could drink what she wanted, and when she wanted. Carrie picked her way elegantly to one of the bars she had read about in the brochure, the Blue Lagoon. A relatively new addition to the cruise liner, it was a cocktail bar designed with the beach in mind, one could even sit in shallow water with their drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrdering a Bahama Mama, Carrie waited for her drink to be made, casting a wary eye over the rest of the bar. There were a few girls around her age dotted around, she noted with disgust that they were far too big to be thinking of wearing something as revealing as what they were. A couple of guys were sat with then, tanned, surfer types, who clearly didn't seem to mind the extra pudge as they sat close to the girls, laughing and chatting with them as if they had been friends for years. Carrie sniffed a little, taking her drink in hand, and moved to settle into the shallow pool at the far end of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was delicious. Carrie gave a soft sigh as she sipped more of the sweet drink, she had never tasted something as refreshing and creamy as she had that cocktail. It led for a relaxing afternoon, sitting in the warm pool and sipping drink after drink, with a warm buzzed feeling that seemed to seep into her very skin. It was getting to be late afternoon that Carrie finally forced herself out of the pool, wavering a little due to not being used to drinking in the first place. She decided that this bar was going to be one that she visited often, asides from the tasty drinks on offer, those cute boys had to realise they could be with someone so much hotter than those fatter girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the bar, Carrie..</span></div></div>",

She gingerly opened her eyes to see the smiling face of a young man, she felt herself blush, a rather attractive young man. He helped her back up to her feet, only letting go of Carrie once she seemed to get her balance back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" he asked, a lilting accent tugging at his words, \"Too many at the bar, huh?\" his white teeth flashed into a smile at Carrie, and she felt herself go weak at the knees, \"Too bad. I'm just about to start my shift. Could have done with a pretty girl like you to look at while I worked.\" Carrie could only stare at him, taking in his bright blue eyes, the crop of sun bleached blond hair that fell dreamily into those eyes, and his slender, toned figure that was more than complemented by his uniform. She glanced to the name badge printed to his shirt, the block letters spelling out 'Ethan'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.. I could come back?\" Carrie suggested, somewhat astonished herself by the slight slur tugging at her words, \"When do you work next... Ethan?\" Ethan's smile seemed to grow at that, and he raked his hand back into his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I work the late afternoon shift,\" Ethan explained with a laugh, \"Every day from five. But I'm thinking you should sleep that lot off first,\" he added with a teasing wink, before sauntering into the bar, \"See you around, Blondie.\" Carrie felt her heart flutter as she rested her hand across her chest. She had never felt like that around a guy, ever. Ethan hadn't fell at her feet, he hadn't begged to have her, and that just made Carrie want him all the more. She continued to smile dazedly as she made her way back to the cabin, to follow up on his idea of getting some much needed sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, no-one else was there, so Carrie was free to slump down onto the bed, and fall into a deep sleep bought on by the alcohol she still wasn't all that used to. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking up several hours later, Carrie grimaced on feeling the mild headache spreading across her forehead. She sat up blearily to fumble about the darkened bedroom for the aspirin she had put in her handbag, able to hear the sounds of her family in the main lounge of the cabin. She took a couple of pills, along with a swig of tepid water from the plastic bottle she had left at the side of the bed, before gingerly getting to her feet. Carrie groaned at how dizzy she felt, but moved to the closet to pull out a dress to wear over her bikini. She chose a short, white design that barely fell to her knees, and showed off every single slight curve of her slender body. Tugging it into place, Carrie blearily pulled on a pair of sandals with real diamonds encrusted into the pattern, and pulled her hair back into a messy bun that looked as if she had spent hours getting it just right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the sleeping beauty awakes,\" her father teased as Carrie padded her way into the room, \"C'mon We're about to go get something to eat.\" Her father was a good natured man for someone so rich, and had grown up in humble surroundings. Max Farron was sharply dressed and handsome despite being in his late forties, with a toned body that came from a good couple of hours at the gym every night. His hair was dark, like his youngest daughter's, and was starting to grey slightly at the temples; this just had the effect of making him all the more good looking. His green eyes twinkled as he looked to his eldest daughter, the exact shade as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Carrie was about to protest, when she heard her stomach growl underneath her dress, and she felt herself blush in surprise. She never had much of an appetite, and chose to snack on salads and other light treats to keep her figure looking as good as it did, but for some reason she was hungrier than she had ever felt before. \".. okay, daddy,\" she added, beaming over at him, \"That sounds great.\" She was on holiday, Carrie reasoned, not to mention she could just work off whatever she ate in the gym or the pool tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just waiting for mom,\" Carrie's little sister elaborated with a roll of her brown eyes, \"She had to do her hair again.\" Robyn Farron was just eleven years old, but had a mindset more like her father's. She was a proud tomboy, and couldn't understand how her sister and her mother could spend so many hours making themselves look good. Robyn was quite short for her age, and mostly slender, though she had a little pot belly that strained at the front of her dress. Her dark hair was pulled back into a simple ponytail, Carrie's fingers itched in the want to try and make it look a little nicer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready,\" Carrie's mother smiled a little as she finally made her way back out into the lounge, \"I booked us a table at the seafood place. I thought it would be nice to try something different.\" Carrie's mother Estelle looked beautiful, no matter what she wore. Tall and elegant, it was easy to see where Carrie got her looks from. Estelle's face was perfectly made up, an expensive dress skimming over what few curves she had, and her brown eyes sparkled gently in the overhead lights. Carried sighed a little, her mother was so naturally stunning, it was easy to be envious of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled again, Estelle looked over, laughing gently as her smile softened. \"I should think Carrie's stomach agrees that we should hurry up,\" she teased her eldest gently, and ushered her family out of the door. </span></div></div>",

You come back, eat it, and if you're still hungry, you can go up for more.\" Robyn's eyes positively shone at the idea, she was never shy about admitting her love for food, while Estelle and Carrie looked somewhat more apprehensive about the idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Estelle sighed as the waiter set down four plates in front of them, \"I supposed there is salads at least.\" She headed off towards the salad bar to take her fill, while Robyn and Max set about taking a bit of everything that they could. Carrie hesitated as she hovered between the two. Should she behave and go with her mother to pick at salad? Or should she give in to the gnawing hunger and try a bit of the rich looking dishes her sister and father were looking at? Carrie's stomach rumbled again, and she gave a weary sigh, before heading to the buffet to try some of the delicious smelling dishes on offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEstelle stuck to her one plate of salad, while Max managed a good two dishes of food. Robyn managed three, but Carrie surprised everyone by managing to eat five. She sank back against her chair as she finished the last mouthful of lobster ravioli, swallowing hard and closing her eyes from just how full she felt. She had never felt a hunger like that before, she realised as she looked down at herself, she hadn't been able to stop eating. The food was so rich and delicious, and smelled so good, she had taken spoonful after spoonful without realising that she was rapidly emptying her plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Carrie,\" Max teased as he looked at his stuffed daughter, \"I think you set the record there.\" Carrie just gave a little grown, noticing with some worry that her stomach was sticking out just a little from how much food she had pushed into there, she could see her mother eyeing it with some disdain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you keep that up,\" Estelle warned gently, \"You'll get fat.\" Carrie looked over to her little sister Robyn, who's stomach seemed to stick out more than it usually did, half wondering how the younger girl didn't let herself get put down by their mother's comments at times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with some difficulty that the Farron family made their way back to their room, Carrie poking anxiously at her slightly protruding stomach, and deciding that she really needed to start exercising to ward off getting fat. </span></div></div>",

Carrie padded out of the shower with a towel wrapped tightly about her, smiling a little on seeing that yet another beautiful day had dawned. It meant that she could spend her morning sunbathing and working on her tan, and maybe taking a dip in the pool if she had time. Letting the towel drop to the floor, Carrie took the underwear she had laid out on the bed, pulling on her panties with a slight wriggle of her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn pulling her bra on, Carrie noted with some confusion that it felt a little tighter than it used to. She straightened the straps as she leant over to retrieve her skirt, a short, pleated item that showed off her long legs. Stepping into it, Carrie began to tug it up over her thighs and hips, letting it rest at her waist before starting to do it up. Carrie grimaced a little how tight the waistband felt about her middle, she only just managed to slip the button into the hole, and there was a distinct pinching feeling. She hadn't even worn that skirt yet, Carrie turned to look at herself in the mirror, it was probably just a smaller fit than she was used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".. my stomach is sticking out,\" Carrie grumbled as she poked at her previously flat stomach, which now curved ever so gently out from her, \"No wonder it doesn't fit. I knew this cruise was going to be bad for me!\" Pulling on a tank top, she stormed into the bathroom, standing on the scales. Her eyes widened as the digital display finally began to stop flickering, showing her that the past week of drinking and eating had added a good few pounds to her frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"117lbs?\" Carrie stared at the numbers, \"I gained seven pounds in a week? Ugh.. I'm such a whale!\" She threw her hands up into the air as she stepped off the scales again, moving away to swap her skirt for a pair of shorts instead, the elasticated waistband helping her to not feel quite so fat, slipping a pair of trainers onto her feet. Determined not to get any bigger, Carrie made her way to the gym instead, if she nipped this gain in the bud, she could be down to her pre-cruise weight within a matter of days. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking onto the deck, Carrie raised her hand to protect her eyes from the sunlight, slipping her other hand into her bag to retrieve her sunglasses. Slipping them on, she blinked in surprise on seeing a familiar figure coming towards her, crossing her arms self consciously over her stomach. Even when her tank top was pulled down into place, she could still see the slight curve of her stomach against the material. And the last thing she wanted was for Ethan of all people to see that she had gained weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Ethan grinned at her once he came close enough, wearing a pair of oversized shorts and a tight fitting t-shirt that showed off his lean muscles, \"I was hoping I'd catch you. It's my day off today,\" he added, his eyes seeming to lighten up even more, \"I was thinking we could spend some time together that wasn't in the bar?\" Carrie was torn, on one hand she wanted to get rid of her extra pounds, but on the other, she didn't want to turn down the chance to spend an entire day with Ethan. She smiled a little, and found herself dipping her head into a nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Ethan declared, before taking her by the hand, leading her to one of the upper decks, \"We could go grab a movie? By the time that's finished we can grab something to eat.\" Carrie nodded her agreement as they walked side by side, the idea of spending time in a darkened room with Ethan was just heavenly, she dismissed the idea of getting something to eat; she could always grab a salad and think nothing less of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that,\" Carrie confirmed, her heart skipping a beat as Ethan squeezed her hand. On getting to the cinema, Ethan insisted on buying both the tickets and the snacks, leaving Carrie to stand to the side as she watched one of the theatres let out. She could see more overweight girls, she noted, with a wrinkle of her nose. It was still disgusting, she looked down at her small stomach with a raised eyebrow, she wasn't going to let herself become one of them. No matter how happy they looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in screen two,\" Ethan confirmed as he made his way over, balancing two large popcorns and two sodas in his arms, \"C'mon!\" Carrie wanted to protest that she wasn't going to eat so much as a bite of popcorn, but didn't have the heart to considering he had spent that money on her, and so instead followed him to the double doors with a large '2' over them. The room was still in semi darkness as they slipped inside, and they took their seats near the centre of the screen. Carrie settled back, trying to remember when she had last been to the cinema like this, before gasping as a piece of popcorn was pushed between her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Ethan admitted with a sheepish chuckle, \"Couldn't resist.\" Carrie smiled back, trying not to worry about what effect that one piece of sweet, buttery popcorn would to do her figure, sinking back into her seat as the previews started. She felt herself looking to the popcorn, her will wavering on remembering how good it had tasted. Carrie couldn't pay full attention to the trailers, and it was with a reluctant sigh that she grabbed a couple of pieces between her fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a couple of pieces couldn't hurt, Carrie reasoned, nibbling at the sweet popcorn. It was just an hour into the film when she felt her fingers brushing the bottom of the popcorn carton, she looked over in surprise, and some horror, on seeing that she had eaten the entire thing. Ethan caught her look, and shifted to place the second carton of popcorn between them. Carrie sighed a little as she looked back to the screen, well aware she had a stomachful of sweet and probably calorie laden popcorn to contend with. Still, she couldn't quite help herself as she plucked another piece from the top, the action almost automatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo whole cartons of popcorn and a large coke later, Carrie grimaced as she walked out of the theatre with Ethan, barely listening to him go on about the film they had seen. All she could focus on was what a pig she had been, she had willed herself to try losing weight that day, and she was already behind with it. So caught up in her thoughts, Carrie barely noticed when Ethan stopped to look at her, and she felt herself blush a little at the look he was giving her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said are you hungry?\" Ethan questioned good naturedly, \"I know this place. It's really small, quiet. Romantic,\" he added sheepishly, with a charm that made Carrie melt a little, \"What do you say?\" Carrie could only nod her agreement, looking down at her stomach a little anxiously as Ethan led her away. </span></div></div>",

She whimpered a little on tugging it up about her waist, the button and hole separated by a rise of flesh. \"You're kidding me,\" Carrie moaned as she struggled to do up her skirt, the fabric refusing to come together about her thicker waist. She flopped down on the bed, grinning to herself as her stomach flattened a little, allowing her to finally do up her skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tight fit, Carrie realised as she gingerly sat up, but it <i>fit</i>.

Carrie stood up to pull on a t-shirt, grimacing at how tight it felt about her arms, and looked down in dismay to see that the very bottom of her stomach was sticking out from underneath it.

Carrie scowled as she batted her sister's hand away, \"Are you doing it to annoy her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out!\" Carrie made a move to chase her sister, Robyn ran shrieking from the room as she burst into laughter, \"You don't know what you're talking about!\" As she went to slam the door closed, the button from her skirt popped off, her stomach spilling out through the broken zip.

Her stomach only stuck out into the smallest pot belly, but from the way her mother was looking at it, it could have been a full blown gut. Estelle sighed after a moment, folding her thin arms across her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting chubby, Carrie,\" Estelle warned, reaching out to poke Carrie in the stomach, \"You need to watch out. You'll become a right little piggy if you keep this up. It's a steep slope,\" she continued, \"Once you let yourself go, it's so hard to drag yourself back from that.\" She cupped her daughter's cheek, noticing with some weariness that even that felt fuller against her palm. \".. I think you should sit out of family dinner tonight,\" she added, dropping her hand as she turned away, \"You've clearly eaten enough.\" Carrie felt tears prickle at the backs of her eyes as her mother walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that she was only trying to look out for her, but Carrie hadn't exactly asked to gain weight. She looked down at herself, before gripping her stomach in a sudden frustration. She was trying so hard, and yet this was what she had to show for it? \"If I'm such a pig,\" Carrie muttered as she grabbed her room key, \"I'm going to show her what a pig can really be like.\" She stormed out of the room, and made her way to.. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not wanting to face Ethan when she was so emotional, Carrie made her way to one of the other bars that had caught her attention. It was a bar filled with thumping music, the furniture lit up with neon lines of light. In the darkness, she noted, no-one could see that she had been crying. Or the fact she had put on a few. Carrie took a seat at the bar, rubbing at her eyes, before gazing down the cocktail list.She wanted something with more of a kick to it than the Bahama Mama, she realised, and jumped a little in surprise when she felt a chubby hand touch her wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try the Long Island Ice Tea,\" the girl suggested with a smile, speaking louder so she could be heard above the music, \"They're amazing!\" She was another one of those chubby girls, Carrie noted wearily, who was wearing shorts and a close fitting top despite her extra girth. A part of her wanted to look down at the girl for daring to speak to her, a stronger part could see that the chubby girl's face was sweet, and the other was only trying to be friendly. Carrie nodded, the girl beamed, and instantly held her hand up to order them two Long Island Ice Teas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Kitty,\" the girl offered eventually as she sipped at her drink, \"I haven't seen you around before.\" Kitty seemed to be almost completely round, Carrie noticed, with cropped dark hair and stunning blue eyes. She clearly took good care of herself, despite her weight, with pretty make up that really helped to draw out her features. Carrie looked down into her drink as it arrived, before taking a generous swig of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".. I'm Carrie,\" she responded after a moment, \"I spend more time at the Blue Lagoon.\" Kitty gave a knowing nod as she sipped at her drink, before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm.. these are so good,\" Kitty smiled at Carrie a little more, \"Hey, how about you hang out with us tomorrow?\" Carrie wasn't sure as she continued drinking, though the alcohol was compelling her to say yes. </span></div></div>",
