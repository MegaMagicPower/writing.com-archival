Springing a few bits to get a carriage from Canterlot is seeming like a better idea now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you catch your breath and feel the much-needed coolness of the shade against your sweaty brow, you sit and admire Ponyville just ahead of you; it isn\u2019t exactly the sort of place that <i>screams </i> royalty, but if Princess Twilight Sparkle is willing to call it home, you\u2019re not going to question it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou search your satchel for the scroll of directions Twilight had sent you, though looking ahead at the lofty structure of the castle which overtops the rest of the thatched-roof buildings, you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Dear Peppermint Swirl,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am looking forward to you working as my new assistant! I hope Ponyville provides a pleasant contrast to Fillydelphia, and hope to see you as soon as possible. <br>\r\nOnce you arrive in Ponyville, you can meet me at the castle for your induction on Thursday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely, <br>\r\nTwilight. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had also included a map with directions, but reading the letter again you realise how vague Twilight is regarding the job <i>itself</i>. Even in the original job description, she had not really given any details, though the prospect of working with Twilight Sparkle of all ponies makes something so petty null and void, and you feel very honored that you have been chosen for the job in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour induction isn\u2019t until tomorrow, so it\u2019s really up to you whether you want to head to Twilight now or sleep somewhere else for the night.<br>\r\nLooking ahead, you see three options: <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re sure you wouldn\u2019t be turned away for being just one day early, and the accommodation would surely be a hundred times better than any hotel you could find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle is on the other side of the town center, so it seems a good idea to walk around the town, rather than through it; this is simply not time for distractions - nothing which might pull you away from your duties here in Ponyville. Besides, you\u2019ll have plenty of time to make friends during your stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you find yourself at the entrance to the castle; a large, imposing door towering above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knock, but there seems to be no kind of response. You wat, and then knock again, but once more there is nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back and look around you, up towards the windows of the castle and along each wall that you can see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAha. One of the windows on the first floor is open, and there seems to even conveniently be a ladder somepony left against the wall. You don\u2019t want Twilight to think you\u2019re  breaking in, but once you find her you can easily explain yourself. <br>\r\nOr... wait around for someone to answer the door. </span></div></div>",

Did you just get into Ponyville?\u201d <br>\r\nShe shakes herself out of her rambling, bashfully looking to the ground, blushing, and clearing her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! Had to walk from Canterlot.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no! You should have told me! I would\u2019ve sent for you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.

I knew I should have written that part out in a bigger typeface! Agh! Stupid Twilight! Well, it\u2019s just that I have certain... disagreements with certain foods, and because of that I usually have to deal with quite... unpleasant gas, as do my assistants. I did actually have an experiment right now that I need some help with. It\u2019s really quite weird, and a little gross, so I\u2019d understand if you want to turn down the position.

Thank you so much for understanding, it\u2019s just that this is a very intimate position, so I needed to know my... problem... was one you could deal with. I\u2019m ashamed to say it\u2019s become somewhat of a fascination for me, actually. That was what this experiment was about.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s the experiment?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight lead you down in the other direction than the one you had come, turning a few corners before the two of you entered a large library, shelves lined with a multitude of books and with jagged crystal structures sprouting up along the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, I was reading some old spell books I\u2019ve never read before. Mostly simple stuff, but there was this one spell which intrigued me tremendously.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alicorn opened a dusty book in front of you both, laying it down on the floor and finding a particular page. She seemed to talk enough for the both of you, but you really didn\u2019t mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple spell which deals with matter introduction and placement. As I say, it\u2019s nothing too advanced. The spell allows you to fill a chosen void or vessel with a liquid or a gas, provided you have a sample of the matter on hand. Let me demonstrate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a half-empty glass of water, placing it down in front of her, before gesturing your attention to an empty flask on a desk on the other side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor example, I can use the molecular and chemical structure of this water, and fill that flask over there with new water!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer horn glowed purple, and you both watched as the flask steadily filled with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! See? Well - it got me thinking, and I\u2019ve also had this really bad stomach cramp lately, so I thought that maybe... I could fill myself with gas, and in doing so dislodge the gas which seems to be stuck!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you, her face filled with pride, despite the bizarre nature of her thesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I could help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to need a sample of my own farts for the spell to work. I would try and produce some gas with chemicals, but farts are actually made up of several different <i>types</i> of gas, rather than just methane or sulphur like most ponies think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never imagined you\u2019d have Princess Twilight Sparkle herself geeking out at you about farts of all things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are we gonna get the sample?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... that\u2019s where you come in.\u201d She gestured towards a small beaker, blushing again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to fill that?\u201d You had to try and hold back the laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right! Um, I\u2019ve actually been holding one in since we started talking, so...\u201d She just smiled suggestively. There was something oddly cute about her sheepish, slightly embarrassed demeanour, disregarding the entire topic of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the small flask, holding it for a few seconds, before stepping around behind the alicorn. It seemed a little forward to just push it against her asshole, but then what wasn\u2019t forward about this whole experiment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou positioned the small cylindrical flask somewhere under her tail, until you felt it yield against her pucker. She let out a short gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere comes! Make sure you get as much as you can in there!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few seconds later, there was a quiet, dampened hissing sound, and you felt the flask heat up slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuick! Close it up!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached for a little rubber stopper, quickly popping it in the flask and holding it up in your hoof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect! I\u2019m sure this is more than enough!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt levitated from your hand, shrouded in her purple magic aura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, So, I\u2019m going to see if I can fill my small intestines or my colon with <i>this</i>. It\u2019s going to take some concentration, so I\u2019m going to need you to watch to see when it\u2019s working!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... how will I tell?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lower abdomen should bulge slightly. You\u2019ll know when.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alicorn stood with her legs parted slightly, her stomach and underside on show clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright... now, I just need to visualise the void which I want to fill... hmm.. I think I\u2019ve got it. Now... with the contents of the flask..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few seconds of silence, but surely enough, you could see her lower belly distend very slightly; very gradually inflating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. I\u2019m gonna stop and see if that worked.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sparkles around her horn abated, and the pony held her position carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna need you to rub my abdomen slightly. I can feel it in there, but it\u2019s not coming out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering for a moment why you were so willing to do everything Twilight asked of you, you stepped closer to Twilight, reaching a hoof up and gently massaging her undercarriage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head was only about three inches away from her rump; her tail was off to one side, and from here you could quite unmistakably see... her nethers. You felt yourself blush. You\u2019d only been working for Twilight for about half an hour, and already you\u2019d seen her most private areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t have very long to muse over this though, as a loud and raspy fart ripped from the Princess\u2019 asshole. You felt her swollen belly deflate slightly as it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell rose up to your nostrils. There was something about it that reminded you of slightly off, cloying milk, along with the smell of damp rags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pursed your lips as the pungent smell entered your nostrils. You felt nearly dizzy at the realisation of your current position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt worked! Uh, sorry. I guess you\u2019re kinda in the blast zone back there, huh?\u201d The purple alicorn looked back at you and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery refreshing.\u201d You joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re taking it better than Spike usually does.\u201d She said offhandedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpike?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s my usual assistant. The one I mentioned earlier. I don\u2019t really think he\u2019s that into all this stuff, so I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve got an assistant who doesn\u2019t mind it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to work under you, Princess.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh! No need to be so formal! I like to see my assistants as my equals, you know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snickered. \u201cNo need to be.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAnyway...\u201d </div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight closed her eyes again and began to focus, filling her bowels again with the gas from the flask. As you massaged her abdomen you watched it bulge from the effects of her spell, your eyes going wide at you saw how bloated she was making herself. \"Um, Twilight?\" You spoke up, getting a bit worried since you were standing directly behind her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... just a moment Peppermint.\" Twilight groaned, her eyes still closed shut in concentration as she was filling herself with an alarming amount of gas. Just as you thought she couldn't possibly get any more full she finished her spell, though the discomfort on her face didn't fade. \"Ooooh, yup that really did it!\" She spoke up as there was a loud groan from her abdomen. You gulped as you felt yourself sweating a bit. Before you weren't worried about a couple farts but seeing as how the Princess had just turned herself into a walking gas bomb and you were right near where she would be expelling it, things weren't looking as pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight.. maybe I should you know, move?\" You didn't really know how to phrase it without sounding rude, you just didn't want a faceful of stinky alicorn gas!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move? No no no, you have to stay right there! Your massaging really helps get out all that gas and-\" Twilight bit her lip as she had a pained expression. \"Ahhh quick get ready, I can feel it all coming! It's going to feel great to get rid of this cramp!\" She strained as you just massaged her abdomen, turning your head a bit to the side so the inevitable blast didn't get too much of your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was silent for a few moments before all hell broke loose. You saw Twilight's pucker open wide and blow the first long, loud and above all reeking fart right onto you. Coughing and gagging, you tried to maintain your composure and kept massaging her to get it all out. The smell was absolutely dreadful and all you could think about was spoiled milk. Just as that fart finished another blew out from between her cheeks, this one more quiet but carrying an even worse stench with a heavy cheesy undertone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were retching and trying in vain to blow the stinky air away from you, Twilight felt like she was in heaven as she let out fart and fart. All the pent up gas she had accumulated during the day, along with the large amount she had just pumped into herself, came flying out in all manner of sizes and sounds. Some were small and quiet, others were long and obnoxious, though the one thing they did share was a very heavy dairy stench. As a particularity wet one graced your face and nostrils, you thought that she must of really had something to upset her stomach like this. You had smelled some bad farts before, but the Princess' were on a totally different level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's-\" Twilight paused to fart as she had a very relaxed look on her face, \"ahhh almost,\" another pause and fart, \"all of them!\" As she said this a particularly vile silent but deadly fart blew onto your face, this one threatening to knock you out cold. She giggled sheepishly as she looked back at you. \"Ooops, sorry I guess it wasn't!\" She pulled her ass away as her storm of gas finally seemed to end leaving you standing there in a fart filled room. You never thought any pony could fart like that, much less the Princess of Friendship herself! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh geez that stinks doesn't it, I'm sorry!\" She groaned as she immediately cracked open every window available, though it didn't do much good against the putrid smell that clung to you. \"Maybe I overdid it a little with the gas, but to be honest I was curious how much I could fit in there!\" She smiled and quickly went about writing some stuff down while you tried to recover from what just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, just wasn't expecting uh... that.\" You smiled awkwardly, trying your best not to breathe much as it smelled quite toxic. How in Equestria could someone like her produce such a smell? \"I'm glad I could be of assistance, even if that assistance was relieving you of your gas.\" You chuckled, secretly hoping that would be the last fart focused experiment for the day. \"So, need any help with other experiments? Or are we done for the day?\" Twilight finished writing and turned to you, looking quite refreshed as she responded with...</span></div></div>",

Besides, you couldn't exactly say no, you were her assistant and it wouldn't be a very good first impression to deny her help on your first day. \"Ah, sure! I don't mind, it is my job after all!\" You smiled and fanned the air, it doing little good considering the majority of the air in the room had already been tainted by Twilight's farts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! There's so many interesting experiments I've wanted to attempt, but Spike isn't exactly the most keen at helping out with them.\" Twilight beamed as she went across the room to a bookshelf. Catching a few more whiffs of her gas, she groaned and started to fill the room with air freshener. \"Ugh again I'm sorry about that, I knew I shouldn't of had that cheese earlier... my gas usually isn't that bad!\" You assured her it was fine (your nose sure was telling you it wasn't though) as she looked for a particular book in her collection. Standing behind her you had the perfect view to watch her purple rump sway back and forth, her chubby cheeks slapping together from the movement. The sight made you blush as she continued to move her fat ass in front of you. It was clear she had put on a little weight around her plot, was it from sitting on her throne too much, or overeating perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were broken as Twilight found the book she was looking for, bringing it over to you and opening it to a page. It seemed to be full of a variety of different spells, all looking quite complex. Twilight tapped her hoof on one of the pages and smiled. \"This one right here, a size reduction spell. Or a shrinking spell, as most would call it! I've wanted to try this one out for a long time but I haven't had a uhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guinea pig?\" You said rather bluntly, you weren't surprised she hadn't found someone to try this one out on. All manner of bad things could happen at a smaller size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blushed a bit and giggled. \"Yeah... Spike is worried something bad would happen, but trust me! I'm sure I can make it work, I've already shrunk a couple objects! Nothing living mind you... but I'm sure it will be fine! Besides think of all that could be learned!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had an unsure feeling about this but at the same time Twilight was the element of magic after all. Even if something went wrong you were fairly certain Twilight could fix it, few knew as much about magic as she did. Still, you were more worried about what exactly she had planned for you when you were small. You doubted she only wanted to shrink you then grow you back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alicorn grabbed another book nearby, this one even thicker and looking quite old. \"Of course, if you don't want to try that one out its fine, there are lots more different experiments we can try!\" It seemed either way you would be testing out a potentially dangerous experiment with her, you just hoped it wouldn't be as stinky as the first one (the effects of which were still apparent as the room had quite a pungent odor hanging around). After a few moments of thought you came to a decision. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Princess's face lit up at your response, clearly eager to try this spell out as she went to prepare for her newest experiment. \"Excellent! You're such a great assistant, I just know with you at my side we are going to make some huge magical breakthroughs!\" You stood around awkwardly watching Twilight as she set up, though it didn't take her long. A couple minutes later she smiled over at you. \"Okay, let's begin. Just step over here and wait. Don't worry, it won't hurt, you should just feel a bit lightheaded.\" Her words did little to comfort you, it wasn't the shrinking process that worried you. Rather what was going to happen to you at this small size, you could get stepped on, sat on, or even worse! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, let's get this over with.\" You gulped, knowing it was too late to back out now. Twilight looked so excited to try out this spell, and you would hate to ruin that excitement by suddenly saying no. As long as she didn't keep you small for very long, you'd be okay with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled and nodded as she read from her book. \"Perfect, now I'll need to concentrate for a bit. This shouldn't take too long. This spell isn't that difficult, though it takes a bit of work.\" She closed her eyes and focused. A few moments later her horn lit up with her magical aura, your body soon being enveloped by it as well. Indeed you started to feel lightheaded, like the room was spinning around you. This feeling only got worse as the aura intensified and your body began to shrink in size. At first it was hardly noticeable, but soon it became very apparent as you shrunk down in front of Twilight, the colossal mare now towering over you when mere minutes ago you had been the same size. Her giant shadow was cast over you as the rest of the room began to rise up all around. This was a lot smaller than you were expecting! Your body would easily disappear under one of Twilight's hooves or even worse ass cheeks. In fact you were a little glad you couldn't see her plot from this view, her crack being so big you could probably get lost in it forever at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the shrinking stopped as you seemed to be a couple inches tall. However the look of intense concentration on Twilight's face remained, this must require a lot of her focus. You were just about to speak up when she suddenly bit her lip and released an enormous fart that was as loud as thunder to you. She let out a relieved sigh and had a relaxed expression on her face, the gas rippling to a wet halt a few seconds later. She giggled and looked down at you. \"Sorry, I had to fart halfway through the spell and you have no idea how hard it was keeping it in! Soon as I finished the spell I just had to let it rip.\" Twilight caught a whiff of her fumes and scrunched up her nose in disgust, that was a truly putrid blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while it was nasty to her, it was pure hell to you. At this size the sound had left your ears ringing, and even worse was the horrific stench that followed. All you could smell was rotten eggs as Twilight's disgusting fart filled the room. You covered your nose and fanned the air in a desperate attempt to rid yourself of it but at your size it did little good. \"GAH! P-princess, that's absolutely dreadful! I'm not so sure shrinking me was such a good idea!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at you with interest as she got a parchment and quill, your tiny voice just barely reaching her. Thankfully she kept her own voice down to keep from deafening you with it. \"Nonsense! We will learn so much about this. So it's one little fart, its not like it can kill you. Now, it's good to see that you can speak. The size reduction spell seems to have been a success, but we will have to run some more thorough tests to see if anything about you has changed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just gulped and looked up at her enormous face as she picked you up with her sweaty hoof. You felt very vulnerable at this size, just one of her farts was like a hurricane to you! \"Tests?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded. \"Oh yes! While you may appear the same, the shrinking may very well have effected you in other ways. Is your strength proportional to your new size? What about your durability? And I'm very interested to find out about your senses. Oh there is so much for us to learn, I don't know where to begin!\" The Princess beamed down at you, ready to begin an intense research session. Before long she decides to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm curious about how your new size has affected you.\" She mused, still keeping her voice at a reasonable level, and gave the spellbook another quick read-over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In... what way?\" You asked, dreading the response you were no doubt going to receive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... how much you can withstand. I assume as you are far smaller, your strength and durability are also reduced a considerable amount.\" A troubled look began to quickly fix across the alicorn's face; it was a look you knew all too well, and moments later she unleashed another fart. Once again it sounded like the ominous, sonorous crack of thunder coming from dark storm clouds; it was as if you could physically feel the rumbling vibrations around you caused by the disturbance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I guess there's still a little stuck up there from the last experiment.\" She grinned, her face flooded with a deep blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although, that does give me an idea about how we can test your endurance...\" She didn't even need to tell you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there... no other way?\" You pleaded, your softened voice only just reaching her. You could tell by the unchanged emotion on her face that there was no convincing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. We can have a... sign of sorts; something you can do to communicate to me that you've had enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight reached down and held you in her hoof, bringing you up to an empty cushioned stool and placing you down gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, and without issuing any further warning, the looming pony turned around - a movement so titanic it felt like the earth turned - and then lowered her plot down towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed nervously at the massive plothole hovering a few feet away, contracting and pulsing as Twilight's tail raised up above you, casting a shade down over your entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few seconds it peeped open, and brought forward a ferocious gale that rivalled even the most violent wind storms you had experienced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm, unrelenting gust of wind was so strong that you grabbed hold of the cushion beneath you, worried it might genuinely send you hurtling to your demise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was accompanied by a low, baritone rumbling sound, like a shifting of a gigantic rock. So loud it almost pierced your ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds - that felt more like a few minutes - it ended, and the great force against you ceased. The smell, however, didn't. It was as potent and all-encompassing as a dank, putrid swamp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight peered over her shoulder and down at you. \"How was that? You're still... alive, at least.\" She smiled, though you felt that was a genuine concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Powerful.\" You replied, covering your nose to try and reduce the effects of the stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's try something a little more intensive.\" She told you, \"I'm going to sit down. When you feel like it's too much, just poke my left buttock. But... If possible, only do it if you really can't take it anymore. I want to make sure these results are as accurate as they can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the lump in your throat grow three times the size as Twilight began to ease herself back onto the stool; her flanks descended down on you, as big as a vast cliff face, and you found yourself crouching down in an effort to not be crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes, feeling yourself shrouded in darkness from every angle, and upon opening them, you saw that Twilight had sat down on top of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now trapped in the large crevice between her two butt cheeks; it was as if you were inside a huge cave, with a ridge running overhead. You could also see her plothole, protruding just above you, pursing and contracting to itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was already unpleasant, but it didn't take long for things to get much worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deafening bellow Twilight pumped gas into your enclosure; blaring against you like a sharp, hot geyser. You panicked, having to decide whether you wanted to cover your nose or your ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't last long, but even after it had finished emitting, you were still surrounded by a choking, thick smog. The smell was even worse, making you gag and hold back the need to throw up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air around you didn't seem to diffuse or weaken at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay down there?\" Twilight asked, raising her voice so that you could just about make it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a second to reply. \"<i>Not really</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. It won't be too much longer. Hang in there, Peppermint!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself collapse onto the plush surface beneath you, staring up at the huge protruding anus with a terrified gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear the distant sounds of her stomach working away, and before long Twilight raised one of her cheeks slightly, her asshole loosening and vomiting out another steaming stream of gas. This time, at least, it was silent. <br>\r\nWell... silent to Twilight, maybe, but to you there was still a loud hissing sound as the hot gas blew against your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of it pinned you to the floor, not allowing you to even move your hooves up to your face to protect it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, it ended, leaving you sprawled out and whimpering helplessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Whew</i>. I didn't know I still had so much in me...\" She said to herself, her voice tinged with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even have the strength to give her a response, just breathing heavily and looking up at that winking dark sphincter just inches above you. Your head spun, and after the next one there was a good chance you'd be forcefully knocked out cold. There was no question that the intensity of her farts was massively increased with your smaller size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I only have one more, for now.\" She told you, and seemed to readjust herself on the stool to get comfortable again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just laid lazily, unable to find the energy to do anything, just staring up at her asshole and awaiting another tortuous blast of flatulence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came shortly after, with the volume of a foghorn. The force of the wind against you was so strong it was almost like g force, pushing you down against the cushion and ruffling your hair like a fan on full blast. The smell hit you full on and was as repugnant as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last modicum of strength you possessed. you reached your hoof up to her left cheek and jabbed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight responded immediately, letting out a surprised yelp and quickly raising her plot up and away from you, letting out another high-toned fart as she did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sorry! Are you okay?\" She looked down at you, and you clearly looked as bad as you felt, as the mare blushed and smirked apologetically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was that bad, huh? I guess there's no question about your robustness being...<i> reduced</i> slightly. Thank you, though. I'm learning a lot more about the restrictions of your new size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trotted happily over to a scroll and marked down a few notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" She said, still writing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt another wave of dread over you. What more could she possibly do to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm almost satisfied, but I'd like to see...\"</span></div></div>",

I'm really interested to see if they've changed at all. Maybe they've gotten stronger!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still covering your nose from the foul gas she had just released, the eggy stench surrounding you like a putrid fog. \"Ugh well I can say for sure my sense of smell and hearing are definitely more sensitive... that fart seriously sounded like a storm! And don't even get me started on the smell...\" Your retched and tried to get some fresh air but it seems the Princess's gas had polluted all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, I suspected noises would seem much louder at your size. Though we will have to see just what the extent of the changes with your sense of smell are.\" She wrote on her parchment, not even noticing you gagging on her fart right in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, Princess? Are you sure about that? I mean, that fart REALLY stinks, and I wasn't even close to your plot! I don't really want to know just how bad it can get...\" You groaned and spoke up to her. Smelling more of her farts, especially when closer to the source, was not something you wanted to experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight finished writing and turned back to you. \"Of course I'm sure! Peppermint, don't worry. This won't be dangerous, we'll just run a few tests then I'll have you back to normal before long! Now, let's try out your sense of taste. I'm quite interested in this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped loudly as her gas seemed to finally clear, only to find it replaced with the rancid smell of her hoof you were standing on. \"Taste?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and nodded as she levitated you with her magic. \"Yes taste! It will be simple, just keep your mouth open!\" Before you could protest she brought your face right to her sweaty hoof, which seemed like it hadn't been cleaned all day. You opened your mouth to yell but this proved to be a very bad idea as you were rubbed all along her hoof. The taste was absolutely vile and only got worse as sweat pooled into your mouth. Twilight did this for about a minute until she seemed pleased with herself and finally pulled you off. \"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gag and cough up some of her hoof sweat, though not all of considering you had been forced to swallow some of it. \"That was the worst thing I've ever tasted! It was like making out with a fat stinking ass! When was the last time you washed your hooves?!\" You yelled and groaned as all you could taste was her dirty hoof, it was like it seared itself onto your tongue. You wanted to curse Twilight out for doing such a repulsive thing, especially when there was absolutely no reason for it when she could have just made you taste something actually pleasant like food. It seemed Twilight had been so eager to test out this spell she hadn't thought ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blushed a bit. \"Um, sorry it was yesterday morning. I missed my bath today, I was just sooo busy... Anyway. It definitely seems like your sense of taste is stronger! Let's try out another test just to be sure though. And since you gave me the idea...\" Again before you could speak up she brought you towards her plot, your eyes going wide upon seeing your destination. Kissing her unwashed ass was about the very last thing in the world you wanted to do. Unfortunately before you could close your mouth she slammed your face against her fat cheek, your lips pressing against it. The taste was indescribable and made you cringe. In fact it was so bad you could feel yourself passing out as your senses were overwhelmed, your vision going blurry as all you could see was her ass. </span></div></div>",

At least it seemed like she knew what she was doing, but there was always the chance of things going disastrously wrong and ending up as a chair or a lamp permanently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight raised the spellbook up towards her and began turning pages until she reached the one about transformation spells, her brow furrowing slightly as she studied it closely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" She started, \"It seems simple enough. The book suggests a couple of things I could try on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it... hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"It shouldn't. It might feel a little strange, but you'll be fine. The reversal spell is very easy to perform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, she offered the book to you, opened on the page, and pointed to the small list of objects it seemed to recommend transforming a pony into. You'd heard of troublesome wizards using a similar spell on ponies they didn't like to permanently leave them stuck as an item of furniture. The idea seemed horrifying, but you had confidence in Twilight's ability to reverse the spell if you needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe items the book seemed to suggest were... unusual, to say the least, but thinking about it for a second, you decided on...</span></div></div>",

That should be easy.\" Twilight stepped back, checking over the page of the spellbook again and then beginning to focus, her horn illuminating with a purple aura and pointed towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it didn't seem like anything was happening, but suddenly a strange tingling sensation ran through your entire body. It wasn't painful, but certainly wasn't pleasant, either. You felt your blood quake through your veins and your skin crawl over every inch of your frame. Extending a hoof, you remarked, with surprise, that it seemed to be shrinking down, eventually disappearing up into your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to remain calm, closing your eyes and trying to ignore the change that was taking place across your body; you felt yourself collapse onto the floor as your legs, too, seemed to gradually shrivel up into nothingness. You could feel every bone and muscle realigning, your skin growing tighter, then looser, then tighter again as it readjusted to your shifting structure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unfamiliar sensation heightened, feeling like the rushing, unstoppable feeling of g force you would get on a rollercoaster hurtling down a great height. Suddenly, the sensations just stopped. You opened your eyes, staring up at the ceiling. No matter what you did, you couldn't move. You couldn't even speak. All you could do was look around you, and take in silent breaths of air, as if you were breathing through your nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow!\" Twilight exclaimed, trotting over to you hastily and staring down into your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... are you okay there, Peppermint?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you couldn't reply, so you just blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll take that as a yes. It worked!\" She reached down and picked you up. Though you couldn't sense too much, you could feel that you were loose and draping over Twilight's hoof. It was a very strange, very scary sensation, but you felt surprisingly calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on. Let me show you.\" She turned to look for a mirror, and finding one, held it up to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at you was a small, purple pair of panties, laying helplessly in Twilight's hoof. If you had a heart, it would probably start beating a lot faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight continued to gaze down at you, studying you like a specimen in a jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should test your resistance.\" She commented, and then, without a word of warning, grabbed you by both sides and began to stretch you. The sensation was very unusual, but not painful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Not bad.\" She said to herself, staring down at you again. You could tell an idea was starting to develop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to need to see if you can withstand your intended purpose, though. If so, maybe I'll be able to try some more advanced transformations.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what she meant by 'intended purpose', but you couldn't exactly ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour answer came soon after, though, as Twilight once again stretched you out, and put both her hind hooves through your leg holes, pulling you up until you were tightly in place over her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! It's... a little bit of a tight fit, but you certainly seem to be maintaining your elasticity.\" The mare blushed, shaking her hips slightly and stretching her legs to get comfortable. You realised that you could sense everything; the clean, but still musky scent of her nethers consumed you entirely, and you became infused with her body heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's try...\" She said to herself quietly, heading across the room. You felt yourself rub over her thighs and cheeks with smooth, soft friction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, turned, and you only had a few seconds to see the empty chair beneath you before Twilight sat down on it with a soft thud, sending a shockwave through your entire \"body\". Now, all you could see was darkness, her ass pressed against the hard wooden surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself rub against the chair mercilessly as Twilight tested your limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing okay down there?\" She asked, her voice muffled, \"Oh, sorry. I forgot you can't exactly... <i>talk</i>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled nervously, clearly a little too caught up in the outcomes of this particular experiment to have thought about your wellbeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's<i> one</i> more thing I need to test out...\" She began apprehensively, clearly having left this until last for a reason. \"You're not going to like it, but it won't last long. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what it was she could possibly mean, but when the sound of a soft grunt came from Twilight, it all clicked instantly. Oh, dear Celestia...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Phrrmmmmmmmppp</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fart came out low and rumbling into the seat below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour entire self was overcome by a thick, relentless smog-like cloud. It was entirely different to the experience of just smelling a fart, or even having a fart in the face, as Twilight's penetrating gas had literally passed <i>through</i> you; forcing you to take the brunt - soaking you in the dense, rancid stench of flatus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could cough, you would, but you couldn't. You couldn't do anything besides breathe it in and remain in place hugging the princess' rear. Every thought was overcome; tainted by the pure, concentrated essence of her gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted up from the chair, giving you another burst of flatulence - this time unintentionally - and attempted to peer round and get a look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing you could do about your situation, as much as you wanted to get as far away from Twilight's ass in case something else slipped out. The smell was still all you could breathe in, and you sensed it wouldn't just disappear any time soon. The fact was, the particles of her gas had literally infused themselves into you. You were marked by this smell until she decided to wash you. In a way, you had <i>become </i>Twilight's farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled you off of her again, holding you up in front of her and seemingly hit by a pang of the smell you were now permeated with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! Sorry, Peppermint. At least we know you can withstand that... kinda.\" She grinned sheepishly. You were hoping she'd change you back soon, but she didn't seem to want to return you to your original form so soon. Maybe she was worried that once you were back, you would demand to leave immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she left you down on a table and told you she had a few letters to send. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no sense of hunger or thirst. All you could do was think and smell, and considering you still were holding on to the remnants of Twilight's expulsions, you wished you couldn't even do the latter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to tell how much time passed. There was so much to think about that it went quickly, and before you knew it Twilight had returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Peppermint. How are you holding up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just looked round at her, mute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Peppermint, I have been communicating with some friends, and I mentioned our experiment. It was impossible not to! It's not every day you pull off something so ambitious!\" <br>\r\nYou wondered where this was headed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thing is... somepony has shown quite a lot of interest in... borrowing you. Just for a day or two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, dear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously the limits of your new form are still to be seen, and, I felt that by lending you to somepony else, maybe it would be a good way of examining some of those limits, so I said yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. Twilight was at least vaguely considerate, but you couldn't be sure another pony would show you the same remorse. After all, you were nothing more than an article of clothing now; an object that could be thrown around, used, or abused in any way the wearer intended. You couldn't fight back. You couldn't protest. You couldn't even voice discomfort. Until Twilight turned you back, this was your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise that once they return you, I'll perform the reversal spell. It will just be for a day or two, like I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came over to you, picking you up, and then folding you a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to spring this on you so suddenly, but they asked that I send you to them by mail this evening. When you get back, I'll make it up to you, I promise.\" You could tell she meant this genuinely, but you couldn't guarantee whomever it was that received you would have such good intentions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last look you saw a grey, blonde-haired mail pony at the door, smiling and ready to deliver you to your new temporary residence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Hey Derpy. This is the package I mentioned. If you could just deliver this to...\"</span></div></div>",

You'd never particularly been turned away from anypony having less-than-perfect manners, and truthfully you really did want to get closer to Twilight. The idea of being so intimate with such an important pony - one you admittedly looked up to - was worth a little flatulence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ascending a couple of staircases, Twilight stopped you outside a large doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, here's your room! There's a bed, a desk, some reading material, an en suite bathroom, and a view that I'm sure you'll like!\" She outstretches a hoof proudly, and you step inside, almost taken aback by how ornate the room is. You've barely even <i>seen</i> somewhere this fancy before, let alone stay in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just in the next room, so if I need any assistance I'll just call.

There\u2019s some prepared in the main dining hall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... yes, thank you.\u201d He nods and departs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d been so busy you\u2019d almost forgotten about eating - it was probably best to do so <i>before</i> you went to help Twilight. You had a feeling the experience would quickly ruin your appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander along the corridors and head downstairs, taking the time to admire the murals, paintings, and lavish design that every part of this castle seems to have been decorated with. There\u2019s a nice, cool atmosphere inside with the crystal and stone walls and floors, making you feel very comfortable, and really very at home despite not even being here a day. Though your work is... less than desirable, the deal you have here is not bad at all. Not only are you working personally with a Princess, you\u2019re able to live in luxury. It\u2019s definitely worth having to smell a few smelly farts and help out with some slightly weird and unusual experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few wrong turns and a lot of walking, you find the dining hall, and more than that... it\u2019s empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large table stretches across the length of the great space, looking as if it were fit to hold at least fifty ponies, but right now there are none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only ponies in the room are a couple of guards who greet you as you enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Twilight?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Princess has been invited to a special dinner outside of Ponyville tonight, as she is meeting with some delegates from Cheneigh in the far south.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to just sit wherever you want. It\u2019s not surprising that Twilight is a busy pony with a lot of appointments, and you\u2019ll have more than enough time to spend with her later on, you\u2019re sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA waiter comes by to give you your meal; a nicely-prepared souffl\u00e9 with a small bundle of roasted vegetables alongside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost get the impression they just threw together something simple as the Princess was out of the castle, but you didn\u2019t mind, and sated your hunger by digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through eating, you looked up to notice to more creatures had entered the dining hall; a light purple unicorn with small highlights in her mane, and a short purple dragon. They choose seats and the waiters float across with their meals straight away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey!\u201d The unicorn greets you. \u201cYou must be Twilight\u2019s new assistant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I just got here today.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope Spike doesn\u2019t get jealous!\u201d She looks down to the dragon, who is about to put a forkful of food into his mouth, but stops to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Me and Twilight agreed for me to take a break for a while. I love being her assistant, but it\u2019s exhausting! Besides, I\u2019m trying to get into the body guard business!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... bodyguard?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! I figure a lot of creatures, especially rich ones, need someone as their right hand man, so why not me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019d want someone a little more, uh, brawny?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I\u2019m brawny!\u201d The dragon levered his arm to try and flex, but didn\u2019t seem to produce so much as a lump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn laughed as he rolled his eyes and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I\u2019m so rude! I\u2019m Starlight Glimmer! This is Spike!\u201d She waved, and Spike did the same, more preoccupied with his food than your presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Peppermint Swirl.\u201d You introduce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, has Twilight had you do anything yet? Order her books? File her socks in chronological order?\u201d The unicorn giggled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t sure whether or not you should tell them the truth - if Spike had been her assistant for so long, surely he would have had to do similar things, but maybe not? Maybe Twilight had been taking care of her flatulence issues in private and only just brought an assistant in to help with them to take the load off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, not much. I just helped with an experiment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelped with an experiment? Wow, she must really trust you!\u201d Spike spoke up with a mouth full of souffl\u00e9. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I just held a beaker.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you didn\u2019t specify that you were holding the beaker up against her asshole, or any other specifics of the task, but it was best to keep that information to yourself, in case the princess wanted to keep it private. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening pressed on, you made friendly small talk with Starlight and Spike, and after not too long, you could hear the main door to the castle open and brisk hoofsteps coming down the hallway towards the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight appeared in the doorway, but she looked... almost panicked; her teeth were fixed into a grimace, her legs restless and her breathing seemed intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... Peppermint... could I... <i>ugh</i> I need your assistance. It\u2019s... time for... studying.\u201d Between every other word she grunted and pulled a face, one eye half-closed - that almost looked like she was trying to hold down vomit... or hold something else <i>in</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed like she was really struggling to keep her composure, so it was probably a good idea to not keep her waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better go, Peppermint. Twilight really does get excited about studying.\u201d Starlight chuckled, but you knew already it wasn\u2019t studying that had her so worked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding it was best to not keep her waiting, you quickly got up and followed after her, sprinting up stairs and through corridors until the two of you reached her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed Twilight inside seconds before she used her magic to slam the door, and stood shaking in the center of the room, legs slightly apart and brow furrowed, she let loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fart that came ripping from Twilight like a faulty lawnmower was so loud you wondered if her shutting the door would even do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped, exasperated, and seemed to raise her rump up slightly - this was one <i>long</i> fart, and you could almost feel the second hand relief from her as it ripped and roared from the princess, seeming to get a little more wet until it dribbled into nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t exactly end there, though, as with an extra push another fart ached and eeked from her for what had to be a further five or six seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a sigh almost as loud and audacious as her gas, and collapsed forward onto her bed, breathing heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. I was holding that in the entire journey back. I was about to explode!\u201d She gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, she still <i>did</i> explode, but it was probably better to do it here than on a cramped carriage ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry - I\u2019ll open the window.\u201d She was sill out of breath, using her purple magic to push the window open a crack and then levitate a small air freshener from her bedside table and spray the room a few times. You got the impression she probably relied on this a lot, seeing as two empty bottles sat in the small waste paper basket by her work desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had dinner with some delegates from Cheneigh and we had some of their national curries and bhajis. They were delicious, but I do <b>not</b> think they agreed with me.\u201d <br>\r\nIf the previous display wasn\u2019t enough to prove she was right, a quick, damp-sounding fart slipped out from under her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. Ugh. That does <i>not</i> smell good.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow the smell from the particularly long fart she had just let out hadn\u2019t reached you yet - probably because she was closer the window than she was to you - but still she sprayed some of the air freshener again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t need to call you up in such a panic, I just wasn\u2019t sure what to do! That was pretty... embarrassing.\u201d She peered back at you over her shoulder and smiled, though the sides of her mouth were deep red with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. All part of the job, right?\u201d You could already tell you were in for a smelly night - you hadn\u2019t had a chance to actually get a sample of her curry gas yet, but based on the copious amounts of air freshener she was still spritzing liberally from the can, you could tell it wasn\u2019t at all pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, <i>man</i>, that korma must have had milk in it.\u201d She turned over, her hoof rubbing her pained stomach as she laid another wet-sounding fart into the bed sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing slowed and she seemed to regain her composure, standing back up and breathing a heavy sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry! This isn\u2019t a great night to start. I\u2019m not usually this bad!\u201d She played it off with an awkward laugh, still blushing just as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do have some important letters to write, though. I\u2019m sorry to have to do this to you, but, as you can tell... I kinda need your assistance.\u201d <br>\r\nShe seemed embarrassed even to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the job you\u2019d agreed to, after all. You just hoped you had enough stamina to keep up with her on a particularly... <i>farty</i> night. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll - <i>ugh</i> get myself over there when I can.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head towards the desk, and as you do quickly realize the chair Twilight has against her desk isn\u2019t ordinary at all; a large oval shape is cut into the seat of the chair and below it sits a large box. You can only assume this is where your head goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s a slightly awkward angle to get yourself into; you need to lie back so that your legs and arms are coming away from the desk and your head sits just under, pointing towards the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one final breath of fresh air and savoring it, you get down and shove your head into the box. It\u2019s padded and actually quite comfortable inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are also slits in the side of the box to let in the light, but seem to have been fitted with glass to <i>keep</i> in the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of getting used to this compartment and what you\u2019re about to endure, Twilight manages to get herself over to her desk and takes a seat, immediately blocking out some of the light, but you\u2019re able to make out the sight of her spread cheeks less than two inches away from your face; her tailhole sits, pursing slightly about level with your muzzle, and her marehood is directly above your forehead, half visible through the oval gap and half not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of her bare nethers isn\u2019t bad at all; slightly sweaty but you can tell she cleans well and often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like you can hear her fairly well from down here, too as she sighs, despite the box feeling quite sealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before she let out her first fart, windy and gushing from her puckered anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>brrooooooo</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the hot wind fill up the box, and the smell soon followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>holy Celestia</i>, it was not good. Your first instinct was to try and reach your hoof up to your nostrils, but realized quickly that this wasn\u2019t possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to just lie, face scrunched and contorted as the impossibly sharp and foul smell found its way into your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could smell the damage the exotic, aromatic spices had done to Twilight\u2019s poor stomach; the resulting smell of her fart was like a cloyingly bitter mix of curry and mustard - sweet yet unmistakably the smell of flatulence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. I hope it\u2019s not too bad down there.\u201d She shuffled to get comfortable and you could hear her start to write. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, it <i>was</i> too bad, but what could you do? You\u2019d already agreed to help Twilight with this most intimidate and disgusting deed, and it was definitely on the edge of bearable, even if it made your stomach turn and your nose burn and ache. You certainly never imagined that the princess of friendship could be so incredibly stinky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really an amazing place, though.\u201d She started, making casual conversation as if she hadn\u2019t just ripped a fart right into your face, \u201cthere are so many old ruins and pieces of history! I\u2019d love to take another visit there someday - only I think next time I\u2019ll bring a packed lunch.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last word or two are drowned out by another blast of gas, this time slightly spluttery and inconsistent. The box seems to somewhat muffle the sound too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same strong smell washes over you about a second later. You expect to be somehow used to it, but it hits just as hard as before. Another fart, this one moist-sounding, dribbles out and you hear her sigh in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d She apologises again, though you\u2019re not sure why. You can tell this is something she\u2019s fairly embarrassed about, especially in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to say, though, you\u2019re doing a very good job! I can\u2019t smell anything.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re not surprised with how intense the smell has been for you and how airtight this chamber seems to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear her quill scribbling on paper above you, still swimming in the vestigial smell of her emissions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can also occasionally hear her stomach working away and digesting; ominously low growling sounds that end in little internal squirts and whines. Her stomach is clearly doing its best to evacuate the foreign spices and the hefty dairy with equally hefty farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winced in pain as you simultaneously heard a rupturing rolling thunderous growl come from somewhere up above you in the princess\u2019 inner workings, and less than five seconds later were blitzed with a hot steamy hiss and an immediately repugnant curry smell, exactly like baked onions and rancid tomatoes thrown together with that same lingering mustardy undertone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped loudly after this airy, sultry stream of fetid gas had left her bowels; with every fart she was probably feeling gradually better, so at least you didn\u2019t have to endure this forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes teared up at the sides and you felt your nose was scrunched up, cringing as you took deep sniffs that seemed to cleanse the back of your nose and mouth like menthol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no getting used to the smell, but you wanted to help Twilight however you could. That was why you were here, after all. This probably wasn\u2019t a job that many ponies were willing to do, and in that way you felt quite fortunate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rump above you raised up as Twilight leaned forwards and lifted herself up and away from the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me just give you a little air. We wouldn\u2019t want you, y\u2019know, <i>passing</i> out or anything.\u201d She giggled bashfully. What an adorable dork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see her looking down at you in the box. \u201cComfortable?\u201d She grinned, but before you had the chance to answer the residual smell had clearly wafted up to her and she recoiled, eyes shut tightly and tongue distended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAck! Wow! That is...\u201d she blushed, holding her hoof over her muzzle and opening the window a little more, then spraying some more air freshener around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s... <i>much</i> more.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a few more moments to savor the relatively fresh air and give your lungs a rest before unexpectedly letting a loud fart out into the room above you. You can tell by the look on her face this was accidentally and she quickly sits back down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes readjust to the reduced light and the same view as before; her winking anus that sticks out, puffy, and like a bomb could go off unexpectedly at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remainder of your session together goes past surprisingly quickly. Every couple of minutes she tenses up and blasts another airy fart into your little box, which you promptly inhale. It still burns, but you manage to breathe most of it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all have the same stench, too, but the last two or three farts seem slightly more potent. So much so that the final whispery one she dispels into the box actually makes you cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, are you okay!?\u201d She gets up and peers down into your headrest, but you assure her you\u2019re fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that\u2019s all of it. Well... to be perfectly honest, I think I need to use the little fillies\u2019 room, and... yeah...\u201d she starts blushing again and trails off, clearly too embarrassed to tell you she\u2019d rather not risk letting out more than just gas onto your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs bad as her farts are to sniff point blank, at least you\u2019re spared the ablutions. You don\u2019t even want to imagine the sorry state she\u2019ll leave the toilet in; you got the impression whatever she ate in Cheneigh didn\u2019t agree with her at all. Hopefully the next time you had to assist her in this way her stomach wouldn\u2019t be quite so upset and as a result her farts wouldn\u2019t be quite so strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her magic, Twilight opens up the box again and you pull yourself out, glad to feel clean air on your now sweaty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>anyway</i> if you\u2019ll excuse me..\u201d the princess bids you goodbye and leaves fairly hastily to visit the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you need my services again this evening?\u201d You ask her just before she leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no. You did a great job. Thanks.\u201d With that, she doesn\u2019t stay around any longer and the short, wet fart that accidentally slips out from her cheeks tells you it\u2019s best she doesn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s nice to take a moment to relax. You sit on Twilight\u2019s bed for a moment, looking around at how neat and nicely-decorated her room is. You\u2019d expect nothing less from a princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s starting to get a little late, and it seems like a good time to get back to your room next door and sleep after such a busy day. However, you decide a quick shower first wouldn\u2019t go amiss.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s another room next to this one, though the door appears to be locked. You can assume this is probably the toilet Twilight is using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start the shower and climb in, letting the lukewarm water wash over you as you begin to scrub with a bar of soap. There are clean, neatly-prepared towels for you, too.

It was best to give Twilight her privacy, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour room already felt homely, and as you sunk into the fresh, cool linen and silky sheets suddenly the deed of inhaling pony farts didn\u2019t seem all too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell asleep almost instantly, giving your body the rest it desperately yearned for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning came suddenly and pleasantly, with the soft song of birds and the gentle touch of sunlight over your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, though, you realize the reason you were even awake in the first place was knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up and stretch. \u201cI\u2019m awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe princess wishes to see you next door.\u201d The voice of a guard comes through, and shortly after you hear his hoofsteps as he departs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you certainly didn\u2019t have to wait around to get to work, but you felt well-rested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading along the corridor and pausing outside Twilight\u2019s door, you knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter just as the Princess is lying sleepily under her bed sheets and spraying another can of air fresher around her, but it\u2019s not enough to mask the muggy odor already filling the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh. Peppermint. Good morning. I woke up with the <i>worst</i> bellyache, and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she doesn\u2019t need to say another word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need assistance?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, bashfully aware of how inconvenient it must be to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought maybe you could... come into bed with me to do it. These sheets seem to keep the, uh, <i>smell</i> in fairly well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would probably disagree with that given the fact you\u2019re already smelling her rank byproduct, but did as she said and crawled under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed was spacious, even with her in it, and though your legs and tail poked out the rest of your body was covered completely by the duvet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to ask for you so early, but I get the <i>worst</i> morning gas. Especially after I\u2019ve had something a little... objectionable.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s clear she\u2019s become more comfortable with the whole situation, and truthfully you have too. It didn\u2019t exactly make the experience any less nauseating, but it wasn\u2019t <i>quite</i> as bad as you had first expected, and if you\u2019d already survived her on one of her worst nights, it seemed like you could handle mostly anything this job would throw at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, Twilight\u2019s rump wasted no time and a thick, noisy fart blasted into the darkened space that your upper body and her lower body now occupied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see her back legs sprawled out and her tail laid out across the sheet, and, perhaps a little too cocksure, you pull her tail out of the way, lowering your head down to where her tailhole sits and inhaling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly realize how bad an idea that is. The smell hits you like boiling vinegar and you retch immediately. It\u2019s practically the same as last night, only it\u2019s been brewing away in her belly as she's slept. Clearly it takes a little longer for food to go through her entirely; vestiges of last night\u2019s exotic curries still clinging to her lower intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, dear. Are you okay?\u201d She asks with genuine concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d You respond, wiping a tear from your eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's best to take it one step at a time if you don't want to permanently damage your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets another fart leak out under the covers, this one much quieter and seeping out in a hot, fetid efflux. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your head at a safer distance and inhale slowly and carefully. The hot curry stench burns the back of your throat, but is becoming slightly more manageable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least you can say it's sobering. If you were still a little sleepy before you're wide awake now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking this pretty well.\" Twilight said languidly, resting her head into her pillow as she gradually relieved herself of her pent-up morning farts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's my job.\" You say back, muffled by the duvet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, it must be pretty stinky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not too bad.\" You lie, though to be honest it really isn't <i>that</i> unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steams your face with another warm, intoxicating voidance that you almost instinctively sniff. It's less concentrated than the last one, so you decide that with the next fart she passes, you're actually going to try and inhale it straight from the source. You're not sure why. Maybe just to prove that you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's almost all gone, now, Just one last one.\" She yawns, rolling over onto her front and offering you the perfect opportunity to try and take one of these at point blank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean in close, feeling the radiation of her body heat on your muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments of silence, you hear the rasp of another fart and soon after feel its airstream against your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you sniff it burns somewhere deep in your nose, but you keep in position. You sniff again, and again. It's starting to become a lot easier to hold in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. I think that's it. Thanks, Peppermint. You did a really good job.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's true; you hadn't heard the familiar spray of her aerosol this entire time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls herself out of bed and then you do the same. She's still sleepy, her shoulders softly rising and falling as she sucks in another yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ooh</i>. I need a shower, and probably the bathroom again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's your cue to leave, but before you're out the door she stops you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peppermint - I actually have a lighter schedule today, so I was going to ask..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at her as if she needed confirmation to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you like to grab some lunch in town? You came straight here, so, I'm assuming you haven't had a chance to see Ponyville properly yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I'd love to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles. \"Great! I'll come by your room around 11:30, okay?\" and with that, you head back to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. You already have a lunch date with princess Twilight herself! Well - not necessarily a <i>date</i> date, but it will be nice to spend some more time with Twilight that doesn't involve sucking in her farts. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The heat subsided slightly as you and Twilight made your way down through the center of Ponyville. Naturally, you garnered a few looks. It was clear Twilight was respected a lot round here, unsurprisingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped in what seemed to be the center of a restaurant district; a bunch of tables set out under colorful parasols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this your favorite place to eat here?\u201d You asked Twilight, who turned round to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not <i>exactly.</i> My <i>favorite</i> place is hayburger, but I figure it\u2019s best I don\u2019t eat anything too disruptive for your sake and for mine.\u201d She blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she hadn\u2019t told you, you assumed talking about her <i>condition</i> in public was a bad idea. It was clearly something she was a little self-conscious about sharing, even if she was becoming more and more comfortable with sharing it with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you took a seat outside a cafe which wasn\u2019t busy at all, but which Twilight insisted was the best. It also meant you had a little more privacy to talk away from the prying ears of the public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI recommend the feta and walnut salad - it\u2019s delicious!\u201d She licked her lips voraciously as she hailed over a waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peered down at the menu. It wasn\u2019t cheap, but you sort of expected Twilight was covering the cost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have the feta and walnut salad with an orange juice, and...?\u201d She looked to you, urging you to order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another quick glance at the menu you went with what looked good: a cress and cheese tart served with gourmet hay bites and an apple juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter made a note and hurried off to get your food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t the weather wonderful today?\u201d Twilight gazed out at the lively town square. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still warm, but not as blisteringly so as it had been the day before. You took a moment to just sit and enjoy the view with Twilight, before she started up a quiet conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you noticed earlier that my, ehm, <i>emissions</i> had a similar odor to the ones last night.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had, but it seemed like a weird conversation starter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Guess it was still going through your system.\u201d Even you felt a little embarrassed discussing the subject in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it. I was thinking, and it seems as though there are certain times of the day where certain meals are at different digestive stages.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she\u2019d found a way to geek out about even this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor example... what I\u2019m about to eat now will probably start to show itself this evening - around the time I\u2019ll be <i>studying</i>, and what I eat this evening for dinner will likely be detectable tomorrow morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed along, checking over your shoulder every few seconds to check there wasn\u2019t anypony in ear shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough of course last night was an exception; as I had some food that didn\u2019t agree with me, my body must have just tried to get it out of me as quickly as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, realizing what it was she was rambling on about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. It\u2019s a little gross, but I find digestion fascinating! How certain especially potent base ingredients can find themselves coming through in the smell of the... <i>flatulence</i>.\u201d She whispered that last word especially quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right though. You had noticed the strong presence of onions and mustard in the smell of her gas, which you assumed were probably used a lot to cook the curries she had eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped yourself. Celestia, you were really analyzing the smell of a pony\u2019s fart. You really had gone crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter appeared with your food, laying it down on the table and thanking Twilight as if her just being there was a blessing. You couldn\u2019t deny that it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dug into her salad like a ravished dog, quickly realizing she was in public and then eating a little slower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is great!\u201d She tells you enthusiastically with her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lunch tastes great, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think forward to the upcoming evening, realizing that in some way the salad Twilight is currently chowing down on will be filling your nostrils. It\u2019s a weird thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you continue to make casual conversation over lunch, until you find you\u2019ve both finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll cover it. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d She pulls a coin purse out from her satchel and lays the appropriate amount down on the table over the bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s genuinely enjoyable spending time with Twilight. Despite the position you\u2019re in with her, she doesn\u2019t seem to be too embarrassed to treat you as a friend, too. You can tell your assistance is genuinely useful and that she\u2019s elated to have someone she can share that side of herself with without worry of ridicule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou part ways when you get back to the castle; Twilight has to leave you to spend some time with her friends. You\u2019re almost sad to be apart from her, even for a few hours, but knowing you have another intimate session coming up this evening seems to brighten your spirits, even if what you\u2019ll be doing is still quite disgusting and grueling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself caring a lot less, though. Back when you arrived the idea of being anywhere near pony gas made your stomach lurch, but you realized now that it really wasn\u2019t so bad. It still smelled pretty horrible, sure, but it made Twilight happy, and it gave you a chance to be as intimate with her as possible. In a weird way, you spend the rest of the afternoon looking forward to your evening session. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Study time!\u201d She announces, as if it\u2019s already routine for the both of you. It\u2019s only the second day, but in a way it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s a lot less alarmed than yesterday, too, which at least means her gas won\u2019t be quite so bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow her into her room again, looking just as it had this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you haven\u2019t been too bored!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no, I got lost in a book.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles. \u201cI know that feeling all too well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe routinely takes a seat on her \u201cthrone\u201d again, using her magic to open a large, old, leather-bound spell book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shortly get into your box again. There\u2019s less dread now that this whole situation is more familiar to you; you figure that experiencing her worst gas on your first night has meant you\u2019re now more quickly-adjusted to an average night of her studying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a day!\u201d She sighs. \u201cPinkie Pie and Applejack were having some silly argument about setting up the Ponyville county fair for this weekend, and it took forever for them to come together and use both their strengths combined. It was hard not to just intervene, but you\u2019ve got to let ponies work things out by themselves sometimes.\u201d She rambled. It didn\u2019t really mean anything to you, but you still listened, happy to hear Twilight tell you about her day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably you hear the tight, airy hiss of a fart coming from above you. Looks like it\u2019s started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to work, but unexpectedly, the smell hits hard. Much harder than you were prepared for, and you begin to cough and splutter uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought a healthy, light lunch would result in slightly better-smelling farts, but evidently it just made them infinitely worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt hearing your violent reaction, Twilight quickly gets up from the seat and peers down into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just like yesterday this backfires, and the smell of her own gas reaches up and punches her in the face, too. You see the visible shock and disgust contort over her features as she also breaks into a coughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Holy Moly</i>!\" She manages, rummaging around in her drawer and producing a wooden clothes peg, hastily clipping it over the end of her muzzle and spraying another half can of air freshner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess healthy eating only makes it <i>worse</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel a whole lot less confident about your ability to withstand another studying session, but you grit your teeth and instruct Twilight to sit back down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitates for a moment, clearly a little worried about your wellbeing, but does as you tell her and blocks your view once more with her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before another windy fart blows into the box surrounding you. You try to mentally prepare, and then sniff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't as sickening as last night's curry farts, but it's definitely a lot stronger and sharper, practically burning the inside of your nose. It's like a hot, humid, vegetative odor of steamed cabbage or broccoli. It's hard not to gag, but you manage to hold it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me know if it's too much, okay?\" She tells you, embarrassed, and gets back to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother piping hot fart blows against your face a couple of minutes later, which you obediently inhale. It's bracing, but once again you manage to hold it in, exhaling it back out through your mouth and feeling it burn just as much on the way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the study session continues much the same as it had the night before; the frequency of the gaseous outbursts is definitely less, but the sheer potency of them makes it feel like it lasts a lot longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the session, you're feeling a little dizzy, but mostly okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Peppermint. You did great.\" Twilight's eyes lighten up as she waves you out of her room, though just before you can leave she calls out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wait</i>! There's one last one!\" She says, panicked, and you hurry over to where she's standing by her bed, dutifully getting up behind her and lowering your muzzle directly to her asshole. You feel a warm spray of silent gas flood your nostrils directly, and sniff as hard as you can, letting it burn deep in your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems even more impressed by this display, once more wishing you goodnight and letting you head to your own bed.   </span></div></div>",

Again, it was difficult, but something in you wanted to do the very best job you could for Twilight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer farts weren't as obnoxious as they had been yesterday; for last night's dinner she had eaten something fairly mild, which manifested itself in her morning farts with a cloying, potent smell like sulfuric cabbage. It was definitely gross, but it was also becoming easier to withstand it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you'd attended to her morning duties, which seemed to be a lot less than the day before, you once again parted ways with Twilight, letting her head to take a morning dump and leave you to preoccupy yourself for another day. You decided a walk around the castle grounds and the outskirts of Ponyville could be nice; after all, you'd still barely explored the town around you, or even the rest of the castle for that matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight came to visit you just before lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Peppermint.\" She showed herself in to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to let you know I'll be busy for most of the day. I have some special visitors coming for a dinner later, so if you could help clean up the dining room, that would be great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you still be needing my services this evening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Oh, I think so. I'll see you later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept yourself busy for the rest of the day, doing a little cleaning, taking a little stroll around the grounds, and before you knew it, the evening had come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked out from your bedroom window as an ornately-decorated carriage descended down to the entrance of Twilight's castle, and inside, to your surprise, sat princesses Celestia and Luna. You almost had to rub your eyes to assure you weren't seeing things. It was the <i>real</i> Celestia and Luna. You'd never seen them before in person, though it was no surprise Twilight was having this calibre of guest to dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Twilight came to your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Peppermint. I'm sure you saw them arrive, but I have Celestia and Luna here for a meal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw them. I'm a little star struck.\" You chuckle nervously. She grins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought I'd let you know that I'll come to visit you a little later on. Looks like there's quite a feast prepared so I'm sure I'll be needing your assistance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, she leaves you again, and apart from a guard coming by to give you some dinner, for the next two or three hours, you're left alone in your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you hear a rapping at your door, and call for whoever is outside to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Twilight, only, she's not alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you see Celestia and Luna behind her, you fix your slumped posture and sit up, attentively, not wanting to seem like a slob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Peppermint Swirl?\" Celestia asks Twilight, stepping past and into your room. You're still a little in awe that Celestia herself is in the same room as you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Uh, Peppermint, I hope you don't mind, but we got talking about your... <i>position</i> here, and Celestia and Luna wanted to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna entered the room, too, checking you out as if you were on auction and she were considering buying you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... he doesn't mind it?\" She asked Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, It can get a little stinky sometimes, but Peppermint does a perfect job.\" She seems a little embarrassed to be discussing this in front of the Princesses. You wonder how it managed to come up in conversation in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peppermint,\" Celestia addresses you directly, \"How would you feel about me and my sister... trying out those services of yours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were speechless for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna interrupted. \"It's just, I believe we had a little too much to eat. Neither of us really want to stink up the carriage on the ride back to Canterlot. If you don't want to, then we would understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight shares a look with you, as if she hadn't fully expected the princesses to ask something of you like this, either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't feel like you can really turn them down, though. The chance to serve beneath Celestia and Luna, in whatever capacity, seems a once in a limetime opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help.\" You tell them, and immediately their eyes light up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He really is willing to do this!\" Celestia exclaimed to Twilight. \"I almost thought you were joking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! Peppermint is the best assistant I've ever had! He's already been through the wringer with me.\" Twilight blushes to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case,\" Luna begins, \"Let's not waste any time. My stomach feels unsettled to no end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia, Luna, and Twilight advance towards you. You remain seated on your bed and watch as Celestia and Luna turn around in front of you, pointing their illustrious, clean, royal bottoms to you as Twilight gets up onto your bed and aims her rump towards you, too; you feel yourself blushing at the sight of three sets of genitalia in your face in every direction; firstly, Twilight's familiar rear end. Then, Celestia's wide, pristine-white, perfectly rounded plot. Finally, Luna's smaller, but shapely cheeks where her dark, winking plothole and marehood sit beneath her tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have long to think about it before the first fart is produced. It comes from Celestia, a loud, raspy blowing fart that raises slightly in pitch as it releases. You hear her sigh contentedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to handle this job in the same way you had for Twilight, you lean towards her rump and inhale. The smell is immediately dizzying and unfamiliar to you; almost musky in a way, and somehow smelling like something you shouldn't be smelling at all. Celestia's personal smell. It's unique in the same way that Twilight's is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after her sister's ass bursts with a softer, quieter wet fart that gently ripples and rips moistly for a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean towards her and get a sample of her aroma. It's different, too; earthy and pungent like aniseed but with a thick, eggy smell to it. You find yourself coughing as your facial features contort in instinctive disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like my fumes are too much for him.\" Luna laughs to herself, but you assure her you're fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia lets rip again, followed almost instantly by Twilight. The two fart sounds collage together, and pretty soon the smells hit you from two sides; you can sense the familiarity of Twilight's smell. It's a little scary that you've inhaled so much of her gas that you can pick it out, but it's almost overpowered by the sheer musk of Celestia's. You decide leaning in towards each posterior is probably not worth it, as Luna, too, lets out another wet rambling fart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain in the middle, hearing fart sounds blast out around you from every direction; the odors combined are definitely something strong, and you already feel your eyes watering from inhaling them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farts continue to come, overlapping but each pony having their own unmistakable sound and smell. It's a strange, dizzying experience but you do your job and stay in place, sniffing loudly and trying to keep your dinner down as the concoction of pony gas grows stronger and stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterspersed amongst the variously-toned farts are soft, feminine grunts and sighs of relief from the three princesses. Some of the farts are short, staccato pops or cracks; some are long, windy, squealing trumpety plumes of acrid gas that only add more to the swarming cloud of effluvium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou become more and more lightheaded. Usually it's only Twilight's farts you're inhaling. Three different ponies all at once is something entirely different, and your oxygen becomes deprived much faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds around you eventually seem to just merge into one mosaic of fart sounds, but you can sort of tell which pony is letting off which ones. Twilight's are more frequent, but shorter, and have a potency that cuts right through. Celestia's are mostly longer and windier, with a smell that seems weirdly personal to her. Luna's are also long, but much wetter and not as loud. The smell, though, has just blended into one. You can barely even pick out individuality in it anymore; it's just a thick smog of sulfur and methane and chokingly sour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really do begin to feel lightheaded, like you might pass out any second, but Celestia and Luna seem to be finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I feel a hundred pounds lighter!\" Celestia coos softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters turn to look at you, but Twilight doesn't seem to be totally empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight? You still have more, after even all of that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to see that Twilight has sunken into a downward dog position, her rump raised up and her head resting against your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... a little more.\" She says, still clearly embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mischievous smile seems to spread across Luna's face. \"Why don't we see how good Peppermint really is at this?\" The sisters share a glance, and in only a few seconds you feel their hooves against the back of your head, guiding it towards Twilight's rump.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're held only about an inch away from Twilight's butt, watching her hole pucker as you already had so many times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pert, shrill, trumpet-like fart blurts out from her ass, and she lets out a stuttered gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he needs to be a little closer if he's going to get it all.\" Luna says sadistically, and you feel a push against your head, forcing you to make contact with Twilight's butt. She looks round, seemingly as surprised as you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell this close up is as strong as it can be. At this point it's hard to even make out any particular resemblance to anything; it's just strong, smelly gas. Almost like the smell of petrol, or burning rubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you do as you're told and take in a whiff. It seems to only make you twice as lightheaded, and you feel a headache form in one side of your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight pushes out another fart, this one half-muffled by your face and hitting you directly with an irritating stench that makes you cough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact,\" Celestia starts, \"Why don't we make sure he gets <i>all</i> of it? See how good his tolerance really is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you feel Celestia's hooves move from supporting the back of your head to grabbing your jaw, squeezing your muzzle and forcing you to open your mouth through pursed lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna then applies some more pressure from behind in a precise way, and you can feel that your mouth is open and around Twilight's asshole, Sealed around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight seems just as shocked as you, looking up with eyes that seem to ask if you're ok. The main thing that concerns you is passing out on the job, which it seems is dangerously close to happening. The room is already swirling and dancing around as if you're drunk, and you feel like it would only take a couple more farts to knock you out completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not sure how much more I have.\" Twilight calls up to Celestia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you can push at least one more out, Twilight.\" Celestia's soft, comforting voice comes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple alicorn nods and you can see on her face that she's pushing as hard as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few seconds later a fart blasts out into your mouth like a warm air canon, but in the shock of the unfamiliar sensation it simply forces itself out either side of your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.\" Celestia says to you, \"That's not how you do it. You're letting it all escape.\" Her tone is strict but at the same time weirdly assuring. You're so dizzy it all feels like a dream to you, anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you want to do,\" She begins, as if she's giving you some kind of lesson, \"Is swallow the gas as it enters your mouth. It'll feel good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, you could breathe it in.\" Luna suggests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I think that would be a bit too harsh for his lungs. They're clearly still not fully accustomed to gas yet.\" With how bizarre this whole situation is, you ask yourself if you really are dreaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got one more, Twilight?\" Celestia asks, and Twilight nods silently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then make this count.\" She tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds, a low, rasping fart floods your mouth with a hollow, gulpy noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying your best to do as Celestia says, you suck the gas to the back of your throat and swallow it, as if it's a mouthful of water; gulping it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can physically feel it travel down your gullet and to your stomach. It's possibly the weirdest thing you've ever experienced, but as soon as Celestia feels satisfied, she and her sister release their grip and you fall down onto your back, watching the ceiling spin around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon see Twilight looking over you, concerned. \"Peppermint? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be fine.\" Celestia assures her. \"He just needs a little fresh air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the window open with a creak, and feel the cool, rain-tinged night breeze drift in. It's wonderful. It feels like a gallon of water after a week stranded in the desert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Celestia starts up again, \"I think it's time for dessert.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ponies leave, but Twilight looks back at you one last time to check you're ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of filtering the farts from your lungs, you begin to feel better. The lightheadedness subsides almost instantly, and you're able to sit up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot soon after, the door knocks once more. Your heart drops as you expect to see the three princesses back for round two, but it's just Celestia on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approaches you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're feeling better, Peppermint. I apologize if me and Luna got a little carried away. It's been hundreds of years since we've encountered a pony willing to attend to... such private matters.\" She pauses for a second. \"I'll get to the point. We were just talking, and me and Luna were remarking how nice it would be to have a pony like you around our castle back in Canterlot. As you can imagine, like Twilight, we find ourselves <i>in need</i> of assistance often. Don't feel compelled, but I wanted to ask if you'd consider coming back with us and resuming your job at our castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offer comes as a surprise. You're not sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, if you feel you have a duty to remain here serving Twilight, then I'll understand, but if you would like to come back and work for us, we'd provide you with everything you have here. We have one of the finest chefs in Equestria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a moment. You'd only been working with Twilight for three days, and already the two of you had seemed to secure a bond. On the other hoof, working for Celestia or Luna seemed like one of the highest honors imaginable. They may have been a little more extreme with their methods, but they clearly still understood when they had pushed you too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which of you two would I be serving?\" You asked, still toying with the idea in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could perhaps do a trial period of sorts. Me and Luna naturally work at very different times, so you could alternate between the two of us. After a week or so, you could choose one of us to serve permanently.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you, waiting for an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight's okay with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said that if you made this decision, she'd still understand. I'm sure she'd be over to visit more than once, anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to decide. It seemed like even with a lifetime to think it over, it would be difficult to choose, but after about a minute, you go you decide to...</span></div></div>",

If you ever change your mind, ask Spike to send us a scroll. We could always use an assistant as diligent as you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, she leaves you alone in your room, and a few moments later you see her carriage leave from outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a knock at the door a few minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Peppermint.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Twilight. She smiles warmly as she enters your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you decided to stay here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't leave you when you need my assistance so often.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed. \"I'll leave you for the night. You've had a pretty... <i>exhausting</i> evening. You need some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's certainly one word to use, though <i>extreme</i> would probably be more accurate. There's a certain sense of relief in having chosen to stay with Twilight; you could tell the other princesses were a little more... unforgiving in their methods. Even if you were made to inhale her noxious fumes, Twilight was at least a little more understanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned the light out and rolled over into bed, falling fast asleep in just a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake softly, feeling a comforting warmth of the morning sun across your face. The hectic session with Celestia and Luna the night before now feels like it happened a thousand years ago; you're here, still with Twilight. Everything feels good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're even surprized to find yourself genuinely anticipating your morning session with Twilight, trotting contentedly across to her door and knocking gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, she's under her covers, reading a book which she momentarily lays flat on her chest to smile at you. \"Good morning, Peppermint! Did you sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did.\" You reply, hopping up onto her bed and waiting for her to raise the covers and allow you underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll probably be fairly brief this morning. I think I emptied myself a little last night.\" You recalled her long, seemingly endless farts that the other two princesses had forced you to take in close up. It was hardly surprising she was a little... <i>farted-out</i> this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself once again under her sheets, faced with her lower body which you have come so accustomed to. She shifts around, laying on her back, and spreads her legs a little wider for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also,\" She begins, \"I'm afraid I'll be out all day. I have to go and give a lecture at my school this morning, and then all afternoon I'm meeting with some friends in Yakyakistan.\" She chuckles coyly, \"This time, I maybe shouldn't go and eat something I've never even heard of before.\" She recalls the events of a few nights ago after her dinner in Cheneigh, and then lifts up the duvet to peer down at you with a smirk. \"Unless, you'd like me to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure how to respond at first. She really thinks you <i>prefer</i> it when her farts are worse? You're certainly more used to them, but that doesn't mean you're willingly going to give your nose a more torturous time than it needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat what you want. Don't let me change that.\" You reply, and she seems happy to hear it. \"Thanks. I'll try and eat something a little more mild, but I'll be back for the entire evening, so if I do go with something more... adventurous, I'm sure you'll be able to manage it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're both interrupted by a fart, which she squeezes out casually onto the mattress. You sink your head down between her thighs and get to work, sniffing deeply and slowly. It's definitely the most manageable gas she's had since you arrived, or are you just becoming more insusceptible to the smell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Twilight predicted, the session doesn't last very long at all. After about five more minutes she has a short, half-silent fart, and then seems to be rid of her morning gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both part ways, and head off to try and find a way to keep yourself entertained for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt drags at times. Maybe it would be worth finding something to keep yourself occupied while Twilight is busy, but you get by by exploring around Ponyville a little and spending a good hour or two in the arcade. You'd always been a fan of video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back to the castle as the sun is just setting, and find Twilight has already arrived home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The princess is in her room. She asked to send you up when you return.\" A guard tells you, and you promptly make your way upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're surprised to see Twilight isn't sat at her desk, but on her bed, reading what appears to be the same book she was this morning. Her face brightens immediately as she sees you enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peppermint! I was wondering when you'd get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I was just taking a look around town.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about it.\" Her voice is slightly strained, and you share a knowing glance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to avoid anything too... disagreeable, but the food there was just so good!\" She's clearly a little ashamed, but you don't care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the ominous growl of her stomach and sit on the bed next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already let a couple out.\" She admits, still somehow a little embarrassed to talk about the subject, \"They... don't smell great.\" She grimaces sheepishly, and decides on lying down over your legs on her belly, her plot facing up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean over and get ready for the first gassy discharge - you're a little surprised she's been able to hold them in so well so far. As soon as she lays down onto her belly, though, her lower intestines seem to start working faster and within a few seconds, a loud, crisp, wet fart burbles through her cheeks and smacks you in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a strong, very eggy odor, which you quickly start sniffing. This night is going to be tougher than you originally thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I ate so much..\" She moans to herself, reaching down to rub her tummy and push out another moist eruption of gas, this one going on for a bit longer and just as smelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing grows heavy and laboured, her frame draped over your legs and her head buried in her hooves. Although she isn't wrought with quite as much desperation as she was a few nights ago, it's clearly still causing considerable discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach down and spread open the buttcheek closest to you to allow the gas to pass more easily. It feels like a warm, soft pillow of fat, and as you pull it, you reveal her dark, winking plothole which had been concealed beneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer back arcs slightly and you see her plothole blossom and push out to spit a windy, warm plume of air at your face. You fill your lungs with the dense, sulfur-like stench, holding back a cough and leaning in even closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later another fart is released, dry and noisy like tearing paper. The familiarly humid wind reaches your muzzle again, and just as obediently as ever, you bring it into your lungs, sullying them with Twilight's rectal perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, these smell so bad.\" She buries her muzzle even deeper into her arms and groans, but you assure her by boldly craning your neck down and planting a kiss on her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe freezes for a second, but then pulls her head from their protective cave and looks up at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope you haven't somehow crossed a line, but you can't deny it any more: you love Twilight, and you love her farts. Even if they're the most awful-smelling things in Equestria (and they certainly come close) you wouldn't care, because they come from her, and you know that every breath of methane you inhale is one less breath she has to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to double down on your affectionate gesture, you lean in and plant another kiss, this time on her cheek. She blushes, and after a moment, starts to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peppermint...\" She utters softly, turning slightly and moving her head closer to yours, allowing you to tenderly ease into a kiss. Your heart shudders as you feel the warm wetness of her mouth, her tongue gingerly daring to explore yours. It feels surreal, but at the same time it feels right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou embrace Twilight, wrapping your arm around the back of her neck, but the moment is interrupted by a trumpeting utterance from her rump. She pulls away and blushes. \"I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle. \"Don't worry.\" and relocate your head back to the other side of the mare, blissfully breathing in through your nose and allowing the gas to burn the back of your throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly you feel Twilight's hoof against the back of your head, slowly guiding it down so that your face is smooshed against her cheeks, muzzle fitting snugly into the crevice between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tenses up and releases more gas, muffled and muted by your face but still surprisingly loud. You sniff fervently, nuzzling up against her plothole, begging for more, and she has a lot more to give. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell is overwhelming but your pure, passionate instinctual love for Twilight has taken over entirely, and you continue to sniff and snort, replacing the oxygen in your lungs with her thick, growly expulsions. Your head is swimming, spinning, and Twilight pulls you back out, sitting up straight and once again pulling you in for an impassioned kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart is beating rapidly, pounding in the back of your throat as you clumsily reach around Twilight, holding her close and never wanting this kiss to end - even if the smell of eggs and soggy, pungent cauliflower is lingering around the two of you. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Somehow, Twilight notices this at almost the same time, breaking the kiss and looking down at it curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" She remarks, blushing again. You find yourself a little embarrassed, too, not entirely sure what to do next, but the sultry, seductive eyes Twilight looks back up at you with give you an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... <i>really</i> like my farts, huh?\" She asks, teasingly, and giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more the kiss, but you can't deny that in some weird way her gas is becoming oddly arousing too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares down at your cock again, eyes filled with intrigue. You wonder if she's... ever seen one before like this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brow furrows and she leans over to one side, letting a fart rumble against the mattress. \"Sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh. Even now, she's still apologizing for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill seeming a little unsure, Twilight hesitantly leans down towards your stiffened member, and, after taking a moment to just look at it, she starts to lick it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you heart was going crazy before, it's in overdrive now; you feel a wave of shock and sensation ripple up your back as Twilight becomes a little more comfortable, and drags her wet, hot tongue up the length of your shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses briefly to dismiss another fart from her bowels, bursting out in a wet rippling explosion, and then gets back to tasting your cock; exploring the shape of it with her tongue and feeling it tense and throb in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take in a shuddered gasp as you're overtaken by ecstasy. You can't hold back anymore, and grab Twilight by the shoulders, eliciting a little yelp of surprise from her as you pin her onto her back, looming over her and staring directly into her eyes. She holds her hooves up over her chest as you allow your carnal instinct to overcome you and sink down into her groin, your tongue probing and massaging her already moistened pussy lips. She loses control of herself and involuntarily pumps out sporadic, spluttering farts. The smell floods your nostrils, but you don't care. If anything, the smell seems to just increase your drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight is speechless, gasping and moaning uncontrollably as her body shudders against yours; your tongue explores her marehood as hers explored your own member, deeper and deeper. You taste the musky, almost sharp flavor of her pussy; juicy and fleshy and growing more so as Twilight's arousal heightens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Pepper-\" She tries to say, but her words fall apart; giving in to her libido and raising her shoulders, her body shuddering and quivering and her pelvis beginning to gyrate back and forwards slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more short, gulpy farts rip out from beneath you, blowing a hot, steamy breeze against your neck and replenishing the eggy aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull your face away from her groin, a strand of saliva still connected as you stare up at Twilight. Her eyes are pleading and soft, drool pooling at one side of her mouth as she pants and gasps in messianic pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your body up again, your member hanging rigidly. You bring it up to Twilight's marehood and press against the wet outer lips gently, seeing her entire body quake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...\" She whispers, spreading her legs and forcing out another bubbling fart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing for just a moment, you thrust forward, watching your cock disappear into her readily awaiting mound, wrapped with a firm, unrelenting grasp as it sinks deeper into her warm, wet, tightness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight squeals, biting her hoof and feeling her shoulders shudder and rise up, every muscle tensing and relaxing all at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathless, you continue to move in and out of her, your cock effortlessly pumping in and out rhythmically, pushing her hips back and forwards and causing her mattress to jump up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fart escapes from her, her attempts at restraining it no longer there. Moments later the rich, satisfying aroma of it rises up to you and motivates you to plunge into her with more vigour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer yielding pussy walls massage your cock as it drives in and out, tingles spreading across its entire length and igniting a tickling sensation in your balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan along with Twilight, whose careful and measured demeanour has given way entirely to raw, unbridled pleasure and passion. Her lips quiver and push together as the alicorn tries to speak, but can't. All that seems to come from her is wailing, wavering moans and screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself unable to break from your thrusting motion, too, just getting faster and faster and seeming like it might never stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight grabs the sides of her bed for support, twisting and tensing and squirming with delight. You can tell you're close to climax, and deciding cumming inside a princess wouldn't be ideal, unsheathe your cock and explode with heaving ropes of thick, white fluid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey splatter all over Twilight's torso in a stringy, random pattern, and this seems to bring Twilight to climax herself, releasing the loudest, most piercing scream yet and feeling herself explode, her pussy sending a spurt of her own seminal fluid out in an arc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collapse next to Twilight. For a few moments, there's only the sound of you both panting as you gradually catch your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peppermint... I never knew you felt so strongly about me.\" She tells you, still flustered, but manages to let out a short chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you felt that way about me, either.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... great.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down at herself, covered in both of your cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I should maybe go take a shower.\" She relaxes herself, imbuing her mattress with another fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she weren't painted in ejaculate, her bed is now a sweaty, tangled mess of sheets. You feel like you could do with a shower yourself, if only to wind down before bed.</span></div></div>",

She seems annoyed or frustrated somehow, breathing fairly heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later she visibly tenses up her abdomen and you can make out the sound of a bundle of watery waste plopping into the water below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Celestia...\u201d she curses under her breath, spraying from yet another can of air freshener. She seems to have them placed strategically around the castle, which you\u2019re not too surprised about given her tendency to produce awful odors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out another grunt and empties her bowels more into the toilet bowl beneath her.

In some weird way, you almost wish you could help her somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? Maybe the fumes she administered to you earlier had made you truly lose your mind, but you felt compelled to service the Princess in her time of need. Even now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea developed in your head, and you soon found yourself considering something truly unlike yourself - actually going over, knocking on the door, and asking if she needed help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like you had a death wish, but the more you thought about it, the more it made sense. In some strange way it was as if you wanted to see the most intimate and personal sides of the princess, and the idea of being left out of even something as disgusting as this felt wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled yourself away from the gap in the wall, and decided...</span></div></div>",

There was still a second of hesitation, but not for long. You reached towards the locked bathroom door and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. <i>Occupied</i>!\" You heard Twilight's strained voice come from inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess. It's me. Peppermint Swirl. I just... I know it's not part of my job, but I wanted to see if you needed any assistance in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few moments of silence. You had clearly taken Twilight by surprise, and just as you were about to check she'd even heard you, she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Don't feel as if you have to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-I want to.\" You interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. Okay. I guess I could use a hoof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the lock in the door turn, and with her magic, she opens it slowly. She's still sat up on the toilet seat, bent over and visibly in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just stand around! I don't want somepony seeing me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step inside and she swiftly closes and locks the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're inside, the smell hits you. Despite the window being wide open, the room is somehow still humid, and a bitter smell lingers in the air. It's like the same onion-y, mustard-y odor her farts had, only a lot more intense and a lot more like manure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. You really don't need to help with... <i>this</i> if you don't want to. It's not within your duties as my assistant at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... it looks like you could use some assistance to me. That's what I'm here for, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment she smiles up at you, but this doesn't last long as a wet, spluttery fart echoes around inside the bowl and her face suitably contorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I help with?\" You ask, and after regaining her composure, she tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ugh</i>... Um... My stomach is hurting pretty bad, and I think it could use a little stimulation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stimulation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Maybe you could... <i>rub</i> it a little? An abdominal massage can often loosen the bowels a little more.\" You can tell she's exceedingly embarrassed even saying this, but it's obvious she needs help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do that.\" You tell her, and her eyes light up a little. \"Oh, thanks, Peppermint!\" She's interrupted by her stomach again, which lets out a loud and painful-sounding gurgle. She emits a pained groan along with it, which tells you you should probably hurry along and help her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on. If you grab that stool over there...\" She gestures to a short plastic stool by the sink, \"I'll sit like this. You go behind me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for a moment where the stomach pain is at its least egregious, she turns herself around on the toilet seat so that she's sitting on it backwards; resting her arms and head against the tank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drag the small plastic stool across and take a seat, resting behind Twilight and now able to reach down and massage her belly, which you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flinches at first; the sensation of another pony's hooves against her paunch is clearly a little alien to her, but she soon comes more comfortable with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel it's especially bloated; as you rub you elicit little gasps and moans from Twilight, and loud, wet, spraying sharts in the toilet. Now, of course, as her butt is facing you, you also unfortunately get a little renewed wave of the awful stench every time she deposits into the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. It smells disgusting.\" Her voice is wavering and weak as she focuses on voiding her bowels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub using both hooves in a circular motion, feeling her entire body tense up as the pain shoots through her lower abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>J-Just there</i>.\" She whispers, and you focus your kneading on that one specific area. Almost immediately the muscles in her stomach go taut and you hear a violent spurt of runny feces splatter and dribble into the toilet water down below. Whatever it was she ate, it really did a number on her digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell doesn't get any better, as with her farts, and it's overwhelmingly nauseating, but you realize now you don't even care. The princess' wellbeing is truly what comes before anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring yourself up behind her, practically hugging around her, resting your torso against her back, and still rubbing her slowly deflating belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that feels... <i>mmh</i>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again you feel her muscles in her abdomen tense and suck in uncontrollably, her spine curling over forward and a soft whimper escaping her lips as a long, burbling sound of wet flatulence ripples into the toilet. It's almost like the sound of a battered old car rasping into ignition, accompanied by a muddy, watery tone and the sound of molten shit trickling into water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as this stream ends, another comes out. You probe and push and squeeze Twilight's stomach even as it's tensed up, and this seems to make even more shoot out of her like a leaking facet, splattering the inside of the bowl with a chunky brown membrane and turning the toilet water a darker and darker shade of  russet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Y-Yes!</i>\" She gasps, almost orgasmic, and a violent, squirty surge dollops into the water with a watery trickle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last soggy fart, it seems like the curry has completely evacuated her system, and she melts forward into pure relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly is now flat, as it should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think that's all of it.\" She sighs breathlessly, forcing out one last small fart just to be sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't thank you enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, there was something you liked about giving the princess a massage, even if it meant putting up with the smell. It was warm and close and intimate in a way you felt few other ponies ever had been with her. It felt good to help her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you really have outdone yourself. You've earned a lie-in tomorrow.\" She looks back at you and smiles. \"You can go now. I'll... take care of the rest and then get some sleep myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think you've done more than enough to help me, Peppermint. I really appreciate it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could always... clean up... for you.\" You responded, slightly restrained. It was weird to even find yourself suggesting to do such a thing but it felt... right, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alicorn blushed immediately. \"Oh, Gosh. I don't know. I couldn't ask you to do that, too...\" She smiled sheepishly, holding her hoof to her face with a timid, embarrassed laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. I want to help you in every way I can.\" You offered, feeling more and more passionate about what was, really, a job nopony would ever willingly want to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight paused, thinking things over. \"Well... I suppose if you're offering. I mean, I don't want to make you do anything you don't need to as part of your job.\" Her face flushed a darker shade of red and she climbed off from the toilet. To your surprise, she turned and moved her tail aside, presenting her dirtied plothole to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, fuck. She had clearly misunderstood what you meant by <i>clean up</i>. You heart rate increased as you realized what it was you had agreed to; cleaning the princess' unclean plot with your <i>tongue</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed your pride and advanced towards Twilight, trying to mentally prepare. Still, for some reason you couldn't understand, you <i>wanted</i> to help her. Even with this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rested her front hooves on the rim of the toilet, turning her nose up at the waste still collected in the bowl, and flushing, finding she had to flush another time to get rid of it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now inches away from her asshole; glistening in the vestigial light-brown shit that caked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sucked down one last breath and then took the plunge: extending your tongue, closing your eyes, and pushing your head forward, feeling a sharp, bitter taste against it immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppressed the need to gag and continued to lick, almost trying to imagine it was nothing more than ice cream, though the smell and taste made this impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had a distinctive earthy flavour; bitter like orange zest, dirty, and not at all pleasant, but you sucked it down, feeling the intense taste staining the back of your throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tongue probed in deeper, further into the tight, pursed ring of muscle, feeling it weaken against the force of your tongue as you felt yourself inside her, the walls of her anus tensing and clamping around your tongue, but you continued to lick, passionately, eliciting a quick moan from Twilight, who had probably never experienced something like this before. At least you were both in the same boat in that respect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lapping grew more fervent as you suckled the mare's plothole, cleaning it as thoroughly as was possible, feeling the tart, nauseating taste of feces weaken more and more. It was surprising that you had managed to get this far without turning your head and throwing up. Even if you wanted to, the knowledge that you were serving Twilight seemed to quell the intense sickness. You felt as if you could continue servicing her all night; your muzzle planted firmly between her wonderfully curvaceous cheeks and in-taking every fart and every expulsion her body had to get rid of. Your fervid love for Twilight was growing more and more. Either that, or you had finally cracked. It wouldn't be out of the question, with the sheer amount of pony farts you had been made to inhale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her plothole was cleaned, and you pulled yourself away. She sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-\" But her words failed her. You noticed her pussy was a little more moist than it had been when you started; clearly, the sensation had aroused her quite a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Peppermint. You really are... a wonderful assistant.\" She said softly and breathlessly, standing back up straight and smiling at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's what I'm here for.\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps... if you'd like... you could attend me with all of my toiletry needs from now on. If you think that wouldn't be too much work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not at all. I'd love to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offered you one last warm smile and then headed past you to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience had been both satisfying and sickening, but it seemed like you'd have to start getting a whole lot more used to the smell - and taste - of the princess' solid waste. Your job had just become a whole lot more interesting, and disgusting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a smell you weren't going to forget anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up the next morning, you allow yourself to get another hour or two of sleep. Your whole body aches. You'd had a pretty busy first day to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally do pull yourself out of bed, at almost mid-day, you head out into the corridor and find a couple of guards standing outside the entrance to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we're just trying to fix the toilet. Waiting for the plumber to arrive. I'm afraid it's out of order for the time being.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't respond, but you have a pretty good idea <i>what </i>caused it to be out of order in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find out that Twilight is off having yet another meeting. She's certainly a busy pony, but that doesn't surprise you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day passes by surprisingly quickly just exploring the parts of the castle you haven't already seen, and before too long, the evening comes around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that Starlight and Spike are also away from the castle, so you end up eating by yourself as you wait for Twilight to return home, no doubt for another \"study\" session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, the doors to the castle burst open, and you almost feel deja vu as Twilight runs in in almost exactly the same way she had the night before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses for a moment in the doorway, but realises she doesn't have time to even tell you anything, and dashes off upstairs, shivering and quaking in desperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Twilight! The bathroom is-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to gallop after her, trying to catch up with her, but by the time you've reached her she's already found out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of order!? What??\" She's dancing around on the spot, hind legs crossed as sweat collects on her brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight!

It's pretty clear you don't have a lot of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do!?!\" She asks again, her voice shaking as she keeps a tight clutch on her sphincter, grunting and moaning as her stomach lets out anguished squirts and rumbles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere don't exactly seem to be a lot of options available. </span></div></div>",

I don't mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to show her you don't you lie onto your back - still in the middle of the corridor - and open your mouth as wide as it will go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you for a second, then back at the bathroom door.<br>\r\nThe wet gurgle from her belly makes her decision for her, and with a trample of hooftsteps you watch her rump descend upon your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of her fat purple assmeat blots out any slither of light, but you don't have long to think about that.<br>\r\nWith a loud, anguished groan Twilight's barely-holding pucker unclenches and all hell breaks loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing to empty into your mouth is a hot, depressurizing fart that blows your cheeks to their fullest limits and flows down your throat for a few seconds. It is heavy with the spicy taste of whatever abomination Twilight ate to upset her guts this much in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another grunt, the real deal releases; a hot, chunky slop that piles into your mouth and fills it within seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body reflexively takes over and all you can do is gulp.<br>\r\nIt sears your throat as you swallow it down and settles in your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing her hooves against your stomach, Twilight blows out a series of wet, pungent farts that are muffled by your mouth. With a wail the alicorn blows more impossibly thick chunks of half-digested food into her little makeshift toilet bowl. It empties out of her, round after round, trickling down your throat in a near-constant stream.<br>\r\nThis must be how those castle toilets feel when she finds herself destroying them with violent midnight squirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of trying not to choke on Twilight's runs, it seems the worst wave of it has passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you one last little gulp of diarrhea before dismounting your face. Her shithole has accrued a dripping light-brown layer of excrement. <br>\r\nShe sighs, heaving and steeped in relief.<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>goodness</i>... are you okay, Peppermint?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peers over her shoulder to see you lick a little errant dripping of scat from your lips.<br>\r\nYou nod - your throat is still a little gunked up - and she turns to give you a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses as her face approaches yours, and her nostrils flare.<br>\r\n\"G-Gah! Oh, you smell awful! Oh, I'm so sorry! I just panicked, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise a hoof to her mouth to silence her.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. That was nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles, though she can't imagine how you could possibly derive enjoyment from such a degrading and repulsive task.<br>\r\nJust as you're about to get back to your feet, Twilight turns to ask you...</span></div></div>",

Don't worry about it. This isn't the first time I've had someone turn down the position, and I'm sure it won't be the last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do feel bad.

Sorry for wasting your time.

You knew for certain this wasn't Princess Twilight, judging from her appearance and what you had been told this must be Starlight Glimmer, Twilight's other assistant! For a brief moment you were worried, having remembered stories about her old, quite nasty self, but she had been reformed now! Surely that was all behind her, she was supposed to be kind now. You put on your best smile and apologize, trying to explain the situation as easily as you can. \"Oh sorry about that! I'm Peppermint Swirl, I tried the door but there was no answer so I-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could explain further, Starlight had overcome the surprise of bumping into a random pony in the castle and cut you off. \"You think you can just let yourself into the castle like that?\" She asked, eyeing you suspiciously. You were about to speak up, but she suddenly realized the room you had exited from. \"Wait a second... You just came out of our archive room, that is a very restricted area of the castle! You're what tripped the alarm spell!\" She narrowed her eyes at you, her demeanor shifting to a very threatening one. \"What were you doing in there? There are ancient, priceless scrolls and spells in there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- umm but.. I just-\" You stammered, unable to speak properly as she pressed towards you, backing you up against a wall. You always really sucked when put under pressure like this, you tried to find the best way to explain despite it all. \"I just let myself in... to see Princess Twilight, I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! To see Twilight! Right....\" She rolled her eyes. \"If you wanted to see her, you would have waited for an answer at the front door like any good, law abiding pony would. You broke into a highly restricted area, filled with priceless spells! Are you one of those criminals who steals ancient texts and spells and sells them off? Or perhaps you wanted them for yourself?\" She glared as you gulped, this was turning out so very, very badly... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I just need to see Princess Twilight I-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! I am putting you under arrest!\" Starlight snapped as she cast a spell, binding your legs with a magical rope that left you completely immobile. \"Twilight's gone for a bit, but I can handle you while she is gone. You *will* tell me everything... Twilight mentioned a black market for rare spells, is that who you're working for?!\" She asked, though not even giving you a chance to respond as she enveloped you with her magic and brought you down a flight of stairs, to the dungeon of the castle. You were getting more worried by the second, and every attempt to speak was a stammering mess of words. If you could just get Twilight, she could explain everything! Starlight seemed very dedicated to her job, and you were quite frightened at what she would do to what she thought was a spell thief that broke into the castle. You were brought into a room and put behind a table while Starlight looked at you from the other side. \"Now, tell me. Why did you break into the archive room?\" She glared at you with a stern look, her blue eyes completely fixed on you. Just as you were about to speak up...</span></div></div>",

At first you thought it had to be the table scraping against the ground or something, she couldn't have possible <i>farted</i>! But the putrid smell hitting your nose seconds after confirmed it, she had most definitely ripped a huge fart. The relieved expression on her face also gave it away... \"Oh, oh my... excuse me.\" Starlight blushed a bit as you were gagging and trying to turn your head away from the awful smell, quite clearly disgusted from her gas. \"My lunch doesn't seem to be agreeing with my very well... perhaps those layered bean burritos were a little much.\" She said nonchalantly as you were choking on her fart, which had very quickly filled the small room you were in. If your hooves weren't tied up tightly, you would have been holding your nose and fanning the air to avoid the terrible smell. Hell, you would have ran as far away as possible from this stinky mare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that stinks so badly! I can hardly breathe, it's so thick!\" You gag and sputter, the stench of her cheesy burrito gas burning your nostrils. \"I didn't break in! Twilight's... assistant...\" You manage to get in between your breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight's expression turned back to an annoyed one, as she seemed to just ignore her massive fart (something you desperately wished you could do) \"Yes, I AM  Twilight's assistant...\" She asserted, you guessed she must not have gotten the memo about you, or simply didn't remember... \"And yes you did break in! Twilight set up an alarm spell that would get tripped if somepony came in, you set it off. Tell me... what were you trying to steal?\" She slammed a hoof on the table, already getting quite impatient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as finally her gas seemed to be dissipating, letting you slowly recompose yourself. \"I just need to see the Princess... I'm no thief!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be the judge of that, and so far you have been proving quite guil- ugh, excuse me again.\" Starlight groaned as she let out a silent fart that was even worse than her previous blast. Almost immediately the stench hit you and you were bucking and struggling as much as possible, you couldn't handle the smell any longer. \"Let me out of this room! Your disgusting farts are going to kill me!\" You plead as your sense of smell was overwhelmed by the stench of her rancid gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill you? Come now... they're bad but not THAT bad.\" Starlight coughed a bit as her silent fart wafted up to her, that was a <i>really</i> stinky one... But it was just gas. She was certain mere flatulence couldn't kill a pony, no matter how bad it was. \"Now stop whining and tell me what you were doing!\" She demanded, getting annoyed at your continued resistance as you just couldn't respond, you were far too busy choking on the toxic air that the room was now full of. Seeing your completely disgusted expression and your hatred of her farts was giving her an idea though, albeit it was a nasty one. Perhaps she would require more extreme methods to get you to talk...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A devious smirk crossed Starlight Glimmer's face as she decided what to do. Sure it was an incredibly disgusting thing to do, especially for a well mannered mare such as herself, but she was determined to get you to talk, even if that meant utilizing less... professional methods. Starlight had read a book or two on interrogation, and so far you had been proving rather stubborn to the talking approach, so she decided to step it up. One of the tips that came to her mind was to take note of things the suspect hated and use it against them. In this case, it was clear to her you absolutely loathed her farts and wanted to be as far away from them as possible. She blushed a little at the idea but nonetheless continued, a little embarrassment on her part was worth busting a criminal like you. \"I see you are still refusing to cooperate. Very well, I know just what to do. This should effectively deal with two problems at once!\" Starlight said as she got up, making you more than a little scared at the thought what she could be doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fear quickly turned to confusion as you saw the mare get up on the table, the legs squeaking a bit under her weight. What in the world could she be doing up there? Almost immediately that question was answered and your heart sunk as Starlight spun around, her rather large behind now facing you. No... she couldn't... she wouldn't! \"P-please no! Don't tell me you're going to-\" You yell and plead as you watched her lean her head forward, pushing her butt out further and as close to your face as possible. Once her ass was mere inches from your face she cut off your begging with another putrid fart, the warmth of this one was much more apparent due to the proximity. The heat wasn't the only thing that was stronger, the smell was even worse than before, something you hadn't thought possible! The disgusting fart spluttered on for a few seconds, making you feel rather nauseous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh, now that's MUCH better. My tummy has been acting up a bit, so I hope you don't mind if I just stay right here and let all my gas out.\" Starlight snickered as she watched you gag and heave on her latest fart, you look much more sickened now that you were closer to her ass. \"I should warn you, it's going to get VERY stinky back there. So, why don't you make this easier on yourself and tell me what you were trying to steal? Cooperate with me, and I will keep you far away from my ass. Refuse to and well...\" She let out a small, unfeminine grunt as her cheeks parted and another warm, smelly fart blew directly onto your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile there wasn't a mirror in here, you were fairly certain your face was turning a little green. The stench of her farts was sickening (it also didn't help you were forced to stare at her pink, sweat covered asscheeks and crack. Not the prettiest sight in the world) and you knew you couldn't take much more of this before passing out. \"Sweet Celestia, the SMELL! Please! I'm not a thief!\" You yell out as you choked on her gas, the after effects of all those beans she had eaten filling your nose. \"I'll do anything, no more farts!\" You beg, tears running down your cheeks from the gas irritating your eyes. This response didn't seem to please Starlight in the least as she just glared back at you and forced out another paint peeling fart, this one even blowing back your mane a little. It seemed like you would be smelling her poots for a long while unless you confessed to a crime you didn't commit... even then, who know's what Starlight would do to you once you actually confessed...</span></div></div>",

There was, of course, the option of finding where that lemonade was coming from, you were certainly getting more and more thirsty, but before you could decide on that your gaze fell on a bright pink candy-covered facade which almost appeared to me made from gingerbread, cake and candycanes. Ponies were coming out with cupcakes, candy, and various other sweet treats. The prospect of that <i>did</i> seem appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the market itself, the beginnings of which you could see winding around down a road to your left. There would certainly be some interesting things on sale, and perhaps even something to beat the heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrowsing a little more, you spotted what appeared to be a day spa a little farther away.

Don't leave a drop!\" She slams her hoof against the stall, getting the brief attention of a few passing ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reluctantly finish it off, placing the empty glass back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" She smiles, \"In a few seconds, you'll have a pretty good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can ask her a further question, you begin to feel strange. Your senses start to numb, and your eyes grow unnaturally heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What....\" You try to say, but before another word can even leave your mouth, you fall asleep. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You find yourself awake, your head throbbing and your heart immediately palpitating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your eyes, find that you're no longer outside, and it's not even daytime anymore. You're inside, In somepony's house, and on top of that, your left hoof seems to be tightly fastened to the radiator behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thousand questions swarm around in your mind as you sit, helpless, trying to see if there's any way to free yourself from the hoof cuff, but it's on way too tight to get it off. Even if you managed to, you'd probably tear your skin off with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to piece together as much as possible from before you fell asleep... you remembered the lemonade stand; the light-mulberry mare who forced you to drink the lemonade spiked with... something. Whatever it was, it had put you out for what had to be some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the door clicked and swung open. As you expected, the same mare was on the other side, off-kilter and dishevelled; a wide, silly grin was planted over her face as she waltzed inside and slammed the door. Even without the strong alcoholic smell she was giving off, it was clear she was very drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, heyyyy.\" She slurred, wobbling over towards you. \"Look whooooss awake.\" Her words came out slow and messy, dribbling through her lips with an apparent lack of control. What the fuck was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look. I'll pay you everything I have. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she reaches a hoof out and presses it against your muzzle, silencing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhhhh...... ishhht oookayyy. y-Yooouuu didd a<i> baddd </i>thing and yoouu need to be <i>pummisheed</i>....\" She paused, realizing she'd said that word incorrectly, but seemingly too drunk to bother and correct it. Instead, she giggled and burped into her hoof, groaning and rubbing her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But noowww thee shhhpider has a fllyyy.\" She teased ominously, tumbling back onto the floor and then pulling herself back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and then burped again, this time letting it rattle in her throat for about three times as long, covering her muzzle with her hoof and then blowing out through pursed lips. \"Ughh.. That tassteee bad.\" Her face collapsed into a disgusted grimace and she fanned her hooves wildly in front of her face to dispel the odor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wiiinne always giveshh me gas.\" She giggled, forcing out another burp; this one sounding strained and horribly wet. You just hoped she didn't throw up on you and would pass out soon, but even then... you still wouldn't be able to free yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thingg I got my little flly here..\" She alluded to you, reaching a hoof down to stroke the underside of your chin. With this, she quickly leaned in even closer, her muzzle level with yours, and brought up another deep-set belch right into your face, letting it roar out through her lips and right up your nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gagged silently as the disgusting stench of whatever she last ate filled your senses. It was as if you'd stuck your nose right down her gullet and taken a whiff of the contents of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" She exclaimed, though before she could say another word, another round of gas exploded from her - only this time, it was from the other end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wet, ripping sound of unbridled flatulence. \"Scccuuuseee me..\" She started laughing again, standing up straight and, as you had feared, turned to bring her plot right to your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nose wrinkled up instinctively as she swayed her heavy, unwashed rump in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smell thisss one!\" She called out, and brought her weight back onto your face, blasting you with a rippling congested gusty fart that painted your face in a  sultry, humid smog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was even more overwhelming than her burp had been; a sour, sharp eggy smell. Every breath just brought more and more of the stench into your lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, that was wett!\" She commented, proudly, and started to smear her sweaty, dirty plot against your face, leaving a sticky, smelly gloss of sweat over it like a snail's trail. This was about as hellish as you could imagine a situation being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was clearly too drunk to even really know what she was doing, but somehow you sensed that she'd be administering a similar punishment even if she were sober. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whasss wrong? Too smelly?\" She asked you rhetorically, and then started to make loud, forceful grunting sounds, her abdomen tensing up rock hard with her asshole still pressed against the tip of your muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed out another fart, with as much force as she possibly could, making it outpour with a loud, vigorous ripping noise that pummelled against your face, forcing vibrations through your nose and mouth. She seemed to push even harder still, grunting with more desperation, and increasing the pressure of her putrid release, forcing the sound to raise up into a squeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good five seconds she cut it off, collapsing onto the floor in a breathless heap. \"Wwwooww.. that wass loud!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't really focus on what she was saying, though. The smell was far too potent and offensive to even hear her. It took all you had to not throw up, your stomach reeling uneasily. The only air around you to breathe was tainted by the revolting presence of her gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stayed laying down on the floor on her belly, seemingly deciding she was too drunk to bother getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plot was no longer on your face, but it didn't stop her from forcing out wet, gurgly farts, dribbling out from the slovenly, intoxicated mare in a similar manner to her speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thheesse feel soo good..\" She sighed, almost orgasmically. If she didn't stop soon, you could tell she would end up pushing out more than just gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Why don't we go get some coffee?\" You asked, knowing it would probably yield no results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naahhhh\" She said, her mouth half-closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Come on. I... I hear coffee gives you really... bad farts.\" This wasn't true, of course - at least not in your case - but at this stage any possibility of getting her to stop farting and maybe let you out of your cuff was worth trying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a second, looking round to you, and then...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

They seemed completely glued to a podium raised slightly above ground level, on which a pristine white unicorn was showing off a series of dresses, some fitted onto mannequins and one being worn by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed over, trying to bob and weave through the crowd to get a better look at what was drawing so much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me right! I'm looking for a new assistant, and one of you lucky ponies has the chance to fill that ever-coveted role! Oh yes, I'm serious; a position alongside THE Rarity! You'll get all the insider knowledge about how I make my dresses: my process! I'll be selecting a name randomly from this wonderful new sun hat I designed just last week, and yes - before you ask, they <i>are</i> available for purchase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wouldn't want to neglect your duties with Twilight, but you decided it could be fun to throw your name in anyway. You weren't even sure who this mare was - it seemed like her clothing was pretty famous around here - and it could be interesting to find out a little more about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed and shoved your way over to a tall, elegantly silent mare with a carefully-trimmed mane, who handed you a piece of paper and a pen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly scribbled down your name and handed it back to her, watching as she tossed it into the hat and then handed it up to Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn peered down into the hat, using magic to shuffle around the pieces of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who will be my lucky new assistant? Let's find out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and drew a single piece of paper from the hat, holding it up in front of her face, unfolding it, opening her eyes, and announcing that the winner was... </span></div></div>",

I'll just wrap things up out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as she says, heading towards the entrance to the boutique itself, turning back to see Rarity dispel the crowd.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show's over, folks. Unless, of course, you'd like to buy something in my new summer line? Starting at only 670 bits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey don't seem too interested, though, all splitting up and still visibly upset they weren't in your place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and don't forget I'm hosting an auction later this evening at Canterlot!

I'm Rarity, but I'm <i>sure</i> you already know that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, you probably wouldn't know that if she hadn't told you, but you shake her hoof anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe I've seen you around Ponyville before - are you new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I just arrived today. I'm here to work with the Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Twilight? Yes, she <i>did</i> mention something about a new assistant... hm. I'm sure we can work some arrangement out so that you can still help me around here. She's a good friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered if maybe you'd gotten yourself in a bit too deep; not only did you have absolutely zero expertise with dress-making or fashion, it could be a bit tricky being assistant to <i>two</i> ponies. Still, you were here now, so you had to make do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway! I have the auction later, so there's much to do! Not a second to waste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started heading upstairs but you called out to stop her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... exactly is my job going to entail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at you for a second. \"Well, assisting me, of course. I have a lot to do to get ready and I need some help. Would you be a dear and grab a glass from the kitchen?\" She pointed to a room off to your right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I'm not exactly very experienced in dress-making.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"Oh, heavens, no, you won't be making any dresses. No, no, you'll just be my personal assistant. Don't worry. It's about time for my lunch, so this is as good a time as any to give you a little test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued up the stairs, pausing for just a moment, a quick flash of discomfort surfacing on her face.<br>\r\n\"Actually... maybe grab a plate while you're at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this she trotted upstairs, leaving you to get the plate and glass. You wondered why exactly she was going to eat upstairs, but didn't think too much of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up a knife and fork as well just to be prepared, you headed upstairs, but immediately you were a little confused. There was no sign of Rarity anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Upstairs of the building was an open-plan bedroom, only one door on the far side of the room which you could only assume led to the bathroom. There isn't even any table to speak of up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to try and look downstairs again,  you heard a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peppermint? Is that you? I'm here. Do be quick, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scanned around for the sound, suddenly freezing in shock as you realised the voice was coming from behind the bathroom door. </span></div></div>",

You might jeopardize your chances with the Princess if you can\u2019t even attend to Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push open the unlocked door to see the mare in even greater discomfort than before, hoof over her belly as she sits, legs splayed, on the toilet bowl. <br>\r\nThere\u2019s already a humid, foul odor in the room, and it\u2019s not hard to take a guess at where it\u2019s coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh.

Silly me, I didn\u2019t even explain! I suppose by this point it\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary to me, but for someone new...\u201d she pauses, clearly wanting to hurry things along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one way a pony keeps herself in such good condition. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already noticed my perfect skin, my flawless mane... they don\u2019t just get this way on their own. People try eating and drinking all sorts of things for their health, but I\u2019ve stumbled on the one true method for maintaining absolute physical perfection!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn\u2019t exactly need to explain what that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou... drink your own pee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t put it quite so crassly, but in summation, yes. The natural goodness in one\u2019s own urine is unmatched! ... and even more so for the... ehm... <i>solid</i> waste.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you weren\u2019t crazy; this mare is really asking you to help her eat and drink her own shit and piss. You almost want to be sick, stifling a gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut anyway... perhaps we could move things along? It\u2019s getting increasingly hard to hold all this in, you know?\u201d She blasts out a quick whimpering squeaky fart into the toilet, which seems to only heighten her panic and she jumps up from the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf... if you\u2019d get the glass ready first.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scramble to put down the plate and hold the glass in your hoof, still more than a bit weirded out and not sure exactly how this is going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity raises her tail and spreads her legs slightly, revealing her puffy grey pussy lips and twitching tailhole. You almost feel like blushing, but there are more important matters to attend to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t be shy! Get it in position! I just had these floors tiled and if you spill even a drop you\u2019ll have to clean it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold the glass underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, good heavens. No! It\u2019s hardly going to go in the glass like that, is it? You haven\u2019t had a lot of experience with a mare, have you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d had plenty, but funnily enough none of them had exactly asked you to help them piss into a cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust a lady do everything for herself?\u201d <br>\r\nShe reaches down and spreads her pussy lips for you, revealing the slightly dampened pink inner lips and both her vagina and her urethra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs wrong as it feels, you position the cup so it\u2019s just beneath her urethral opening, and she seems to take this as a cue to finally let her hold go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a soda fountain the dark golden liquid squirts out in a powerful stream, splashing into the clear glass and filling it rapidly; you can feel your hoof warmed from the urine inside the cup as it gets more and more full, foaming and rippling as the jet of piss sends bubbles rushing up to the surface. To make matters worse, the release of her bladder seems to signal her body to slightly release her bowels too, and an airy, foul-smelling fart puffs right into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before it reaches the brim, she gasps and stops it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my. There\u2019s more than I expected. Quick! Get another glass! Hurry!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs squirm together as she holds back as hard as she can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place the full glass down as gently as is possible, dashing out of the bathroom and back downstairs, grabbing two more glasses just to be sure and galloping back up to Rarity again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get the second glass into position almost as soon as you re-enter the room, and the heavy rush of urine continues. She lets out a sharp gasp as it surges rapidly into the glass, though this time it gradually lessens in intensity, and reduces to a small dribble before it can fill another cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last little splash forces its way out, along with another less-than-welcome fart, and it seems she is done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew! <i>Goodness!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place this half-filled cup down next to the other one, watching as the surface fizzes slightly and then settles down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re already close to throwing up at the sharp, disgusting smell alone, but the worst is yet to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, I\u2019m rather dehydrated, aren\u2019t I?\u201d She comments to herself as she studies the two glasses. The expression on her face seems to contrast entirely to your own; she almost looks like she\u2019s about to lick her lips in anticipation of drinking the copious amount of fluid she\u2019s produced, but there\u2019s no time to rest yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to you, she says...</span></div></div>",

You hold your hoof over your muzzle to save yourself from having to smell another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, her anus winks and distends, and finally you see the dark brown head peek out, pushed out slowly with a wet mucusy crackling sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering your muzzle doesn't seem to really do any good, as the intoxicating smell of feces hits you like a brick wall, causing your eyes to water a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bends forwards to push it out harder, squeezing the soft log of brown fudge down onto the plate like a cake piper, coiling around itself before being cut off and falling into a messy curl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's not done though, and presses out another log, glistening and textured, that joins the previous one on the plate, bundled on top in a little loose pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder how much more she could have, but there's still more to come, coiling out wetly in the same way and once more landing onto the little stack of shit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seems to be all of it though, as Rarity lets an exhausted sigh pour out from her mouth, collapsing a little before sitting back up on the toilet to wipe. At least you don't have to help with <i>that</i> aspect of the procedure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad agglomeration, if I say so myself.\" Her voice was a little strained and tired, but she seemed just as fervently obsessed with the byproducts she had left as she did before, practically drooling at the sight of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but stare at the pile yourself, using every ounce of will you had to suppress the urge to retch. The smell was ungodly, and the lack of windows in the bathroom only made it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad job, Peppermint.\" She commented. You weren't sure how it was a job you could even mess up, but it was no use arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still...\" She began. What more could she want? \"It looks as if it's missing a little something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" You ask apprehensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure it's delicious, but it's a little plain. Now I've got you here, perhaps you could add a little something extra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Extra...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls her eyes. \"Do I really have to spell it out for you? Can't you add a topping of your own? A nice <i>cream topping</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your heart drop. She can't surely be suggesting what you think she's suggesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Oh, it does take you a while to grasp things, doesn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?! How could you possibly!? Even if you wanted to, the smell and the sight before you were so un-arousing it could almost make you impotent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? You're not going to keep a lady waiting, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Oh, don't tell me you're shy! I've seen it all, dear, don't mind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... not sure I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? It <i>works</i>, doesn't it?\" She peers down between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I'm not exactly... <i>in the mood</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So it's incentive you want, is it? I'm sure I can help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans back on the toilet bowl, spreading her legs and bringing her hoof up to her marehood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you really do blush. This mare really doesn't hold back, does she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even a second of hesitation, she begins to rub it, massaging the lips and moistening her hoof. \"<i>Mmh</i>. How's that?\" Her voice wavers as she continues to fiddle with her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, despite all odds, you can't help but become aroused by the sight. Rarity is a very attractive mare, even if the things you just saw her do were anything but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon your own member has risen, hard, and even though it feels wrong, you bring your hoof to it and start to stroke it up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. That's it. Very good, P-Peppermint.\" She's struggling to keep composure, that sentence collapsing into a passionate moan as her rubbing becomes more intense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her mound as it's rubbed and probed, watching it salivate and drip down into the toilet water below, hearing her soft and gentle gasps and moans. You're almost able to tune out the horrific smell around you, more and more turned on. <br>\r\nShe accidentally lets a fart slip out into the bowl, now unable to control herself and overtaken by pure urges, instinctively gyrating her hips against the toilet seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're ..  v-very lucky to be seeing this, P-P-Peppermint. M-Most ponies could only dream of..\" But again her sentence falls short, taken over by pure sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bites her lip, allowing her hoof to venture slightly deeper between her lips, soaked in her own juices, and it's enough to bring you to orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself tense up more intensely than usual, and taking a second to aim your cock at the shit she's laid out on the plate, let out an uncontrollable moan of your own and watch thick, white cum squirt out over the \"meal\", settling down over the top of it in a stringy pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels weird. Even though you're experiencing orgasmic pleasure, you're smelling the scent of her waste, while looking straight at it. It's a cognitive dissonance you're not sure you like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up as Rarity emits an even louder moan than yours, lifting her hoof up and letting her cum drizzle between her lips and drip down onto the plate, on top of your own ejaculate. You'd never seen a mare come to orgasm so soon, but then Rarity was clearly not the average mare in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was breathless, hair ruffled and chest rising and falling rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my... I certainly didn't expect to do that so early today.\" She smiles at you, lying back onto the toilet in bliss and peering down at her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what a lovely coating you've given my lunch, Peppermint. I'm afraid I couldn't help but add a little of my own.\" She giggled softly and used a few strips of toilet paper to wipe her pussy clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat back, too. Somehow, the smell didn't seem to be as bad. You just hoped you hadn't somehow made yourself <i>like</i> this stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm starving.\" She got down from the toilet and sat just across the floor from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went first for the urine, picking up the filled glass and without delay poured it back, letting it run down her throat as she drank at least two thirds, placing it back down and sighing contentedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Refreshing. A little strong, perhaps, but very flavorful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got even harder to not gag out loud, and harder still when she used her magic to pick up the knife and fork you had brought and cut a small segment of her own shit off, levitating the fork to her mouth and placing it inside gently, chewing and looking somehow even more blissful doing it than she had masturbating. She swallowed, seemingly with no difficulty whatsoever, and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sublime! Your addition adds so much flavor! It complements it perfectly!\" You could see it had stained her teeth. You couldn't even imagine what the taste of this abomination was if it was even half as bad as the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to eat it piece by piece, each one seemingly more delicious than the last, taking sips of her piss alongside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she was on the last piece of solid matter, having effectively cleaned the plate entirely. You had no idea how somepony could ever devour so much of their own waste, and how they could enjoy it so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was now a ring of brown around her lips, which she wiped away with a sheet of toilet paper, letting out a small, feminine burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I <i>am</i> sorry!\" You wondered why she bothered apologizing after what she'd already done in your presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was wonderful! I'd usually ask you to give it a test first before trying it myself, but it is your first day, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck. No. it was bad enough having to smell it, but having to eat it would definitely make you hurl. You shiver at just the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of.. now that the test is over, so to speak, and I'm more than happy with your performance, would you definitely like to stay on as my assistant? I suppose you can decline, if you'd like, but it would be lovely having someone around to help me out. You'd be my nutritional assistant and chef. It's a lot of responsibility, but I have a feeling you're more than capable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, now's your chance to get out of this insane mare's clutches, but for some reason you take a second to hesitate. You can't honestly say why, but after the experience you feel a weird attraction to the mare that wasn't quite there before. Still, she is basically opening the door and letting you walk free... </span></div></div>",

It's so hard to find the staff these days.\"<br>\r\nShe dismounts the toilet seat and gives it a flush - not that she actually deposited anything in there <i>to</i> flush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn leads you down into the kitchen - small, but very smartly-fitted with high end equipment and appliances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I suppose you can start with something simple. After all, I <i>did</i> just have lunch, and I'm not tremendously hungry.\" That pert, polite little smile beams your way again. One that utterly betrays this mare's intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd usually prepare some fresh ingredients for you to use, but I suppose we'll have to resort to leftovers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls on the door of the small refrigerator and swings it open, revealing that the inside is filled with surprisingly normal ingredients; cheese, milk, vegetables, a few tins and bottles of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, your attention is immediately keyed onto the topmost shelf, and the translucent tupperware boxes that are lined with condensation and filled with something brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see...\" She retrieves a container and you notice there's a sticker on the top with a date written in ink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is only from the weekend, so not too out of date!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls off the lid and releases a flooring stench into the room. Her regular shit was already foul, but shit that has fermented for almost a week is a hundred times worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, bundled together, are three thick, firm logs of excrement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think a salad would suffice. Of course there are many dishes you could prepare: I'm particularly fond of curries and stews, but you'll have more than enough time to make those!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch, still awe-struck, as Rarity complacently gathers the ingredients and lays them out for you on the kitchen surface.<br>\r\nThere's a head of lettuce, two ripe tomatoes, a small onion, a little bottle of salad dressing, and, of course, the main source of protein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder, but remember you had the chance to turn this down.<br>\r\nYou've made your shit-scented bed and now you must lie in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, off you go! Just... don't make it too big, Peppermint, darling; I had rather a large lunch as I'm sure you're aware.\"<br>\r\nShe giggles, as girlish and becoming as she would addressing the highest of society in Canterlot, and steps back to let you get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it's an easy meal to prepare, the part you're dreading is having to actually handle her waste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any, uh, gloves or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, darling, you don't need gloves! Why, I thought boys were supposed to be mettlesome when it came to all things dirty and disgusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like there's no way out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start with the vegetables, taking one of the sharp kitchen knives and chopping them to the best of your ability. Even if you're not much of a cook, you're able to get by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay them onto the plate - rather too decoratively for what's about to be laid on top of them - and then, taking one bracing breath, turn your attention to the final ingredient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grip one of the logs in your fingers. It's immediately slimy and cold. <br>\r\nYou stifle a gag and quickly drop it down onto the chopping board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think one will do. I'm not sure I have the room for much more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least this can be over with sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring the knife above the turd and lean into a slice, working your way along its length until it's separated into five smaller chunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot particularly keen to touch it again, you bring the chopping board over the salad bowl and scrape them onto the bed of lettuce and onion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt almost looks edible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Not bad, though I feel it could use a little something more. The dressing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to pour some on but she stops you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, No, Peppermint. I mean the dressing needs something more. In fact - I may just be able to provide something fresh for this meal, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes the small bottle of salad dressing from the counter and places it on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you lend a hoof? I wouldn't want this to spill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you think your work is done...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reluctantly take the bottle and bring it up to her marehood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to show a little initiative, you pry open that labia and gently press the neck of the bottle into the little visible urethral opening that sits on one end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few slack sighs and grunts the mare manages to release her bladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just hope she doesn't end up overflowing again, though it seems she already relinquished herself of most of her watery waste earlier and produces just about enough to fill up to the neck of the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt combines with the rest of the salad dressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing your thumb over the lid, you give it a shake and then take it back to place onto the salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA disgusting menagerie of shit and piss. You will never, ever understand how Rarity can take this down like it's nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! D\u00e9licieuse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carries the salad over to the table that occupies the other side of the room and begins to eat with a fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch her tongue caress those little nuggets of her own shit, slicking them with a film of saliva before she brings them into her awaiting mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chews, letting that flavor really settle on her tongue before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a couple of minutes, Rarity has finished the entire thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one airy belch into her hoof she rises and approaches you again, lips pressing a firm kiss into your cheek. You don't know whether to blush or retch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Peppermint. That was delicious. Really - you have a talent clearly. I'm looking forward to seeing how you tackle slightly more complex dishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a spark of sincerity in her eye. This really means this much to her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway! There's so much to do before the auciton later - and so little time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the afternoon is - fortunately - scat free. It's mainly following Rarity around as she readies her dresses and asks which hat looks best with which frock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from one very short, punctuating fart that she releases while working on a gown, you don't have to encounter the smellier side of Rarity at all for the duration of the afternoon. In fact, you find her company is thoroughly enjoyable when you're not being made an accomplice to her strange shit-eating habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe auction rolls around and Rarity spares no expense in your arrival; you follow her out onto a red carpet to a crowd of adoring fans as she leads you through to the large auction hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never felt more out of place; you're surrounded by the most elite of the elite, and the looks they give you suggest they can smell the lack of money on you - <i>and hopefully not just Rarity's shit</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it's admittedly a little uninteresting, Rarity's good spirits and affectionate companionship keep you vaguely interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the auction is complete the high society of Canterlot gathers in one of the large back rooms for drinks and an expansive buffet that you almost feel too poor to touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity disappears into the crowd for a while, leaving you to idly sip at your drink and just observe the ponies around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, though, she returns - only, she's not alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! There you are. Peppermint - I'd like you to meet Fleur De Lis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightly larger, impossibly beautiful mare bows her head to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were talking, and we... might have ended up discussing your new position as my chef.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Fleur here shares some of my... <i>passion for nutrition</i>, shall we say, and she was wondering if you'd be dreadfully opposed to the idea of a little... what was the term you used..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shared session.\" The mare has an impossibly affluent way of speaking; a sultry, precise accent that could lull you to submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Well, I'm not sure what you'd say to that, Peppermint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you decline I won't take it personally.\" Fleur assures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're certainly put on the spot, but you can't deny the offer seems... intriguing in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was an old trick you'd seen done a thousand times before at birthday parties as a foal, but you watched on regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now, as you can see, the great and powerful Trixie has been locked; <i>sealed</i> tightly in this impenetrable box. If you look<i> above</i> the box, you'll notice this tank of water is slowly, but surely, emptying into the very same box! How is the great and powerful Trixie going to possibly escape this particular watery, deadly prison!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd oo'd and aa'd as the water level in the tank steadily depleted, with the locks and chains seemingly unmoving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no! Maybe this is truly it for her!\" The unicorn gasped with an exaggerated, dramatic lilt. You thought she was laying it on a little too thick, personally, but the crowd were eating it up; gasping along with her and leaning forwards on their seats, as if they truly believed she would be in any real danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Gasp!</i> It looks like the box is filled with water, and there's still no sign of Trixie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd reacted expectedly, until a voice came from behind them - and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you mean the <i>great</i> and <i>powerful</i> Trixie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn azure-blue unicorn wearing a magician's hat and cape was inexplicably standing behind you, holding a pose as the audience roared with laughter and applause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she been there the whole time? You couldn't remember seeing her as you arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Thank you! You've all been such a wonderful audience, but I would be nothing if not for my wonderful assistant: Starlight Glimmer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn on stage smiled humbly and bowed, and the crowd headed back towards town, passing Trixie who was holding out a small bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, any donations are much-appreciated!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a few clinking coins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the audience had emptied out from the field, Trixie headed over towards the stage where she met with Starlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to head over, just to tell them their performance was good, even if you'd only caught the last few minutes. Despite the fact you'd already seen a similar trick performed before, they both certainly put a lot of effort into entertaining the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. They really were tight today. Looks like it's beans again for dinner.\" Trixie complained, looking into the bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's not all bad.\" Starlight giggled to her partner, as if she were making some insinuation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two unicorns noticed you, they stopped their discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. What is it? An autograph? Would you like my assistant here to take a photograph of you alongside the great and powerful Trixie!\" It was as if that grand, actorly demeanor had just been switched on again for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no, I was just going to say I enjoyed the show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Starlight smiled at you warmly, though Trixie seemed to scoff a little at the idea somepony wouldn't want her autograph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I've seen you around town before.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got here today. I'm actually here on business... of a kind, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of business?\" Trixie's eyes inspected you as she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm supposed to be assisting the princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Really?\" Starlight's face seemed to light up, \"I live with Twilight most of the time. I would probably be there right now, but Trixie asked if I could help her out for a week and I said yes. Small world, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't surprising everypony had a close connection to Twilight in this town. She <i>was</i> the princess of friendship, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm supposed to be staring tomorrow, but I thought I'd explore around town a little and get to know the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure you've <i>also</i> heard of me.\" Trixie once again held a pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't, but it was rude to say that, and she clearly enjoyed the attention, so you told her you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it's a real pleasure to finally meet me, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Trixie. Drop the act. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peppermint Swirl. I'm afraid to say you definitely haven't heard of me.\" You laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking you up and down again, Trixie looked as if she'd just suddenly had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Starlight, he'd be perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. We wouldn't want to deprive him of his job here. I'm sure Twilight's pretty swamped without me at the castle this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... perfect for what?\" You interject, and the two mares look round as if they'd momentarily forgotten you were even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just that me and Starlight have been... how should I put this... we've been looking for somepony to join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. There's... a few things we've been wanting to try... in private... and we've been trying to find a victi- uh... I mean... participant... to help out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like... a new trick or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorns shared a knowing glance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something a little suspicious about how vague Trixie was being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you haven't found anypony willing to help? Not even one of those ponies watching your show earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Starlight who spoke up next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. It's not something most ponies would be comfortable helping out with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie added; \"...and, let's just say, we don't exactly want... our secrets being shared with somepony who <i>lives</i> here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight nodded in agreement. \"People here spread things around a lot. Someone like you - an outsider - we'd feel a whole lot safer sharing these... secrets with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure why they couldn't just come out and be a bit more direct. \"What kinds of secrets, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... it's not so easy to just tell you,\" Trixie began, \"Not until you've accepted. It would be easier to just show you. We wouldn't want you going around just telling everypony our secrets if you decide to decline. I'm afraid if you want to know... you'll have to say yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would also mean that once you said yes, it would be hard to exactly get out of it, too. Still, it did seem interesting. You'd always had an interest in magic, and in all honesty you were now just interested in what these big secrets were anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Trixie pressed, clearly impatient.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m in.\u201d It would have been nice to know exactly what it is you were in for, but the only way to find out was to go along with Trixie and Starlight\u2019s request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d make the right choice.\u201d Trixie grinned. \u201cOur wagon is just behind the stage. Follow us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mares went on ahead and you followed behind, eventually arriving at the steps to a large, modern wagon. Well - it was really more of a caravan than a wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading inside you were surprised to see just how spacious things were. There was a main living area with a couple of comfortable-looking seat cushions laid out on the floor, and a little kitchen nook off to the side. On the other side was a closed door, which you assumed was probably the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was certainly basic, but for a home on the road, it was very cosy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you got rid of that poky old wagon.\u201d Starlight made her way across to one of the large plush cushions and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s always good to have a little change once in a while.\u201d Trixie headed straight to the kitchen, opening up one of the cupboard doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed disdainfully, looking over the rows of near-identical cans of food. \u201cIt would be nice having a little more variety around here. I\u2019m starting to miss the taste of food that doesn\u2019t come from a tin.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gotta make certain sacrifices when you\u2019re on the road. When we get to Manehattan, I\u2019ll treat you to a proper meal out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith <i>what</i>? The blue unicorn asked, tersely. \u201cWe\u2019re broke.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRainy day fund.\u201d Starlight shrugged, easing herself into a more relaxed position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had still been absolutely no mention of what it was they wanted from you. In fact, they were acting as if you weren\u2019t even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...\u201d you spoke up, receiving looks from the two unicorns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, relax. We\u2019ll get to your role here after dinner. Speaking of - would you like some?\u201d Trixie asked in an uncharacteristically amiable tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. I haven\u2019t eaten in a while.\u201d You responded, realizing your hunger had suddenly crept up on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to the stock of cans, and hearing her belly groan pleadingly, settled on a tin and opened it, pouring the unappetizing beans into a saucepan and heating it, stirring every few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can come sit down, you know.\u201d Starlight looked over to you, pointing to the unoccupied cushion, which you shortly took a seat on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how did you get in with Twilight?\" Starlight asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I applied to be her assistant, and she wrote me back telling me I could have the position. I'm supposed to start tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As <i>thoroughly exciting</i> as I'm sure working with Twilight Sparkle would be,\" Trixie began, facetiously, \"Hopefully you'll see sense and decide to stay on with us instead. I'm sure she'd be able to find another pony willing to wait on her hoof and foot.\" She smiled, snarkily, and finished up cooking the beans, distributing them into three separate bowls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food's ready.\" She announced, using her magic to set up a small plastic table and lay down some cutlery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Starlight took a seat, the two unicorns sitting next to each other and you on the other side of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started off eating the still-steaming beans, clearly quite hungry. You could tell meals here were few and far between, and so began to eat from your own bowl. You hadn't had anything since breakfast, so, while basic, it was nice to have a hot meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mares seemed unhappy with the food; clearly having endured the same meal many times before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should save up and get some cheese and bread.\" Trixie said in a muted tone, probing her beans with her fork before reluctantly taking in another mouthful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does sound good right about now. Are you sure these are definitely in date?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I assume they keep for a while. I don't know. It's not as if they taste any better either way.\" She answered shortly, finishing the contents of her bowl and pushing it aside. \"Although they really don't seem to be agreeing with me.\" Her teeth clenched together as she reclined back on the stool, rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They never do.\" Starlight grinned to Trixie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your attention back down to your bowl, still taking occasional spoonfuls. It really didn't taste great, but it would have been rude to not finish it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you had your fork raised halfway to your mouth, your attention was alerted to a loud, reverberating rippling sound. Looking up, you saw Trixie grinning deviously and blushing. \"Oh, <i>excuse me</i>.\" She said insincerely, wafting her tail to dispel the fart she had just blasted out onto the wooden stool she sat on. How charming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Starlight started, \"You call that a fart? Don't make me think you're losing your skill.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, naturally, I wanted to hold back in front of our new guest.\" She looked round to you. It certainly didn't sound like she was holding back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's going to have to get used to it, though.\" Starlight reminded her, and the blue unicorn nodded. <br>\r\n\"You're right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with this, using her hooves to support her weight, she lifted her kiester up off the stool and strained hard, sending an even louder, more boisterous fart growling out of her with absolutely no restraint. You stared at the situation before you, speechless, as Trixie sustained the flatulence for what seemed like a while. In reality, probably only about eight seconds, but definitely far longer than a fart should be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a feminine gasp it came to a sudden end and she sat back down again, out of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more like it!\" Starlight cheered on, excited, and then leaned round the back of Trixie and took a sharp, thorough inhale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had gone from weird to straight up bizarre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh~ That was a pretty potent one!\" Starlight giggled like an excited filly, clasping her hooves over her muzzle and coughing, though she clearly <i>enjoyed</i> the smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what our little apprentice thought of it.\" Trixie looked to you, expecting some kind of an answer. You couldn't even come up with one if you tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell seemed to suddenly hit Trixie, who reacted accordingly. \"Oh! You're right, Starlight - that's a bad one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like something crawled up your ass and died!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Trixie sniffed at her own gaseous byproduct, trying to identify what it reminded her of like a wine taster detecting notes in an especially potent bouquet. \"Oh, it's eggy, but there's something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight cautiously joined her, once again leaning back so her head was closer to Trixie's rump. \"It's almost like spoiled milk!\" The purple unicorn announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was typical that you had just happened to agree to stay with the two craziest ponies in town, but there was no getting away from it now. It was obvious now why they didn't want their <i>secret</i> spreading around town. You had heard of ponies having a fetish for hooves, but <i>farts</i>? It almost seemed like some elaborate prank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he's caught wind of it yet.\" Trixie smirked rigidly, looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight then started to waft her hooves in an exaggerated motion to send some of the stench your way. Still, you just sat, motionless and unable to even formulate a response to this insanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stony demeanour was quickly shattered, though, as the smell hit you almost out of nowhere. Weirdly enough, it was exactly as Starlight had described: eggy and with a disgusting undertone of rancid dairy. You felt like being sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go.\" Starlight laughed. \"That caught you off guard, Peppermint, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I've got another one already. I think the beans are really beginning to set in.\" Trixie once again clutched her stomach uneasily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already? Usually it's not for an hour or two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe you were right - maybe they are out of date..\" Trixie managed, resting forward onto the table and blasting a wet, raspy volley of gas out from behind her. There was a disgustingly muddy, wet sound to this one, but it didn't deter Starlight, who once more leaned back and over and fervently took in a lungful of the freshly-produced anal pollution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!\" She exclaimed, nose flaring and cheeks scrunching up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too much for you to handle?\" Trixie asked her, looking back with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No. It's just... wow! That really clears your sinuses.\" Starlight joked, wiping her nostrils and taking another deep, meaningful sniff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just to make the situation even more insane, the two mares sat up, facing each other, and pulled one another into a passionate kiss, moaning ardently as the gassy medley swarmed around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight pulled away, still gazing directly into her partner's eyes. \"They're even smellier than usual. I think I'm already wet just from that little sample.\" She tittered, half-embarrassed, and Trixie planted a kiss on her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't we get started? We've kept dear Peppermint here in the dark long enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed pretty fucking obvious to you what their big secret was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need some assistance. As much as we adore the gassy fun the two of us have together, introducing a third party into the mix would definitely open some avenues.\" Trixie told you, and Starlight nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we start with?\" The light purple unicorn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie thought about it for a moment, and then decided...</span></div></div>",

I'm not sure how much longer I can hold back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Starlight practically leapt from her chair and assumed a position on the plush seat cushion she had been sat on earlier, lying down on her back and gazing at her partner, her eyes desperately yearning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's eager.\" Trixie chuckled facetiously, getting down and trotting over to Starlight, waving you over with a hoof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you were just... watching, but it didn't make <i>what</i> you were watching any less revolting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down a few feet away, hoping you'd maybe be just outside the blast zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie lowered herself on top of the other mare, her rump pointed towards her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight visibly became quite anxious, her cheeks reddening as she gazed at Trixie's nethers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, p-please..\" She stammered. Trixie just let out a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at how desperate she is! You've probably never seen anything quite so shameful, have you?\" She asked you, only making Starlight twice as embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie! Do you really have to..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh! You know it's what I like to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were seriously having a squabble in a situation like this? You were generally all fine with ponies being <i>into</i> whatever they wanted to be, but when you were being made to watch it you weren't quite so nonjudgmental. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really want it?\" Trixie teased her friend, revelling in the squirms and desperate moans she got in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I'm so desperate for your gas!\" Starlight started fervently licking her partner's plot with a violent wet spittling noise. It was truly a pathetic display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Trixie. with seemingly very little effort, gave her friend exactly what she wanted; a piping hot fart fresh from her lower stomach, which bubbled out in a loud, unapologetic ripping sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Starlight began snorting it up like it was the last breath of air in Equestria, shuddering with intense pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they're so stinky today! I think my nose is running a little..\" She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know you like them stinky.\" Trixie blasted another anal eruption into Starlight's face, not as long as the previous one, but still nasty-sounding. If the smell you'd been assaulted with at the table was any indicator. the smell Starlight was inhaling was very strong indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes! Your farts are..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect? Yes, I know they are. Why don't you squeal for our guest just to show him how much you want some more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight did exactly as she was told, letting out a whimpering, wavering whine, though you got the impression it wasn't entirely voluntary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now... how would you like a closer sniff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>YES</b>\" Starlight had been taken over entirely by sheer sexual arousal at this point. You never thought you'd see a pony <i>this</i> worked up over flatulence of all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie lifted herself up and with a thud stationed her plot on Starlight's face, wiggling around to get comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis almost sent the unicorn over the edge, her hooves digging into the cushion and her legs desperately rubbing together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to look away from the performance in front of you if you tried, you silently, repulsively, looked on as Trixie lifted her right cheek as if she were sitting on a chair, squeezing out a deep, rumbly fart that was half muffled by her partner's face and then settled back down into position, trapping the fumes between her ass and Starlight's muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight let out a moan of pleasure, also muffled beneath Trixie's weighty posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she <i>liked</i> that.\" She giggled to you. You felt like throwing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want another one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>MMMH! MMMH!! MMMMHHH!</b></i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes.\" Trixie smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed to let out another fart, though this time she didn't lift either cheek off Starlight's face, keeping her ass firmly planted in position. It clearly took a little more pressure to get the gas to expel, but once it did. you could tell Starlight was close to climax at just inhaling it. You couldn't imagine how utterly repugnant it would smell that<i> close</i> up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight's hoof reached down between her legs to relieve herself, but Trixie pulled it away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should you have to waste your energy doing that? We have an assistant now, after all.\" She turned round to you with a broad, menacing grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You've never eaten a mare out before? You are our assistant, aren't you? You agreed to help us out with this, remember?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't wrong. You cursed your curiosity. You had no idea their secret would be quite so... whatever this was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was really no way out of doing what she told you. After all, you'd made an agreement. There was no backing out. The only way to escape at this stage would be to make a dash for it, but you didn't imagine you'd get very far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Can't you see how desperate she is?\" Trixie emphasised this point by letting another fart thunder against Starlight's face, making her moan and squirm even more ardently. </span></div></div>",

Starlight was still writhing desperately, Trixie's weight pinning her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry. I think she's desperate.\" Trixie tittered, pulling in her abdomen and sending another rumble of flatulence over her partner's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>Mmmmhhh</i></b>!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding it was better to get the awful deed over with sooner rather than later, you scooted close and took a moment to gaze between Starlight's legs. Her pussy was already soaking wet; a little pool of fluid had formed on the cushion below, and both her hind legs twisted. You didn't know how anypony could derive this much pleasure from something as disgusting as farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lowered your head, eyes closing in worried anticipation and started to lick gently at Starlight's marehood, feeling it practically squirm in response and rouse another loud, muffled moan from Starlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! She sounds like she really needs that, and really needs<i> this</i>, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, Trixie supplied Starlight with yet another ripple of gas. It was surprising she could produce it so frequently. Those beans really did a number on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat became even more apparent as the smell slowly floated over to your head. You'd hoped Starlight's face might have taken the brunt of the stench, and while it did to an extent, it wasn't enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled your head away to cough, and then buried your tongue back between Starlight's pert, juicy lips. Your tongue lapped away with a sticky slurping noise as the moans and whines came more and more often. Starlight was experiencing the absolute apex of sexual satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any other scenario, getting to eat out a mare as attractively-built as Starlight would be a fantasy, but the steamy stench of broccoli and egg that washed over your face every few minutes killed the mood entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to say it, but I think the tank is almost empty.\" Trixie prodded her deflated belly with a raspy chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight uttered a sound of protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this last one is going to have to really be something special.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. Out of the way. Your feeble attempts aren't enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled your head out from Starlight's crotch. The taste of her would be in the back of your throat for some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me show you how to really pleasure a mare.\" Trixie grinned haughtily, and you watched as her horn began to glow and levitate something from the small kitchenette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it got closer, you could see it was a cucumber. A particularly large one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you were a little confused, but the confusion disappeared as Trixie began to lower it, using her magic, down to Starlight's pleading marehood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as it disappeared into Starlight's fleshy mound, appearing again and then sliding in and out with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight, of course, went into overdrive; she had already been close to toppling over the edge and this was enough to see that she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beat her hooves against the floor, legs turning over each other as Trixie's penetration sped up faster and faster. You could hear Starlight was panting and whining like a dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy this, my dear.\" She said, very gradually leaning forwards and letting a barrage of noisy farts evacuate onto Starlight's sealed face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a couple of seconds Starlight reached climax, and reached it violently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe practically screamed into Trixie's backside, legs falling limp as her pussy squirted and excreted its carnal juices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie's smile remained in place on her face. She retrieved the cucumber from deep inside Starlight and, to your surprise, brought it to her mouth, licking up and down and sucking it almost dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there's nothing quite like the taste of your pussy.\" She moaned to herself, as if it were a normal thing to say, and then, finally, pulled her ass off of Starlight's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn looked utterly exhausted; her chest rising and falling as her matted mane fell over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd give our new guest a proper demonstration.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight looked like she needed a moment to recover, so instead Trixie turned to face you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Quite a disgusting little deviant, isn't she?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just as speechless as Starlight was. You'd never seen mares - or even stallions - engaging in something as revolting as that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think we should do next?\" She pried. You couldn't even begin to think of an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On one hoof, I could perhaps let her rest a bit,\" She looked back down at her partner still sprawled out on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or... we could make things more interesting.\" Her mouth fixed back into that same devious smile which seemed to be a trademark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, how?\" You asked, wondering if you even wanted to know the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got a spell book somewhere around here. If you helped me out by reading me the spell, maybe I could finally take a crack at that <i>inflation</i> spell you wanted me to try, Starlight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight's ears perked up immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You decide.\" She turned to you, smile dropping. It didn't look like you had any other option. </span></div></div>",

You\u2019re lost in fantasies of sponge cakes and brownies and before you know it, you\u2019re at the front of the queue, which seems to have died down slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, boy! Lunch is always the <i>busiest</i> time! I\u2019m pooped!\u201d The pink pony wiped a drop of sweat from her brow and then turned her attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I get ya? Carrot slice? Marzipan surprise? Marshmallow macaroons? Key lime pie? Oat and hay flapjacks? Cake? Chocolate? Vanilla? Strawberry? Lemon meringue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re bombarded by a thousand words a minute as the baker lists off seemingly every single item on offer. You were already stuck for choice with just what was on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what do you recommend?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWellllll, it\u2019s a Tuesday, and the weather is warm, so I\u2019d suggest an igloo pie!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIgloo pie?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! It\u2019s one of our specialties!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded good, but even if it didn\u2019t this mare\u2019s bubbly, restless energy would probably compel you to buy whatever she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take one!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and dashed into the kitchen, leaving you for a few moments to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before she returned, though, with the igloo cake all boxed up and ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne igloo cake! Enjoy it while it\u2019s cold!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass her the bits and thank her, but she doesn\u2019t seem finished with you yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay... you\u2019re not a baker, are you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, not-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-because I\u2019m really looking for someone to help out around here since Mr and Mrs Cake went on vacation for a month.

Besides, she\u2019d probably just have you blowing the dust off books or something!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving secured herself a baking assistant, she hurries over to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverybody out! We\u2019re closed for the rest of the day! I\u2019ve got a rookie to train here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few ponies sitting and eating cakes in the shop get up begrudgingly and leave, allowing Pinkie to lock up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, rookie. Let\u2019s get cooking! There isn\u2019t a second to waste! Oh, and I\u2019m Pinkie Pie, by the way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can tell her your name she grabs you by the arm and leads you round into the kitchen. Things really seem to move at a thousand miles an hour with this pony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! So let\u2019s start easy and just make cupcakes! I have a rule around here; you gotta eat what you cook, even if it turns out awful and burned and tasteless! It\u2019s the only way to improve!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re not sure that\u2019s quite right but you nod, taking a look at the ingredients laid out on the surface. Pinkie throws an apron round your neck and starts to demonstrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Ooookay</i> so we first get the oven nice and hot, then into a bowl goes butter, sugar, <i>mix</i>, eggs, <i>whisk</i>, flour, vanilla extract, cinnamon, salt, <b>into the cases</b>, into the oven, thennnn for the frosting... butter, cream cheese, sugar, more sugar, <b>MORE SUGAR</b>, vanilla extract, into the piper, out the oven, frost those cakies, <b>done!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head is in a spin as you try to compute even a word of what she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you. \u201cGot it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... I think so.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Now you try!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step in front of the mixing bowl, looking down at the ingredients and trying to see if anything she told you even went in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her facial expression for cues, after a good few minutes, you have something vaguely resembling cake batter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Not too bad. Let\u2019s get these in the oven and see how they come out when they\u2019re done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be a lot better, but also a lot worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so great having a helping hoof around here at last! If you can learn my methods, you\u2019ll be finishing orders in no time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder why she doesn\u2019t just put you on the front desk, but arguing with this pony would likely just end in another five minute rant or ramble, and you need to give your brain a rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the cakes seem ready, and after piping some of your makeshift frosting on top, she hands you a cupcake and you both eat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Not bad. A little dry. Good for a first try though, uh...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses. <br>\r\n\u201cGosh! I\u2019ve been so busy I never even asked you your name!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeppermint Swirl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh! See, you\u2019re perfect for the job! Now... if you want, I could always share a little company secret with you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the way I make my special double chocolate surprise! It\u2019s our bestseller!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must be very trustworthy to be divulging secret recipes this early on, but you\u2019re curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the big secret is I don\u2019t mix it in a bowl, at all... I mix it in my tummy!\u201d She grabs and jiggles her pudgy paunch with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh. I don\u2019t follow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple! I just get a big ol\u2019 tube, stick it in my rump, and pour all the ingredients inside. Give em a little mix and voila!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like this has to be a joke at first, but quickly realize she\u2019s serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis has to break some hygiene laws to say the very least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... isn\u2019t that a little..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnhygienic? <i>nahh</i> I mean... I don\u2019t call it double chocolate for nothin\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet Celestia. So not only does this mare give herself a fucking enema to mix her batter, she wants you to help her do it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be way easier having somepony else to give me a hoof!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain silent, really not sure what to even say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo? Hm. I mean, maybe that\u2019s a little bit advanced for a noobie like you. I guess if you didn\u2019t want to do that, we could always grab some grub! My tummy\u2019s been growling away all day! You can even choose what we get to eat! You could even feed it <i>to</i> me if you want! You <i>are</i> my assistant, after all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts imitating the sounds of her stomach as she leaves you to decide which of the two options you\u2019d prefer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon! Choose one! Pick pick pick! Unless of course it hasn\u2019t been written yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Neither of the two options seemed preferable, but Pinkie seemed pretty desperate for you to give her an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... I guess we could try the secret recipe.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bursts with excitement. \u201cGreat! Ooh, it\u2019s gonna be so fun having somepony else to help!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder how it\u2019s possible she\u2019s been doing this for so long without getting this place closed down, but you don\u2019t have long to think about things, as Pinkie zooms past you and opens a closet, rummaging around and pulling out a variety of ingredients and tools. You gulp as she begins to lay them down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoookay, so first you wanna stick this tube thingie <i>waaayy</i> up in my tushie, then use this funnel to pour all the ingredients in! Don\u2019t worry - I\u2019ll tell you the order!\u201d She explains rapturously, wasting no time and immediately getting into position; her rump raised up high and her chest down to the ground. She wiggles her butt at you to indicate she\u2019s ready, showing off her genitals and taut, puckered anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell? You just gonna stand around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the tube attached to the funnel and hesitate for a moment, before bringing the end to Pinkie\u2019s tailhole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirm as you feel it twitch and pucker reflexively, awaiting the thick plastic tubing currently probing it. Taking a deep breath, you push, feeling her asshole give way and accept the end of the tube, sucking it in as you push deeper and deeper, eliciting a gasp from Pinkie herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowie! It feels even weirder when somepony else is d-doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to push a little deeper, until she tells you to stop. If this situation weren't so uncomfortable, you might be impressed at how wide her anus has spread to fully receive the duct. You hold the funnel. This entire ordeal feels so bizarre you're not entirely sure you're not dreaming. <i>If only you could pinch yourself to find out...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait..\" She says, pausing. \"Listen to this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even ask her what she means, you hear a hollow blaring sound travelling up through the tube and out of the funnel like an out-of-tune tuba. Pinkie bursts out laughing at the sound of her uncouth anal eruption, and you just roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you <i>hear</i> that?!\" She tries to imitate the sound with her mouth, only making her laugh more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like a whole minute, she manages to compose herself. \"Ok, Swirlie-Wirlie, start off with the milk.\" She points towards the kitchen counter where she has laid out the needed ingredients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The whole bottle?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! We're making a big batch, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the bottle and pull off the cap, pausing for a second before pouring it slowly into the funnel, watching it filter down the tube and, ultimately, into Pinkie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Cold!\" She shivers, half in pleasure, and you eventually pour the entire bottle in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How did I ever agree to this?\"</i> You ask yourself, turning back to the ingredients again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Next up, you're gonna have to mix together the flour with a little water. It won't exactly go through the tube otherwise.\" She giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly you do as she says, quickly mixing the flour and water together to form a paste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... you better mix the butter in, too!\" She calls out, and so you add it. You're just glad all you have to do is effectively pour ingredients into a funnel. Maybe if you were able to close your eyes you could imagine it wasn't going straight into a pony's colon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the mixture combined, you bring it over to the funnel again, and as before, tip it in. It doesn't hurry down the tube as fast as the milk, but it does seem to reach Pinkie eventually, as you hear her gasp and moan in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gooey!\" She stutters. You cringe just at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look!\" She calls to you, prodding at her belly. \"It's already bulging out a little!\" She pokes it again and it lets out a deep-set gurgle at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Eggs next! Make sure you whisk them up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the same bowl, you crack in the two eggs and whisk them haphazardly. You figure this isn't a recipe where attention to detail is going to really make much difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pour the eggs down the tube as well, watching them disappear; sucked up inside Pinkie's rectum to add in to the mixture already inside her. You're just lucky you never actually got a chance to eat the cake she sold to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Now just add the chocolate sauce, the sugar, the baking powder and a little more milk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this will all... fit in?\" You ask her cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh. Of course! I've done this like a hundred times!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's best to just get this over with as soon as possible. You prepare the last few ingredients, mix them together, and then pour the concoction down through the tube, making sure to lift it up high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, right?\" You ask her, hoping to Celestia you don't have to do anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! Now the mixing stage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mixing stage?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take the tube outta my butt and I'll show you!\" You can tell by the slightly strained tone to her voice, and her bloated, bulging lower abdomen, that she's pretty full up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully remove the tube from her with a wet popping sound, hearing her cautiously moan and gasp as she tries her best to keep the mixture contained within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay... now grab the last piece of equipment and put it in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're wondering what she's referring to at first, but looking back to the kitchen counter, hidden behind the bag of flour, is a large, rubber, obsidian-black butt plug. Of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning off your senses as best you can, you ease it into her asshole, watching it gape to accept its girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aghh.\" She gasps. \"Good. Now, it's time for the mixing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully rolls onto her back, making strained, laboured grunting noises as she does so, and reveals her pudgy, distended belly to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Just... give it a rub to mix those ingredients up nice and good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.. what? Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, who else would I be talking to, silly?\" She giggles, her energy reduced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's really no way out of doing this, is there? You get down to the floor, reaching over to Pinkie and very gently massaging her belly. You're surprized to find it's taut; almost rock hard, so utterly filled to its limits that the walls of her colon are pushed to their extremes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to rub at each side, watching Pinkie's face distort at the sensations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Good job.\" She grunts, biting her lip and spreading her legs as she tries to put up with the increasingly apparent desperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to wobble and slosh her belly, that lets out more and more pained noises of digestion and irritation. It's pretty obvious it wants to void itself of all the cake mixture inside as soon as it possibly can. It's probably not a good idea to leave it much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. That's good. Now get a clean bowl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly rush to get a mixing bowl - the largest one you can see - and meanwhile Pinkie gets herself back onto her hooves, assuming a similar position to before with her rear raised up towards the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hurry! My tummy's really starting to hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assume a position behind her, bowl primed and angled so there won't be any spillage, and, taking a deep breath, you reach forward and pull the butt plug out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even half a second of delay, her asshole distends and spews out the thick, gloopy cake mixture like a torrid, gushing eruption. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie gasps, almost orgasmically, as the dark brown batter spews from her in a violent stream, making a wet, choking sound like a blocked pipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to keep the bowl in the right position as the batter fills it up rapidly. As the unwavering volley continues, you can see that her belly is shrinking in size just as quickly as the mixture is pouring out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ooh, yeahh..</i>\" Pinkie moans, tongue lolling out. Clearly she's enjoying this a lot more than you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stream begins to abate gradually, but, to your shock, something more than cake batter passes out from her anus; a lighter brown, runny matter that you can only assume - by the horribly sour smell now afflicting your nostrils - is poop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes all your strength to not gag, swallowing hard and feeling your mouth crease up at the edges. With this, though, she's finished, and with one last little wet dribble of chocolate sauce, the mixture is back in the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least none of it got on-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>schhlllaarpp</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wet rippling splatter Pinkie farts and blows specks of cake mix all over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoopsie!\" She laughs and stands up straight again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Swirlie-Wirlie, I'll get it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have a chance to wonder what she means by that, the mare comes up to you and licks over your face and upper torso, cleaning you up, but in possibly the least hygienic way possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're left with a sticky, bad-smelling film of saliva all over you. It's hard to decide if this is really better than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That's a great batch!\" She picks the bowl up herself to inspect it, before quickly preparing three large cake tins and pouring it inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, when this is ready, we'll be able to try it! I'll let you go first, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can't seriously be expecting you to actually <i>eat</i> that after knowing how it's made. You shiver at the thought. How can it even be edible? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cFood it is!\u201d Pinkie announced, probably just as rapturous as she would have been if you\u2019d gone with the other option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat do you feel like? Hayburger and fries? Extra cheese burrito? Pizza? Pasta? Ooh! Or we could just go grab a bunch of snacks from the store and chow down on those!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were overwhelmed by choice, and the rate at which Pinkie was listing it off to you, so quickly agreed with her last suggestion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood choice, Swirlie!\u201d She chirped, hoisting you by the arm out the front door to the bakery and led you across town to the small supermarket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry - I\u2019ll pay for it all.\u201d She told you, casually throwing a steadily growing mass of snacks, candy and soda into the shopping cart she had you pushing along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered how even two ponies could feasibly eat this much, but you didn\u2019t doubt Pinkie Pie had something of a mammoth appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip round the store didn\u2019t last very long, and once she\u2019d cleared the shelves of just about every unhealthy food item the store stocked, you both headed to the counter to pay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes pulsed wide as you saw the final price flash up on the mechanical cash register, but surprisingly Pinkie paid for it in full, and didn\u2019t seem to even remotely care that she was throwing away so many bits on junk food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were soon back at Sugarcube Corner, where Pinkie led you up to the second floor. The majority of the space consisted of her bedroom, which was surprisingly bare and plain for a pony who seemed to like to make an exaggerated effort in every other area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie dumped the pile - though it was more of a mountain - onto the middle of the floor, rubbing her hooves together as she licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, boy! What should we try first? There\u2019s too much to choose!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat back on her bed, observing silently as the energetic pink pony pulled out two bags of chips, throwing one to you and then popping hers open with a squeeze, pouring the contents down her throat, barely even crunching or chewing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feebly took nibbles at the bag of chips, but the way Pinkie continued to guzzle down snacks and pour entire bottles of soda down her gullet in one go put you off eating at all. How could a pony - especially a mare - eat like <i>this</i>? It was unnatural. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a short, loud belch as if it were just something to get out of the way to clear more room for food, and resumed her insane binge; you had scarcely finished half of your bag of chips and she had seemingly devoured half the pile of snacks she had supposedly brought to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Sorry! I\u2019m just so hungry!\u201d She giggled with a full mouth, spraying little pieces of chewed up food everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to not notice that her stomach had visibly increased in size, too; bloated and protruding out as it tried desperately to contain the huge amount of food she had stuffed into it - far more food than any mare, or even stallion, should eat in one sitting. Probably even one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slow, lazy burp dribbled through her lips as her shoulders sunk and her body seemed to recline back, her belly sticking out even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, wow! Looks like I ate all that a little too fast, huh?\u201d She prodded at her bulging belly, and then, seeming to have suddenly thought of something, looked up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeeing as you\u2019re my assistant here now... maybe you could help me out a l-little?\u201d Her demeanour had quickly changed from perky and hyperactive to reserved and strained, letting out hefty breaths and another full-bodied burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp? How?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe give me a little rub. Get it moving through me. I think I got some chips stuck in my throat.\u201d Her features contracted into an expression of slight pain as she thumped her hoof against her chest, rattling out another long, masculine belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Oh, boy</i>...\u201d she sighed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was clearly struggling to digest all the food she had crammed into herself, unsurprisingly, and though it really wasn\u2019t your duty, you got down onto the floor, scootched up next to her and gingerly began to rub her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no. You\u2019re barely doing anything. You gotta <i>really</i> massage it deep.\u201d She told you, grabbing your hoof with her own and guiding it forcefully further into her taut, balloon-like belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, yeah. That\u2019s the spot.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to apply pressure, rubbing in a circular motion. It felt strange, but it seemed to be helping her somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to you, mouth opening and only a second later a deep, noisy belch came through it, sounding as if it had originated deep down in the depths of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hit with the smell of warm garlic, and recoiled, nose scrunching up in an effort to close out the stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen - to your surprise - Pinkie reached over and started picking up <i>even more</i> food from the pile. It wasn\u2019t with the same veracity as before, but startlingly she seemed to have room left to stuff more and more down; whole packets of chips, entire bags of candy corn, huge bottles of drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPinkie? Are you sure you should..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh! Don\u2019t you worry about me!\u201d She assured, but you could feel her stomach growing in size gradually with each item of food she forcefully made it take in; you felt like it could genuinely pop at any second, but she seemed determined - for some strange, undisclosed reason - to eat everything in sight, and after what had to only be five minutes, she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gurgling, whining groans from inside her stomach only got more and more disgruntled, like a snared animal growling and desperate for release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her hoof up to her mouth and spewed out another grisly eructation, which you felt vibrate through her entire torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breaths had become even more laboured, too, and mustering all the energy she had, she slid herself over to sit against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were half-closed, her expression suggesting she was trying to just focus on digesting the unhealthy myriad of snacks currently struggling to break apart in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gotta fart... <i>so bad</i>.\u201d She smiled, and this immediately send your blood cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanna let it b-brew for a little more, though. I want this to be one impressive ripper.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid this mare have no shame? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to you, eyes flashing with competitive excitement - muted, but still apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you go grab me the bag of hot chilli chips we have in the cupboard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... what?\u201d You couldn\u2019t believe she could fit even another crumb inside her; her stomach was so utterly filled to the brim that it felt rock hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Do it.\u201d She repeated, overcome by stomach pains as her belly protested and grumbled away at her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clearly wasn\u2019t going to change her mind, so you made your way downstairs and soon found the chips she had mentioned. They were really going to finish her off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard her unleash another monstrous burp as you came back up the stairs. She was still collapsed against the wall, her hind legs poking out either side of her enlarged tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snatched the bag from you and poured the chips down her throat carelessly. You could tell that from the moment they reached her stomach, the reaction was not good. Her eyes perked open, her stomach bubbling and burbling even louder, the sound travelling down further and further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuick! Get over here!\u201d She gestured to her belly, which you promptly found yourself trying to rub again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched her left eye stutter and close, and her face contorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Time this one f-for me.\u201d She managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the floodgates forcefully opened.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You managed to count rough seconds in your head, though your surprise made it hard to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to be wrong. According to your own internal counting, it had already been surging on for twelve full seconds, and that wasn\u2019t even accounting for the one or two you missed as it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t a quiet, weak fart, either, it sounded like it was being released with the maximum amount of pressure possible; revving and choking like an engine and sending shockwaves through the floorboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was starting to just get ridiculous. Twenty seconds passed and Pinkie still kept it going. Her face was completely at rest; she was clearly focusing all her attention on making this fart as long as it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it passed the 25 second mark, the smell suddenly caught up to you. You tried to continue counting as it intruded your nostrils, leaving the acrid stench of warm, damp milk in the back of your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie seemed motionless, only opening her legs a little wider, which seemed to alter the sound very slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, keeping it going, she sunk back and laid down on her back, raising her right leg up in the air and forcing her butt cheeks to press together. The gas flow didn\u2019t stop, though, it just grew even stronger to force its way through her pursed buttocks like the spittling, shaking nozzle of a whoopie cushion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also noticed her belly was gradually becoming more and more yielding and soft, letting down like a leaking waterbottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after almost a whole minute, it stopped suddenly, but Pinkie wasn\u2019t completely finished here. She pushed out one last fart, this one in itself lasting about eight seconds, and then collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew! I think that\u2019s a new record!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained frozen as she patted her belly and managed to release one more burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell still hung like a phantom in the room, and just to ease your lungs a little you headed to the window and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe center of the room was still covered in the pile of empty, used wrappers and bottles. It was impossible to imagine all of it could fit inside one pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Swirlie,\u201d she started, still using the nickname you were starting to hate, and then came out and said...</span></div></div>",

Are you able to start immediately?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd does 200 bits seem to be a reasonable fee?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA week?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, a day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n200 bits a day!? You noticed Vinyl look up in alarm, the smile on her face growing even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds... adequate.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis mare really did have a lot of money. You wondered why she was still sharing a house and didn\u2019t just buy one of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, perfect! Well, if you\u2019d like to get started on Vinyl\u2019s room. I just need to pop into town to grab something for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\nBefore leaving she leans in and whispers to you; \u201cKeep an eye on her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she leaves you and Vinyl alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! It worked! I knew Tavi was loaded but 200 a day!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be nice having some money. As long as you let Twilight delay your starting date, there\u2019s no reason why this can\u2019t work out rather nicely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you remember that you need to actually clean up Vinyl\u2019s room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pry open her door and step inside, it\u2019s immediately apparent that Octavia wasn\u2019t at all exaggerating; the place is a pig sty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirty laundry and empty food wrappers are strewn carelessly across the floor, so much so that you can barely see the surface of the floor itself. The bed sheets are stained and randomly scrunched up over the mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a single pony could let their room get to such a state, but considering you\u2019re getting paid, you grin and bear it and get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s laborious work, and even after twenty minutes you\u2019ve hardly made a dent in the clutter. You\u2019re roused by a knock at the door, peering into the lounge and noticing Vinyl has her headphones on, lounging lazily on the sofa with one arm draped over the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to wonder why she\u2019s even getting 50% of the take, but it doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s going to even hear the door, and you go to answer it yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh... food delivery?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the door\u2019s open, Vinyl finally looks round and pulls her headphones off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! My burritos are here!\u201d She pushes past you and grabs the paper bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can cover the cost, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble under your breath and gather every bit you have on you, handing them over and closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis mare is really starting to get on your nerves; you agreed to go along with her little plan and so far she\u2019s being a total slob while you clean up her room for her. You wonder if the money is even worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the day not getting any younger, you decide it\u2019s best to return to cleaning. You\u2019ve already filled three black bags with trash and you\u2019re not even halfway there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you start to get into the hang of cleaning up and it seems to go by marginally faster. <i>Twilight</i> wouldn\u2019t have you doing anything as demeaning as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re almost finished, deciding to finish with cleaning the dirty wood-panelled floor, down on your knees and scrubbing the surface as well as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl trots over and you look up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019ve been baking something up for you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh. Maybe you misjudged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can thank her, she swivels around - about as swiftly as you\u2019ve seen her move this entire time - and reaches a hoof back to push your head into her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>FRAAAARRPPP</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lays a hot, awful-smelling fart on your muzzle and lets you free, laughing to herself like it\u2019s the funniest thing she\u2019s ever done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your nose, feeling the putrid gas right in the back of your throat. You\u2019ve gone from being annoyed by this mare to <i>hating</i> her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew! Burrito toots are always the smelliest!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trots back into the main room, leaving you with the cloud of stink to clean the rest of her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just finish up your job, silently cursing her in your head as you do so. It\u2019s strangely motivating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after you\u2019re finished, the door opens and Octavia arrives home, pausing as she passes by Vinyl\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, wow! You\u2019ve really done a number on this room! Oh, I hardly recognize it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. It wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind you, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be back to how it was in a matter of days, but thanks all the same. I\u2019m glad we hired you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re a little impressed you made such good work of such a messy room, but it\u2019s left you exhausted, and you sense Octavia can see this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I completely forgot to mention your sleeping arrangements. We have a spare room. It\u2019s rather small, but cosy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you to it; it\u2019s not much bigger than a closet, but the bed inside is very comfortable, and you\u2019re certainly not planning to stay here long at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hover around for the rest of the evening, occasionally picking up little pieces of trash or cleaning surfaces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia is even kind enough to feed you, but Vinyl Scratch doesn\u2019t get any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the entire evening she continuously passes gas casually and nonchalantly. It\u2019s as if she doesn\u2019t even understand the concept of manners. Octavia steps in to voice her resentment of it every time it happens, though this doesn\u2019t seem to get through to Vinyl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, at the end of the evening she announces she needs to <i>\u201cgo take a monster dump\u201d</i> and marches upstairs to the bathroom, as if it\u2019s some important event everypony must be aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia gives you your money as promised. It\u2019s a bit weird being paid by the day, but you\u2019re not complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long and irritating day, you find yourself in your temporary bed and restless. You\u2019re tired, but you just can\u2019t settle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot able to put up with things any longer, you decide to... </span></div></div>",

This was the kind of pony who needed to be brought down a peg every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your envelope stuffed into your satchel, you creep out into the main lounge. The house is still and all you can hear is obnoxious snoring coming from one of the rooms. You assume it\u2019s Vinyl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re not sure exactly <i>how</i> to get back at her. You pause for a moment and try to conjure something up. This mare doesn\u2019t even care about anything, so what could you possibly do to ruffle her feathers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember the sheer amount of clutter you tidied up in her room earlier; most of it was trash, but there were some assorted electronics and DJ equipment. Maybe you could swipe something and sell it on. She probably wouldn\u2019t miss it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s risky, and for a moment you consider just leaving now and never returning to this place, but there would be some satisfaction in knowing you\u2019d had the last laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your footfalls as silent as possible and head towards her room. The door is already half open so you slowly push your way inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprise surprise - it <i>is</i> her snoring so loudly. She\u2019s sprawled out over her bed, bedsheets basically halfway off the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room smells pretty funky, too. A humid stench of body odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mess has already started to return, too. You don\u2019t see how this could be possible but... whatever. You\u2019re here for only one thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the pile of music equipment is on the other side of her bed. Great. You can\u2019t just walk up to it and swipe something, you\u2019re going to have to lean over her to get it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and wipe your brow. Once you\u2019ve got this, you can get the hell out and never look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to quietly bend and stretch over Vinyl\u2019s sleeping self, keeping your breath held as you stretch your arms out as far as they\u2019ll go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peer down at her, laying on her stomach. She even looks like a slob when she sleeps, a little pool of drool accumulating around her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see a microphone that looks like it could be worth something. It\u2019s probably the lightest and easiest to carry thing there, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach out a little closer... closer... until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>brrrrrppp</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slovenly mare lets out a wet, rumbling fart in her sleep, and directly into your face, using her tail to waft it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt smells even worse than the one she made you smell earlier. All the food from the day settled in her stomach in one disgustingly sour cocktail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt affects your concentration and makes it much harder to stay in your poised position, but you manage to, and grab the microphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! You begin to bring it back towards you, making sure you\u2019re still hovering over the sleeping pony, and then...</span></div></div>",

You drop the microphone and crease up, falling straight forward on top of Vinyl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re able to look up for a second and see a sinister smile before she grabs her unkempt bedsheet and pulls it over the both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou little fucking thief!\u201d She calls out, still monitoring her voice so Octavia doesn\u2019t hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really have no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you were up to something, so I pretended to be asleep when I heard you come in. Pretty good acting, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can barely even take in what she\u2019s saying to you, still reeling from the sharp pain in your side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot only were you going to steal from me, you were going to make a dash for it with all the money! What happened to our agreement?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s a rush of movement and a flash of light and somehow you find yourself laying on your back with Vinyl\u2019s legs either side of your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see she\u2019s straddling your upper chest, leaning back so her nethers are directly in your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to teach you a lesson, thief.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even utter a word she blasts another repulsive fart into your face. The toxic fumes are like poison, making you cough loudly as you try to rid your nose and mouth of the appalling odor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m gonna have fun with you.\u201d She snickers to herself. You feel like calling out to Octavia in the hopes she might hear you and come to your rescue, but you don\u2019t even want to imagine what Vinyl would do to you in that case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering up you can make out her fierce eyes through her messy hair in the dim light of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seems to be something... shiny... a strand of something, but before you can think about it too much you find out what it is: a wad of saliva that splatters into your face. It reeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make you hurt.\u201d She says again. You don\u2019t doubt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain is a rush of emotions and panic as the mare forces out yet another fart into your face, this one sounds wet in the most horrible way possible, bubbling moistly from her asshole and covering your face in a thick hot fog that smells like all the awful junk food she\u2019s digested throughout the day fermented and churned in that belly of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like that? Brewed specially for you.\u201d She snickers again, rocking herself back and forward and leaving a film of sweat and mucus from her pussy and ass all over your upper torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell has already made you lightheaded and oxygen deprived, the room spinning around you with her face still smiling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans down, head getting closer and closer to you and brings up a wet belch to blow right into your nostrils. It\u2019s much sharper than the smell of her farts, and brings you to involuntarily gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood one.\u201d She says under her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder exactly how much more of this you can take. The air in her room is already heavy and humid, so even if you didn\u2019t have farts and burps flooding your nostrils, you still wouldn\u2019t have much air to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notices you\u2019re just on the brink of passing out, and of course she doesn\u2019t want her torment to be cut so short, so gets off you and off her bed. You hear her rummaging through her drawer, but you\u2019re far too dazed and in pain to try and see what she\u2019s doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer soon comes to you in the form of a prick in your side, which causes you to sit up immediately and scream, though just as you\u2019re about to scream, she covers your mouth with her hoof. You look down and notice in her other hoof she\u2019s carrying a small knife to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down. I\u2019m not gonna kill you.\" There's a pause. \"Well... not unless you try something stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia, now she's literally threatening you with a weapon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't hurt me.\" You manage, as if that would have any influence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just grins. \"I won't, as long as you do what I say, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, still dizzy and in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove it. Sniff this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect her to flash her flank at you and blast you with another fart, but instead she raises the arm not wielding the knife and reveals the matted jungle of hair under her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't exactly need to get any closer to sniff it, as the tart odor already reaches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on. I won't ask again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe points the knife at you in a jabbing motion, and you realize you should probably just do it. It's hardly any less humiliating than what she's already subjected you to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling yourself shaking, you lean in closer, aiming your muzzle towards her armpit and inhaling as softly as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on! That's not a sniff! I want to hear you snort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold back tears and do as she says, drawing in a violent, audible snorting sniff. Instantly you gag as the vile sweat-laden aroma fills the back of your throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reel back and start coughing uncontrollably, which only seems to bring a wider smile to Vinyl's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now lick it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeary-eyed, you look back up at her desperately. It's not even worth trying to put it off. Maybe there'll be some chance to tackle her and get the knife, but right now that isn't going to happen. You have to submit to her whims or you have no doubt she'll cut you. Maybe even kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring your head back towards the bush under her arm, extending your tongue and touching it to the hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Lick it! Get it nice and clean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's clear she won't accept any feeble attempts, and try to shut off your brain as you lap at the greasy, salty, bitter unwashed hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now suck on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lump in your throat only gets heavier as you follow her command. There's no way to stop the dry heaving as you suckle on the sweat-drenched bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what is probably five seconds but feels like five years, she lets you stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now I know you can be trusted.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your stomach lurch as you realize there's at least one piece of hair stuck between your teeth. It's hard to not throw up, but that would probably just anger her more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Now we're gonna make things a little more interesting, thief. Nice and slowly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestures you to get up from her bed and you do so, still holding the knife mere inches from your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lead. We're going to....\"</span></div></div>",

The idea of that really makes you shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. I could do with a nice relaxing bathe. Go run it.\" She aggressively points to the tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn on the faucets and begin to draw the bath, watching as she climbs inside, sprawled out, and tells you to get in the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not a particularly huge bathtub, so it's not exactly easy for the two of you to fit inside, but Vinyl doesn't care. She reclines back against the wall, letting out a sigh as the warm water slowly fills around you both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're startled by a wet, quacking fart you didn't expect, which brattles against the bottom of the bathtub, half covered in water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smell it.\" She instructs, stretching her hind legs up around your neck and drawing your face closer towards her groin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell is hard to ignore, and seems to only be amplified by the steamy humidity of the bath water. It's the same repugnant stench of what can only be compared to eggs and soggy, steamed cabbage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Here comes another!\" She announces, before bracing herself against the sides of the bath and letting a long, noisy fart bubble in the water which is lapping against her plothole, creating a horrible muddy kind of sound that only makes things more repulsive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water continues to rise steadily, and you begin to realise she doesn't seem to be relaxing her grip around your neck anytime soon. As the water gets closer and closer to submerging your head, she simply looks down at you and says, \"Hope you can hold your breath long enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snickers. \"Don't worry. You've got my special supply of <i>oxygen</i> to keep you alive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, her legs pull you in closer, dunking your head beneath the water and stuffing it firmly between her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to panic, realising you can't hold your breath for very long and she has no intention of letting you go anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of you her asshole opens and spews out a stream of glistening bubbles of fart gas, which ripple up past your head and break on the surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour desperation for air growing, your instincts kick in, and despite everything you lunge your head forward, pursing your lips tightly around Vinyl's anus and trying as hard as possible to breathe in the toxic fumes escaping from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your mouth fill slowly with a hot outflux of methane. Your initial urge is to gag and spit it out, but you know this is your only hope, and gently try to breathe it into your lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems to work, but it's anything but pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel her stench fill your lungs, and while it's no substitute for oxygen, it seems to satisfy your need temporarily, though it leaves you significantly more lightheaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suck down the last few seconds of the fart she's dispensing - under any other circumstance you'd probably be impressed at how long it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting your head away as far as Vinyl's tight grip around you allows, you breathe the gas back out, watching it bubble up as her farts had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a second, though, you feel her hoof reach down and push your head back so you're against her. You once again seal your lips around her pucker and await the next release of gas, which comes after only a few seconds in the form of four or five disconnected bursts that reverberate around inside your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to breathe it in, and then breathe out again. You're not sure how long you can realistically keep doing this, but it seems to be keeping you from drowning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste is beyond appalling, though. It's no surprise that her farts taste almost as bad as they smell, and your entire mouth and throat are covered in the flavor which you doubt you will ever truly get rid of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrowsy and barely holding on, you desperately breathe in the four second fart Vinyl pumps into your mouth, feeling your lungs shudder at the fumes you're giving them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this one, though, Vinyl finally releases her legs from around your neck and lets you bob up to the surface, spluttering and breathing quickly and hungrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad! Kinda thought you'd pass out after breathing in the first one.\" She smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to take a moment to recover from the ordeal. You were still dizzy, and the taste was still singed into your tastebuds, but at least you could breathe again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I'm feeling generous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did such a good job down there I'll spare you my bowel movements... for now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're too disoriented to really give any kind of response, merely glaring at her as she climbs out of the tub, sending one last fart your way and giggling to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go wait downstairs while I take care of business.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a sudden knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vinyl? You in there? I was going to brush my teeth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn gestures at you to keep quiet, once again grabbing the knife and holding it in your direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Gonna be a while, though, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia grumbles from the other side of the door. \"Fine. I'm going to my cello lesson. I'll be back by noon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting to hear the front door close, Vinyl tells you you can go and wait downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Order some food for me, would you? I have a feeling after I drop this load I'm gonna have plenty of room for more.\" She sits up on the toilet bowl and blasts a long, wet fart into it. You take that as a cue to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crash down onto the sofa, taking a moment to try and recoup and catch your breath. This mare is completely insane. You curse yourself for ever trying to steal from her. Maybe this is all somehow karma, though you know she would have deserved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding there's no point trying to escape, and finding you don't even have the energy to bother, you head over to the table beside the front door and pick up a stack of fast food flyers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Vinyl?\" You call up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnng. Yeah?\" She calls back, her voice strained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What food do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. All of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>All of it</i>? You shrug, telling yourself that if you do what she says, she's more likely to let you go at some point... hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou call up all the places advertised on the flyers, listing off a hooffull of items from each one, and then take another moment to rest. You're almost certain once Vinyl is finished upstairs she'll find some other way to further humiliate and torture you, so having even a minute of rest is much-needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about fifteen minutes, the first order of food arrives, and you pay from the money Octavia had given you. You find yourself not even caring, and just wanting to get things over with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the rest of the food arrives, and conveniently Vinyl seems to finish up and head downstairs at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! You're gonna wanna leave that for at least 24 hours. I really put that thing through its paces.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spots the ungodly heap of fast food on the table and her eyes light up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww yeah! I'm<i> starving</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in silence as Vinyl trots over and picks up a burrito, unwrapping it and stuffing it in her maw, chewing without any semblance of manners. You notice she's still brandishing the knife in your direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna take me a few hours to get through all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wouldn't believe a single pony could possibly manage <i>this</i> much food in one sitting, but you somehow feel Vinyl Scratch is just disgusting enough to try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits down on the couch next to you, stretching out and finishing the burrito in just a few seconds, letting out a dry belch and grabbing for something else, but she pauses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Don't think I'm letting you just sit there being lazy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere it comes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you're not eating even a bite of any of this, but how about you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a knife to your back, you reluctantly do as you\u2019re told and head to the kitchen. Once you arrive, the knife pokes lightly against your skin, and you stiffen. \u201cWell?\u201d the unicorn says expectantly. \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, make me some breakfast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s still dark out, but sunrise is approaching. You know Octavia will be waking up in an hour or two to get ready for work, so you calm your nerves by telling yourself that she\u2019ll help free you from this insane mare soon enough. In the meantime, you comply with her request, and open the fridge. Inside you spot a carton of eggs and fresh veggies, and elect to make a simple omelette. Vinyl doesn\u2019t appear to take issue with that choice, saying nothing as she follows you all around the room, ensuring the blade stays at your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the meal is finished, you set it on the table and look back at Vinyl. She raises a brow, \u201cMan, you\u2019re a worse servant than I thought. Pull the chair out for me, servant!\u201d She commands haughtily. You grumble with indignance but do as you\u2019re told, and finally feel the knife leave your back as the pony plops her pert plot down onto the chair, looking satisfied. \u201cAnd get me some milk\u2014 and fetch me the salsa!\u201d she orders rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the fridge, and pour her a glass of milk before locating a jar of salsa, which is labeled as \u2018extra spicy\u2019. You set both items in front of her, and she happily begins to tear into the meal. She eats with about as much grace as you\u2019d expect: zero. You watch her messily gobble up the meal you prepared in remarkably short time, then pats her now-full belly. \u201cAh... cruddy hospitality aside, you\u2019re not a bad cook .\u201d She comments as rises from her seat. You say nothing in response, refusing to accept the remark as a compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl doesn\u2019t seem to mind your silence, but returns to her position behind you, once again ghosting her blade along your back. You tense up instantly, heart pounding. Of course, it was wishful thinking to have thought that would be all she\u2019d make you do, but you had still hoped. \u201cRight, let\u2019s go to the living room. I gotta catch up on my shows.\u201d She says, and you do as you\u2019re told, exiting the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the mare\u2019s stomach gurgles. \u201cOoh... I love spicy food, but it doesn\u2019t seem to love me!\u201d Vinyl says. You find it hard to believe the food has already gone through her, but the gurgling is hard to argue. \u201cGood thing I\u2019ve got you here, though! Octavia\u2019s always giving me flack for stinking up the place, so you\u2019re gonna make sure that doesn\u2019t happen by being my personal fart filter.\u201d The vile pony proclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory of her previous farts immediately comes to mind, and fear shoots through you. \u201cLike hell I am!\u201d You cry defiantly. Almost immediately, pressure is applied to the blade against your back, pushing it painfully against your flesh and threatening to break it. \u201cWell, I guess I could call the cops and turn you in for trying to rob me, maybe embellish it a little and say you tried to assault me, if you\u2019d rather that option...\u201d Vinyl threatens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you briefly consider it, but sigh in defeat and resign yourself to your fate. \u201cWhat do you want me to do...?\u201d You mumble begrudgingly, and you can feel the mare\u2019s satisfied smirk over your shoulder. \u201cGet on the floor and lay with your head face-up on the cushion.\u201d She instructs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying goodbye to your dignity, you do as you\u2019re told and sit on the ground in front of the couch, head on the cushion behind you. The sight of her perky, white plot filling your field of vision has fear washing over you. She\u2019s got you completely at her mercy, and settles onto your face roughly, legs straddling your head as she picks up the television remote and casually flips through the channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of her ass is already not pleasant, unsurprisingly for a pony with such poor hygiene. It reeks strongly of musk and sweat, and your muzzle is seemingly the perfect fit to slide right into the horrible cavern of her crack. She simply sits for a good ten minutes, stomach bubbling and groaning ominously. After a bit, she begins to shift, wiggling atop you and positioning herself so that her disgusting asshole now makes full contact with your poor muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you\u2019re ready down there!\u201d Your tormentor smirks down at you below her. The puffy button of her anus pulses against your muzzle, each flex of the rubbery muscle filling you with dread. After sufficiently teasing you for a good minute, the bud on your nostrils opens up and unleashes all hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBBBBBBBZZZZZZZZZZRRRRRRRRRRRRR<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl\u2019s fart buzzes harshly against your muzzle in an embarrassingly bassy noise, buffered by your pinned nose. You can\u2019t really focus on that aspect however, as the smell is immediately funneled up your nostrils. This fart is perhaps the most repulsive yet, smelling heavily eggy with a hint of rotten vegetables. Despite your best efforts, you thrash and buck instinctively as your entire head is pumped with the reeking gas. She only laughs and bares down harder on your face, wiggling her hips and effectively rubbing your poor nose in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, that was a weak one, too.\u201d She cackles obnoxiously. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to do better than that, slave! I can still smell that!\u201d Vinyl complains when the eggy reek reaches her. Biting her lip and clutching her tummy, she pushes another raunchy blast of methane, injected directly up your nostrils. You buck and thrash as she fumigated the interior of your head with her reek, but she simply holds you in place, allowing you to go nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVinyl...?\u201d You both hear a voice from down the hall\u2014 Octavia\u2019s. Panicked, the mare perched on your face grabs a blanket hanging on the back of the couch and drapes it over her lap, effectively covering you up. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare move a muscle.\u201d She whispers, flexing her sphincter over your nose threateningly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh. You're up early.\" You hear Octavia's more refined accent coming from somewhere in the kitchen. She clearly hasn't noticed the fact you're pinned beneath Vinyl Scratch, and while you could probably alert her, you know Vinyl will only make your situation worse if you try anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Just woke up and felt like having some grub.\" The unicorn answers, still balancing on your face and pinching the tip of your muzzle with her tight, sweaty plothole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. The only reason you'd ever be awake at an hour like this.\" Octavia yawned, preparing a cup of coffee for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl rested against the back of the sofa, pulling the heavy blanket up around her abdomen so you were concealed completely, reaching her hoof down to reintroduce the knife against your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Where's that cleaner... Peppermint?\" She asked sleepily, taking a sip of coffee and coming in to the lounge where Vinyl was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure.\" The unicorn feigned ignorance. \"Something about catching the market before it got too busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia bought her improvised lie. \"Well, I have a cello lesson in a few minutes. I hope you'll be able to keep the house from becoming a bombsite until Peppermint returns.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh. You have so little faith in me, Tavi!\" She grinned. You could tell the omlette and salsa were working - or rather not working - through her digestive tract; whining gargles and rumbles coming from her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe readjusted her plot over your face, distributing her weight to her right cheek, and, to your shock, silently eased out a hissing fart against your nose; a slow, sultry, concentrated stream of gas brushing against your muzzle and filtering into the only space it could find to occupy: your nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour teeth gritted together and the back of your nose burned as if you'd just poured acid into it; a painfully raw feeling that seemed to spread all the way down the back of your throat. The overwhelming stench of sulfur and rancid veggies filled your entire self. You couldn't cough, or retch, or gag, and you certainly couldn't struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuppressing the instinctive urge to even let out a piteous moan, you just sat in silence and let the smell wash over you, every breath only bringing more of the pungent fumes into your lungs and seeming to never lessen in intensity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the kind of torture you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. There had to be some way of alerting Octavia to your presence without making a sound, but the more you tried to find one, the more hopeless the situation seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear Octavia get up from the other couch and head back towards the door. You started to panic, realizing your chance to be rescued was about to disappear completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted again as Vinyl's anus distended out, opened up, and laid a wet, rumbly fart onto your face, barely even shifting her weight to let it out freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vinyl!\" Octavia called out, disgusted, but the unicorn merely laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Scuse me.\" She chuckled, but once the smell hit your senses it was impossible to focus on anything other than it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears welled in your eyes, stinging as if you'd just cut up a batch of onions, and the need to gag was harder and harder to subdue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! That one was ripe!\" Vinyl called out, still laughing at how much it seemed to make Octavia squirm. You couldn't believe even a particle of this gas could possibly have gone anywhere other than under the blanket and in your nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll take that as my cue to leave. Just don't do...<i> that</i>... on any of my cushions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you hear the door open and shut, and almost immediately Vinyl lifts the blanket up and off of you again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed. Such a stinky fart and you still kept your cool.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Octavia had left the house entirely, it was as if any attempt to hold back or be quiet had vanished, and Vinyl pushed yet another fart out against your face, this one dribbling out with little force, as if your face planted between her cheeks was stopping the flow from coming out any faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a wet, warm sensation cover your face, flowing up into your nostrils again and hitting you with another wave of the appalling methane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh... that one felt <i>wet</i>!\" She announced, proudly, and shuffled herself around over your head, wiping her leathery, sweat-covered perineum across your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head was throbbing, one side of it aching from lack of oxygen. Maybe if you were lucky, you'd pass out shortly and not have to endure this torture any more. You realized, though, that even if that happened, as soon as you re-awoke Vinyl's plot would be staring you in the face and ready to administer more gas. There was really no way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta say, you're a good fart cushion. Wouldn't be surprised if you were one of those freaks who <i>enjoyed</i> this.\" She goaded, a smug grin fitted firmly in place on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was anyone deriving any sort of pleasure from this, it certainly wasn't you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say those eggs agree with me, though.\" She grunts, and effortlessly plants another wet stink bomb directly onto your face. \"Suck that one down, <i>fart slut</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no choice. The only alternative is to not breathe at all, and while that sounds preferable, you know Vinyl will follow through on her threat of violence if you disobey her orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling on some music channel on TV, the unicorn pulled herself off of your face, laying down on her side lengthwise along the sofa, then patting her plump buttocks to tell you to get your face closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon.\" She pressed when you paused, still in shock, \"I got a really nasty one brewing. Don't think I can hold it much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like you were on the verge of tears, you tried to tune out the nausea and disgust and turned your head around so that it was lying on the couch cushion and facing her unwashed white butt. It was scary how even looking at it sent a shiver of fear through every corner of your body; knowing that it could go off any second and the resulting smell would only mean another surge of sickness and pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs seemed to wrap around your neck like a snake pulling you closer into her trap. She reached a hoof back and grabbed hold of one of her doughy cheeks, her stomach tensing up as she pushed another cluster of gas through her system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slow, droning fart purred through her cheeks, making them almost vibrate slightly, and she squeezed the two fat-pillows together with her hoof, tonally shifting the long, rumbling fart into a low, wet sputter. Applying more force, she grabbed the asscheek and folded it out, once again modulating the timbre of her release to be louder and brighter; bursting out like a trumpet and sending a hot, stale wind gusting against your face. This change in sound seemed to amuse her, and she jiggled her asscheeks together rhythmically, creating a wet, sporadic, choking sound that only made her laugh more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flow of gas ceased and she sighed, mouth open and tongue lolling out. \"Much better.\" She told herself, her voice drenched in satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the smell had gotten no easier to sniff down, still eliciting a potent desire to vomit, but you had to hold it down. You didn't even want to imagine what would happen if you ended up throwing up all over her. She'd probably kill you on the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Vinyl's voice calling down to you, stirring you from the dizzy haze you now laid in, and though it took a second to really comprehend what she was saying, you heard...</span></div></div>",

She doesn\u2019t even have to use the knife anymore\u2014 you\u2019re so dizzy from oxygen deprivation and the stench of the farts forced up your nostrils you simply stumble along behind her. Even still, she makes sure to bring the weapon along, just in case your fight returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re back in her room now. As your senses begin to stabilize, you can see you\u2019re standing before her DJ equipment. She plops down onto a stool in the midst of it all and starts adjusting some dials. You stand to the side awkwardly, unsure what you\u2019re supposed to be doing, and growing more anxious by the moment. After a few moments pass, Vinyl finally speaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna help me with my newest track,\u201d she explains. \u201cI knew it was missing something... and i think you\u2019re just the thing to give it those final touches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t like where this was going already. She was going to fart on you, and use it in one of her tracks? That she played for other ponies? This mare was truly sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiggles her perky plot down on the stool, and points down behind her. \u201cWell? Get in position.\u201d The unicorn demands. Swallowing what remaining dignity you had left, you do as she says, and get on your knees in front of her ass, kneeling as if before a deity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA microphone comes into view. Vinyl is adjusting it so that it\u2019s just a few inches from her ass and your face. After she\u2019s satisfied with its position, she lifts he ass up off the stool, sticking it out towards you. The thing terrorizing you more than anything else is once again staring you in the face\u2014 her anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart fills with dread as you feel the hoof on the back of your head pushing you in closer, and closer. You squeeze your eyes shut, as if not seeing it will make it go away. Alas, you know it doesn\u2019t work, as you can both smell and feel the greasy ring now resting on your lips. It\u2019s a truly sickening feeling\u2014 rubbery and filthy\u2014 that you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever be able to forget<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d The unicorn demands. It takes every ounce of willpower to force yourself to comply. Confirming your fears, Vinyl positions her rosebud right over your open maw. The stink of her raw asshole alone is enough to revolt your tastebuds, and you wonder how any mare can be this foul. Did she even bathe? You\u2019re starting to doubt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold back your vomit with all of you strength when you feel her raw asshole pucker in and out inside your mouth. The puckered flesh bumps against your teeth as it distends, then pulls back as she relaxes. After a few flexes, she tenses up. \u201cHere comes! Keep your cheeks nice and loose for me, ok? Wanna be sure and capture that reverb.\u201d The unicorn sounds excited. You can merely whimper, the weapon about to go off right inside your maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it happens: She rips a solid 6-second fart into your muzzle. You tense up beneath her, and your cheeks instantly inflate with the stinking gas, the sound deep and bassy in your muzzle. The force of the blast shakes your entire head, rattling your skull. The first thing you notice is how hot the gas feels. It\u2019s uncomfortably warm, heating up the interior of your mouth, stench lacing with your tastebuds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste is the most rancid thing you\u2019ve ever tasted. It\u2019s what you imagine rotten eggs tasting like, if you had ever eaten a rotten egg. But by far the worst part was that despite it being blown into your mouth, you can still smell it, as if her rectal perfume had been injected directly into your sinuses. You squint your teary eyes, pain splitting through you as your nose and throat are callously burned from the inside out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer puffy asshole injects another brain-numbing fart down your irritated throat. The sound of this one is obscenely wet inside your mouth, sounding like the epitome of a pony who just shit herself. It is picked up by the microphone, and the indecent expulsion loudly sputters from her professional-quality speakers, made bassier by the curvature of your mouth. It\u2019s just about the most humiliating noise you can imagine being on the receiving end of, and here it is, echoing down your insides. It\u2019s followed up by an equally wet, sickening sound. A vile mist of ass slime and shit spritzes across your palate, and you instinctively flail like a dying animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare is surprisingly stronger than she looks, and easily keeps you pinned under her ass. She wiggles her butt cutely. You feel her sphincter pulse and twitch inside your mouth, the greasy flesh expanding and bumping against your teeth. The feeling makes you flinch, terrified that every moment will be the last before you\u2019re force-fed more gas. You know it\u2019s coming, you just don\u2019t know when.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nssssssssssssssSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSssssssssssssssssss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it comes. This one wasn\u2019t going to be making it into the track, as it\u2019s silent save for a violent hiss that only you can hear. It\u2019s the equivalent of swallowing a fireball, if fireballs reeked of digested omelette. Vinyl\u2019s anus heats up to the point the mare actually winces in pain as she forces this miasma out. The fart dries out your entire mouth and brutalizes your already sore throat. And it just keeps going\u2014 like a never ending gas leak, her red-hot anus pumps what feels like gallons of methane into your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seal of your lips around her festering anus is so tight that no gas escapes anywhere but down your throat. Your cheeks over inflate, and dirty fart steam starts to escape from your running nostrils. With seemingly no trace of pity, she laughs upon noticing the way her rectal fog fumes from your nasal cavities. And this fart merely contributes. Your sinuses are packed full to their capacity with this mare\u2019s awful reek, and it\u2019s still not enough, as she continues to pump more intestinal gas into your head, watching with a highly amused smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully, the pony using your mouth as a fart catcher raises up from your face\u2014 by a few inches only, mind you. Fart vapors visibly waft from your ruined maw as you gasp for air that is more oxygen than methane. Your eyes are bloodshot, rolled back into your head and full of tears. You sniffle and snort in a vain attempt to clear her sulpherous emissions from your sinuses. \u201cN-no... no more...\u201d you mumble hoarsely, weakly shaking your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, that stinks!\u201d She exclaims with a giggle and quickly fans the steam rising from your mouth. \u201cYou could use a breath mint... thanks for the help though. I got some pretty sweet samples.\u201d In an act of further indignity, she presses her hoof to a button, and a replay of all the farts injected into your muzzle play back-to-back. In a few of them, the sound of your pitiful whimpers can be heard in the background. Vinyl notices them as well, but acknowledges them by remarking that she thinks they really \u201cadd to the composition\u201d, whatever that means. You can\u2019t truly imagine it adds to anything other than your furthered humiliation.</span></div></div>",

Shit. There really is no way to explain this away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd prefer if you didn't make a scene. I doubt Vinyl would be any happier with what you've done than I am. You can try to run, if you want, but I've already told the guards around Ponyville to be on the lookout for you. I knew it was a matter of time before you tried something like this. I thought you'd be a little more intelligent than to do it on the first night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're speechless. She really has left you cornered. You can forget your position working with Twilight. You're effectively a fugitive now, though she could of course just be bluffing. How would she know you were going to do this when you yourself only though it up moments ago? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, if she isn't, you won't get far, and being thrown into jail doesn't seem like a much more preferable option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd come up to my room, we can discuss what's going to happen next. I wouldn't want to wake Vinyl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one last second to see if you can spot one last escape plan, you give in and head up the stairs shamefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe follows you into her room and closes the door behind you both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the polar opposite of Vinyl's bedoom; clean, spacious, well-aired. It almost looks like an entirely different house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we can work something out. I don't think I should have to turn you in to the authorities, but in return, of course, you're going to have to do something for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on, you'll be working up here as my personal servant. No pay. As far as Vinyl will be aware, you will have left early. You stay up here, serve me whenever and however I want, and if you make any attempt to escape or tell Vinyl; If you try to form some little scheme, then I will have you thrown in jail. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure what you even have left to say. She really has covered everything. You're helpless.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She curls over as the spurts become a longer stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fillies gasp and sigh exasperatedly, the air high with both the sound of fresh scat sliding along the surface of their sphincters and the smell of their combined dung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood Celestia, it is not a pleasant smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs ripe as manure comes; a smell so sour and disagreeing you have to cover your muzzle with your hoof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a glance over your shoulder to check there's nopony around, though really you don't expect there ever would be this far out into the orchard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just... <i>ugh</i>.... keeps ....<i> mmmhff</i>... coming!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah think I g-got the last of it!\" Apple Bloom announces, finishing off her bundle with a big thick coil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that Scootaloo's onslaught of mud seems to stop coming too, though Sweetie Belle is seemingly not running out any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends seem to notice this, too; turning to admire the still-constant stream of splattering peanut-brown excrement piling on to the growing mound behind her that spreads out across the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

This feels a little inappropriate to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if that's not questionable enough, Scootaloo and Apple Bloom sidle up behind her, one on each side, and each spread one of her small filly cheeks out away from her asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seems to increase the pressure of the shit jet pouring out of her. She trembles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... won't stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! Keep up like this and your poop pile will reach the clubhouse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey don't seem phased one bit by the little speckles of brown that splatter onto their faces this close to the splash zone.<br>\r\nThe smell so close must be absolutely abhorrent, but neither filly seems to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this just how ponies are in small towns? Is this what rural life does to them? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stream dies down to a trickle, but surprisingly starts right back up again, fuelled by a wet slobbering fart that blasts Apple Bloom and Scootaloo with a mist of shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww! Hey, Sweetie Belle! You blew poop all over us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll take forever to get outta my coat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry, girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This</i> is what it takes to make them disgusted?

I already told y\u2019all I can drink cider \u2018till the cows come home!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe circle breaks slightly, and you see that this southern-tinged voice is coming from a mare! An orange mare with a plaited mane and a large brown cowboy hat, wiping the residue of a glass of cider from her lips, looking around eagerly for a stallion to step up to the challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re quite surprised to see a mare out-drink such burly, largely-built colts and Stallions, but she seems to be pretty unmatched so far. You did always have a knack at drink-offs yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow wasn\u2019t the time to be distracted by hoydenish cowgirls, though, or was it? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Y'all can't seriously be too scared to drink a mare under the table!\" She laughs loudly, another two rounds of cider being placed down onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe searches around the crowd for an appropriate opponent, before, of course, she settles on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! Ya look like you can hold down a few pints!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, while every other stallion's eyes attach onto you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>C'mooon</i>, I'm payin' fer it today, but you'll be payin' fer it tomorrow.\" She chuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure's already too much to turn down her challenge, and she seems like she's already been drinking for a while, so surely it can't be too hard to out-drink her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a seat opposite her, the stallions surrounding you whispering and gasping amongst themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so here's how it's gonna work - Down the glass, in one gulp, and whoever falls down first loses. Right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eye up the two foaming pint glasses in front of you. This is such a stupid idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three! Two! One!\" The orange mare counts you in, and then she's off, her head tilted back and her throat surging as she gulps down the cider. You quickly join her in downing a glass of it yourself, if you weren't having to swallow it down at such a pace you'd remark it was pretty good cider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finishes her glass a few seconds before you, wiping her lip with a satisfied grin. You pull your empty glass away breathlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good cider, huh? Made it maself, y'know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, but before you have even a chance to catch your breath, she's moved onto the second glass, and you join her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's surprisingly quite exhausting, and though you do have a high alcohol tolerance, you're starting to feel a little lightheaded from the lack of oxygen alone. All you can see is the golden-orange beverage drain away from your glass, your vision blurring for a second as you focus entirely on finishing the whole glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slam your glass down onto the table, taking in desperate breaths, all the while the mare opposite you simply sits and smiles, unphased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad at all! Yer doin' better than half these so-called stallions, but it's time for the big guns.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans over and says something to a pony, who head over to the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, a few months back, we had these real special dark apples growin' in the orchard, and I took that opportunity to make some special <i>dark</i> cider. Now, this stuff's pretty strong. Had Big Mac sleepin' like a baby after jus' one glass. Let's see how ya do.\" She winked, and the two large tankards were placed down in front of you, once more there were two glasses each. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you weren't tipsy already, after this you sure would be. The ponies around the table gasped, but Applejack's smug countenance was unchanged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three... Two..... One!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both swung the tankards up to your lips, gulping the cider down. It was immediately obvious that this was much stronger. It was far more bitter than sweet, and with nearly the potency of whiskey, but now you'd gotten this far your pride was setting in. You're not giving in that easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cider was heavy as you swallowed it down your gullet, sitting in your stomach like a rock and making your head lighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both completed your cups, and she seemed impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Yer doin' better than I expected! Nopony's gotten further than this last pint, though. Good luck.\" She grinned as she held the glass in front of her; she looked as if she could quite easily down another five of these if she wanted, but this was it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath, and both began to drink. You were starting to feel the effects of the alcohol take hold of you, but not in a pleasant way. A headache was starting to form, but you power on, every mouthful of dense, dark cider becoming more and more difficult to swallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten seconds.

She must have really left an impression on you. Either that, or you\u2019re more susceptible to alcohol than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a steady canter you\u2019re back out in the street, and spot the orange pony heading across towards the center of town. You pull up just behind her and she looks round, seemingly puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do <i>you</i> want? Don\u2019t tell me you want a <i>rematch</i>. Some folks don\u2019t know when to quit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat <i>do</i> you want? You\u2019re not even sure how to answer now you\u2019re here and have her staring you down, awaiting an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t just walk away like that. You\u2019re... not like most other mares.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn\u2019t respond, her eyes looking you up and down, and finally she smirks, as if she\u2019s caught on to a secret you didn\u2019t even know you were keeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I get it.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cYou <i>liked</i> what I did back there, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? What was she talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Ain\u2019t no shame in it. If you\u2019re gonna get your corn hard form farts, good thing you came across the best farter in Ponyville.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really were lost. She couldn\u2019t be suggesting that you were... attracted to her farts, could she? You felt as if you could be attracted to <i>her</i>, but the raucous wind she seemed to pump out like air, the smell of which you could still feel in the back of your throat, was the least attractive thing about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat <i>is</i> the reason you followed me, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t just let her slip away now, though, and for some reason came out with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Y-Yes. Your flatulence was so... alluring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt awkward to even say, but you couldn\u2019t imagine a situation where it wouldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed again. \u201cAnd Granny Smith always said letting fly the way I do would keep admirers <i>away</i>. I\u2019m Applejack, by the way.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offered you her hoof, and worried for a second she might let something go if you tugged it, reached across and shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re in luck, too. I don\u2019t know what I ate but my belly\u2019s brewin\u2019 up somethin\u2019 fierce.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize the situation you now have yourself in, but you want to see where it\u2019ll go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact, I was going to stop by my friend Rainbow Dash and see if she wanted a contest. If not her, then Pinkie Pie. Those two usually seem to be up for it. We could certainly use an impartial - or partial - judge.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cContest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you for a second. \u201cUh... fart contest. I assumed that was obvious given you just lost one.\u201d She added teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, if you\u2019re more inclined, we could just head back to the farm and I could give you a little one on one session. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s one of your wildest fantasies, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid either of these options even sound preferable? It seemed to come down to being farted on by either one pony or two. Either way, the end result was not too different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we walk and I\u2019ll have a think about it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want. We gotta head in the same direction either way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you headed off in whatever direction that was - you and Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment about how different your day could be going if you hadn\u2019t decided to follow her outside. You\u2019d probably be resting on a comfortable bed in a room upstairs, but you would also be wondering what might have happened had you not followed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow were you going to play along, too? Feign an attraction to farts? If the one she let out earlier was any indication, they wouldn\u2019t be pleasant to inhale willingly, but then perhaps she\u2019d find some triumph in making even someone aroused by farts disgusted by hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat brings you to Ponyville, anyways?\u201d She struck up a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here to work with Twilight Sparkle as an assistant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say. We\u2019re good friends, although - I think you made the right choice. I can\u2019t imagine her gas smellin\u2019 any worse than a bouquet of flowers, or something. Come to think of it, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever even heard her cut the cheese.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you\u2019re not sure how to answer, but the walk across town seems to have passed much more quickly than you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell. Here we are. The fork in the road, so to speak. Do you want to judge a contest or have me all to yourself?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt as if you\u2019d made up your mind, and go with...</span></div></div>",

Well, you know you\u2019ll be getting much closer, but in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re surprised she\u2019s so open to all this, especially seeing as you don\u2019t even know her. You get an impression she might be slightly into farts herself, even if she doesn\u2019t let on that she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue up a hill until you reach a quaint little orchard and an old, red farmhouse in the middle of it. You\u2019re really out in the heart of the country here. It makes sense that a mare like Applejack would live somewhere like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe others are out deliverin\u2019 supplies today, so I can really make the rafters <i>rattle</i>.\u201d She chuckles and leads you into the old barn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost the instant you\u2019re inside, an unrestrained burp escapes her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh. All that walkin\u2019s really made my lunch back up on me. I ain\u2019t feelin\u2019 too great.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can audibly hear her stomach let out a pained sound, and she grits her teeth, rubbing her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what position you wanna get in but get in it now \u2018cos I can\u2019t hold it in much longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panic for a second, not exactly sure what someone who wanted this would do, and quickly head round back of her, just leaning forward, one arm rested on Applejack\u2019s lower back and your face about level with her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a split second after you assume this position, she lets go of the hold she had on her sphincter and a muddy, sputtering fart blasts out in a hot wind like a rip cord being tugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail lifts and tickles your forehead, dusty and dry, while her orifice beneath spews the warm stream of air forward, and it really can be described as a stream; it sustains for probably a few seconds before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell is the same as earlier, only <b>much</b> more potent. It\u2019s like hot rubber and fresh manure all with a sickly eggy undertone, and it takes all your strength to not gag immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew! Boy, I needed that!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd again, another fart rips and roars around your face; you can tell by the sound and the airstream that there was very little effort expended to discharge this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell stings your nose again, making your stomach lurch and your head light and dizzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out a hearty grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be shy! Get in there!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word of warning, the pony backs up until you feel yourself against a wall, forced into a sitting position with your face pressed firmly against her yielding posterior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice her cheeks, which seem to be spread either side of your face; when you open your eyes you realise that you really are wedged in tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better, now rate this one!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe effortlessly eases more foul-smelling wind out, only this time your face muffles the sound, but sadly not the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounds bassy and strained as the gas now has far less area to be released into, instead you feel it squeeze across your cheeks, slightly ticklish, and of course occupying the only available space besides that - your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack doesn\u2019t seem to be so pleased with the vastly reduced tone of her odious emission and pushes harder, causing the smelly jet of wind to push out more viciously so much so that there\u2019s a louder sound coming from the air pushing between your face cheeks and her ass cheeks than there is from her actual anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stops suddenly and she lets out a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s kinda hard to push these out with your face in the way.\u201d She breathlessly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recall times in the past where you\u2019ve rode past a field full of manure; that sour, sharp, ripe smell that made you cover your nose. Applejack\u2019s farts smell like you\u2019ve had your head dunked in a large trough filled with that exact manure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLemme do it into your mouth.\u201d She demands, and for some reason you accept, opening wide and sitting up slightly so your mouth covers her anus, sealing it on all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive stamina you got there!\u201d<br>\r\nShe calls back, before demonstrating her own stamina and straining out even more gas; this pony is like a machine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the fart reverberate around your mouth, rumbling your cheeks as it trails down along your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound this time is not so much muffled as hollow. Your instinct with a huge stream of gas flooding into your mouth is to tighten up your throat, which seems to only make it sound even more hollow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the gas escape out past your lips, overflowing from the confines of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re not exactly sure how someone could <i>enjoy</i> an experience like this, which makes it even harder to act like you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, there are what sounds like hoofsteps just outside the barn door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock causes Applejack to pump a short staccato fart into your mouth before quickly moving away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApplejack? You in there?\u201d A deep southern drawl comes through from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought he was out!\u201d She whispers to you, clearly alarmed to find you\u2019re not alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear whoever is outside trying the door and she looks round at you as if to tell you to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panic, searching around the barn until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as you duck inside, your visibility is reduced by something blocking the top of the barrel: Applejack\u2019s ass. She was sitting atop the barrel, plugging it up with her perky and extremely smelly rear. In the low light, you can still make out her shapely ass, bisected by her tail and swollen anus. The reeking muscle hangs less than a foot from your face, striking fear deep within you. You gulp thickly, and before you can do anything, you hear the sound of the barn door creaking open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack laughs, strained and suspicious. \u201cBig Mac! Fancy seein\u2019 you here.\u201d She says, immediately wanting to face-hoof at her poor attempt at seeming inconspicuous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion quirks a brow, and Applejack is speaking again before he can reply. \u201cI thought you were taking Granny into town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer hip started actin\u2019 up,\u201d Big Mac replies, walking further into the barn. \u201cSo it\u2019s back to work fer me\u201d. Applejack shifts atop the barrel nervously, \u201cI-I see...\u201d A low grumble sounds from her gut, causing your own to drop. It\u2019s the only warning you receive before her tight plothole parts and blows a bassy growler of a fart into your confined space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShoot!\u201d You hear the stallion exclaim, \u201cYou alright, sis? That sounded nasty.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nasty. The earlier stench of her farts quickly fills the barrel completely, blocked from airing out by the cowpony\u2019s plump posterior. It takes every ounce of self control to not gag as your olfactory system is ravaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I think my lunch didn\u2019t agree with me is all,\u201d Applejack replies with a strained tone. Her pucker twitches before ejecting another blast, quieter than the first but no less potent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, keep sittin\u2019 on that barrel. Yer gas makes the barn smell like a field of roses.\u201d Big Mac was, well, BIG\u2014 but even his farts couldn\u2019t hold a candle to his sister\u2019s. On more than one occasion, the mare had been forced to sleep on the porch to keep from fumigating the entire Apple Family home. Her gas could work as an effective pesticide\u2014 that was, if it didn\u2019t also kill the plant life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow, you felt like you had entered the world\u2019s stinkiest sauna. The heat of her intestines was oppressive, cooking you beneath her ass. \u201cWill do,\u201d Applejack replies with a light chuckle. In her mind, she was giving you what you wanted while also sparing her family the reek of her gas. A win-win scenario. The oblivious mare grunts lightly before ripping another nostril-burner into the barrel, ending with a relieved sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air in the barrel had taken on a yellowish-brown hue, her rancid gas hanging visibly in the air. Your eyes watered, gazing through squinted lids up at Applejack\u2019s anus as it pulses and erupts again, the hot and eggy wind burning your eyes. Your mane was going flat, cooked by the humidity of her guts and no doubt now carrying the sickening stink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac eyed the scene with a vaguely repulsed look before returning to retrieving some equipment he needed. You could hear movement outside the barrel during the moments in which Applejack\u2019s flatulence wasn\u2019t deafening you with its orchestra of rude noises. Mercifully, you hear the barn door creak open once more, and then shut close.</span></div></div>",

This is your fetish, remember? Shoot, this must be heaven for you, sugarcube! All my farts nice and condensed like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tailhole quivers and vomits out another foul burst of noisy gas, ringing around the inside of the barrel for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Phew</i>. \u2018Sides \u2014 my belly\u2019s so bloated I ain\u2019t even sure I could shift from this...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans aside, providing you with a glimpse of daylight but also a wet fart, and then settles back down with a hefty grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...spot. <i>Granny\u2019s Girdles</i>, that one reeks!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s no longer a case of marginal disgust; if she doesn\u2019t let you grab a lungful of fresh air soon you\u2019re going to either pass our or vomit or both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019know, if I dropped one as smelly as that in the house, I\u2019d have the room cleared in seconds, and here you are takin\u2019 it all nice and raw and undiluted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour desperation burgeons into heaving panic; you push your hooves up into the ass-meat flowing tightly over the rim of the barrel, but as you try to lift Applejack you only bring another fart shooting out of her stinkhole and steaming your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery breath only draws in more and more of that smell of trash-heap egg and pungent, rancid grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air is so thick with fumes you can almost chew on them. Your face is glazed in sweat and so hot and flushed you could have sworn you had a sunburn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack rudely brings up another raucous belch and lets it hang in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTastes like granny\u2019s apple n\u2019 bean surprise! Stuff always gets me gassed up somethin\u2019 fierce. Has me blowin\u2019 off the bedsheets everytime she whips it up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this smell once belonged to apples and beans, it certainly doesn\u2019t resemble them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... can\u2019t breathe down here!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hush. Don\u2019t you fret. Just lay back an\u2019 enjoy the storm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looses a throaty grunt and feels a long, wet fart empty into the vessel below her, sounding not unlike the revving of a chainsaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Whew</i>. Good <i>gravy</i>, that one sounded <i>raunchy.</i> Burned my butthole some.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe appalling stench redoubles and so does the humidity. <br>\r\nIt\u2019s so superheated that you\u2019re sweating like a pig, feeling your world spin and wheel around your head. <br>\r\nEvery breath carries the repugnance of stale, stagnant apple farts. To think that right now you could be comfortable and warm in a hotel room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... you\u2019re certainly warm, but it\u2019s a sickly warmth. Like the overbearing sultry air deep in the foliage of a jungle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly now do you notice that you\u2019re not completely alone inside the barrel. <br>\r\nA few flies spin around in the stink, three settle on Applejack\u2019s cheeks, pausing for a moment to polish their little legs together and indulge in what, to them, likely smells like a fresh pile of scat.<br>\r\nAnother perches on your brow for a few seconds before taking off and whizzing around with a little buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you feel as if you might drift off, a tight trombone note sounds off from above you and pulls you to attention; it\u2019s as if she won\u2019t even allow you a moment\u2019s respite from her gastrointestinal maelstrom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one hits you directly. A little sickeningly warm puff of rancid eggy gas. You notice two of the three flies are caught in the stream and fall with gentle thuds to the bottom of the barrel, stone dead.<br>\r\nYou dry heave. Another quacking fart stirs the air, depletes your oxygen, and it\u2019s all you can take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Applejack</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a pause, and a quick scoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ain't into farts, are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What!? Of course I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, Peppermint. I'm the element of honesty, and that means it ain't hard for me to winnow out the truth from the..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>fraaaaap</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...exactly.\" She chuckles.<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong. If'n you're willin' to keep it up even after all this, you must really like me. I'm plum grateful, but one thing you're gonna wanna know is we apples do not tolerate lies. Truth only. Do you like farts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass acts as a buzzer and blows a hot honk against your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try again. Do you like farts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the darkness you can just about make out the sight of her distended plothole struggling to contain the sheer pressure of her next fart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue another gush of air boils your senses. This one is uncharacteristically silent - a searing hiss. <br>\r\nThe smell bowls you over with a thousand tonnes of pure stink. It smells less like gassy eggs and more like pure, stomach-turning manure.<br>\r\nHer stomach rolls with a noisy growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ooh</i>. My belly don't feel too good up here, Peppermint. You wouldn't want me to turn this barrel into an outhouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood runs cold.<br>\r\nYou don't doubt for a second that she's being completely serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This next one's gonna be risky! Let's give it one last try. Do you like farts?\"</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m the one who deserves the assistant here! I\u2019m sure you\u2019d rather work for me than being stuck in some stuffy library all day! C\u2019mon!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m just not sure..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses, and a devious smile crawls across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the way I see it, you don\u2019t have any way of getting down from here without my help. You\u2019re not really in a position to say no, are you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I\u2019m asking is you be my assistant for... one day. Until your potion wears off, at least, and if you like it better, you work for me instead! Though... I\u2019m also the one with the potions keeping you up here, so I would choose something in my interest, if I were you..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeez. She\u2019s crazy! Though you have a loyalty to Twilight, you can\u2019t exactly argue with Rainbow Dash, and your induction isn\u2019t technically until tomorrow, anyway, so there\u2019s no harm in humoring her for just one day. Hopefully her threats are as empty and desperate as they seem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess for one day...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Sorry if I seemed a little... Uh... threatening, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been needing an assistant for ages now, and it\u2019s just not fair for Twilight to hog you like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash leads you towards the entrance of her house. She seems okay, though her threat is still looming over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, here\u2019s my crib. I know, I know, it\u2019s pretty awesome. No need to tell me.\u201d She chuckles to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re both in a large hallway, with a staircase leading up to the next floor, and doorways to your left and right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would give you the tour, but you\u2019ll see the whole place while you\u2019re working for me. My bedroom\u2019s upstairs, kitchen and lounge are down here, I\u2019ve got a little training ground out back, and the bathroom\u2019s upstairs too.\u201d She looks back at you. \u201cIf you <i>do</i> decide to take up the position, you can take the spare room. I haven\u2019t exactly got a bed in there, but there\u2019s a mattress.... I think.\u201d She briefly flashes you a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut anyway, the first order of business....\u201d </span></div></div>",

It\u2019s been sitting there for like week, and I\u2019m <i>wayy</i> too busy to do it myself!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d You grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt gets pretty sweaty in all that wonderbolt gear!\u201d She jeers, as if this is all giving her some kind of sick satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash shows you to the laundry room, just past the kitchen, where a large, nearly overflowing bundle of clothes sit in a basket and produce an immediately apparent smell of damp sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just gotta separate the colors from the whites, then wash them both individually. Not too hard, huh? If you were with Twilight right now she\u2019d probably be using you as a victim for some weird spell, or making you mark her student\u2019s homework or something!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaves you to it, trotting away casually to no doubt go and laze around on her flanks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel down beside the pile of laundry, wishing you had a clothes peg as you start to take out the items of clothing and place them in the appropriate baskets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disgustingly damp smell only gets worse as you start to take pieces of clothing out; it\u2019s like the smell of a dirty old mop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes themselves <i>feel</i> filthy, too. They\u2019re soaked in perspiration - just how sweaty does this Pegasus get!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out a blue full body wonderbolt suit with Rainbow Dash\u2019s cutie mark printed on the side, and it smells the worst of them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swear you almost see sweat dripping from the outfit, a buildup collected through all her long, exhausting flights and training. You don\u2019t even want to imagine how much time she\u2019s spent in this suit, and how infrequently she\u2019s washed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw it into the color basket, and Rainbow Dash returns in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting through this pretty fast. What\u2019s wrong? That\u2019s the smell of success, you know!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly she comes up behind you, using her hoof to force your head down into the basket, your face brushing up against the soggy unwashed clothing, the piercing scent of her musky sweat penetrating your nostrils full force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to push your way out, but she\u2019s too strong. All that training seems to have paid off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? It seems to me like you\u2019re not being very <i>respectful</i>. You don\u2019t even know who I am, Do you? I bet if you were doing <i>Twilight\u2019s</i> laundry, you wouldn\u2019t be acting like it was such a chore!\u201d <br>\r\nShe pauses, her hoof still pushing your head down and digging into the back of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to show me a little respect for once. I want you to realise who you\u2019re working for, so lick it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLick... what?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCelestia, the laundry! Lick it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t possibly. The smell alone is enough to make you gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy wonderbolt suit. I want you to take it back out and <i>lick it.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause again. It doesn\u2019t look like you have a chance, but if you can put it off for even another minute you want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome <i>on!</i> You want to go visit your precious Princess Twilight Sparkle, right? That\u2019s your ticket out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeekly you reach into the color basket, and pull out the damp onepiece, the smell still radiating from it strongly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon! It tastes like candy, I promise!\u201d She chuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to lick it, feeling the sweat squeeze out onto your tongue with the bitter flavor of Dash\u2019s bodily perfume. <br>\r\nYou retch, pretty loudly, and bring yourself to lick it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, huh?\u201d She sneers, her voice sharp and pitiless. <br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna guess how many times I\u2019ve farted in that thing?\u201d She laughs again, partly at your misfortune and partly at her own repulsive attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough. Now it\u2019s time to lick the real thing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, you turn your head, and find yourself face-to-cheek with her rump, her tail swishing from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLick my cheeks. I was working out earlier, so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s <i>plenty</i> of fresh perspiration on them!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exhale sharply, noticing the smell coming from her rear end is even worse than the smell coming from the laundry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and before you showed up I took a pretty big dump, so apologies if it\u2019s extra stinky back there!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis mare is disgusting. When you thought about Ponyville hospitality, you certainly didn\u2019t think of <i>this</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou extend your tongue, closing your eyes and licking. It\u2019s warm and clammy; the distinctive musky smell that was on the clothes is even stronger coming from the source itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow the other one. I\u2019m feeling cleaner already, I can see why Twilight wanted an <i>assistant</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lick the other cheek, gagging at the little beads of sweat which seem to stick to your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. That\u2019s enough for now. Don\u2019t even think you\u2019re worth a taste of what\u2019s between them.\u201d She snickers and steps away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel as low as you possibly can, on your knees and shaking on the floor, with the taste of sweat clinging to your tongue and refusing to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway...\u201d </span></div></div>",

She\u2019s already demonstrated how much power she can exert over you if she wants.

Try it again, and this time how about you address me as Ms. Dash.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see the twisted sadistic smile fixed on her face. This mare is completely insane.

Pretty impressive, huh? Took a long time to squeeze out but I\u2019d say that\u2019s one for the photo album!\u201d <br>\r\nReally, you can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s joking or telling the truth. Neither would surprise you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s best to just get this job out of the way. It\u2019s going to need to be done sooner or later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething\u2019s not right, though. You look around again to double check you didn\u2019t miss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... Ms. Dash? There\u2019s no plunger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of <i>course</i> there isn\u2019t. You think I\u2019m gonna waste money on something like that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the needless addition of a water feature in her bathroom, you wouldn\u2019t think a plunger would be too far out her budget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen... how am I supposed to unblock it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks. \u201cGuess you\u2019ll have to work something out by yourself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway.

The idea runs through your mind that you could make some hasty escape while she\u2019s out, but there\u2019s no way you could see that happening without breaking your legs from the fall, and even if there was, she probably would have thought of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately search the bathroom for something you can use to unclog the profane mess she\u2019s left in the toilet; a stick, something to scoop it up with - but there\u2019s nothing you can use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could always go and grab something from the kitchen and use that, but she probably wouldn\u2019t be happy when she found out, and you could bet she <i>would</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exhausting every other option in your head, it becomes clear you have only two options..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You intake a short, tense breath, and using every ounce of will you have march back over to the toilet bowl. It's clear that Rainbow Dash has orchestrated this situation so that you're left with no other choice than to unclog the toilet manually. Even with your<i> own </i>waste you wouldn't do something like this in a million years, but knowing her the alternative would only be a hundred times worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's hard to not try to delay the deed itself any more, and you stare for a few seconds at the thick clumpy excrement down in the toilet water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Forgive me, Celestia...</i>\" You tell yourself, biting your lip and then submerging one hoof down into the toilet water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscles in your face begin to tense up even more as you feel the texture of the dung against your hoof; it's like thick, gritty mud that's accumulated into one big pile under the water. It feels like it's blocked all the way down to the pipe, but you continue to push it out the way, trying desperately to clear a passage and let it all flush away. It's obvious this will take more than a single flush to clear, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell is also beginning to become overwhelming. It's a horribly earthy stench that reminds you of the unpleasant odor of a public bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds of digging and burrowing down into the mass of fecal matter, you finally feel your hoof break through to the other side and find the pipe which seems to twist up sharply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou retrieve your hoof back out from the toilet, now stained brown, and pump the lever to flush as hard as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toilet lets out a watery hissing sound as it tries its best to rid itself of its contents, and, to your relief, does manage to flush about half of the shit-infused toilet water down the pipe, but not all of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter letting the water refill, you give it another flush, feeling yourself elate slightly at the sight of the last of Rainbow's disgusting waste flushed away and out of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's the toilet unblocked, but there's still another glaring problem to solve; your shit-caked arm. The smell is starting to heighten now it's out of the water, and you're not totally sure how you can even get rid of a stench like this. Like garlic, you'll probably still be sensing a hint of it on your hoof a week from now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough your tempted to spite Rainbow Dash by using her precious little water feature, you use the sink to thoroughly clean your hoof and forearm, reducing the large bar of soap to about half its size, but as you predicted, the smell is still there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless you want to soak your arm in bleach, you don't imagine there's anything stronger in here that would lessen the smell more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember, suddenly, an old piece of advice you always used to hear about cooking with potent foods; that rinsing your hooves in lemon juice would neutralize the odor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt probably wouldn't work, but if there was even a chance that you could diminish the smell of Rainbow's shit, you were willing to try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen was, surprisingly, as clean and tidy as the bathroom. It didn't make sense for a mare with a personality like hers to keep her house so neat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely enough, you managed to find a single lemon in the refrigerator, and slicing it in half, began to drench your arm in its juice, scrubbing tirelessly and then rinsing with water. Every few seconds you raised it up to your muzzle to sniff, and it did seem to have an effect somewhat. It was at least bearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were clearing away the lemon and the knife, you heard the front door swing open. Just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, slave, I'm back!\" She called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading through into the main hall, you saw that she was wiping herself down with a flannel, out of breath and resting against the stair railing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing in <i>there</i>?\" She asks rudely, eyeing you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I unblocked the toilet but I was just... cleaning my hooves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds she understood and her nose curled up in disgust. \"<i>Ewww</i>! You cleaned it with your <i>hooves</i>!? You really are disgusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not like she had given you any alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you did it, though. Shows the lengths you're willing to go to to please me.\" She grinned wryly, before tossing the sweat-drenched flannel at you and heading into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hit with the rancid, sour smell of her perspiration, and quickly threw the flannel back onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck her head into the refrigerator, and after less than two seconds turned to you, faced fixed into a scowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you use my last lemon!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow the fuck could she even know that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her silently, unsure exactly what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for my fucking lemonade! How <i>dare</i> you use my ingredients without asking <i>me</i> first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure how she expected to make lemonade with only one lemon, but once again you felt like this was probably somehow a setup at your expense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing slowed, and again a smile cracked across her face. \"Looks like I'll just have to use another recipe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached up into the cupboard and pulled out a large glass jug, laying it down on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only... It's not going to be me drinking it. It's going to be <i>you</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what she was getting at, but it become clear pretty quickly as Rainbow Dash squatted over the jug, grunting to herself softly, and began to pee into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared, not sure what to say, as she proceeded to fill it to almost the brim, leaving a little frothy head on the surface and sighing contentedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was holding that in for at least an hour.\" She chuckled, picking up the jug and laying it down on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason it hadn't clicked before, but you realized that you were going to have to actually <i>drink</i> this. She wouldn't<i> really</i> make you, surely? This had to just be some form of intimidation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now for the finishing touches.\" She tittered, quickly heading into the hallway and coming back with the soggy sweat-soaked towelette she had just been using to swab herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held it up over the jug, and to your utter disgust, wrung it out, letting a little rivulet of sweat trickle into the urine below, wringing it a few more times until it was practically dry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Now. Grab a glass, and follow me. I just hope you're thirsty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your heart sink lower into your chest as it became pretty clear she really <i>wasn't</i> bluffing. She was genuinely expecting you to drink it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently you picked up a glass and followed the pony through into her lounge, where she placed the jug down and sat, resting her hooves behind her head, on the sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a seat.\" She smirked, patting the empty cushion next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill silent, and still dreading the inevitable, you sat down quietly next to her, your gaze fixed almost obsessively on the jug of warm, dark-yellow liquid on the coffee table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Drink up. I made this just for you, so it'd be rude if you didn't finish it <i>all</i>.\" She really emphasized this last word to you, her tongue viciously scraping along the roof of her mouth, her face half derisive and half amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took one final look at the jug before you, and...</span></div></div>",

You grabbed the piss filled jug and brought it up to your mouth, the horrible acidic stench burning your nose and eyes. It looked like the least appetizing beverage in the world, her piss was a dark yellow and had bubbled and frothed in the jug. She had probably been holding it in for awhile, you wouldn't be surprised if she had been saving it just for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to get this over with, you shut your eyes and took a sip of the piss. It was disgustingly warm and the taste was extremely foul. Gagging and coughing you spit up some of it, earning a glare from Rainbow Dash as she stomped her hoof on the ground. \"You better not waste any of that! I went to all that work for you, so you'd better drink it all up!\" She grinned over at you, clearly enjoying all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWork? All she did was squat down and piss in a jug! Trying your best to ignore her, you compose yourself to take another drink. Sipping it would take quite awhile, and would only force you to savor the bitter taste longer. So you decided to chug as much of it one go as you could. It wasn't going to be pleasant, but it was your best bet to drink all of this sadistic mare's urine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes again you started to chug the jug of piss, gulping down mouthful after mouthful of the awful stuff. It was like the worst beer you had ever drank, this stuff was literal piss after all. Your face scrunched up in disgust from horrific taste and bitterness, but you plowed through it and continued to chug. You started to feel lightheaded as you swallowed what felt like a gallon of her piss. Finally you reached the bottom of the jug and the last of it swirled down your throat. You threw it to the ground, her urine dribbling down your face as you panted. You had a strong urge to throw up, but thankfully barely managed to keep it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! Look at you! How'd that taste, my piss good enough for you? Maybe I can start my own brand of lemonade, you sure seemed to enjoy it!\" She laughed and cackled as you were recovering from your ordeal. Somehow you had managed to drink all of it though the taste was still in your mouth. You felt nauseous from it, not just from the taste but also from the shame of it. You had just drank another pony's pee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... yes Ms. Dash... whatever you say...\" You wiped your lips, Rainbow recoiling as your breath reeked of piss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew you need a breath mint or something. That is nasty!\" She chuckled and fanned the air. \"Anyway, I got another job for ya. And this one is really important!\" As soon as you saw the smirk on her face you knew this wasn't going to be good. She led you through her house and into...</span></div></div>",

Considering how bad of a time you had in here before you were really worried about what she had planned. Since it was the bathroom you could only assume that things were going to get stinky again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash went over to the toilet and peered down into it, examining the job you did unclogging it. You were nervous but you did the best job you could considering how little she gave to work with (which was nothing after all, she had just left you with a seriously clogged toilet). She finished and glared over at you. \"Didn't do a very good job cleaning it. Look at all these stains.\" She pulled the handle and watched it flush. \"Well at least it ain't clogged anymore. Still, next time I expect this bowl to be sparkling clean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just weakly nodded. What were you supposed to use to get the stains out? You really didn't want to think about it.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I'm glad you got it unclogged in time for me getting back. Cause I always take a dump after practice. And this is gonna be a gnarly one I can tell.\" Rainbow laughed and turned around, slamming her fat ass onto the toilet seat. You backed up towards the door, not wanting to be in here for this. \"Hey! Where the fuck do you think you're going?\" She yelled at you, making you stop and curse under your breath. \"Your job is to tend to my here in the bathroom, as my assistant! So get the fuck back here while I take a shit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhimpering, you turned around and slowly walked back to her. This was really going to stink. Still, you had unclogged her toilet with your bare hoof. This couldn't be that much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. Stand right there.\" Rainbow Dash chuckled as you stopped right beside her, far closer than you would have preferred. \"Just one more thing...\" She grabbed the roll of toilet paper and put it in your hooves. \"Perfect! Now, stay quiet. I like to have some peace while I shit.\" Immediately after saying that she let out a loud, wet fart that echoed through the bowl. The sound made you cringe as you suspected the toilet was getting much filthier. It only got worse as she let out more farts and a barrage of sickening plops followed. The pegasus had a relieved expression on her face as she kept unloading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly the horrible smell reached you. You gagged and covered your nose almost dropping the roll of toilet paper. While the mess she had left for you in the toilet was stinky that was nothing compared to this. The stench of fresh shit and her farts filled your nostrils, making you want to run out of the bathroom and as far away from this filthy mare as possible. Instead you were forced to stand beside her, inhaling her putrid release. This went on for a few more uncomfortable minutes, at one point you nearly hurled after Rainbow made a heavy plonk and let out a very relieved sigh. You just held your breath for as long as possible, not wanting to have to suck in any of the tainted air. It smelled like rotten eggs, garlic and whatever the hell else she had eaten earlier. Finally she seemed to be finished evacuating her bowels and looked over at you expectantly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew exactly what she was waiting for and filled with humiliation and shame you tore of a few sheets of toilet paper. Rainbow Dash chuckled and leaned over on her porcelain throne, lifting up a cheek to show you her filthy ass crack. The sight of it made you gag, it was completely covered in wet shit and the bowl underneath it hadn't fared any better. You brought the toilet paper to her crack and started to wipe, it quickly becoming soiled with her filth. Even worse some got on your hoof making you retch while the pegasus just laughed. You wiped it off as quick as you could and went back to wiping her crack, sheet after sheet becoming covered in her shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you were reaching the end of the roll, her crack was so filthy it seemed it was going to take all of it to get it clean. With one of the last sheets you gave her asshole a good wipe. You breathed a heavy sigh as it was relatively clean, that was the end of it. Just about time too, you couldn't stand breathing in this shitty air for a minute longer. It was by far the most disgusting thing you had ever smelled. It hadn't helped that Rainbow had farted several times while you were wiping her. \"Ah ah, you aren't done yet. You have one last thing to do.\" She looked at you smugly as you went to wash your hooves. You looked back at her confused for a moment, until it dawned on you. Sighing you went back over and flushed the toilet for her. Unsurprisingly, her huge bowel movement clogged the toilet again. It was much dirtier now than before as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, don't worry about it. You can unclog it tomorrow, I won't need it for the rest of the night after that release.\" Of course you did worry about it, you weren't excited to unclog that mess later... She laughed and got up, fanning the air as she washed her hooves before you even though she hadn't used them for anything. You washed up after, at least your hooves didn't get as dirty as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash left the bathroom, you following behind her and feeling more humiliated than you ever had in your life. You had just stood beside this mare while she shit and even wiped her ass for her. Could things possibly sink any lower? Your mistress looked back at you, that smug grin still spread across her face. \"Okay, now that my bathroom needs are all taken care of. You can...\"</span></div></div>",

Flying around in a tight suit in the blisteringly hot sun will do that, you suppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re spared her suit - for now - which is still on the floor down in the hallway, but you know from experience the pony herself is much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you have a shower or something? Cool off?\u201d You ask, knowing full well it\u2019s a stupid question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs. \u201cYou think I\u2019m going to waste water when I have a perfectly good shower right here? Now stop stalling.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat else can you do? As you crawl onto the bed you\u2019re reminded of her strength by her hoof swiftly forcing your head into her exposed pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re hit with a sharp, piercing stench. It\u2019s disgusting, and the jungle of matted fur beneath her arm doesn\u2019t make it any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut that tongue to work, slave.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you do: cringing with every lick, you force your tongue to lap at her sweaty pit, covering it in a sickly layer of potent perspiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you\u2019re done with her arms, she instructs you to move onto her torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer coat is practically drenched, so the saliva from your tongue doesn\u2019t make much difference. The taste of her sweat is less of a flavor and more of a raw pain; it makes you dizzy it\u2019s so foul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d She expels a raspy sigh, easing back into the mattress as you lick her all over. <br>\r\n\u201cNothing like a tongue bath on a hot day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can barely take in what she\u2019s saying, though. It\u2019s a blur. All your mind can focus on is the dauntingly nauseous task you\u2019re being made to perform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou work your way down her torso, past her toned paunch, and closer to her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you try anything,\u201d she starts, her voice once again picking up a tone of authority, \u201cdon\u2019t even think about licking my pussy. You\u2019re gonna have to earn the right to do that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like the prospect even seemed appealing in the slightest; if that was as poorly-maintained as the rest of her, it wouldn\u2019t exactly taste very nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you arrive at the part of her you\u2019d feared the most: her groin. There is a musky, almost cheesy stench emanating from between her thighs. One that makes her armpits smell like a bed of roses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, and she can sense this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls one of her legs apart to reveal the fleshy, damp crevice within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gag, audibly, but this just seemed to make her laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes, trying to shut off your senses, you go in for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell that envelops you is like some kind of sickening high swamp. It\u2019s putrid. No - putrid is far too tame a word for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel the sweat collect on your tongue; feel the acrid flavor instilled in your tastebuds like garlic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what feels like hours, the worst is over.<br>\r\nWell... it seems to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be generous, slave. I\u2019ll let you lick that little asshole of mine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lies fully onto her back, her hoof reaching down to part one of her cheeks and expose the winking ponut to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you\u2019ve already been made to lick her ass clean before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn\u2019t make it any less disgusting, though; her fleshy, muscled cheeks are covered in a sticky film of sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do the best job you can, though: you continue to lick along the curvature of her cheeks, venturing between them every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, with not a word of warning, something unexpected happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ffrrrrraaaaabbt</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud, obtrusive fart blasts you in the face with a hot smack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops! Excuse me!\u201d She jeers. You\u2019re caught in a daze of hot, sickening, stagnant-smelling rotten egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, slave. Had that one pent up all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses for a second, and then lets out an exaggerated noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew! Oh, Celestia! That\u2019s a ripe one!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just laughs at your entirely piteous demeanor as she forces out another wet, juicy fart right into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow the smell of her gas is even worse than the smell of her shit. As much as it makes you feel physically ill, you know it\u2019s just another thing you have to endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan! Who knew a smell like <i>that</i> could come out of a butt like mine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn\u2019t exactly surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, you have to admit it\u2019s kinda impressive! Bet you\u2019ve never smelled a fart <i>that</i> rancid before, and <i>especially</i> not from a mare!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles; gloating, as if this is something to gloat about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to ignore her and just get the job over with; after all, you\u2019ve almost cleaned the entire surface of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you carry on applying reluctant licks over her rump, you hear another chuckle from above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? Seeing as I\u2019ve got some gas in the tank, why don\u2019t I get a <i>really</i> good one out for you? Get your face in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re given a choice as she pulls herself forwards and pushes your head into her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLetting a few farts fly is <i>always</i> fun, but I\u2019ve never had an <i>audience</i> before.\u201d She snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... technically I have in the Academy changing rooms, but now you\u2019ve got a <i>front row</i> seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe maintains the pressure on the back of your head and starts letting out strained, raspy grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour muzzle is stuffed between her sweat-soaked cheeks and there is nothing you can do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHnng-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch as the dulled, muffled sound of flatulence batters against your face. <br>\r\nThe smell is a horribly pungent wave of egg. You feel your stomach turn on itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fart rattles on, and on... punctuated only by little grunts from the mare as she obviously makes a deliberate attempt to make this release a long one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about six or seven seconds it stops, but all it takes is another strenuous push from her to start up again like a faulty engine; it reverberates against your face and imbues your senses with its aroma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother five seconds... no, six... seven... eight...<br>\r\nAfter nine, it stops, and it seems like that\u2019s all she\u2019s got for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh! Shit, that wasn\u2019t bad, huh? Pretty long if I say so myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snickers pridefully and lets your head go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re swimming in the malodor; that fucking disgusting smell of eggy farts is going to be stained into your senses for a while. You can\u2019t fathom how a mare can be this grotesque. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can do, though, is pathetically look up at her, eyes pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really ought to start timing those things. Maybe I could set a whole new kind of record!\u201d She smirks; showing those pearly teeth of hers for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d Her eyes widen and she starts wafting her hoof in front of her face. \u201cReally clears the sinuses!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash leans towards the open window and sucks in lungfuls of fresh air. It\u2019s like she\u2019s taunting you further; you\u2019d give anything for one single untainted breath of fresh air right now, and she knows it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Not a bad job, but there\u2019s more work to be done, slave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t even bring yourself to ask her what\u2019s next. It\u2019s almost as if you not asking might somehow mean it won\u2019t happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does, though, and you feel yourself sink further as your tormentor announces she wants you to...</span></div></div>",

You do as she says\u2014 as if you have much of a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rainbow Dash returns, her hooves are full of colorfully-labeled junk food that she deposits onto her bed. If all of this is from her kitchen, she must get one hell of a daily workout, or you imagine she\u2019d be quadruple her size. \u201cI always knew I was the best farter in Ponyville,\u201d the mare brags, \u201cbut now that I have a captive audience, it\u2019s my perfect chance to prove it!\u201d She seems far more excited about it than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plops back down on her bed, tearing open a bag of snacks that advertises itself as \u201cscorching hot\u201d. Dash sticks her hoof in and stuffs multiple chips into her mouth, chewing rudely. After swallowing, her mouth opens to spew out a loud belch accompanied by a small fireball. \u201cAhh, yeah. These babies kick in real fast,\u201d she says while patting her belly. She looks back to you, \u201cWell? What are you waiting for? Get your butt over here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you trot up and settle between her thighs. Your reluctance must show on your face, because Dash laughs raucously. \u201cC\u2019mon, it can\u2019t be that bad!\u201d You know that she knows it very much can be, and simply glare at her, which seems to amuse her further. \u201cOk ok, get your snout in there. I feel the first one coming!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes every ounce of your willpower to nestle your muzzle back between those hellish cheeks of hers. Remnants of her previous blasts remain, as does the natural musk of her ass, creating a uniquely disgusting blend for you to experience firsthand. You naturally don\u2019t want to push in very far, and hope Rainbow Dash won\u2019t care. Wish in one hand and shit in the other, right? Your tormentor\u2019s hooves grip your head, positioning your nose flush to her filthy sphincter. \u201cTheeeere we go,\u201d she sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince as the greasy flesh of her anus bulges out, enveloping your nose. You feel Dash relax her guts before she lets her gas out right into your nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRNNNZZZZT...BZZRT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash was right about clearing the sinuses. You can feel anything obscuring your nostrils from taking in the entirety of her fart melt away, corroded by the sheer heat of the explosion. You would swear you were snorting wasabi and not mare guts if it wasn\u2019t for the violent stink. Pure sulphur couldn\u2019t come close to matching the stench forced up your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body is wracked with convulsions, an involuntary reaction to the stink, and Rainbow Dash has to pin you in place to keep you from jostling from the position of your nostrils upturned flat to her fat pucker. While you feel the fart do away with some of your brain cells, the mare above you simply cackles obnoxiously. Her superior strength keeps your nose tight to her asshole as she forces another gut-bomb down your flaring nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound is buffered, your nose acting as a fart dampener. To Rainbow, she hears a muffled, nauseatingly wet noise under her ass. \u201cOh, that sounded so gross!\u201d She laughs as her festering anus bubbles on top of your muzzle. If one good thing comes from the hell you\u2019re enduring, it\u2019s that your brain is too fried for you to be humiliated by the crude noises created by the bond of her anus and your nose. You were hardly completely spared from humiliation however, as the reek of rotten eggs will be burned into your snout for perhaps weeks to come. You can feel it filling your entire being with each humiliating inhale, tainting you inside and out with the filth of ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerciless, Rainbow Dash pushes HARD. She tenses, silent before bursting into a harsh fit of laughs.</span></div></div>",

Your body hungers for some kind of air, and this is all you're getting.<br>\r\nThe moment it hits the back of your nose you can tell there's something different about this one. The reaction it draws out of you is so violent and intense that you actually manage to overpower Rainbow Dash for a second. You pull yourself from the vice-like grip of her thighs and fall back onto the bed, your body forces out a loud, guttural retch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt smells like a trash bag filled with cracked eggs and left to cook in a humid jungle for a year. Completely, utterly, viscerally repugnant. It feels like the walls of your nose are peeling away under the appallingly noxious fumes, and your sinuses sting like they're pumped full of acid.<br>\r\nRainbow Dash peers over at your writhing and convulsing with a palpable curiosity. She gives the air a little sniff and the stench of her own gas hits her almost as hard as it hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy <i>Fuck</i>!\" A little chuckle underpins her disgust. You watch through blurred, watery eyes as Dash wafts her wings to dispel the odor. Of course, she's sure to waft <i>towards</i> you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't think those chips would kick in so fast, <i>heh</i>.\" She snorts some of the air again, feeling her nasal passage significantly cleared by the sobering smell of pegasus fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact...\" She peers towards the little stopwatch she keeps by her bed. <br>\r\n\"What a perfect opportunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you really have time to notice, the pegasus has trotted along the bed and brings her rump crashing down onto your face with a soft thud.<br>\r\nShe wiggles herself into a comfortable position, using your muzzle like a barstool, and sets up her little stopwatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention is immediately caught by the sour sweat still clinging to her flanks. It has dried, but is no less pungent. She wiggles her grimy little stinkhole against your nostrils and as it begins to reflexively pucker and twitch, your heart falls in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you're ready. This is gonna be one for the record books!\" This is all the warning you get before she leans her weight onto her right cheek and lets loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deafening buzz comes flooding into your world. As she grunts and pushes a little harder, it raises into an airy squeal. <br>\r\nEven if you could hold your breath, you would not be able to ignore the powerful rush of hot, muggy wind blowing with a brutal force right up your nostrils. <br>\r\nThe smell is somehow ten times worse than that last one. <br>\r\nYour body jars and struggles, fighting for survival. Your conscious mind has now taken a backseat to your primal instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every attempt to topple the gassy tyrant bearing down on you, you find she is able to exert an equal amount of effort. Your body, in its languished state, is no match for Dash's athleticism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifts her position a little, and with this new posture comes a slightly altered sound. It's almost like distnat thunder ringing in your ears and burning your nostrils. <br>\r\nYour lightheadedness develops into hazed dizziness. For a moment you wonder if this is some kind of lucid nightmare. <br>\r\nNo.<br>\r\nEven in the darkest, most depraved depths of your mind you could never conjure up a stench as utterly execrable as this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoves her spewing sphincter as close up to your nose as she can get it. It blows you with a mist of swampy sweat that only compounds your agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what feels, to you, like several lifetimes, the fart peters out into a hot scorching hiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, yeah! Fifty six seconds! Not a bad warmup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes feel wetter than usual. <br>\r\nThey're not just watering in response to the acrid fartfog steaming them up, you're actually crying. Sobbing quietly and hopelessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too shabby, but I can do better.\"<br>\r\nThis is the last thing you hear before...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thankfully, Rainbow Dash's toxic farts were finally too much for you to handle and caused you to pass out. The last thing you saw was her stinking ponut and sweaty asscheeks before everything turned black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke sometime later, you really couldn't tell how long you had slept but the stench of the pegasus's revolting gas was still seared onto your nose. Groaning, you tried to get up, but found your whole body tied up. Before you could so much as shout, Dash walked into the room smiling, her body completely drenched in sweat. \"Ah good you're awake, I got something really special planned! I was just out at Wonderbolts practice and jeez was it brutal , now that you got your rest I can get mine!\" She declared before you could utter a word, and just like that she left the room for a moment only to return and wheel in some sort of contraption made of metal bars, braces, pulleys and ropes. All you could think about was what Dash could possibly have planned for you with this torture device... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I know it might look a little complex but it's really very simple!\" Dash said as she began to untie you, your body paralyzed with a mix of fear and still being groggy from just waking up. \"I just needed these on ya for while I was out at Wonderbolts practice, don't want my new slave running away!\" She chuckled as she finished untying you, your senses finally kicking in as you went to run. Slave?! When had you gone from assistant to slave?! Before you could even reach the end of the room Rainbow tackled you roughly to the floor, her heavy quite muscular body for a mare pressing down on you. \"Heh, then again, you can't even leave my house without me! You're alllll mine until I say so.\" She grinned down at you with a sadistic look before getting up and dragging you over to her contraption. She was right, even if you made it away from her you couldn't get down to the ground without serious injury. You were stuck with this reeking pegasus and whatever she had planned for you... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Dash took your front hooves and put them in two braces that locked in place, keeping your hooves firmly stuck. Next, she did the same with your back hooves on the other side of the machine and wrapped several ropes around your limbs to support them further. After that she began to use the pulleys to hoist your body up into the air so it was a few feet off the ground. Your face was pointing up towards the ceiling and feeling very exposed. You began to panic as you were suspended in the air, your whole body vulnerable as whatever struggling you attempted only caused you to sway back and forth. \"D-Dash... what the hell is this?! What are you doing?\" You asked, the fear in your voice just causing her to laugh. \"Oh like I said, I'm going to get some rest! And you're going to help me!\" Dash smirked and used more ropes to bind you and support your dangling body. By the time she was done you were firmly stuck in place above the ground, barely able to move. To finish it all off, she slipped an odd looking ring onto your horn. \"That's an anti magic ring, it prevents you unicorns from using your annoying magic. So don't think you can get out of this!\" She answered the question you had on your mind, which only served to scare you even more. Your magic was the only thing that could have gotten you out of all this bondage, now you were completely helpless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, here's what we're gonna do. What I just did with you is set up my new 'hammock'! Yup, that's right, you have the honor of supporting my amazing body while I rest!\" Her words struck terror into your heart, it all made sense now. With how your body was positioned, your face was going to end up right under her... Ass. Dash's blue, sweat soaked ass was all you could see as she got on top of you, laying on her back like you were an actual hammock. Of course this meant your face was completely buried and smothered under her plot, which was so big and plush it felt like your face sunk into a giant ball of dough. Her weight was immense and the whole bondage contraption briefly shuddered under her weight, the ropes and pulleys creaking a bit but managing to stabilize and keep you both up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed in relief and got comfy on you, already your body was feeling sore from supporting this lazy ass pegasus. Worst of all though was that all you could smell was her ass, your nose forced deep into her crack. You just prayed she would get up soon... \"Alright slave, I'm gonna nap here for awhile. You just do your thing down there, oh and I had a couple bean burritos earlier so just warnin ya. It's gonna get bad.\" Dash chuckled ominously before almost immediately passing out on top of you, she must of been in quite a comfortable position. If only you could say the same... </span></div></div>",

From your time in Canterlot, you had a seen a few griffons and read about them too. However, the ones you seen in Canterlot were always ambassadors or diplomats from their lands, and none of them were ever as rude as this one. So it was very uprising for you to run into one out here, especially one so different from the ones you had met. You were left standing there for a few moments, unsure how to respond. This only annoyed the griffon further. \"What you never seen a griffon before? You just gonna stand there staring all day? If that's the case... I got something for you to stare at.\" A large smirk crossed her face as she turned around and disappeared from view, soon replacing her head with her large, round rump! She broke into a fit of laughter as she shook her brown furry ass back and forth, mooning you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just groaned and rolled your eyes, she sure was immature. \"Wow... Umm I'm, new in town. I just wanted to see who lived here... it looks like a really cool place!\" The griffon mooned you for a few more moments before her laughter finally died down and she turned back around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Really, well. In that case I'd be more than happy to show you around...\" Though you couldn't see it from your position way down on the ground, she was grinning widely. \"The name's Gilda. This isn't exactly my place, but I'm looking after it for my friend Rainbow Dash while she's gone.\" Gilda said as she started to fly down towards you, getting bigger with each flap of her strong wings. She had looked a lot smaller up there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I see, well I'd love to see inside. It looks very impressive!\" You smile as she landed by you, taken aback by the sweaty smell coming off her. The griffons you had met in Canterlot seemed to have been more hygienic too... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda smiled, not seeming to notice you cover your nose from her wicked B.O that filled the air. \"It sure is, Rainbow Dash's place is way cooler than most of the lame houses you ponies have. First off though, you won't be able to go there unless you mind plummeting right back to the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right! Unicorn and Earth ponies can't walk on clouds, that's okay!\" You focused and soon after your horn lit up. \"I learned this spell so I could visit Cloudsdale one day! I still haven't got the money to go yet... but, someday.\" You smiled as you finished casting the spell on yourself, making you feel ever so slightly lighter. \"There, now I can walk on the clouds. Though... I kind of need a ride up there.\" You ask sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, I got you covered.\" Gilda said as she roughly grabbed you and flew you up to the house with incredible speed. You looked down and felt a little nauseous, it hadn't looked quite as high up from down there... Soon though you were through the front door and marveling at Rainbow Dash's cloud house, Gilda smirking at you deviously the whole time. She stretched her wings and spoke up \"Well now that you're here, how about we...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a grin, Gilda brought you to the kitchen which wasn't exactly in the cleanest state with dirty dishes filling the sink and a garbage overflowing with what seemed to be tin cans. \"My friend Rainbow Dash is out for the week so she had me look after her place, thankfully she left me a big stash of these beans. I don't know how I can live without them.\" With a chuckle she pulled out a couple cans of baked beans and opened them up, dumping them into a big pot that she then put on the heat. With that done she tossed the empty cans onto the ever growing pile, an audible gulp coming from you. Again this Gilda didn't seem to be the most hygienic griffon around, and combined with her immaturity and apparent love for baked beans, you knew this didn't bode well. \"Ahh, wow, I've never heard of griffons liking beans before..\" You gulped and looked around the rest of Rainbow Dash's kitchen as you made small talk. Not being particular fond of them, you decided to make a salad for yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Rainbow Dash won't mind if I eat some of her food?\" You inquired, you didn't want to be rude. Gilda just smiled and shrugged. \"Nah. Help yourself, though you are really missing out on these beans.\" She laughed and gave them a stir, the aroma of them cooking filling the room. Though admittedly it did smell quite delicious, you know it wouldn't smell nearly as good coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you soon finished making your meals and sat down to eat, you with a rather small salad and Gilda with a great big heaping bowl of baked beans. While you nibbled on your salad as politely as you could (living in Canterlot had made your table manners impeccable), Gilda chowed down and shoved spoonful after spoonful of beans into her mouth as if it were a race. Your eyes went wide a bit, perhaps it wasn't the best idea checking out this cloud house. Being stuck here with an unhygienic griffon full of baked beans sounded like a recipe for disaster. Breaking yourself out of your trance watching her devour her food, you spoke up trying to make some conversation. \"So... you live here in Ponyville? You must be the only griffon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda shook her head and swallowed a big mouthful. \"Nah. I'm just visiting for awhile. Rainbow Dash had some big Wonderbolts training thing so she needed me to look after this place. It's pretty cool, I get to sit around here and relax-\" She paused for a moment to lean to the side and blast out a very loud fart that rippled against her chair, soon filling the room with an utterly putrid stench that made you instantly clutch your nose. \"Ahh and I can fart as much as I want! Not like anyone's going to give a damn.\" She laughed and fanned the air a bit after getting a whiff of her ripe gas. She didn't even seem to notice your disgusted expression as she went back to eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, you didn't have much of an appetite after that. The reeking griffon gas filled the room and forcefully entered your nostrils, it was heavy with the stench of beans and cheese. \"Umm, maybe I should be going... I only got into town today and I have an awful lot to do..\" Gilda grinned as she finished her food and put a wing around you. \"Nonsense! You just got here! Why don't we sit and relax for a bit. I'm sure there's lots you want to know about griffons and Cloudsdale and who better to tell you about them than me?\" You gulped as she led you out of the kitchen, you feared it wouldn't be easy escaping this gassy griffon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gilda brought you to what seemed to be a fairly large living room with two big, long couches arranged around a table and open windows that filled the room with sunlight. She dropped her heavy ass down onto one of the fluffy cloud couches and leaned back. \"Ahh these clouds sure are comfy.\" She spread out her wings and stretched as you took a seat on the couch across from her, your politeness preventing you from just running out the door (also there was the whole problem with you being unable to get down, you weren't the best at teleportation spells yet and it was an awfully long way to the ground)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and smiled at the sensation of sitting on a cloud. It felt like well, sitting on a cloud. It was so soft and comfy, it was no surprise to you pegasus napped on them as you had often heard about them doing. \"Yes, this is very nice. Rainbow Dash sure has a nice house!\" You relaxed on your couch, even forgetting that you were sharing this room with a gas filled ticking time bomb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda spread her legs and leaned back further, her ass now pointing directly at you. You quickly realized this and gulped as her large round cheeks faced you, seeming much larger than it had seemed at first. There was a deadly silence in the room as you soon heard a gurgling, no doubt her stomach and bowels at work with all those beans. \"Uhh Gilda...\" You muttered, an enormous fart ripping out of her rear and cutting you off as you could actually <i>feel</i> the heat and force of her fart blowing onto you. Immediately after the smell hit you, and sweet Celestia it was bad! The eye watering stench was so horrible that it would have put even a dragon's fart to shame. Gilda seemed completely unphased by her gaseous outburst as she just let out a little relieved sigh and kept her relaxed pose on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" She looked over at you, snickering from your disgusted reaction. You were desperately trying to fan some of the air away, all of it was in vain of course as Gilda's gas was so thick it seemed to fill the whole room, even with the windows open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-your... g-gas.\" You stuttered, having to pause in between as you choked and tried to get some fresh air. Her gas was so stinky you were worried it was going to be permanently seared into your nostrils. At this point you realized that griffons and baked beans definitely do not mix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda laughed as she rolled her eyes. \"Oh, yeah, sorry I guess? You know griffons don't usually care about farts as much as you ponies do. We just let it rip!\" She grunted and let fly a long, disgusting fart that was somehow even worse than her previous emissions. The first sniff of it had your nose burning as you were trying anything you could think of to not breathe her gas. \"Ahhh. That's why I like Dash so much, she doesn't care. Hell, we've gotten into some pretty mean fart contests. I've never met a pony who can fart like her!\" She chuckled as her fetid flatulence didn't seem to affect her at all while to you it was like literal toxic gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were beginning to think that if you didn't get out of her soon, this farting griffon was going to kill you! A silent blast of gas blew past her cheeks, something you would have been unaware of had not the stench not doubled in intensity. Your eyes went wide as the sbd snaked it's way up your nose, filling it with the smell of rotten eggs and unwashed ass. At first you had wanted to learn a lot more about griffons, but this seemed like a little too much! </span></div></div>",

She sat on your stomach knocking the air out of you, her fat ass immobilizing your body. \"Hah! Got you, this is going to be a lot of fun! For me at least!\" Gilda cackled as she grabbed a rope and proceeded to tie your hooves together tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?! Why are you doing this?! Let me go!\" You gulped and shouted at her, still trying to do your best to break free. You could hardly budge her and all your struggling managed to do was make her nasty, sweaty cheeks slap against your stomach. With your hooves tied up you were now at her mercy, and judging by the grin on her face she probably wouldn't be showing you much of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda finished tying you up and tossed the rope to the side, still smirking the whole time. \"Why? Cause I want a slave that's why, and you will make a good one. Watching this place has been so boring that I need something to entertain me. And you'll do juuust fine.\" She chuckled and spun around so her ass was now pointing towards you. The view got worse as she backed up, her ass getting larger to the point where you could see every drop of sweat that ran down it. She stopped her rear just inches from your face, the intense smell of her musky crack making you wrinkle your nose in disgust. This was much worse than her B.O; of all the griffons to be enslaved by, it just had to be by one of the smelliest ones...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave?!\" You whimpered with a facefull of griffon ass. You were thankful she hadn't backed up even further, but this wasn't all that much better. All you could smell was her rank butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda rolled her eyes and backed up just an inch, as if to punish you. Your nose was almost touching her crack now and the smell was even worse here. Her ass was so sweaty you were almost worried she'd drown you if she sat on your face. \"Didn't hear me down there? Yes, you're my slave! And your first duty as my slave will be to...\"</span></div></div>",

You'd think in this entire building there was one fun thing to do, but no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you... have any studies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"I always leave it until the night before. That's how you get the best results.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure how true that was, but decided against arguing with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at you for a few seconds more, an idea seemed to form, and a smile crawled across her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... maybe you and I could do something. As you're new here, and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! What like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... there's one thing I really do enjoy that I can't exactly do around my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and... what's that?\" You asked cautiously. It was a well-known fact that dragons liked to get up to some dangerous things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fire-breathing contest! You in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I'm not a dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes. \"But you can burp, can't you? It's pretty much the same thing. Just... less fire hazard when you do it.\" She chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised a female dragon was interested in such a.. mannish activity, although she didn't seem like a particularly effeminate girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we can even get a lighter from somewhere and make yours as flammable as mine!\" She seemed to be growing more and more excited at the idea that she finally had somepony to do this with. It wasn't surprizing that her friends didn't usually let her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What do you say? If you're too much of a sissy, I can always try and find Spike.\"</span></div></div>",

She is nothing like any of the changelings you've seen before; her hooves and gnarled and full of holes, like ancient black tree bark.

You had reached a small clearing, but it certainly wasn't Ponyville. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, would you look at that?\" She turned to you, her voice raspy and almost electric. <br>\r\n\"It appears I'm lost too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flash of her eyes told you that your suspicions had been correct and that this was in fact a trap, but before you even had time to react, you felt yourself pulled towards her against your will,. surrounded by a magical aura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour muscles begin to shift and move at her will, and you soon find yourself laying down on the uncomfortable dirty floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snickers. \"I have to say... you are quite possibly the most gullible pony I've come across.

I have captured you <i>to</i> humiliate you. Your kind bores me. You're just dumb food items. Beneath me... And I intend to make sure you know just as well as I that you are beneath me.

Kiss me!\" she said loudly, starting to get annoyed at your reluctance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this threat, you didn't dare stalling any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to cry and whimper audibly. You really didn't want to do this, but she clearly left you no choice. At least no choice worth picking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't go for the hole like she intended, however, opting instead to peck away at her dark, voluptuous cheeks, hoping it would satisfy her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sweaty back there, and you felt the moisture of her ass cheeks against your lips, and you caught a whiff of her musky butt cheek as you kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin felt weird to you. It wasn't furry the same way as a pony's, but it was still soft and relatively easy to touch, though slightly leathery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic...\" she said after a few seconds of your unwilling worship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that won't cut it... You know I want your lips on my anus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour crying turns louder as you retrieve from your ass-kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please...

Her anus... <i>(it's even smellier when exposed like this.)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts edge is dark and leathery, but it gets pinker and seemingly softer towards the middle. It's not particularly large. A bit larger than a ponies rectum perhaps, but it fits her large figure quite well... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath... <i>(It stinks to do so)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean in and softly you plant your lips on her filthy hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels warm and ever so slightly moist... It's like kissing a round, leathery mouth.... with very bad breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe coos in sadistic glee, giggling at your pathetic behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep kissing. Don't pull back before I let you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your nasty kiss, planted on her rectum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute she allows you to pull back and you gladly do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Fine, you'll do. Listen here stallion. I've decided to make you my permanent ass slave. You will sit by my throne, waiting for my farts.

Come say hi,\" she says, changing subject<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs your hoof again and pulls you after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner, the groaning pony, Tax Filer. He's equally as malnourished. He nods to you, and you nod back. He's tied to the wall, and he's wearing a ring gag. He's got a brand across his chest that reads \"royal toilet paper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe title alone makes you cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes you to the next pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small mare... She looks very young... Almost still a filly. She's sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Crystal Kiss, she's her cum slave. She was nice enough to give the two youngest among us the least horrible jobs. Her twin brother, Crystal Kick, he's her hoof-slave... He's not here... He's, eh? in use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou count in your head... That makes five with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who's the last one?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down and bites her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I - I don't know his name... You don't need to see him if you don't want to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou contemplate a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs and takes you with her once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavily restrained a greyish stallion lie on the floor. Unlike all the other slaves, who all seem malnourished, he seems well off. Still. He somehow looks to be in worse condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch worse condition in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's barely breathing, His lips are swollen and they are clearly infected. His eyes aren't reacting to anything. There are flies crawling everywhere on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look away in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't need Sugar to tell you what his job is... Around his restrained head, is a toilet seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll die soon...\" said Sugar Heart. \"I hope, he'll get that relief every day... And I always say the same thing... Soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that very moment, the door to the dungeon opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piss slave!\" yells Chrysalis, causing Sugar Heart to jump in sudden shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... I can't take her hormone urine now,\" she cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember how horrible it smelled as it came out fresh. It was no doubt the worse pee in Equestria, and in a way, it was your fault she was about to drink it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake with a headache that occupies one entire side of your head. You groan, going to reach up and rub it with a hoof, but you find you can't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, growing increasingly more lucid, you see that you're tied down with ropes - only these ropes are black, cold, and sticky. The only thing you find you can move is your head, which you manage to crane up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt becomes clear to you pretty quickly that you're tied up to some kind of throne. It's tall, stretching up in nodose spikes that make the back of the seat. The arms are cold, hard, and almost like some kind of obsidian. You're sat on the floor, with your head lying against the seat of this mighty throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as your senses begin to return, the overwhelming stench of piss returns to you. You hope that eventually you might get used to it, but somehow you doubt your tormentor would let you off so lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, she enters in through the doorway, grinning as she sees you're awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good. I was almost about to wake you up myself. What perfect timing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're filled with total, utter dread as you suddenly remember your role. No, more than your role - this is now your entire life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you'll be a little more cooperative today. I've had a long, arduous day, and I've been holding it all in just for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looms over you, glaring down at you as if you were a bundle of feces on a sidewalk, and snickers. <br>\r\n\"My, you look so scared. You should be excited I have some sustenance for you. This is all the nourishment you get, after all. I'd enjoy it if I were you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, she swings around, presenting her rump to you and bringing its unwashed smell with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail lifts up and you take a moment to just look at it; her two coal-black cheeks pressed together to conceal her vile, volcanic sphincter. It sends shivers up and down your spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Clean it.\" She commands, her tone direct and officious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point almost every ember of resistance or rebellion has been snuffed out by Chrysalis. You could protest all you wanted, but you know the alternative would no doubt be much worse. Maybe at some point an opportunity will present itself for escape, but as it stands, all you can do is follow your orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretch your neck forwards and begin licking her cheeks, making sure your tongue covers every inch. Once she's satisfied, she reaches back and pulls her cheeks apart, practically peeling them away from each other and leaving a sticky, noxious film of sweat that has accumulated during the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start licking her clean again, suppressing the urge to gag and just powering through your task, feeling your tongue over every inch of rubbery flesh, making sure you spend a little extra time when you finally reach her puckered asshole. It tastes and smells like pure death, but that's still nowhere near as foul as the smells that come out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll do.\" She tells you, allowing you to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..but let's see how good you are at your intended use.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word of warning, still spreading her cheeks, she blasts you in the face with a foggy fart, which hits you with an intense sulfuric odor almost immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you have no choice but to sniff it, making sure your snorts are audible just in case she accuses you of holding your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel tears well in your eyes; partly in reaction to the sharp fumes and partly because it's killing you inside to bring yourself to perform such a low, humiliating task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. I can still fucking smell it. Do your job properly or don't do it at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sends her plot back with a thud, trapping your muzzle between her cheeks and pressing your head painfully against the edge of the seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nostrils are pumped with a fresh deluge of her thick, dizzying anal fumes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out a sight of relief. \"Don't you dare let me smell even a hint of that one or I'll break your leg.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know she's entirely serious, and do the best job your body will allow you to do to vacuum up every particle of her gas. It's a smell that somehow seems worse with each sniff, but you know that like her piss, it's something you're going to have to get used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a brief moment of silence, but once some of her pent-up gases have been evacuated it seems the rest comes barrelling out shortly after, vibrating against your muzzle with a wet bubbling sound that makes you feel sick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff as if her farts are some kind of necessity for your survival, which in a way, they are. It's difficult to not find yourself completely overpowered by the sheer potency of the fumes, but you use every modicum of strength you have to make sure every bit of it goes into your lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad.\" She says, coldly, keeping your head planted into her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you're lightheaded. Your headache has only gotten more painful, but all you can focus on is your mistress' farts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets another moist fart rumble against your face for five or six seconds, and then waits to hear you promptly guzzle it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really love my gas, don't you, slut? You really are pathetic.\" She chuckles to herself, and eventually pulls her ass away, leaving its sweaty, disgusting stench paired to your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your head fall back helplessly, recovering from the ordeal but quickly realising you're incredibly starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses and looks back. <br>\r\n\"Did I tell you you could talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what do I do about food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks. \"I told you. That's all you're getting. That's it. My farts. I suppose if you <i>really</i> wanted it, I could consider giving you something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My shit. You did a passable job with my farts, so if you really ask nicely, I suppose I could let you. If I do, though, you'll become a slave for my ass, my farts, and my waste. You'll need to take care of it as thoroughly as everything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there... nothing else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. That's it. I suppose you won't last quite as long subsisting on only my gas, but perhaps you'd prefer things to go that way. For you to be put out of your unending misery. Or maybe you'd somehow survive on the minuscule amounts of salt and sugar in my sweat. The choice is there. Make a decision now, because I can tell you you won't get a chance like this ever again. I'm feeling uncharacteristically generous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a quick moment to think things over. As desperate as you are for something to eat, are you really so desperate that you'll settle for literal feces? You don't imagine there's enough nutrition in it to even sustain you, but it's... something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it's quite a horrifying thing to commit to. It's bad enough having to inhale each and every one of her farts, but her solid waste being added to the list would make life an even greater hell. Perhaps if you survived on her farts for just a little longer, you could find some way to escape. Convince one of the guards to set you free, maybe. Promise them something in return... if you even had anything to promise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" She asked again. You could tell by her tone this was the last time she'd ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have to say I was hoping you'd make that decision. I've been hoping for a new shit slave since my last one...\" She pauses, simply giggling to herself and approaching her throne - and you - again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, why not start straight away? I'm sure you're dying for something to eat.\" Her tongue flicked out like a snake as she revelled in the satisfaction of knowing she had you in the lowest possible position you could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a ghostly sigh escape your lips; the last shred of hope flittering away and leaving you to become what you now were: a husk whose only purpose was to serve your queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Open up. Don't think I'm going to lower my tolerance with this any less than with my farts. I expect you to do just as thorough a job.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed her command, opening your jaw as wide as possible and levering back your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked once more, turning her weighty plot to you and pressing it up towards your face as she had done before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear her straining; letting out forceful feminine grunts as her stomach worked away to relieve her of her waste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared, terrified of her anus. It winked, shrivelled and distended; at any moment it could open up and unleash her feces, leaving you no choice but to eat it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, though, an airy fart seeped out with a steady hiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider that a treat, because it's about to get a <i>whole</i> lot worse.\" She lets out a booming, authoritative bellowing chuckle, finding your utter humiliation about the funniest thing she's ever witnessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart picks up its pace as, finally, she starts to squeeze out her actual solid waste. An almost greeny-brown log peeks out from her asshole, and with a little extra push from her, slowly coils out with a wet, slick, slimy noise that makes your stomach turn, though the repentantly rank stench that hits you doesn't make things better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your mouth open, trying as best as you can to aim it so her shit-snake will drop down into it. You don't want to imagine what she'd do if you allowed it to fall on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessss\" She hisses, deriving fervent satisfaction as she peers between her legs at you, giving her sphincter and squeeze and watching her own shit fall with a thud into your open, waiting mouth. It sends a shiver of arousal up and down her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm awfully sorry. I've given you rather a big load to start off with, but it's always best to jump right in, I say.\" She snickers, but you soon are unable to even focus on what she is saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected the taste to be awful, but <i>holy fucking Celestia</i>. Your taste buds have never experienced a flavor quite so foul and utterly revolting. It's beyond words, and so completely disgusting your first instinct is to spit it out. You know you can't, though, and even if it's the worst thing you've ever tasted, you find yourself chewing it up and swallowing it down quickly, so desperate for anything that could even vaguely resemble food. Even if it was once food, it's as far away as possible from that now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad. Usually they vomit the first time. I suppose you were born to eat my shit and huff my farts, you pathetic little worm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out another resounding chuckle and you merely whimper. The worst part is, even if it makes you want to tear your tongue out, your stomach hungers for more... You open your mouth, sticking out your stained tongue pleadingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this? You already want more? Well... good thing I had a big lunch, I suppose.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe draws her plot down a little closer, once again pushing out a thick, glistening log of changeling shit. You feel it slippery against your tongue. Just as bitter and horrible as before, but you eat it down. You know this is likely the only \"meal\" you'll be receiving today. At this stage your stomach just wants something to fill it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's hilarious. You're so pathetic! All you can eat is what my body deemed not worthy for me. All you can smell is the gases given off by the bacteria in my stomach. You're about as low as a living being can be. It's almost pitiful, but you're not deserving of my pity. Only my shit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe manages to produce another three or four logs for you to suck down hungrily, each one just as fat and heavy in your gullet as the last. Finally, to both your relief and slight dismay, she's finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clean it. I have business to attend to.\" She commands, and you do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer asshole feels tight against your tongue as you thoroughly clean the surface of her ass, sucking up every remaining stain and fragment of her waste. Your entire mouth is forever tainted in the atrocious taste of her shit, and the rest of your body is still stained in the stench of her piss. You truly have become a living toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passes by at a snail's pace. In some ways, the time where you're sitting with nothing but your thoughts is nearly as tortuous as the times Chrysalis is using you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, though, after what has to be six hours or more, she returns, pushing open the door to her throne room. She's returned for your evening meal. You consider yourself lucky to be given more than one a day, even if it's the most vile and sickening thing you've ever eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings aren't the same as earlier, though...</span></div></div>",

Saying yes to her horrendous offer would make your already hellish life at the hoof <i>(or butt rather)</i> of your evil queen ten times worse... But if you said no, you would starve to death... At least if you didn't manage to escape her stinky torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were out of time to consider it though, so you had to go with your instincts. Instincts are strong, but not always the best guidance for situations like these, however rare they may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll stick with your farts, your Majesty,\" you mutter, sensing she was about to get angry at your reluctance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd chosen the option where you would have to suffer the least. However, you had also just given yourself a theoretical death sentence. That's what instincts will do to you if you're a pathetic scared little pony by nature, make you take the least painful path, no matter the cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're breathing is heavy and strained, and you cry, realizing you're gonna die down here if you don't escape within a month or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic as always. Can't even suck it up and take a little brown. Well, your loss, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs and leaves you tied up to revel in your constant pee stench, additional fart smell, and existential thoughts, clearly enjoying the sound of you crying as she walks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning your hunger has gone from bad to horrendous. You feel like you could just roll over and die on the spot, but you knew that wasn't the case. A pony could last for a month with no food. No, your real dread was thirst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while a visibly bloated Queen wanders into her throne room, swaying her large rump as she approach her fart slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, fart-huffer. I had a big dinner yesterday, lots of cheese and wine, with cake, beans, and fresh pony meat. And now, I really need to fart. And after such a plush meal, I can tell they're gonna be smelly. Very smelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she turns around to align her rump with your still tied up face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan, very much in horror over having to smell such nasty-sounding stink bombs, but even more so from hearing about her food... food you would never taste again for the rest of your short, miserable life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the drill...\" she continues, slowly backing up. \"... if I catch even the tiniest whiff of my farts, I'll break your legs, loser. So you better snort my rump for all you're worth, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimper and sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked you a question, stallion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice is stern, rich with commanding aggression. She's the queen and she knows it. She refuses to be taken for granted. She asks you something, you better answer her, and be polite while you're at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it, my queen,\" you silently whimper, trying to prepare yourself for her farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scoffs before sitting down on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smell my asshole while you wait for my gas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you follow her orders, inhaling the intense stench of her musky butt. It smells even worse than yesterday, she clearly didn't clean her rump in between sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cry as you smell her asshole for about a minute until suddenly, her thick-ish stomach rumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, fuck. I can already feel these are gonna stink! You better fucking snort, bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brace yourself, and so does she, putting more pressure on her asshole, as well as putting more weight on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself being squished by her soft cheeks, and even worse, you feel her asshole opening up against your deeply enveloped snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnng!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blows her filthy stench across your face like a gust of deadly desert wind. It tears through your senses with it stark, beefy smell, burning its repulsiveness into your mind. It's so fucking rotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even with farts this unimaginably nasty, your fear of her is even more overwhelming, and so, you snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhale her literal stinkbomb for all you're worth, and you sniff her next emission with the same passion, your eyes watering due to their sheer harshness. They smell sickening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cry, but keep sniffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits on your face the entire day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, your hunger is far worse, and that thirst you feared had started kicking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely had any energy left when the queen appeared to torture you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, butt snorter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notices your awful state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks shocked for a moment, but then she laughs at your misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, perfect! It looks like it has finally happened! This is my favorite part,\" she cooes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her with tired eyes, tongue dangling out your mouth, not knowing what she means, but guessing you're about to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks closer, butt facing your face, and you brace yourself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... But she doesn't sit on you. She keeps her ass a couple of inches away, oddly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sniff hard!\" she commands before farting, and you do... you do, and something happens... something that hadn't happened before now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer farts are less smelly than yesterday's rotten butt burbs, but somehow, they are far worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are worse because even in this decaying form, they remind you of food... sustenance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hunger has gotten so bad that her farts are like food to you. Stinky, useless food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach growl as you smell it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, such a nice meal I had. It was yummy... Now it's just smelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snort, imagining the foods that once were, dancing with the ghost of sustenance, her ass-gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her farts run out, and you find yourself, both relieved and wishing for more stinkers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks away slowly and you whimper, wishing for her smelly plot to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles back at you, sadistically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at yourself. You hate my stinky butt but you're so hungry you need whatever tiny traces of what used to be food you can get your filthy hooves on. Ha! You're beyond pathetic, now. You're worthless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would cry, but you don't have any tears left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me clean your butt... please,\" you plead, with the most pathetic whimper you had ever uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed food so much, her filthy plot was appetizing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops in her track, sending you the dirtiest smile ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what... I'll give you a second chance. You can be my shit slut if you really want to...  but this time... there will be a steep price to pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept... I'll be a turd slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than an hour later, she feeds you some oatmeal. She did this to ensure you had the strength to carry out the harsh task she was about to give you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears flow as you consume the best meal in your life... The last non-scat meal you would ever enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... as for that price... Which do you prefer? I can either make you lick the butts of every single changeling princess in this hive clean, or I can make another batch of hormone piss, this time at full strength, which is at least 89 times stinkier than what I used on you, and this time, I'll make you drink it. I should probably mention I have more than 700 young potential queens, ready to have their asses eaten.\"</span></div></div>",

Refuse to believe her, because if her request was true, her words could cost you your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rolls her eyes at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I desire an ass slave. Somepony to kiss and smell my butt, and suck beefy farts out my ass whenever I desire them to suffer my gasses. And I've chosen you for the task. Will you take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes another moment to take in this request...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall to the ground in utter defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't do that,\" you say slowly, and carefully, scared and saddened to the core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles lightly, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, how sad, I didn't think I needed torture with you. You seemed too pathetic to defy me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I - It won't be needed, ma'am, I would simply like to find a better solution. We can talk about it, can't we?\" You try your best to sound respectful, hoping for mercy from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scoffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't <i>talk</i> with losers. I just command them. Like this: Horse, surrender yourself to your queen. Be a slave to her butt and submit to your new, nasty, humiliating life, <i>or</i>... prepare yourself to suffer in my torture chamber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start crying audibly. Sadness and anger. In half an hour, your entire life had been ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're a monster!\" you cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squints her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a no. Well, my brave little pony. Hope you don't regret that when you're bound in my torture chamber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her, finding whatever courage you had left. She was not going to give you mercy. She was here to break you. Pleading now would do nothing but please her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't. I'd rather be tortured that submit to your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not as pathetic as I thought, but you will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a light, and then... Darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken later, in a damp, dark dungeon, lit by a dim fire in a fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're tied up by your hooves. They're spread apart far, giving your torturer good access to every part of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breathing gets rapid with panic as you see her large figure looming in over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... how should we start?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You notice that up and further along the path is a little schoolhouse nestled between trees. You knew that Twilight supposedly had a school based in Ponyville, but this seemed like a place for younger fillies and colts to learn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got closer, it became immediately apparent that school was not in session - not today, anyway. The space outside the school was empty, and no noise seemed to come from inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to head back on yourself and find another area to explore, but as you passed by one of the half-opened windows, you noticed a mare sat inside, slumped over her desk and sporting a rather jaded expression; she was the teacher, you assumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped over a page and began writing down little notes in a red marker, sighing to herself and glancing up at the clock. Somehow she hadn't noticed you staring through the window at her, muttering something indistinguishable under her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere she seemed to reach down and rub her stomach, her mouth fixing into a tight grimace as she soothed her belly, shoulders slumped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the last time I get take out for lunch. What a stupid, stupid idea, Cheerilee.\" She chided herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked on, curious, but lowered yourself down so she wouldn't see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to your surprise, the pony rocked off to one side on her chair, making it creak under her weight, and let out a loud, reverberating fart, fanning it with her hoof and settling back down into her previous seated position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly Celestia! If she knew somepony had been watching that, she'd probably die from embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed wrong to spy on somepony like this. Maybe it would be better to call out to her and try to introduce yourself; act like you hadn't just witnessed her ripping flank. </span></div></div>",

For a moment, there's nothing but silence between you as she turns towards the window you were standing in, as if to confirm her fears. It seemed like she was about to say something when a gurgling sound from her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Miss?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Im fine, thanks, uh... I've never seen you around here before. What's your name?\" She tried to put on her best smile, but the look of embarrassment was clear on her face. It was best to try to and act like you hadn't witnessed anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Peppermint Swirl. I'm new here. I was just taking a look around.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem like your excuse woked as the pony responds with a defeated sigh. \"It's alright. You don't have to keep pretending. I already know you were there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I didn't meant to eavesdrop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's okay. Would you like to come inside? The door's open.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestures to the open doorway. Rounding the schoolhouse, you head inside; she waves you over, and you take a seat on a stool across from her. She tries to act nonchalant, but the faint blush on her cheeks betrays her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you say you're new here?\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Yeah, I just arrived a few hours ago. I'm working as Princess Twilight's new assistant.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then let me be the first to welcome you to Ponyville. I'm Cheerilee.\" She extends her hoof for a shake, but her greeting is interrupted by another gurgling sound, making her wince as she pulls her hoof back to rub her stomach. \"Sorry. Let's just say I had something rather... questionable for lunch earlier. It's been causing for me problems all day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glances down at the notes on her desk. You see that she'd been grading assignments from her students, some of which had been marked in red. Looking back up, she gives you an anxious look. \"Say, you wouldn't mind helping me with something, would you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a quizzical look. \"What do you need?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" She takes a breath, nudging herself to continue. \"It's just, I have these papers I need to grade, and my, err... <i>emissions </i>are sort of distracting, so I may need you to help, ehem... muffle them.\" </span></div></div>",

What I need is something that'll help to muffle the sound, and probably the smell, while I work on grading the rest of the assignments.\" She gives you a nervous glance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly did you have in mind?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee shuffles hesitantly before pointing her hoof. \"You...\" <br>\r\nGetting up, she motions you over to her side of the desk. \"Unfortunately, there isn't anything here that I can adequately use, so I was sort of hoping your face could, y'know... I-If that's alright with you, of course.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles, but you see the blush on her face getting redder as she tries to explain. You can tell it must have taken a lot of willpower for her to even consider asking this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever you're ready.\" She gestures to the stool behind her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou oblige and get into yourself into position. Sitting down with your body underneath the desk, you lay your head face up on the wooden stool. As you try to get comfortable, the sight of Cheerilee's magenta cheeks soon eclipses your vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glances over her shoulder, giving you a nervous look before she takes her seat, gently lowering her rump down onto your face. Your muzzle slips in between her cheeks as she gets settled. Her dock rests against your forehead as her tail is draped over your head. She shuffles herself a bit, wiggling her rear, and you feel your nose being shoved up against her anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can still smell traces of her earlier gaseous release, the faint stench leaking into your nostrils. It wasn't an entirely pleasant smell, but you had already agreed to help her with this, so you didn't complain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Cheerilee start to work, marking down the assignments on her desk. Before long, she winces as her stomach emits a low ominous gurgle. She tenses up, leaning a bit to the side and giving you a fraction of a second of fresh air before her anus flares, and a somewhat loud, raspy fart erupts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound is indeed muffled, vibrating against your cheeks as it bellows out. Not a second later are you assaulted with the smell, the scent of what seemed like half-digested hay and nuts filling your nostrils. Whatever she had for lunch was definitely <i>not </i>agreeing with her, the results of which were wreaking havoc on both of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" You hear Cheerilee gasp before she strains herself again, and another more drawn-out fart is released. You feel it slip out roughly against your cheeks, same as the last one, the ensuing smell occupying the small space between your nose and her anus. \"Heh... Excuse me. I didn't expect my lunch to be this bad. I hope it isn't too bad down there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sounded genuinely worried, so it was nice to know that she was keeping aware for your well-being. \"I've already gotten through most of the assignments, so the rest shouldn't take too long. Just... try not to pass out on me, alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are left to deal with the vestigial emissions, Cheerilee turns her attention back to the assignments on her desk. A few minutes pass before she shifts herself again, lifting a cheek off your face as a short, windy blast of hot gas shoots from her tailhole. Your nose scrunches, the rotten stench washing over your face. Cheerilee readjusts her position, her cheeks wrapping perfectly around your face and trapping you in a stinky hotbox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of your session continues on; Cheerilee manages to eke out another fart which you dutifully inhale, your eyes watering with each sniff you took. The smell obviously wasn't getting any better, but you try to make due, nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long after Cheerilee lifts herself up, her rump rising off your face and allowing you to breathe some fresh air. She glances down, giving you a sympathetic smile, and helps you to your hooves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" she asks. You nod, and your attention turns to her desk. All of her students' papers were graded, set aside in a neat little stack. \"Everything's done, but I think there's still one more I need to let go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a pretty good idea of what she was alluding to as she points bashfully to her rump. Turning around, she leans on her desk as you kneel behind her, pressing your nose against her anus. She grunts, and you are once more blasted with a loud, sputtery fart, the sound muffled as you press your face against her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow...\" Cheerilee fans her hoof in front of her muzzle, a faint blush on her cheeks. She turns around as you stand back up. \"Thanks for your help, Peppermint. I really appreciate it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Happy to help.\" It certainly wasn't something you expected to help with, but she was grateful all the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way towards the exit, Cheerilee calls out to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, you wouldn't mind sticking around a little longer, would you?\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're busy with Twilight, being her assistant and all, but I was wondering if you'd like to help around at the school once in a while. I could always use a teacher's aide and your... <i>performance </i>really convinced me. It's all up to you, of course.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is an interactive story based on MLP:FIM, and focused on fart fetish material.<br>\r\nScat is also allowed, as well as fetishes like watersports, slob, weight gain, sweat, feeding and all those which are related to gross bodily functions, although chapters which include any wildly different fetishes will be removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there are any chapters which are written in a vastly different style, I may adjust them. Don\u2019t take this personally, it\u2019s just that I\u2019d like for this story to flow well and if there are random chapters written in a completely different style it may be a bit jarring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, some paths will be more comedic and light on the sexual themes while others will be more sexual and purerly fetish-based. I don\u2019t mind how far you want to go with these elements just as long as they\u2019re still related to the fetishes mentioned above<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, I like to look at each branch almost like an alternate timeline. Characters can appear more than once in different storylines, so for example there can be a branch mainly featuring rainbow dash, but she can also appear in another character\u2019s branch, which will be different to her own one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last note: I started writing this during the airing of season 8. It\u2019s set canonically somewhere in the middle of season 9, although obviously it\u2019s sort of set in its own version of Equestria anyway. There are some elements pulled from the end of s9, but for all intents and purposes it takes place BEFORE the season 9 finale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, hope you enjoy! </td>",
