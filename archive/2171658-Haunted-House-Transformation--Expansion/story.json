It was only Seven O'clock in the evening, but darkness had fallen quickly, and they could barely see two feet in front of them. Using the flashlight on her iPhone, the tallest of the group led the way towards the vast, looming mansion before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building had been abandoned for years, but never demolished. Rumours swirled that it's former owners had been into all sorts of strange, dark arts, and the entire area had been avoided by the locals for the last few decades. It was an imposing sight, towering over the small forest that surrounded the remote area in which it was located. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group moving gingerly through the fog would rather have been anywhere else; but they were all united by a common goal. The night before, their friend, Stacey, had been on one of her regular jogs through the woods, when she had decided to take some pictures with the mansion in the background. The last time they had heard from Stacey, she had joked about looking inside and taking some pictures for her Instagram, and then...nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have the door,\" the leader of the group fumbled for a door knob, shining the light from her phone on the enormous, mahogany entrance to the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an ominous creek, the front door swung inward, allowing the group to step over the threshold and into the house. They were more than a little alarmed to see that the entire main hall was illuminated by fully lit candles and lanterns, creating a warm glow everywhere they looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...this isn't terrifying at all,\" said Emma, adjusting her glasses as she looked around the room nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like the Bates Motel,\" said Carrie. She had come straight from work and was still dressed in a button up shirt and tight skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just hurry up and get out of here,\" said Beth, rubbing her shoulders to stay warm. \"I bet she's not even here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're here now,\" said the leader of the group, a tall, determined looking girl named Katie. \"We know for a fact that Stacey was here. Let's see if we can call her from inside...\" Katie reached into her pocket and took out her phone, only to find she had absolutely no signal. \"Ah crap...anyone got any signal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the others checked their phones, and shook their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. That's a good start,\" Emma sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...plan of action...we split up and search this place.

Katie had been half tempted to keep them all together, but the house was huge, and it made more sense to split up and cover more ground. From the looks on their faces though, the others were more than a little afraid; while she couldn't exactly blame them, she did think the paranoia and local legend about this place was ridiculous. All that \"haunted house\" crap cooked up by the locals was absolutely nonsense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the place certainly looked the part, and the eerie lit candles upon their entry were certainly a little odd. But that was probably just some local teens using the place as their private boozing spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie might not have pushed the others so hard to come here had she not felt somewhat responsible for Stacey's disappearance; the day she vanished, Katie had been due to meet her for their regular evening jog, but due to heavy traffic on her commute back from work, she had been forced to cancel at the last minute. Their route often took them by this house, and Stacey had often joked about going inside, but Katie had always told her it would be a waste of time, and probably trespassing. Without Katie there to stop her, Stacey's curiosity may well have gotten the better of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was wearing a pair of jeans and a tank top that showed off her toned physique, and she shuddered as she walked along the gloomy hallway ahead. It seemed to be getting colder. She glanced around at several different doorways...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If so, this stuff is long expired...or there is no food left in here. What is going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie wandered the kitchen for a bit with several thoughts going through her head.

I'm sorry for not holding tha' door open for a guest.\" Katie was surprised to hear a voice, she didn't expect someone to reply back so cordially. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Standing just on the other side of the doorway was a nearly waif-like figure. Tall enough to nearly fill the doorway, slender hands with red nails, and legs like a model. The figure however possess a few unique additions to her appearance. For example, her lips were a stunning carmine. Contrasting with her very pale lips, which is something the figure also possessed. She wasn't like a Caucasian pale, but pale like a sheet of paper. From what Katie could see, the woman also had strikingly vivid, violet eyes.  Katie rationalized it away as contact lenses.  Long, raven frolics curled down to her shoulders, they were curled in such a way that they looked more like doll hair.  Covering this stunning model was, a frankly surreal sight, a chef uniform. Pure white, black slacks, an apron, and even a long chef hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However, what drawn Katie's most attention was something right in front of her. Something that was frankly hard <i>not</i> to notice. This model character, who didn't even appear to eaten anything larger than a salad, possessed a straining top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Katie eyed the front of the chef's uniform with interest. The buttons seemed to be almost popping off the uniform. She must of been a D-cup or DD, at the very <i>least</i>. Katie couldn't understand it, why would such a skinny women want such a large bust? Katie watched the front of the uniform, she swear that the woman's bust grew a little .Katie stood at the doorway, watching the woman's bust like a falcon, until her thoughts were broken by a \"Ahem\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Katie looked up at the woman's face, who seconds ago sounded friendly, which went against  her now quizzically looking face. Katie realized she was staring at another woman's bust. She quickly did her best to play off what just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm so sorry, I didn't realize. Its just you bus-... I mean your boo-...I'm just going to stop right there. Hello, I'm Katie, my friends and I were looking around this mansion for our friend Stacy. We didn't realize there were people here, sorry for intruding. You don't happen to be the owner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"\" Ah, don't worry dear. I get those kinda looks from o'da peepole. Unfortunatlee, I ain't da owner of this establishment, they'll be coming soon enough. I'm da head chef of here.  Ima Elizabeth and please to meet ya.\" The woman possessed an Cajun accent, which was frankly very thick. Another contrast with her prim and proper appearance.  Elizabeth offered an open hand to Katie, who in turn took it, they shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Com on down and take a seat, dear. Da guests wont arrive fer anoda few 'ours\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Elizabeth lead Katie from the doorway and into the dining hall. Katie's eyes figuratively popped out of her skull. The room was <i>huge</i>, a chandelier was on the roof;a dining table that could fit at least twenty people was in the middle of it; even an area for a small band was located here. The dining table itself had a feast on it, ranging from vegetarian dishes to meats to cheeses. The aroma was heavenly to Katie, who sucked it all in. If she didn't take her training so seriously, she might have even asked for a bite. Elizabeth kindly ushered Katie to the nearest seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what abat that frend of ya'lls? This, Stacey, was it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, did you see her anywhere?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Weeellll, dar was dis fine lass who came here awhile ago. One of my girls relayed it to me dat she seemed to have used our kitchens. Last I heard she went down da cellar. I can show it to you, if ya want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Elizabeth beamed at Katie, her smile and eyes looking at her for any motion. Katie looked at Elizabeth and suddenly she felt weird, like there was something else covering her mind. She didn't feel that a minute ago, what changed? Was it Katie looking at Elizabeth's face more than her bust? Was it the fact that Katie knew this house wasn't for sale? Was it Katie going through the entire conversation with Elizabeth, noting that there didn't appear to be any early arrivals nor other workers currently? There were so many factors going about that Katie needed some space to think things through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the middle of her thinking, she heard a loud clang and saw a pot had fallen as the door leading to the dining room was closing. Katie taking initiative ran towards the door in hopes of getting some sort of clue of these mysterious happenings. Upon opening the double doors, she was greeted by a familiar and welcoming smell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the table was Katie's favorite guilty pleasure dish: a large bowl of loaded four-cheese mac n cheese with crispy bacon, with an extra large chocolate milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's stomach grumbled, and against better judgement she made her way over to the long dining table swiftly and took a seat, ready to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a goner after that first mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moreish, creamy cheese covered every inch of Katie's mouth, with the sharp saltiness of the bacon cutting through. Before Katie knew it, she was shoveling spoonful after spoonful through her lips, but the bowl wasn't emptying. The same could be said for the milkshake - every time Katie took a slurp, the drink would stay exactly as full as it had before she'd even had a taste of the thick, rich goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if Katie was in her own world and that she'd forgotten the reason she was even in the mansion in the first place as she stuffed her face, and had no idea what it was already doing to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, her body was starting to expand. At first, it was a thin layer of fat covering the toned muscles she has worked so hard to maintain as a personal trainer. Then, as her stomach filled out it went from bring rock hard and stuffed to its limits to becoming soft and doughy as it kept expanding, her tank top becoming so tight that soon enough it rode up and strained itself under the two globes that had appeared on her chest. In recent years, Katie had stopped wearing bras as her small breasts hadn't needed them, but now they were back-breakers she was sure to need one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's hips and thighs had also widened, losing definition as the pillowy skin developed and her thighs finally touched for the first time and continued to grow outwards as if in competition with her sides and love handles formed on her lower back. Even her face took a hit as chubby cheeks covered her natural sharp cheekbones and her neck disappeared under a double chin and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed totally oblivious to her transformation, or the creaks the chair she was sat in was making as it tried to accommodate her new girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the spell over the food seemed to wear off as Katie finally scraped the bottom of the bowl and swallowed the last gulp of her shake. She let out a big sigh, groaned and lent back in the chair, her chubby fingers massaging her flabby belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...that was <i>good</i>...\" Katie murmured, still unaware that she'd gained 100lbs. It looked as if she never worked out, rather than working out for a living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, she heaved herself up off the chair, her heavy body surprising her and throwing her a little off-balance so that she stumbled, before she managed to steady herself. She shifted uncomfortably in her too-tight, too-small clothing - her shorts were barely holding together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, I must've eaten a little too much there.\" She mused as she slowly waddled out of the dining room, still unaware of the change that had occured.</span></div></div>",

She hadn't heard the others take the stairs, and she figured they probably wouldn't want to risk going up there alone. Out of her friends, Katie was certainly the bravest, and she knew it. She hurried up the stairs, falling easily into a quick jog as she ascended the huge staircase.  On the upper floor, there seemed to be an endless amount of doors; way more than Katie would have thought were even possible, even for a house this size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three different hallways to choose from; one to the left, one to the right and one straight on. Katie had no idea which one led to what, so decided to start with the left and work her way across. She headed down the gloomy, dimly lit hall, seeing no signs of life or any movement at all. She was at least expecting to see an occasional Spider, but nope, nothing at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie decided to start at the end of hall and work her way back. Turning the handle of the last doorway in the corridor, she carefully pushed it open, half expecting someone, or something, to jump out at her. She had watched enough horror movies in her life to know this was usually when a cliche jump scare occurred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once again, there was nothing. It was almost disappointing. Katie looked around and saw she was in a rather fancy looking bedroom, with a large four poster bed in its centre and an enormous wardrobe and set of drawers on the far side. Directly opposite the bedroom was a large, full length mirror. Katie walked over and briefly checked her reflection; she was a slender, toned girl. Her had a pair of small, perky breasts and a relatively flat ass, with toned, almost washboard abs. She wasn't quite as curvy as some of her friends, or as busty, but her sharp, angular features gave her a very beautiful, aristocratic face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked back at herself, she saw a strange glimmer of light flash across the mirror's glass. Squinting, she lent in for a closer look...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What would you change...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whispering voice came from nowhere, and Katie froze in place. For a moment, she found herself unable to respond, her eyes focused intently on her own reflection. Though she didn't know why, she found herself compelled to answer the question...</span></div></div>",

Before Katie could question any further, there was another flash of light on the mirror, and then... nothing but silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, that was... bizarre.\" Katie said, completely confused. Deciding she had spent enough time in the room, she turned and started to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could make it very far, though, she felt something... odd. There was this strange warmth on her chest. Not only that, but it felt like her B cup bra was a bit tighter then it was earlier that day. Confused, Katie looked down, and was surprised by the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boobs actually seemed to be growing. Her previous B cups had grown into D's, and still seemed to be swelling. Her tank top was starting to strain from her new bust, since it wasn't designed for that size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" Katie exclaimed, shocked. \"Did... did that mirror do this? This is unbelievable... but at the same time, kind of nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her boobs swelled into E cup territory, Katie walked back to the mirror and looked at her reflection. She did have to admit, weird as this was, she was happy to have a bigger bust. Then she felt her bra get tighter, and decided to shed her tank top and bra, lest they rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a little bit due to her new size, but she did get her top and bra off, leaving her boobs out free. By this point, they had grown into F cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, that's a good size.\" Katie said. \"Hopefully they'll stop here. ...wait, does the mirror know I want them to stop? Hey, voice, if you can hear me, can you stop the growth please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence. Katie looked back at the mirror, and saw that her boobs...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her boobs were too heavy now, but Katie worried that might change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her boobs now H cups, Katie looked back at her bra and tank top, which had been thrown onto the neatby bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no way in hell I'm getting those back on.\" She said. The instant she did, she felt a surge of warmth go through her chest. Looking down, she was upset to see that her boobs had a quick spurt, shooting past H, I, and J, and going right to K cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cripes, this things are getting huge.\" Katie said, as she cupped her huge boobs. They did feel rather soft and warm. If it weren't for them constantly growing, Katie could get used to this feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her breasts swelled into L cup territory, Katie decided to start looking for clothes. She really didn't want to be walking around topless. That, and her boobs were getting heavier, and she needed the support. If this room had a magic mirror, chances were good it had bras that would fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the set of drawers, feeling her massive boobs wobble and jiggle with each step. When she reached the drawers, she opened the top drawer and looked inside. As luck would have it, it was filled with bras of many sizes, from tiny A cups to bras that she weren't even sure fit in the alphabet. She sincerely hoped she wouldn't get that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, she saw her boobs had reached M cup, and were quickly turning into N cups. She decided to grab a couple of bras that were a few sizes past N, to prepare for any future growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grabbed them, her mind started to wander. Why the hell did this house have that mirror? Did it have something to do with the previous owner? What if it had something to do with Stacey's disappearance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer musing was interrupted by another surge of warmth. Her boobs once again had a spurt, this time shooting past N, O, P, and Q, and jumping right to R cups. Now irritated, she grabbed a few more bras of bigger sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her finds, she walked over to the bed and sat down. Her new bust was starting to hurt her back, and she needed to rest. Slowly laying down, Katie sighed. This was not how she wanted things to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her hands under her head, Katie, for reasons unknown to her, started to drift off into sleep, her bust still growing.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Katie awoke. She tried to get up, only to feel the weight of her bust. With another try, she sat up, and looked at her boobs. Fortunately, they stopped growing. Unfortunately, they were now...</span></div></div>",

She currently had on her two milky spheres of heft woman flesh. Two mountains of boob that covered her entire vision from the rest of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully on her back, Katie could feel the weight press against her ribcage. They were heavy, but not as heavy as she expected them to be. She wasn't crushed to oblivion,thank goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, Katie brought her fingers to poke one of the moons. A squish greeted her nimble finger, it slowly sunk into the mass. Wobbling and jiggling madly for a few moments upon her finger being taken away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\" Katie could only state as she saw the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stayed on the cold floor for a few more minutes, right until she decided to get up. Which was a Herculean task for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her elbows down onto her side, she grunted as she heaved upwards with all her might.The woman's back moved an inch above the brown wood, before it slammed back down with an audible thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, this is going to suck.\" Katie stated, realizing the depth of her situation.Looking for a place not on cold, dusty floors, Katie spotted a nice chair that appeared to be able support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled and heaved as the woman dragged her body over to a chair. Placing both hands onto the seat, she pushed up with every ounce of strength. It was working! Katie could feel herself go higher from the floor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her boobs smacked against the hard wood,causing no end to Katie's discomfort. It was troublesome, but eventually she had managed to get her breasts to work themselves onto the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing some maneuvers,quick thinking, and determination, Katie managed to replace her breasts with her butt. More clearly meaning she had seated herself on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping her brow, she looked down at her canyon of cleavage, which rested and covered her entire lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't right!\" She bemoaned. A shuffle at the door brought her attention from her breasts to the door, who could it be?</span></div></div>",

WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR TITS?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was shocked at the site of her friend sitting in a chair with a gargantuan pair of boobs sitting in her lap. Katie chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, ah... yeah.\" Katie said. \"There's a bit more to this place then I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding!\" Emma yelled. \"I've seen yoga balls that were smaller. What the hell happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie pointed to the mirror on the other side of the room. \"See that mirror?\" She started. \"I was staring at it, and some voice asked me what I would change. I felt like I had to answer for some reason, so I said I wanted bigger boobs, and... well, I got them alright.\" To emphasize that, she gave her left boob a light slap. That action caused her boobs to wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma walked up to Katie, completely gobsmacked. \"Can I...\" She started to say. Katie knew what Emma was asking, and nodded. Emma kneeled down a little, and starting poking Katie's engorged bust. It certainly felt soft and warm, and the smallest motion caused it to wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable.\" Emma replied when she was done. \"You think there's a way to reverse this? Or are we going to have to start getting your bras custom made?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny.\" Katie said. \"Help me up, and we can think of something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded, and grabbed Katies arms when she held them out. Emma started pulling Katie up, which proved to be a monumental feat. It took a minute and a few false starts, but Katie was finally up. Now standing, on shakey legs, Katie saw that her boobs now hung to just slightly below her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn these things are heavy.\" Katie said, putting her left hand on her back. \"Feels like I've got sandbags attached to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so what should we do?\" Emma asked. \"You said the mirror did this. What if you asked it to shrink you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to risk it. It might make me bigger, and I don't want that.\" Katie replied. \"Maybe we can look around the house, see if something in it can help. Hand me that bedsheet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma did so, and Katie starting wrapping the sheet around her boobs. After a second, she turned the sheet into a makeshift bra. It helped a little, but the weight was still an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm decent... sort of.\" Katie replied. \"Let's get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma and Katie made their way to the bedroom door. Emma walked out first, and Katie followed, her boobs brushing the door frames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooner I get rid of these things the better.\" Katie replied. \"So, where should we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's voice died in her throat when something happened.

Her boobs felt like overfilled sandbags at the moment. \"Maybe we were just imagine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thought trailed off as she finally looked near the back of the room, completely stunned. Emma followed her gaze, and was just as surprised. Because they found the figure that the voice belonged too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure was a woman, a ghostly woman. She had long grey hair and an attractive face with pale blue eyes. Her skin was a pale white and glowing slightly. But that wasn't her most notable feature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat honor belonged to the fact that she was leaning on the largest breasts either Katie or Emma had ever seen. They looked about 5 feet tall and 5 feet wide. They were resting on the floor, but still managed to get the ghost woman in a standing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at the two girls, and smiled sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally... after so long...\" The woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Katie asked, eyes glued to the woman's immense bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Aileen.\" The woman said. \"And I am cursed. Doomed to remain a spirit, trapped in this room by my own body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" Emma asked. \"Did you die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly.\" Aileen said. \"I was a model. One of the best. I was vain, always looking down on those who I thought weren't as beautiful. But I was upset. I never could get a larger bust. One day, as I walked, I felt compelled to enter this manor. I found a mirror, and it asked my greatest desire. I asked for a larger bosom... and got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds familiar.\" Katie said, looking at her own enlarged bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the wish was twisted.\" Aileen said. \"My bust continued to swell larger and heavier. Eventually, I became so large that I could not leave this room, but still I grew, until I became too heavy to move from this spot. Then, something in the house cursed me into a spirit. And you-\" She pointed at Kaite. \"-are now doomed to share my fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Katie yelled. \"No, there has to be a way to stop this! We can save you and us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is too late for me.\" Aileen said. \"I am doomed to remain a spirit, and to keep this bust, for eternity. However, I believe I can help you.

If you help me move, I can assist you in finding a solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked at Katie. \"Do we trust her?\" She asked quietly. \"For all we know, this could be a trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.

But we can work that out later. Please, help me move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma and Katie got to work attaching the pump to Aileen's boobs. Once that was done, they turned the pump on, and watched it milk Aileen. As it did, her boobs started to shrink. Emma also noticed that the pump wasn't glass, but some odd combination of leather and metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the pump stopped. Aileen's bust had shrunk quite a bit, now only seeming as big as beach balls. Aileen stood up tall, showing that she was about 6 feet in height.

She then stood still for a moment and said she wanted a bigger rear. Once she said that, her butt started to balloon like a pair of...well balloons. She kept growing until we had to have her cut out and sent elsewhere since she was a walking disaster. Apparently, the mirror has a curse on it. A curse of vanity. Anyone who stands before the mirror will be overtaken by the mirrors power, stating what they believe to be the most flawed part of their body. Once that is done, the selected part will grow and grow until they can no longer move or end up outgrowing the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that it.

Seconds later, the floor in front of them collapsed, cutting off part of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, crap.\" Katie said. \"Guess we either go right, or backtrack.\" As if on cue, the two heard a roar coming from behind them. \"...go right it is then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sister raced down the right hallway, listening as the roar of the monster behind them get quieter. Eventually, the two came to a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to check it out?\" Erika asked.

Now small enough, Katie opened the door and walked through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, you're turn.\" Katie said. \"These boobs are so hideous.\" Katie's boobs grew while Erika's shrank, and Erika managed to get through the door, shutting it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this whole curse is annoying, but at least we know how it works now.\" Katie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika nodded, and looked at where they entered. It was another hallway, but with an odd change. There were no doors whatsoever on the walls, the hall had dozens of branching paths, there were huge metal bars in front of them, and in front of the bars, a large wooden cart, big enough to fit two 4 foot pumpkins. Next to it was a stand with a vial of pink liquid in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the cart?\" Katie asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika walked up to it, and saw a note inside. She picked up the note and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wish to proceed through this hall, there is a special requirement. One of you must drink the vial on the stand next to the cart. This will make your breasts grow to immense sizes, and make them extremely heavy. You must use the cart to carry your breasts through this hall. There is a door at the other end, but it will take quite a while to reach. Also, this growth is irreversable with an antidote, which you will recieve once you leave this hall. If you do not do this, you will be trapped in this hall forever.\" Erika read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked at the cart, then the vial. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just great, one of us has to be stuck with mammoth boobs and using that cart until we leave this hall.\" Katie grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't exactly have a choice.\" Erika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not drinking that.\" Katie said. \"...rock paper scissors? Loser drinks the vial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can be so immature sometimes, but fine.\" Erika said. The two then played one game of rock paper scissors.

She should have been outside, hanging out with her friends or spending time with her wife. But instead, she was stuck in this labyrinth with Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked at her immense bosom. She wished she hadn't answered that stupid mirror. She should have just walked away, but no. Now she had to deal with this. Hopefully, though, not for much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Erika came to an intersection. The exit was nowhere in sight, so she stopped pushing the cart and stretched her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is taking too long.\" Katie said. \"I really dont' want to spend the rest of my life stuck in this cart.

The monster wasn't some giant animal, but was quite humanoid. And quite feminine, as it possessed an hourglass figure and a fairly pretty face, only marred by it's massive mouth filled with mirror shard-like teeth. It's skin was dark grey, it's black hair was completely wild, and it's eyes were solid black. It also had some clothing in the form of a torn black dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being took one look at Erika, and pushed her aside.

The being was gone, and Katie with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika wanted to start sobbing, but was interrupted by a warmth in her bust.

On the wall was a note, and under that note was another vial, this one filled with orange liquid. Erika took the note off the wall and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know who you are, Erika. Your sister is changed. She is now a living mirror, and will be taking the place of the one that is broken. If you want to see her again, you will have to find her. However, there is one stipulation. You must drink the orange liquid. It will make your boobs fill to the absolute brim with milk, but you will be completely unable to lactate. If you don't do this, you will never see your sister again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika stared at the note, angry and confused. \"What kind of perverted whack-job made this place?!\" She yelled. But if it was the only way, she would have to. She grabbed the vial, and consumed the liquid. Instantly, she started to feel her boobs fill up with milk.

It was an old abandoned house, and she'd probably just overheard one of her friends exploring another room. But it did make her head jerk. In the mirror she saw an exercise machine. Sure she'd have noticed it on entering, she whirled around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sat there, a pristine metal exercise machine, that didn't belong. She was proud of being taut, and toned, and liked the expression on her boyfriend's face at her athletic endeavours. Her svelte body, and the stamina to tire out her man was something she was proud of. However, a niggle at the back of her mind teased out a guilty confession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was curious how she'd look if she were bubblicious, with a bootiful body and curves that inspired envy from some and appreciation from others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrutting over to the exercise machine. She checked it over, everything seemed to be in working order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off her jacket, she'd dressed simply. Expecting to get dirty exploring a 'haunted' house. She was wearing an old blue leotard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie settled into the seat, and checked the weights weren't too extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e2/8d/20/e28d20a2e65801a71149badca8ba015c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e2/8d/20/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving it an experimental pull, she quickly found her rhythm, controlling the weights as they rose, and fell. Avoiding the nasty clashing clang, as the weights settled back down. It was part of Katie's routine, that she found relaxing... almost hypnotic. A few more reps had her getting warm. Feeling the need to get back to exploring, Katie found she couldn't rise from the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms working without her conscious control. Her hands refusing to release the bar. Katie felt the warmth of exercised muscles.... But the burning wasn't in her arms. She felt her bum start to warm. Looking down, she saw she seemed to be covering more of the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0d/b6/74/0db674dc4f9befe0c1b914018a1a672b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0d/b6/74/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rump expanding, as though the machine were adding weight rather than burning it off. The desire to cry out, to call for help from her friends died, in her throat. A croaking rasp was all that escaped. She was forced to concentrate on her breathing, as her arms ached. Her butt continued to warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried, again and again to stop.... to release the bar... to call out.... but her shoulders ached, and she continued her reps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0e/7f/92/0e7f9274b011dad03914161b61824704.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0e/7f/92/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... was ... curious...\" she gasped between repetitions. \"But... But... I don't want this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever was controlling her, changing her was blind to her pleas for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/78/89/27/788927362185e7fd7d3d3eedf9d9fd9a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/78/89/27/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure it was humanly possible to have hips this wide. A crack echoed around the room, and she felt her pelvis widen. \"Please... Please...\" she begged, as tears threatened to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut mercy remained absent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful what you wish for....\" the whispering voice returned. Katie was shaking her head in denial, in disbelief. But she could feel the ripple of her succulent flesh, it was too real to deny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/dc/fd/df/dcfddf4a84a0364f12d270d609ffb157.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/dc/fd/df/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt positively equine, as her hips gave another crack. Her rump swelling, this time the growth stopped. With a shriek of outrage, Katie felt the magic release her, and she erupted from the machine.</span></div></div>",

She could feel the heft of her new rump, the extra sway in her hips, and the tight material threatening to cut off her circulation to her legs. The leotard wasn't tailored for her new physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning this way and that, she ran her hands over her new curves. While her mirror-self reflected the svelte Katie caressing her toned legs, and slim-line rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanting her hands on her hips, she glared at the reflection taunting her from the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror smiled back at her. The frown on her face not matched by her skinny doppelganger. \"There's more of you to love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screwed her eyes shut, swallowing deep breaths. This had to be an illusion, it had to be a delusion. Releasing the breath with a slow huff. She squared up to the mirror, \"You're not real.\" she told it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror image didn't answer, instead nodding a denial, that same taunting smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I can't ... this... it isn't possible...\" she gave her lush thighs a slap, sending a ripple through them. Feeling the ripple roll all the way around. Katie knew her body couldn't change so much, so suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're real.\" she said uncertainly, \".. and I'm... I'm not real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror Katie was shaking her head now. \"No... we're both real... and I can prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie found her arm rising copying her mirror self, until her hand was at shoulder height. She glared at the hand, as it refused to respond to her will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snap of her fingers, and the skinny Katie vanished from the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeaked in shock, as she matched her mirror self. Everything looking as it should. Reaching forward, her hand touched the surface. Half expecting it to ripple and her hand to pass through... Half hoping for that to happen, to emerge on the other side in her original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she only making contact with the chill glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh of defeat spilled from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so easy, sweet Katie.\" Her mirror taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recoiled in shock. Taking a step backwards, a wail warbling in her throat, as her hand remained stuck to the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to be unbalanced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing her hair wildly in panic, she felt the scrunchy fly from her hair. Only noticing as she felt her hair fly back and forth over her shoulders as she thrashed to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreams and shouts of outrage were muted, to whimpers and moans, mewlings that sounded more sensual and needy than filled with the icy dread she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie watched in horror, as her chest started to swell. Growing relentlessly, it pulled painfully at her shoulders. The extra weight building on her chest. Making her back ache. She tried to stand straighter, to better bear the burden. It already felt too big, too wide it overflowed her narrow ribcage. A slender middle looked out of place, positively wasp-waisted with her juicy rump, and jiggling bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/70/e5/d0/70e5d0dca1305a4e90af6362e0c6d804.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/70/e5/d0/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... Please... have mercy.\" she begged the air, the mirror. But there wasn't any reply. It was a cleavage Katie had never experienced before. Horrifying, fascinating, and hypnotic. It drew her gaze, as she fought like an animal caught in a trap. Incapable of escape, she was powerless, as she continued to grow and grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8e/f1/c5/8ef1c55fc94c9c955f14ee273d8fc194.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8e/f1/c5/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... Please...\" she whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... you shall please.\" her mirror self teased, looking her in the eyes, staring her down. \"You shall please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fought to control her breathing, it just made everything look worse, her chest rising and falling with each deeply drawn, panic-filled breath. Rising higher, and never falling back quite as far. She grew and grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/aa/4c/06/aa4c06cf08ead0a4809a460ac3b2fe06.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/aa/4c/06/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie eased her thrashing attempts. They just made her shoulders ache. Her bust sloshing heavily threatened to throw her to the floor. She worried about breaking her arm, if she fell and couldn't let go, would that snap in the struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're bigger than my head...\" she wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger is better, and biggest is best.\" Katie's mirror self answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could only shake her head in mute denial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/43/11/f3/4311f35017065a2160d3fa85ca63c2ee.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/43/11/f3/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mirror self lifted her hand from the glass, and Katie stumbled backwards released from her nightmare. Unable to control her rippling rolling flesh, the jiggle and counter jiggle that made every move impossible to control. Katie crashed back, only stopped from hitting the floor by landing on the bed. The inertia of her huge bust pressed relentlessly, not wishing to stop moving, and she collapsed to the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bust pinning her in place. It was only as the movement settled like a sea calming that she was able to sit upright.</span></div></div>",

Katie decided to head that way, and started jogging along the path in the direction the sign had pointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe garden was even eerier than the house; a fine layer of mist seemed to cover everything in sight, barely revealing anything more a a few feet in front of Katie. It occurred to her that this expedition would have been much easier in daylight, but who knew what might happen in that time. Any time spent not looking for Stacey was time wasted in Katie's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path ahead narrowed, and Katie found herself heading down a winding set of steps. The sound of running water filled the air as Katie pushed through what seemed to be the last of the mist and into a clearing with a two small, round pools of hot, bubbling spring-water. Katie's jaw dropped open at the beautiful sight. If people knew these were here, she suspected this house would be a popular tourist attraction rather than a forgotten curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved towards the edge of the hot spring, Katie's attention was drawn to a large statue to one side.

In front of the pool she was now submerged in was a small orb like sculpture embedded into the rocks. She wasn't quite sure what it was meant to represent, and it had clearly been damaged and some pieces broken off...</span></div></div>",

Even though they weren't fully underwater, her arms and shoulders began to fill out much like her arms, her now-chubby fingers massaging her doughy upper arms while her face slowly chubbified, cheekbones disappearing underneath pockets of fat that slowly developed under her chin. The main spectacle though was her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her chest where her perky breasts had once been were two large breasts, adding to the weight she'd piled on in the mysterious spring. What Katie would soon discover though was that it wasn't just fat that had contributed to her new body, but that her breasts were also starting to create milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowning glory though was the globe of a belly that had formed in the water - gone were the personal trainer abs she'd worked so hard for that had now been replaced by a relatively thick layer of fat with matching love handles. That wasn't the only thing growing though, inside her body, a miracle was occurring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe miracle of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter unknowingly gaining 50lbs as she tried to look at the statue, she shrugged and turned to leave the spring where she'd came in, and was met with some resistance as her new body tried to get used to the weight. Katie struggled, but she eventually managed to make it to the side and get out, heaving her heavy body out. It wasn't until she tried to bend down to get her clothes that she realized something was terribly wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" Her eyes went wide as she finally saw the large belly that was in her way. Her chubby fingers instinctively fell on it, stroking the soft skin. Her belly vibrated, giving Katie a jolt as something 'kicked' inside her. Her mouth opened in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No...</i> she panicked, looking between her belly and the heavily pregnant statue next to the spring. <i>I can't be...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the being inside her kicked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Katie didn't even care that she'd gained weight - she was more focused on the life that seemed to be growing inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Katie felt dizzy. She reached out in front of herself as she stumbled, trying to make it over to the bench just out of arm's reach when she someone's arms came from behind to steady her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie turned to see...</span></div></div>",

The candles were all around her, creating a dim light, but she was still using the flashlight from her phone in case they went out. She was also trying to find some clues to Stacey's whereabouts; fingerprints, footprints, dropped items, anything that might be useful. Searching every room in the house was an option, but Emma preferred to actually try and follow some leads, preferably before she was attacked by a witch or something...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stopped to catch her breath a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been walking for a half an hour. All the doors she came across were either rusted shut or locked tight.

She was just inches from the baby so she crouched as far as she could to get a better look at it. With her belly in her way, that wasn't much and it was a struggle for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed a lot larger than the first one (this one now in her but she refuses to believe.) She couldn't tell if it was a boy or girl but a newborn right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiiggghhhhtt...\" Emma said to it.

Her breasts now dangling over it, she was in awe as she watched it gurgle and cough but with no sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>For a hologram, this is really good! Kudos to whoever did this!</i>\" Emma thought as she snickered at her joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't till her belly accidentally hit it that the baby was slowly being taken into her body! Her eyes went wide as she watched what looked like a black hole eating a star as the baby's body slowly disappearing into her! Just as the baby was fully gone, Emma groaned as she felt heavier, her belly instantly growing larger as it stretched her sweater. Emma quickly rolled on to her butt and leaned on the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To make matters worse, it seems like I'm a black hole to these things.\" Emma joked as she rubbed her now enlarged belly, panting heavily as she now felt two of the moving about in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Memo to myself to avoid the next baby I come across!\" Emma sighed as she struggled to get up. Using the wall as support as she slid upwards, panting at the task she just did. She cradled her belly as she now couldn't see her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe adjusted her glasses and took a deep breath to calm herself as well as regain her composure. Emma looked at her body once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd make the other girls jealous with these.\" Emma joked as she hefted her larger breasts. They were nearing the size of her hand each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I wonder how the others are doing, hope they didn't end up like me or worse...</i>\" Emma thought as she shook her head. \"<i>I know they're all right, just need to find Stacy and get the heck out of here.

One hand, holding the flashlight while the other alternating between cradling her twin sized belly and using the wall for support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I wonder how the others will react if they saw me now.</i>\" She thought, giggling at the thought as she made her way down the dark corridor once more.</span></div></div>",

While Emma thought of a dog,in actually she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what it was. It was too big to be a Pit bull, not hairy enough to be a Malamute, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s snout was too long to be a Dalmatian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Wait</i>,thought Emma, <i>that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be here</i>!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining the light directly at the beast, Emma realized what it was. A Wolf, a huge Wolf, which for some reason had green fur and it was staring right at her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Just back away slowly</i>, Emma hurriedly thought, <i>if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t startle it, it will probably leave you alone</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emma quietly moved backwards from the door and tried to close it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A growl broke her train of thought and quickly Emma looked into the doorway. The Wolf was baring its teeth at her; clearly it was getting agitated by something. Emma couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep herself calm and tried to quickly slam the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Too late! The Wolf vaulted towards the closing door and tried to bite her! Emma yelped and panicked. Dropping right onto her behind and causing to the door to open wider!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emma went wide eyed and scrambled to close the door. Unfortunately, the Wolf was faster, by the time the door was halfway shut,its head was already in the space! Emma screamed loudly and tried to push the head back into the other room. Her right arm on the door and the left pushing the Wolf back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t <b>CRUNCH</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emma screamed, her left arm was bitten! Tears soaked her eyes, as the pain of the bite flowed upwards. The Wolf however seemed to be calming down and Emma felt it struggling less. The Wolf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head slowly sunk behind the gap and Emma quickly closed the door. Tears still soaking her eye, Emma wiped them away with her uninjured arm. Slowly getting up, Emma found the closest chair and wedged it at an angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emma put her head into her hands and breath slowly. She quickly thought over the event that just transpired. One thing however clouded her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid that Wolf smile after it bit me\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emma said to no in particular. She pushed the thought aside, thinking it was just a adrenaline induced hallucination. With that out of the way, Emma quickly looked for something to bandage her wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her left arm, she gasped! The wound was completely healed and the sign it ever occurred were some specks of blood on her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u009d! Screamed Emma. she grabbed her arm and started to press down on it. \u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>I knew I was  bitten by the Wolf</i>, Emma began to think,<i> I should be bleeding right now</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emma glanced at her arm, as though looking at it could bring back the wound. Emma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face was painted with confusion; something strange had happened and she had been a victim of it! Emma quickly shook her head and went forward, the others were still exploring. The quicker she could leave, the quicker she could look for medical attention.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If Emma had a clearer mind at the moment, she would of thought of why the hallways were so long. She would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reached the other side of the house already. Alas, her mind wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the best of places at the moment. And it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t getting any better, her skin felt hotter and she felt hungrier. Weirdly, even though the girls and her gotten something to eat not even thirty minutes ago. Emma couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t relax any longer and sat down on a random chair. She was sweaty and her skin still getting warmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is everyone, Emma announced, I should\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ran into someone\u00e2\u0080\u009d! Emma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s irritation grew and so did her uneasy feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She felt hungry, she felt irritated, which was slowly going into anger, and most of all, she felt scared. Emma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s normally jovial thoughts clouded and slowly it went into a darker place. That was until her left arm felt and itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy am I itchy, Emma said aloud, was it from the bite..Oh my god\u00e2\u0080\u009d! Emma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth went wide open,what was happening to her left arm shocked her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire left arm was covered in fur,bright orange fur at that. Emma jumped from the seat and her face went aghast! Emma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind was buffering as the fur went upwards. Quickly, she pulled herself together from the shock; she should be trying to find something to contain her arm! Emma rushed towards the end of the hallway, the fur quickly covered most of the limb and was moving towards her chest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cANYONE , I NEED HELP ME\u00e2\u0080\u009d! Emma cried at the top of her lungs Already, did the fur cover her torso and crawled to her arms. Emma stopped and clutched her stomach, something worse was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She felt bones elongate and skin being stretched, she gasped and looked down at herself. She was growing upwards and her cleavage was covered in fur! Her clothes were stretching and in some seams already ripped. Her right arm fell to whatever was overtaking her and already did it resemble the left. Emma whimpered and then put her clawed hand over her mouth, she sounded just like a dog! The fur covering her torso traveled to one very few places not covered; her head! If she could see herself, Emma would find out that her ears were growing into that of canine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emma closed her eyes and muttered panicked phrases to herself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happening, this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happening, this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happening\u00e2\u0080\u009d!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emma felt her nose itch,causing her to open her eyes. She almost fainted when she saw the cause of the problem. Her snout was stretching and turning into a muzzle, just like a wolf! Emma was breathing in and outwards, trying to calm herself. This was working, but it was barely enough.  Finally, for what seemed liked eternity the muzzle formed and Emma licked her lips. Which was at the end of her new mouth. Her glasses strangely enough, still sat upon her muzzle.Before, she could sigh in relief, the change had one more thing to accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emma felt a tickle emanating from her buttocks. Something that worried her, fearing the next change. Looking backwards, she gasped, which sounded more like a dog whimper than a normal human. Her buttocks were pushing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way from her body! Already, did the elasticity of her pants felt tight. The crotch of her pants was digging into her and her hips pushed from the waist! Emma whimpered  and got on her knees, her butt was sticking in the air and was still growing. Placing her clawed hands on the cheeks and looking down on the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Please stop changing me</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Emma was thinking to herself, hoping for some end point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheeks were already to the size of soccer balls and soon  would hit basketballs, her pants valiantly staying on. Emma moaned and sometimes growled out her discomfort. Her cheeks pressing outward into her pants, her underwear was already ripping. Emma was too focused on her butt, that she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even realize that her height was still growing! Her calves and thighs grew longer and swelled along with her ass. Emma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind went through so many thoughts, she was basically on hold.  Her hips widening past her shoulders and her cheeks trying to escape their cotton prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SNAP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newer addition, her ears,perked up making her looking behind. Emma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s butt had ripped through her pants and it brought along a new friend! A big, bushy Wolf tail that grew from her spine! Emma face grimaced and her muzzle tried to pass itself off as a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking like a furry porn star, for crying out loud\u00e2\u0080\u009dHer eyes blinked at the sound of her voice, noting that it was somewhat deeper. This still caused Emma to cry aloud and put her head back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her clawed hands were going farther and farther away from her cheeks; which was still growing outwards from her body. Then it stopped and Emma raised her head. Looking back at her ass, she almost screamed! Her lower body took the word pear and ran with it. Standing upwards, albeit rather shakily, Emma comprehended her new size. While her upper half was more or less the same, the same couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be said of her lower body. <br>\r\nStanding nearly seven feet tall, Emma still thought of her ass disproportionate. They were like the semi-hemisphere of small beach balls! Sticking out so far that Emma's clawed hands couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reach them. Her tail was long enough to grow over theses spheres; even then it only hung outwards by a inch or two. Her pants were still attached to her waist, it looked however to be one walk away from exploding. Multiple tears and long slashes dominated the her lower calves. Her thighs didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even possess a gap fro crying out loud! Emma was looking downwards and realized that her shoes were destroyed! Leaving to bare giant,wolf-like feet at the end of her massive legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emma was anxious to find out what she looked like as a whole. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m probably wider than Carrie at the moment\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Emma tried to lighten her mood with her jokes. It wasn't working.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe Stacey was outside, trying to get some signal on her phone? The fact that everything here was lit up at least seemed to indicate that somebody, probably Stacey herself, had been around and explored the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma headed out into the night, jogging across to the large, illuminated greenhouse in front of her. She pushed the glass door open with a creak, and slipped inside. \"Stacey? You here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response, so she decided to look around the greenhouse. To her surprise, it was in remarkably good condition - all the glass surfaces were clean, and the plants all looked healthy and well looked after. She had no idea who had been taking care of them, but obviously someone had been keeping up with the gardening here, because there was no way these plants could have stayed so healthy without some TLC. She strolled up and down the rows of greenery, examining some of the specimens; a lot of the plants here seemed to be fruit and vegetables, and she spotted some blueberries, pears and apples growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey actually looked pretty delicious...</span></div></div>",

Emma tossed the blueberry into her mouth and bit down on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn explosion of flavour hit her as the relatively small Blueberry exploded into a mouthful of juice in her mouth.

She even felt her mouth watering slightly at the taste overload. \"So good...\" She moaned quietly to herself, subconsciously reaching for another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another\" turned into an entire handful, and before she knew it, Emma had pushed an entire leaf's worth of Blueberries past her lips. As she bit down on the mouthful, the juice exploded, turning her entire tongue a bright blue. She closed her eyes as the overwhelming burst of flavour hit her. Eating several of the berries at once tasted so amazing that Emma almost lost control of her body, stumbling slightly against the workman's bench behind her as a little juice escaped her lips and ran down her chin. Her lips were slowly changing colour; stained blue from the amount of juice sloshing around in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmurghhhhhhhh...\" Emma moaned in delight as she savoured the delicious juice one last time before gulping it all down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing out slowly, Emma wiped the juice from her mouth and eyed up the plant once again. Perhaps a few more wouldn't hurt? But then again, she wasn't sure if she should...she had already picked one of the shoots dry...</span></div></div>",

After shaking her head and looking from left to right, Emma suddenly realised the noise had come from <i>her</i>. More specifically, from her stomach. Emma looked down instinctively, and was greeted by the sight of a protruding, bloated looking belly underneath her jacket. Emma's face contorted into a confused frown. It was then that she noticed her hands...her <i>blue </i>hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Did I really eat that many blueberries that I stained my hands and got a food baby?!\"</i> Emma thought in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma unzipped her jacket with her dark blue hands, allowing her belly to bulge out a little more. She gasped as she saw just how round and full it had gotten, and prodded at it with her stained fingers. It felt weirdly soft and squishy, not at all firm and taught, like a normal food baby would be. She took another look at her hands and tried to brush some of the juice stains away, but they wouldn't budge. No matter how much she scratched at them, her hands remained a dark shade of blue. Now getting annoyed, Emma decided to carry on inside and find something to wash off the stains, but before she could take another step, a stirring beneath her top stopped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...why is...my bra...\" Emma trailed off as she felt her bra constrict around her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling uncomfortably, Emma looked down to see her breasts <i>swelling </i>out. She gave a startled yelp and grabbed her expanding boobs in her hands. As she squeezed them down, trying to stop the bizarre growth spurt, she found them too sensitive to hold onto, and after a few seconds, she had to release her hold on her boobs and let them drop. She gave a dull moan as the sensation of her swelling tits made her body shudder with pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is happening to me...I must be having a bad reaction to those berries...\" She muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked down at her belly again, still feeling that strange gargling in her gut. She tentatively pulled her white T-shirt up, exposing her very round, bulging tummy. Even more worrying than it's bloated shape was the fact that, like her hands, it was blue. Emma frantically rubbed her stomach, causing the juice inside her to slosh around noisily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit. Those aren't stains. I'm turning blue all over!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma pulled up her sleeves and jeans, seeing that the colour now enveloped her entire body. She didn't know what to do. Was she allergic to something in those berries? Was she choking or something? No, that was stupid. She could obviously still breathe. So what the hell was wrong with her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma wasn't sure what to do...</span></div></div>",

Cautiously, Emma moved a few feet forward, testing her limitations. Her body jiggled madly as she planted her leg down, but as a whole, didn't seem to be that different from before. Breathing outwards, Emma began her walk through the twisting hallways of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma swayed her thick body through the corridors, seeing the absurd amount of furniture going to waste. The dust filled cabinets and chairs;the old mantle pieces; the lamps, everything was going to waste! She saw a particular picture, containing a very beautiful scene of a farm. Almost Idyllic, shame that it was going to the moths in this place. Emma barreled onward, she couldn't dally around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt like a plump ball waddling around, well no, she could still move her legs a good few feet away from her. So, technically, she wasn't waddling around the hallways. But feeling her now plump body move now, which moments ago was as skinny as she liked it to be,was jarring. She didn't feel like the same person anymore, like she was put into a fatter body of herself. And even then, the fat didn't feel like fat. It swayed way too much to be fat. Like a ocean of liquid was inside of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come one, come all, look at the fat, blue girl!\" Emma joked at her own expense, doing her best to relieve the mood.\" Watch as she bends over an- wait, didn't I see that picture from before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma stopped in her tracks, turning her juicy neck to the right of her. There was the picture again, the idyllic farm. Was she going around in circles? Crap, were was she now? Emma scratched her head, right before she heard a noise coming from behind her. Swinging her large body around, Emma saw who the noisemaker was.</span></div></div>",

Is that one of you guys?\"<br>\r\nThe figure didn't answer and continued to draw closer to her. As it did, Emma began to worry as she started making out a few features of the mysterious figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, they had ghostly white hair hanging down to their waist in messy strands. As the figure moved, their hair waved and bounced invitingly, drawing Emma's eyes to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly, they wore a long white dress that matched their hair perfectly. Much like their hair, it flowed back and forth as they walked. However, as Emma looked down at their feet, she noted that they weren't actually walking on the ground, but floating atop it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Floating?!</i> She thought in disbelief, taking a slight step back. <i>How is that even possible?! Unless... Is this place actually haunted? Am I looking at a real ghost?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure stepped into the sliver of moonlight, which illuminated their beautiful face.

Her eyes were closed, almost like she was sleeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma stared at the ghostly figure for a few seconds before realising how close she was getting. There was about two metres between the two, a worrying amount of space. With her heavy bulk, Emma doubted she'd be able to outrun the figure, who, if she was indeed a ghost, would probably be able to float through stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I need to move...

Her face was a deep, dark shade of blue, which matched her hands and, she assumed, the rest of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird,\" Emma moaned, noting her completely blue tongue as she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at herself in the mirror, she suddenly noticed her top was riding up even further; she went to pull it back down, only to see it creep up over her belly button. Emma gasped as she realised it was actually expanding! This had obviously happened once before already, but she had been totally oblivious to it that time. Watching herself literally bloat outwards was a very surreal experience; she just stood there and gazed at her own growing tummy as it pushed out and grew rounder and fuller, pushing against her pants and putting considerable pressure on her belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, her rear end pushed out equally quickly, causing her pants to tighten even further as they were stretched in both directions. Emma's top was pulled all the way up, bunching beneath her breasts, which now swelled out an alarming speed, snapping the clasp of her bra and causing Emma to jump back in alarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too-too big!\" Emma stammered helplessly as she entire body became rounder and juicier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pop! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top button on Emma's pants burst open, causing her belly to bulge forward into the newly created gap and force her zipper down. The sudden release alleviated some of the pressure on her ass, which had now ripped through her panties and begun to rise over the top of her jeans. Emma gave a startled yelp, hoping this was the end for now...</span></div></div>",

She groaned uncomfortably as her jeans began to dig into her expanding waistline, causing her a great deal of discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This really wasn't what I was expecting to happen when I agreed to look for Stacey...\" Emma grumbled. \"If I can still move at the end of this, I'm going to blame her for everything! Well, if we find her and somebody finds me, that is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma watched herself swell for a few seconds, a frown on her face. Holes began to open up in her top, allowing azure flesh to bulge through, while her jeans began to creak dangerously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Should I strip?\" Emma wondered, a pudgy hand groping around her waist for her waistband. \"These jeans weren't exactly cheap... And I'd rather save them than explode out of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the waistband, Emma gave them an experimental tug, not expecting them to move very far down her thick legs. Her expectations were met, her jeans barely budging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay then, a little force will be required!\"<br>\r\nTaking hold of her waistband, Emma grunted as she tried to force them down her legs. They moved about a centimetre before her bulbous blue behind stopped them. She let out a few more grunts as she attempted to pull them over her rounding ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Almost... there!\"<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Emma, she wasn't quick enough. Her backside gurgled ominously before expanding a noticeable amount. Her jeans tightened immensely, causing a cry of pain to escape Emma's plump lips, before letting out a final creak and splitting apart in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stared at the remnants of her trousers, her lower body grew exponentially. Her hips and backside became rounder and rounder which, coupled with her round stomach, gave Emma a very spherical look. She took a few heavy steps forwards, wobbling dangerously as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Man, I can barely-\"<br>\r\nEmma's complaint was cut short as her top half followed in the footsteps of her lower half and swelled with more juice. Her breasts filled with more and more juice, quickly demolishing her top and leaving Emma completely naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is super embarrassing...\" Emma muttered, her cheeks blushing a deep blue. \"I really hope nobody finds me like this... Well, I suppose I've stopped swelling... For the moment, anyway...\"</span></div></div>",

She just flailed around helplessly before clasping her hands over her exposed nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma is that you making all...that...noise...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, hey Katie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie stood in the doorway, aghast at Emma's swollen, bulging form. \"Wh-what the hell happened to <i>you</i>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...am having kind of a bad reaction to some berries I hate,\" Emma could feel herself blushing, but her cheeks remained a deep, dark blue.

Sooooo...how did this happen again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighed, not really sure she even understood it herself. \"I ate a bunch of blueberries and I think I had some sort of allergic reaction or something...because I just started blowing up like a balloon,\" her stomach gurgled slightly as she spoke, bulging ever so slightly. \"I think I'm filling with juice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie raised an eyebrow in disbelief. \"Juice?

Haha let's all trick Katie with some weird blueberry monster scam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monster?\" Emma blurted out. \"I am not a blueberry monster!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie laughed. \"I'm sorry Emma, but this is ridiculous.

Katie looked at her friend in confusion, watching the woman as she moaned in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this is getting weird Emma, you can stop now.\" Katie joked, a worried grin plastered on her face. Emma didn't speak, moans and groans filled the air. Katie's grin slowly morphed into a worried frown as she saw the scene unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma, you can stop now. Emma\" Katie spoke aloud as Emma kept clutching her massive frame and then Katie saw her friend <i>grow</i>. Emma's frame went from that of a obese woman to a even bigger obese woman. Her ass grew like balloons, a crack canyon that could consume her panties twice over. Her belly could contained twenty, maybe thirty, gallons of juice at the moment. It struck from her frame like a juice filled storage container. The shelf of a stomach made her breasts rise higher; her breasts also got into the fun. The giant jugs rising towards her chin, almost blocking off her view. Emma moved her tongue around her mouth, doing so revealed to her that her cheeks had grown to sizable proportions. It felt like she had stuffed some walnuts into her mouth, she licked her lips in worry. That action revealed that her lips had plumped up significantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growing stopped and Emma was left even bigger than before, she blushed deep purple as she stood in the room.

She gave a moan as her swollen cheeks puffed out, her mouth tasting vaguely of blueberries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Katie was saying, holding her hands out as if to steady Emma's increasingly spherical body. despite the fact they were about a metre apart. \"We need to get you out of here and...drained?

Katie gawked at her barely recognisable friend as she waddled slowly towards her, her thick, swollen thighs rubbed together as she walked. Her ballooning ass cheeks swayed almost hypnotically from side to side, bouncing with every step, and her bloated breasts, pinned down by her hands, bounced up and down with every step she took. Beneath her oversized boobs, her perfectly round, bloated belly sloshed around. The simple process caused Emma to let out an involuntary groan of discomfort. She was so unused to her new weight that she had to stop and plop herself down on the bed and catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghhhh...\" Emma groaned, turning her blue face to look at Katie. \"I...I am not enjoying this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just need to get you to a hospital or something, it might be weird, but you need to leave this room and get back outside so we can call an ambulance,\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right,\" Emma said, looking down at her swollen, blue body helplessly.

One moment.\" Katie walked off and looked around the room to search for something to help out the poor girl. She opened up drawers, looked inside cabinet, and even under the bed. Most of her efforts drew no fruits(pardon) to her labor. Right until she a canister that drew her eye, it was resting on a drawer. It was subtly hidden that she must've went of went over the first time she was coming through, it blended in with some locked boxes on top of the drawer. Going over to the canister, she opened it; Katie happy yelled as she saw what it contained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You find something?\" Emma's voice pierced Katie's mind. Katie walked over to Emma again and put the canister over Emma's fat shoulder, Katie had to use Emma's rear as leverage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See this, Emma? Its oil. A lubricant!\" Katie proudly, proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annnd?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can use it to help you get out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it would've been better if we applied it beforehand.\"Emma pouted and noted silently that her lips felt plumper, was she still growing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right...\" Katie noted sourly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although, you could probably... <i>lather</i> me in the stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?

She turned and looked at Emma, who was wedged in the doorway, writhing slowly as she tried to push herself free. With a sigh, she walked around Emma's gigantic blue butt and rubbed some of the oil on the sides of her stomach. Katie winced as her hand sank into Emma's soft, squishy tummy. She could hear a sloshing, gurgling noise beneath her flesh, as though she was filled with liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it working?\" Emma asked, unable to see what Katie was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a chance,\" Katie said. \"You feel...weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am blue and giant and stuck in a doorway...so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie rolled her eyes and used her other hand to lather up Emma's belly some more. She pushed her hand underneath the space where Emma's stomach was wedged against the door frame, shifting her bulk so that she could reach the right area. Her hand almost got trapped underneath the blue bulk for a moment before she yanked it back out. \"Geez...this is harder than I thought it would be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma shifted her weight as best she could, but barely moved forward an inch. \"Did it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, I need more oil,\" Katie replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the container again, Katie dumped another handful of oil into her palms, which, she noted, were now stained a light shade of blue. She was about to wipe them on something, when she realised her hands were still full of oil. \"Right, one thing at a time...\" Katie muttered to herself as she hurried back to Emma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, hurry!\" Emma moaned, her body jiggling as she uselessly shifted her weight from side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay, geez...\" Katie groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing to the other side of Emma's massively bloated belly, Katie again dug her hand into Katie's flesh and starting rubbing oil in circular motions. Strangely, Emma's stomach seemed to have become much firmer in the last few minutes, feeling not soft and blubbery, but firm and full. While that seemed odd, Katie finished her task and lathered up Emma's gut as best she could. It was a very bizarre experience and not certainly not what she had expected to be doing when they first arrived at the house. She was grateful, at least, that Emma wasn't looking at her. This was awkward enough without eye contact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, done,\" Katie said. \"See if you can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she had even finished, Emma let out a \"Hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!\" noise as she pushed herself forward with all her might. The oil did it's job well, because Emma suddenly tumbled free with a wet \"Phlop\" sound and staggered into the corridor. Her arms and legs had swollen so much that she had difficulty even walking straight, but she managed to steady herself before she toppled over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked back down at her hands, still stained blue, and rubbed them together. To her surprise, none of the blue came off. It looked like they were stained. \"Great...\" Katie grumbled.</span></div></div>",

Hell, evidence points to whoever is occupying this place is still here.

She rushed into the door and waited as Emma lumbered into the room. Quickly slamming the door, Katie and Emma stood still. Whatever was making the shockwaves seemed to be getting closer, as Katie noted that Emma's entire body now seemed to be jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shockwaves sounded as if they were right outside the door and Katie placed her hands around her mouth so she didn't make a sound. Emma wasn't as fortunate and just clenched her mouth as tightly as she could. Finally, it seemed whatever was the source of the sound left and the faintest indication of its passing disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" Emma spoke after awhile, Katie looked over at the blue girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but what I do know is that we need to get you to a smaller size. I don't think we'll get a spacious room such as this again; if we somehow do, good, but I don't wanna risk it.\" Katie stated, walking over to the door, she opened it and peeked her head outside. Seeing nothing, Katie slowly motioned her hand so that Emma would know everything was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo started to journey towards the front door again;every other moment they would look behind them to see if whatever came before them was turning around. After a few moments, Katie and Emma felt like the worst had already passed and just focused on getting out of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where would something that would get juice outta a girl be situated?\" Emma asked aloud, whether to herself or to Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kitchen? Maybe the basement?\" Katie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, the Kitchen I understand, but why the basement?\" Emma questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I pretty sure some guest, or whoever, wouldn't want to eat any deserts if they saw where the fillings came from.\" Katie joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, hah. Wait, do they put a fruit girl's fillings into the deserts? Gross, gah.\" Emma made a gagging noise in faux-shock and the two laughed at the absurdity of their situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a piece of roof fell in front of them. The duo stopped and watched as dust and debris filled their view,  a coughing noise filled the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worst. Escape. Attempt. Ever.\" The voice spoke aloud. Katie and Emma's eyes rose in shock, the voice was familiar to them, but they needed a little confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whose there?\" Katie said. The figure was outlined in the dust and rose abruptly at Katie's command. Trying to wave away the dust, it replied to Katie:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who, wait, Katie? Whose that next to you.\" The figure walked out of the cloud and the answer to its identity was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her normally healthy, clear skin was a pale shade of green, and her clothes clung to her body awkwardly. Emma and Katie gawked at their normally slender, perfectly proportioned model-friend, who took a few ungainly steps towards them before noticing Emma's spherical, blue form for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened to you?!\" Beth asked, aghast at the swollen blueberry girl before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? What's going on with you?!\" Emma replied, deflecting the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth shifted awkwardly. Her entire body had changed since the last time the girls had seen her; now, her once perfect figure seemed to have curved out considerably. Her hips were incredibly wide, rounding out from her butt and pushing her pants down slightly, leaving the top of her ass cheeks exposed. Her butt had almost tripled in size, her once modest cheeks now swollen and bulbous, barely contained by her skin tight jeans. Atop that, her once trim stomach had pooched out into a flabby, green belly and a huge pair of love handles which oozed over the sides of her pants. Her shirt had ridden up over her newfound belly flab, bunching beneath her fuller looking breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think I'm having a reaction...\" Beth stammered, folding her arms across her chest to try and conceal as much of her bloated body as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're turning into a dam Pear!\" Emma gasped. \"Like I'm turning into a Berry! Beth, did you a Pear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People don't turn into Pears, Emma!\" Beth snapped. \"But um...yeah I did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie could hardly believe what she was seeing. \"One of you was bad enough, but two of you turning into dam fruit?!\" She shook her head in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a fruit!\" Beth said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...you are kind of...pear like...\" Katie said, gesturing to Beth's wide hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth awkwardly touched her thighs, which were pressed together tightly below her bulging tummy. \"I don't want to be a Pear,\" she moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, at least you can still move around okay, I'm barely standing with this massive body!\" Emma said. \"You might have gained a few curves, but I'm a freaking parade float!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth looked Emma's naked, bloated body up and down before nodding in agreement. \"You're right, it could be worse.\"</span></div></div>",

Katie looked between the two girls and noted how different their bodies were at the moment. A question popped into her mind as she went over each of the girls' new bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Beth, when did you eat that pear. Like how long ago was that?\" Katie questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, ten, fifteen, minutes ago.\" Beth shrugged, causing her flabby belly to jiggle a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about you, Emma?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm.\" Katie saw Emma try and raise her hand to her chin, but couldn't, due to her vast new body. \"Thirty minutes, tops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\" Katie announced;Beth looked at her friend,her expression covered in confusion. Katie couldn't see Emma's, but she probably have the same face as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Beth spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Emma here ate some blueberries about thirty minutes ago. You ate them about ten or so minutes ago. She hasn't stopped growing, which means...\"Katie lead Beth to her conclusion. The pear girl's face scrunched up in thought, before her lips developed into an \"o\" shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get bigger!\" She yelled, causing some of the paintings on the wall to shake. Katie immediately made a shushing noise and placed her hand over Beth's mouth.\" Psssh. There's something here with us, be quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Beth slowly nodded her head,Katie lowered her hand from Beth's mouth and waited as the girl composed herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, what am I going to do? I got a gig in a week's time, I can't go in looking like this!\" Beth moaned outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you can look over your tits.\" Emma whispered and only Katie heard the faint sentence. Placing her hand on Beth's shoulder, Katie did her best to reassure the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, listen. You're going to be find, Emma and me thought of a few ideas. We think that this place has something to reverse whats been done to you and Emma.\" Katie said, Beth stared at the girl with a raised eyebrow. Even if she was a ditz, she still had enough sense to question how she'd be turned back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you figure that out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would someone not be investigated if its guest didn't come back out? And I don't think the local legends had anything to do with disappearances.\" Katie stopped and looked over at Emma. \"Are there ones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I know of,no.\" Emma replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie smiled and began her spiel once again. \"See. So what I'm thinking is that some where in this place is a way to make you slim again! We placed its either in the basement or its in the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth puckered her lips, she nodded as she went over Katie's words. They seemed true, and she was her friend,so Katie was right! Smiling, Beth stretched a little and spoke.\"What are we waiting for lets go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth waddled ahead, before she stopped and looked back at the two.\"Um, where <i>are</i> we going?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But as we seem to be in an infinite hall, I do not know. Which means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie, don't hurt yourself.\" Emma stated as she lumbered towards the girls and lightly bumped against them due to not knowing where they were. Beth squeaked a little and Katie tapped the blue behemoths stomach.\"We're down here, watch out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Emma replied.\"Back onto topic, where is the kitchen? I can't make heads or tale of this place and I sure as hell can't do it now, thanks to my body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm at a loss there.\" Katie, being the only one with a currently flexible body, sat down and thought up a plan. Emma shuffled a little bit, groaning faintly due to her weight at the moment. Beth, meanwhile, unconsciously scratched her butt before her face brighten in eureka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised a hand and Katie knew she had a question; it was a social \"tic\" she had, probably from when she was in middle school. Katie pointed her finger at her \"Shoot, whatcha got?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Beth lowered her hand and grinned. \"I know,I know. When I was running away from the plant, house, thing, I went upstairs. And as I was running away, I found a <i>big </i>place with all sorts of food. I didn't get a good look at it completely, but I'm guessing its the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're still in this infinite hallway, how would we find it.\" Katie questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, Its not that far, its just right down here.\" Beth happily stated as she pointed down the black hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth, why didn't you say so before?\" Emma called to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot!\" Beth replied with a dopey grin on her face. Katie was about to give the girl an earful, but remembered it was Beth she was speaking towards, Nodding her head, Katie walked past Beth and stared on ahead. \"This way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yepporoonie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing confirmation, Katie marched forward. Followed by Beth,and following her by a <i> wide</i> margin,Emma. As before, silence between the group broken only by the occasional grunt from either Beth or Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I not in front?\" Emma spoke, being the one to break the silence again. Katie,still marching forward, replied to her. \"I'm not all fruity, like you two are. If I encounter trouble, I can easily run back and warn you two. Beside. It be pretty hard to take you away from us, seeing as you're all...gigantic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling satisfied with her answer, Emma did her best to look down at Beth, who was at the moment trying to walk forward and adjust her pants.\"How did you get turned into a pear, Beth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at her large friend, Beth licked her lips and began her tale.\"Okay, so I was finished looking through the upstairs of this place. I mean the right side; upstairs, I think Carrie has the left. But I forgot to tell her that I was done. I hope she is fine and dandy and okay and fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back onto topic.\" Emma's words brought Beth back from one of her nonsensical tirades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, anyways, like, I came down and decided to follow where you'd gone. Maybe help you out there and stuff, so when I came out, who did I spot? Some beefcake of a guy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth bit the bottom of her lip as she reminisced, a bit of juice flowed from her nether regions. The ditsy Beth was smart enough to not bring attention to that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big, handsome, and with muscle like steel. So big handsome guy is like 'Oh, hi there,i'm Kyle.' and i'm like 'Hey handsome,I'm Beth'  and he just smiles at me with the brightest grin. We go back and forth for awhile and he seemed <i>really</i>interested about whoever ate some blueberries,of course why would I know that? Then he leads me around the plant place and I remembered that Stacey needed help, so I was like 'yeah, sorry, but I need to leave, my friend is missing'. And the guy was so nice he offered me any of the fruits in the place to eat, naturally, I ate a pear. Then he left and when I walked away, I started to turn green! Poor guy would probably feel guilty if he found out I ate a defective pear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma interrupted her speech. \"Beth, don't you think the guy's plan was to intentionally turn you into a pear? And don't you think he must've been looking for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth stared at Emma's stomach, seeing as her face was currently blocked off, and replied to that question. \"Nah, him, nooo. He was <i>way</i> to nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma rolled her eyes at the statement; Kate filed this \"Kyle\" character as someone to look out for. \"Then what happened after that, Beth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, I was freaking out of course and ran back inside the building. The forest was creepy with a capital 'C' and Kyle disappeared into it. I was running around, yelling, and I must've awoken this big scary thing. I didn't get a good view of it, but its outline was just scary with a capital 'S'. I ran away and it followed me, thankfully,there was this giant gap I could squeeze in and I just tucked myself into there. But big nasty stuck his arm in there and I had to shimmy my way to the roof, there was piping everywhere that I could climb onto. And to make a long story short: that is how I met back up with you girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't explain your.\" Emma waved her hand over Beth's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I kinda, <i>grew </i>in the roof. Thats why I fell down.\" Beth said, evident embarrassment in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gals, quiet down.\" Katie's voice ranged in both of their ears. In front of them, light from under a door illuminated the hallway. Stepping forward, Katie made her way towards the opening,leaving the two fruits a good deal away. Silently, she peaked her head into a nice room with floral patterns on the wall.Besides that, Katie saw two figures inside of the room, the backside of a gardener and the outline of someone tied to a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been a naughty little gal. All the staffs been in a stir about you.\" A seductive female voice began to converse with the unseen captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you.\" The voice snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is how you treat your savoir? If it had been anyone one else they would've done some <i>really</i> bad things to you. But hey, its not like we can't have this chat become friendly and nice. How about a few fruit slices as a sign of peace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, get those away from me-\" The speaker was muffled as something was shoved into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, deary me, you ate it all. Looks like I have to get more, stay right here.\" A door opened from an angle that Katie, the athlete made her way inside. She gasped as she saw who was tied to the chair.</span></div></div>",

The girl stopped,looking up to see Katie appear in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kat-\" Carrie closed her mouth as she saw Katie raise her finger to her lips. Moving slowly over to the tied up girl, she bent down to see both of Carrie's legs and arms tied together with rope. Looking closely at it,Katie began to fiddle with the ropes until she could get Carrie out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,Carrie.\" Katie smiled at the tied up girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie! I'm glad to see you.\" Carrie replied. \"Are the others with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...I'll explain later,but Carrie,what the hell happened?\" Katie said, hoping a conversation could ease some tension up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trying to find Stacy like the rest of you gals!\" Carrie explained. \"I was going around this place, but it turned into a maze. I wandered around a bit,before I came across this guy,Kent or something like that. He leads me to the backyard,we talk for a while,and when I didn't find Stacy, I left. Then I walked back in, and do you know what happens next? This place got even bigger,what is even happening?! And then this crazy chef lady finds me,binds me before I had a chance to do something, and here I am. I know that that wasn't very precise, but you don't want a detailed story,right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie by then had already untied the rope around Carrie and was helping the office girl up from her chair. Grabbing her hand, Katie and Carrie walked up to the door Katie had entered through. Katie stopped in her tracks however, beginning to rub her chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrie, I'm going to ask you not to scream. Beth and Emma are currently not looking...<i>good</i> right now.\" Katie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I scream, they're my friends?\" Carrie innocently looked at Katie, who only sighed in response. Stepping forward, Katie opened the door and lead Carrie to out into the hallway. Meanwhile, Carrie still had a look of innocence on her face before she opened her mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her stood a large blue mass,a foot taller than the girl, which was currently shuffling on its feet. Beside it was, Beth, but she was green and was holding onto a large belly. Turning to her side,Carrie could clearly see that Beth's ass was wider than her shoulders! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie stared for a few moments, only interrupted by the sound of a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is? Oh, is that Carrie?\" Emma's voice said behind the blue mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie looked at Katie, back at the two,and then back at Katie again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are..are those?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Katie quickly replied. Carrie stared at Beth, who seemed to have turned a darker green in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to Beth, who shrunk into herself,Carrie hugged the girl with all her might. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God. Are you okay? Are you in pain? What did this to you?\" Carrie cried, letting go of Beth,she walked over to Emma and asked the same thing. Katie smiled,remembering that Carrie was the \"team mom.\" Always worrying about the others like they weren't young adults already. Shaking her head, she grabbed a hold of Carrie and brought her up to speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this house is <i>really</i> messed up?\" Carrie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, and i'm getting these two fruits outta of here,so they can get fixed. After that i'm going back in and find Stacy.\" Katie finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And am I not counted in that? I came to help Stacy as well, I'm not going to let what happened to these two happen to you!\" Carrie exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're right here you know.\" Emma said. \"And can we hurry up? My legs are killing me right now, I don't know if I can stand any longer and I sure as hell won't lay down on this dusty floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, come on then.\" Katie announced, walking forward towards the end of the hallway. Followed by Carrie,who was tailed by Beth, and Emma waddled all the way in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments passed in silence, with Katie occasionally looking behind her at her once normal group. With Beth using her belly to hide her privates and Emma's face being blocked by the poor lighting and her giant tits. Though, something bothered Katie about Carrie at the moment. Finding it in her to speak,Katie opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrie, did your shirt always have a little hole between the fourth and third button?\" Katie questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What,no, why?\" Carrie absentmindedly answered. Katie stared as she saw the hole getting bigger and bigger before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\"</span></div></div>",

Emma's blue, swollen face contorted in confusion, while Beth tried to look away awkwardly. \"Wh-what's happening to me?\" Carrie gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hole continued to pull itself apart as Carrie's other shirt buttons also grew tighter, stretching across her stomach. As the gaps became more obvious, Katie could see Carrie's belly taking on a strangely pink colour, which then began to rapidly darken until her skin was a healthy shade of red. The redness quickly spread further, engulfing Carrie's entire torso before creeping to her hands, and, ultimately her face. The sudden change in colour was all too familiar, and Katie hoped, for a moment, that it might just be a genuine allergic reaction...but that was probably naive at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's stomach gave a loud, gurgling rumble, causing her to groan in discomfort. As she clutched at her belly, she noticed her red hand for the first time and lifted it to her face. \"Oh my God! What the hell?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pop!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Carrie's button's exploded off, and for the first time, the girls all noticed that her stomach was beginning to inflate, which explained the buttons. Carrie's gave a squeal and grasped her swollen tummy in both hands, watching in horror as her belly pushed out into a round, red sphere. Her other buttons managed to hold on, but they were now skin tight and looking read to blow. Carrie's horror at her newly expanded belly was soon replace by the disturbing realisation that there were now several small yellow spots appear on her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhhh what nooooow?\" Carrie moaned as the spots began to increase in size, becoming small, crater like blemishes on her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Emma said. \"I think...I think she's becoming a strawberry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie would normally have rolled her eyes at that ridiculous statement, but Emma was right; Carrie's body was increasingly beginning to resemble the skin of a strawberry...</span></div></div>",

Beth placed her hands around her mouth in shock,while Emma couldn't really see that much over her own bloated breasts. Slowly, a sloshing sound filled the air as the areas around the first and second button of Carrie's shirt began to strain. The afflicted girl could only put her hands around her head in shock. Tears beginning to form in the girl's eyes. Her breasts began to bloat up just like Emma's. Looking plumper and plumper by the second. She groaned in discomfort while most of her friends watched her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ping*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA button popped straight off her shirt, Beth yelped in shock. Katie dodged to the side, leaving the hurtling at Emma's belly. It hit, causing a wave of pulsing flesh to ripple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" The blue girl questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie couldn't respond to her,only moan more and more as she grew. Her belly was now larger than a pregnant woman's,while her breasts grew from there once petite B-cups to rest atop of her belly.The poor girl decided to grip them as if that would make any difference to her growing size. She looked around to her friends,pleading with her eyes. Katie could only watch while the other two had their own problems at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it seemed to stop, leaving Carries the smallest of the fruit girls. Which wasn't saying much, her belly was out by four feet and with her viewpoint being taken mostly up by her breasts. Carrie wiped her the tears off of her face, doing her best to keep her enlarged front half from falling down onto the ground.Katie stared at her friend, her lips twitched a little before she began to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,this may be a set back, but I think we can still do it.\" Katie said. \"I just need to take you gals up front and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Katie. We'll do that ourselves.\" Emma interrupted. \"We'll just slow you down. <i>You </i>find Stacy and we'll go and get ourselves out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie stared at Emma while Beth helped Carrie adjust to her new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, you girls need me to watch out for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but our group is way too large at the moment. Figuratively and literally. What will happen if you get caught while we're lumbering around? Like I said,we can find the exit by our own means, just find Stacy and get her out of here!\" Emma proclaimed. Katie still didn't feel convinced about Emma's logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if you're all captured?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then go get help using your unenlarged self and come back! Now head off. If everything goes well, we will meet back out front.\" Emma spoke. Katie began to take a few steps away from the blueberry,who waved a tubby arm at her. Nodding, Katie sped off into the darkness.</span></div></div>",

Wait. Keep ourselves out of trouble.\" She shifted her bulk forward, taking an ungainly step that caused how enormous, circular form to jiggle. It was incredibly difficult to even move her feet at the moment under her juice filled body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you walk?\" Carrie asked, noting Emma's distress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting pretty hard...\" Emma exhaled slowly, feeling exhausted just after that one movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could always roll you, ha!\" Beth chuckled at her sarcastic suggestion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Emma wasn't sure that was such a bad idea...they needed to get to a safer location, and it was going to take hours to do that under her own weight. She was basically a large, blue ball at the moment anyway, maybe rolling around was the answer? The others were probably going to have another growth spurt at some point, so if they were going to do it, it would need to be soon...</span></div></div>",

Not willing to turn all the way around, she spoke loudly enough to be heard from her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your idea is great, Beth.\" Emma huffed out. The pear girl raised her eye at the statement. She scratched the back of her head before she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your idea is great.\" Emma said. \"I can't exactly move fast at the moment and the two of you are smaller than me. So roll me.around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth and Carrie stared at the blueberry for a moment. Beth gaping at her in shock, while Carrie seemed to be seriously considering the suggestion. The pear lady finally found the words to speak towards the blueberry giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,um, I don't know if you noticed, but you look pretty heavy.\" If Beth could've seen Emma's face, she would've saw the woman's frown.\" I don't think we would be able to push you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\" Emma replied. \"I'm near spherical, albeit I still have my legs and arms, I can be pushed! Just let gravity and my curvature be your helping hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth was about to reply right until Carrie interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree with Emma.\" Carrie shrugged causing her breasts and stomach to shake. \"She is a scientist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lab assistant.\" Beth mumbled out. Craning her head to the ceiling, Beth did her best to figure out how the would do this. \"Is the ceiling high enough?\" She stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so.\" Emma shot back.\"It seems spacious enough and I haven't seen any cabinets to stop us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls were unaware that while their conversation was going on the house slowly grew wider and higher to allow their plan to occur. The three argued for a few minutes,but they came to a compromise. Emma was about to sit down to allow the rolling to begin,before she was stopped by Carrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" The strawberry yelled out. \"If you sit down, we can't move you. You still have legs and arms and your head out. You'll just hurt your neck. How about you lay on your side and we'll push you that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma complied beginning to shuffle to her side. Beth and Carrie gaped one again as they saw just how curvy Emma's profile shot was. The woman didn't notice and laid down onto her back. It wasn't a graceful landing as Emma landed with an shockwave of a thud. Laying on her back, she waited for the girls to begin.The pear and the strawberry looked at each other and nodded. Walking,or waddling, over to Emma and beginning their task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heaved at her massive form,and with some luck,began to move the blue form.It started slowly,but slowly Emma picked up speed. However, it was still stop and go as Carrie's large breasts and stomach made it difficult for the woman to get a good grip on the blueberry. Beth,not having anything block her arms, seemed to be the one doing the most work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this is going well!\" Emma happily proclaimed, weirdly enthusiastic of her rolling, though she did frown when she felt something on her side. \"Are one of you sweating heavily? It feels like somebody poured a jug of water on me! And is that strawberry I smell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Carrie spoke out. \"Its my...<i>juices.</i> This red stuff comes out of my boobs now and then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth giggled at the Carrie's statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind;this sucks.\" Emma stated.</span></div></div>",

This left Emma on her chest, her hear pointed towards a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth! Carrie! You two have only been pushing me for like, five minutes or something!\" Emma complained. The two smaller fruits girls weren't listening and were trying their best to catch their breath. Their gigantic juice filled bodies jiggled like jello. The duo could now feel their bodies release sweat due to their mild exertion.Carrie wiped her forehead as beads of sweat poured down,stopping upon smelling a distinct fragrance. Putting her nose against her arm and taking a deep whiff of the limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! My sweat smells like strawberry!\" Carrie screamed. Beth looked over to her friend and proceeded to mimic her actions. But instead of smelling, she gave her arm a nice lick. Smacking her lips a little from the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. If your body is leaking juice right now, it probably means your other functions are flavored with your fruit juice.\" Emma answered the strawberry. Beth scratched her head a little in thought, before a question popped into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, does that mean what comes out of our-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully that doesn't come up!'/Talk later!\" Emma and Carrie yelled out immediately,each giving a little cough after each sentence. A light stretch and a short warm up later, the two smaller fruits began to roll Emma again.All three girls keeping silent watch for any sounds. Which lasted a little bit, before Carrie's body emitted a deep gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" The strawberry whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie stopped rolling Emma and clutched her body in discomfort. Her red face beginning to turn an even darker color while her body grew. The girl's shirt slowly creaked, like a dam holding back red waters, but soon that dam burst! Juice spurted everywhere onto Emma's side and Carrie's shirt exploded outwards. Carrie's remaining buttons hit the house's floor with tiny clinks and clanks. Her breasts and stomach pumped up like three balloons attached to a hose line. The red girl's field of view slowly growing smaller and smaller with each growth of her prodigious girth. Finally the transformation ended, leaving Carrie with a stomach that could make octo-mom blush and breasts half the size of that. Beth watched open mouth and looked back at her own rear,followed by her stomach, wondering when her time was coming. Silent reined supreme for a few moments, until a voice broke the stillness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but did you have to be pointing my way for that?\" Emma screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Carrie replied, her blush still on her face. Emma groaned in humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get back to rolling me,okay? Unless Beth over here wants to add a little of herself onto me?\" The blueberry said. And so the two began to push against the soaked blue near-sphere. Beth grumbling that her hands were now stained with a red juice. It was like this for awhile before they felt how tight the passage was getting. Seeing as there was no way to go back, they two went forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Push, keep pushing,keep-\" Emma was soon cut off as her flesh contracted around her neck from the force. The duo struggled and grunted as they placed force onto the blue side of the woman. And with a mighty heave, the two managed to get Emma out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\" The near-sphere yelled in comfort. Beth and Carrie high-fived each other in awe of their accomplishment, though they stopped when they saw where they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did this place have a ballroom this big or did we miss it the somehow?\" Beth stated as she turned her body around to stare at the entire place. The three seemed to be stuck in a massive arena that dwarfed even their size,but they should've had seen it from the outside. Where were they now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about checking those windows, I can see they moonlight coming through them. Hell, open up those windows and push me out of here!\" Emma said. Carrie was about to walk over, but was stopped as a voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't do that if I were you.\" The three fruits looked,or in Emma's case shook, to find the source of the sound..Beth's eye caught something and the pear swiveled her body to watch the direction.

But..changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that she was suffering from the fruit attack that the other girls were affected by. Her skin was a peach color,which contrasted with her normally pale tone. Her hair had strains of green riddled in it. But the most eye-catching thing about her was that she was pantsless and was carrying a hefty trunk with her. She was like Beth but with an even<i> larger </i>sets of hips and buttocks. No belly though, just flat as usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe peach girl seemed to be covering her privates with her hands, doing her best not to flash her friends.

Shaking their heads in apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacey, you've been gone for a day already.\" Carrie gently spoke. The peach's hands rose up to cover her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

I need to sit down.\" Stacey spoke. She promptly plopped herself on her expanded rear with an open mouth. Beth and Carrie one again looked at each other, before they followed the girl onto the floor. The girls had many questions in their heads, but decided on what to choose. The most prominent one being \"How did you get like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to hear another backstory until they escaped, Carrie broke the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacey. What did you mean by 'I wouldn't do that if I were you' just a few moments ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe peach looked over to the strawberry and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was thinner, I tried to escape through the windows in a place sorta like this. Whatever controls this freaky place didn't seem to like that and promptly sent...I don't know how to describe it. It was something large and very mean. I manged to get away,but i'm betting if we do that again, we're going to see another big nasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so we're back to square one!\" Beth cried out, throwing her hands into the air.</span></div></div>",

Her belly rose up like a circus tent, it gurgle as it plumped up. Emma tried to grab her stomach, for whatever reason, but her ability to grab anything was soon becoming impaired.

It was just them and nature. Well, them, nature, and the automated cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince permanently becoming berries, the two needed more help with their day to day activities. They could roll themselves just fine, but other things were now impossible. The cabin's automated systems helped with that. Just now, the cabin had made them breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two rolled into the cabin's kitchen, and the automated kitchen helped them eat breakfast, since their hands were in no position to do so. Once that was done, they rolled to the fireplace to just relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... so nice to just get out of town for a while.\" Stacey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Katie replied. \"Still, some days I wish I could see my feet. Or eat on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey looked over her wife. \"I think you've swollen again. By about an inch.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn.\" Katie muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespire being full berries now, Katey and Stacey were still swelling, though at a very slow rate. In a few years time, they might be too large to fit in the cabin. But that was years away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth invited us to the premire of her new movie, Blue Romance.\" Stacey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will Carrie and Emma be there?\" Katie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma's still getting used to sharing a body with Mary, so she's out, but Carrie will be.\" Stacey answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie sighed. \"It's so rare to see Emma these days.\" She said. \"She's being called a hero for stopping the Blueing from affecting future generations, but no one sees her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes the moments we do see her all the more special.\" Stacey replied. Katie just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Earth had changed, sure. But in the end, life finds a way to adapt.</span></div></div>",

She was older now and a well respected scientist thanks to her paper on the biology of her own body and possible ways to adapt to it. Of course, she was still blue and very much big and filled with juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had decided to forego being cured, a research team charged into the mansion and conducted a massive raid. Though they did not encounter Mary, they did find the girls under the mansion. They quickly got them out and after that, the mansion completely caved in on itself as if it signified the end of such a place. The only thing that remained standing was the greenhouse with the blueberries that changed their lives forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't all bad for the girls. Beth's new body quickly gained popularity with a number of small time directors, giving her the chance to live her acting dreams. She was nicknamed the Bluest Girl in Hollywood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie quit her job and moved out to the country where she went on entering herself in a few country fairs.

Katie is still a personal trainer but she uses her skills to help the other women like her navigate their new bodies, proving they don't need to rely on anyone but themselves and each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma finished her drink as she gave a little burp. \"Well Mary...not sure where you are now but...thanks for the blue.\" she giggled before waddling off as Mary looked down from above with a smile before fading.

Her glasses lied in front of her as she set aside some hair strands that were in her face. She felt a cold chill, remembering what the plants had done to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around her, she noticed her blouse, jacket and pants on the floor. Though she remembered it had been torn off but strangely were intact. Emma tried to get up from the cold floor only to feel somewhat heavier. A confused Emma, couldn't see much due to the darkness. She struggled to push herself upright, annoyed by the effort to do so. After some attempts, her breasts swaying, Emma finally sat upright on her butt. She could feel her thighs rubbed against her belly,meaning something had changed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what did that slime do to me... Hope it didn't make me fat!\" Emma mumbled as she reached for her pants and took out her cellphone. She turned on her flashlight app on her cellphone. She grew pale in shock as she looked down at her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's belly had stuck out quite a bit but Emma knew that the slime was a whole lot larger than that. Her breasts which sat on her belly, grew larger, stretching her bra to the limit as she breathed heavily. Her breasts jiggled at each inhale and exhale as she could see her breath due to the coldness. Her thighs had gained some weight, her hips widen a bit while her butt grew as well making her panties a semi-thong. Strangely, her belly felt warm as Emma could feel it emanate heat somewhat similar to the slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's just a belly, Emma. No way it could've...</i>\" Emma thought as she felt movements. Cold sweat had dripped down the left side of her forehead. She looked down at her belly once more to see visible movement from her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma slowly felt her belly, it was taut and firm but round. Emma knew the signs as she once had a patient like this. She came to a conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I'm pregnant with a slime! Wonder how the girls will see me now.\" Emma mumbled to herself. \"Well, could be worse! That slime would've made me extremely fat or something else!\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma felt a kick as her belly jerked her body forward, startling her. Placing her hand at where it happen, it kicked her again. This time she felt what was a little foot. The tottaly changed her mind of what was inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oookay...\" Emma said to herself. Rubbing the sport as it was still moving. \"That was definitely a baby's foot. But I don't remember any human inside that smile when I examined before it somewhat assimilated itself into my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma brainstormed a bit, trying to figure out theories possible. It could be cooking, possession, her mind playing tricks as maybe there was some hallucination drug the plants gave her. But the violent kicks of her now \"baby\" quickly knocked her out of her stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! All right! Sheesh! You're just like Stacy when I go brainstorming.\" Emma said to her belly as she soothed it. She looked at her near naked body. \"Hopefully, these still fit. No way I'm walking around a dead beat mansion in bras and panties!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma slowly pulled her pants on, struggling as she pulled them up but couldn't zip it due to her enlarged belly. Her blouse looked like a secondary bras with only two or three buttons that supported her boobs while showing a lot of cleavage then her jacket. Placing her cellphone in her right pocket of her jacket, she pulled out a scrungee and tied her long hair into a neat ponytail. Emma adjusted her glasses once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Now to get up...</i>\" Emma thought as she tried to push herself to her feet. Using the wall as support, she leaned on the wall and slid upwards. Feeling the weight of her belly on her hips,knees and ankles. Emma rubbed her lower back with both hands and looked at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez! I'm huge! No way this is an ordinary pregnancy! If I'd known better! I'd say I'm carrying a giant baby!\" Emma said to herself in awe.

Maintaining balance, she saw the door that was once blocked by the slimenand vegetation.

Giving it a gentle tug, she heard it break away from its tree with a light snap. Illuminating it with her phone, she eyes the shiny red fruit, giving a thoughtful hum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Interesting...</i> She thought, rotating it slowly in her hand. <i>Despite the obvious lack of an owner, all the fruit in this place seems to be thriving... Well, on the surface anyway. I'm not entirely sure about the taste and honestly, I'm a little reluctant to find out...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill rotating the apple slowly, Emma rolled the potential dangers of eating it around her head. Unable to come up with anything more dangerous and improbable than a witch had poisoned it, she shrugged and took a large bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crunch echoed around the empty greenhouse for a few seconds, followed by Emma's surprised moan. <br>\r\n<i>It tastes... absolutely divine! She thought, chewing slowly. So juicy, so crisp and so tasty! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly polishing it off, she dropped the core into an empty pot next to her while, without really meaning to, reaching for another Apple. Pulling it off the tree, she took a bite out of it before holding it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Behold!\" She declared through a mouthful of apple. \"The newest Apple product, the iApple! Get one today for only $99!\"<br>\r\nWith her sales pitch over, she finished off yet another apple, chucking the core into the same pot behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching for a third apple, Emma wasted no time in devouring it. Unlike the last two, which she had chewed slowly in order to savour its taste, this one was chewed quickly and swallowed quickly. Another core was flung over her shoulder, landing next to the pot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple after delicious apple vanished into Emma's mouth until the tree she had been grabbing from had been picked dry. Letting out a quiet burp and wiping a bit of apple juice from her chin, Emma shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Urgh... I feel so full... But they were some damn good apples! I should grab a couple of seeds to plant at home\".<br>\r\nAs Emma turned to the small pile of cores behind her...</span></div></div>",

Then the thought of how filling and amazing those apples were came to her mind. Emma briefly argued in her head and came to a conclusion. She headed back to her pile of apple cores and started picking them apart. Looking for a seed to plant for herself back home. Wait, maybe her friends would want some? So in turn, Emma started picking even more apple cores apart; she could even sell them to some people who desired  apple trees! So she started to pick even more apple cores for herself and her friends and some buyers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not stealing anything, this house has been abandoned for years. In any case, whoever planted this just left these perfectly good fruits go to waste!\" Emma said to herself, justifying her choice. Emma nonchalantly picked apart the apple cores, receiving a hefty amount of seeds. While she was doing this, a change was going to through her body. All the while the poor girl plundered the apple cores that were causing this mutation.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0First,a small red dot appeared on her nose, smaller than a pin prick. Slowly it grew to the size of an eraser head, then a grape, then finally covering the entire nose. It spread throughout her face; her lips especially gaining a glossy red covering and maybe becoming a little plumper? All the while Emma whistled to herself, content at looking through her loot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It spread down her neck, before splitting apart. One color going for her cleavage; the other one covering her back. The cleavage coloration moved slowly down her breasts, heading for her navel. The back coloration covered its side of the torso;if she was shirtless,one could see an almost angel-like pattern. Right before the coloration took her entire back, covering it up. Steadily, the cleavage flowed downwards, coloring her privates red. Her genitals received an almost gloss-like coverage. Her back coloration followed suit, her buttocks gained the dark red<br>\r\nof an apple. Finally the two reds met and combined together. Reaching the end point of her thighs, calves, and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Strangely, her arms seemed to be totally unaffected by this process. Almost as if a strange intelligence was messing with the Emma, trying it's best not to alert her of the change. That did not last however and the coloring spread from her shoulders, its goal the rest of her arms. This process was even more snail-like than the others. Like it was planning on surprising Emma about her development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think twenty-five seeds is good enough.\" Emma proclaimed. Dusting herself off with one hand, Emma put her seed into her pocket and sent forth from the Greenhouse. Still oblivious to her, mostly, red body. Which wouldn't be a \"mostly\" red soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I hope these little guys won't be damaged. I don't want to eat <i>more</i> apples to get the seeds out.\" Emma joked to herself, calmly walking to the edge of the garden. Reaching for the door back into the mansion. By this point however, the red had already colored both her arms. Her hand closed around the handle, giving Emma a full view of her change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To her, her skin still appeared to be white, however that was due to the moonlight reflecting off her slightly shiny skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing into the house, Emma found herself standing in pure darkness. Wherever she was seemed to have no windows, which allowed no light into the room. <br>\r\n \"Did this place exist before electricity or something?\" She wondered, pulling her phone out of her pocket. Turning the light on, she inspected her surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to be in some sort of kitchen/dining room combination. Just in front of her and to the left slightly was a table with four chairs. Strangely, despite the house appearing to have been deserted for many years, the table was set for four. Silver cutlery gleaned and fluttered as she shone her light over the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A table set for four?\" She mumbled, moving towards one of the chairs. \"And they seemed to be just washed too... Maybe somebody else set the table? Although that's could be considered pretty dire if they're expecting us to stay long enough for food. If we are, I think I'm just have a few more of those divine apples...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the table, Emma wandered into the kitchen segment of the room. Unlike the table, which looked brand new, the kitchen looked as though a tornado of dust and leftover food had blown through it at some point. Dishes and glasses were piled high in the sink, while the fridge door hung open slightly, revealing a plate with a mouldy... something sitting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining her light around the room, she searched for any signs that Stacey had been through here. Fingerprints on the dusty countertops, items that looked out of place... Emma found none of these. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a disappointed sigh, she looked towards an archway next to the fridge. <br>\r\n \"Well, nobody's been in here...

She really did <i>not </i>want to be here, but she and Stacey had known each other since their college days, and she couldn't bring herself to say no when Katie had asked her to come on this little rescue mission. Beth was pretty sure that Stacey wasn't even here - it had only been a day, and Beth figured that Stacey was just at some guy's house, or sleeping off a hangover. She and Stacey had been regular party goers during their college years, and had often helped each other through bad hangovers the morning after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if Stacey was here, they had to find her. It was very unlike her to just go off the radar, hangover or not. Beth just wanted to get out of here as a soon as possible. She had even cancelled a date to be here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the floorboards creaked and groaned under her feet, Beth looked around nervously. She was less worried about ghosts and more worried about spiders and cobwebs, because this whole place looked like it hadn't been cleaned in over a century. This was definitely not her natural environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked on, she realized she probably just have dressed a little more conservatively, because her current outfit really wasn't suitable for this place. It was also way, way colder in here than it was outside. Beth was wearing a black crop top and a very tight pair of jeans that showed off her impressively round behind. Now, she realized a sweater would probably have been a better choice...</span></div></div>",

Disappointingly, she still had no signal, but she felt the need to keep checking every few seconds. She hated being without her phone. She had just uploaded a picture of herself to Instagram, surrounded by the fog outside, and was dying to see how many likes it had gotten. In the past year, she had amassed nearly five thousand followers due to her glamour shots and modelling work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor good measure, she snapped another picture of herself pulling a goofy expression as she passed one of the hall's glowing lanterns. Heading onwards, she found herself in a dusty, run down kitchen. \"Gross, this place needs a good clean,\" Beth said, wiping her finger along a filthy table top before blowing the dust off the tip. \"Stacey, you here? Nope? Okay, room cleared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to turn around when she noticed that, strangely, there was an electronic humming coming from somewhere in the room. She moved a little closer to the space where the noise was emanating from, and saw that it was actually an enormous fridge. What a modern day fridge was doing in a place like this, Beth had no idea. It looked so out of place in the rest of the room. Beth moved towards the fridge and pulled it open, revealing, to her surprise, a vast array of food that looked perfectly fresh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, who's keeping this thing stocked?\" Beth wondered as she peered inside at the vast array of meats, cakes, treats and drinks. \"This thing is freaking huge.\"</span></div></div>",

Whoever filled this thing up, they had certainly spent a lot money. It was like having a mini supermarket to hand. Unconsciously, Beth found herself reaching for something on the shelf; she didn't really even register that her hand was stretching out, grasping a nearby slice of thick, chocolatey cake and pulling it towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May as well...eat this...\" Beth muttered. Part of her was a little confused about how the cake had ended up in her hand so quickly, but before she could really think about it any longer, she found herself biting into it. It tasted absolutely amazing; a thick, chocolate sponge with cream filling, tastier than any cake she had ever eaten before. As she went for a second bite, she was practically drooling. \"Urgh...so good. What have they put in this stuff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the first slice of cake was demolished, and Beth was reaching for something else. She usually restricted her diet to salads and healthy foods, barely even touching sweets or chocolate, except as a rare treat, but now she found herself inexplicably drawn to them. She seized what appeared to be a fully prepped plate of chocolate eclairs and stuffed them into her mouth, one by one. They were so light and delicious, she ploughed through them in no time, practically swallowing them down in one bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth knew she should have stopped there, but instead, she sank to her knees and started rifling through the fridge for something else. She quickly settled on what appeared to be an entire row of hot dogs, and started gnawing through them. Everything tasted so good. She didn't even <i>like </i>hot dogs though. Why was she eating them now? It didn't matter. They were too good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to think clearly, Beth just kept stuffing herself. She wasn't even hungry, yet her stomach seemed to crave more and more. Had she been paying attention, she might have noticed that her normally flat, toned stomach was starting to bloat out considerably, filling her lap as she sat on the floor in front of the fridge, bulging and groaning with the vast amount of food she was consuming in such a short space of time...</span></div></div>",

By now, she had almost cleared half of one of the lower shelves, an impressive fear considering the sheer size of the fridge. Had she stopped for a moment, she would've realised that, no matter how much she ate, she never felt full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't stop. Lost in her gluttony, Beth rammed more and more rich and fatty sweets into her mouth. And as she did, her belly continued to push outwards, forcing her top upwards until a band of pale flesh bulged out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the chill on her exposed midriff, Beth was still blissfully ignorant of her swelling belly. Even as it gurgled and groaned as the food within it began to digest and add fat to the rest of her slim frame, she continued to gorge herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs food was digested, her belly shrunk down slightly. It was still heavy and round, but was no longer firm and stuffed full. Her average breasts began to fill with fat, her bra slowly tightening around them until it was digging into the softening orbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath her, her equally average backside began to swell. Her ass cheeks slowly rounded out, her heels pushing into them. Her thighs began to press against her calves, while soft fat bulged over the waistband of her jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This stuff is so good...\" Beth groaned, finishing off another slice of divine chocolate cake. She swiped sauce from her chin with a finger, missing the fact that she now had a second one, and stuffed it into her mouth, moaning happily as she licked the rich sauce from her finger. Wiping her saliva on her jeans, Beth shoved her head back into the fridge, eager to see what other treats it held for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>=====</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Urrrp... Delicious...\"<br>\r\nTaking a break from her stuffing, Beth leaned back. Her constant stuffing had taken its toll on her body, completely destroying her once slim form. Each breast looked like a watermelon resting atop the hefty orb of fat that was her belly. Rips had opened up in the knees of her jeans, which had given into her flabby lower body in places and allowed flesh to bulge through the holes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her soft face, which had the beginnings of a third chin, Beth let out another burp.<br>\r\n \"I could go for a little more...\" She mumbled, staring into the fridge. Despite the amount she had eaten, she had barely made a dent in the mass amount of food stored within the unit...</span></div></div>",

The delicious, addictive snacks in the fridge had lulled her into a sense of security, and she hadn't even thought to check her reflection as she normally would. Loading up her hands, Beth grabbed two huge chocolate chip cookies, and devoured them greedily. She washed them down with a large jug of milk, chugging it down so quickly that she had to stop and breathe for a moment when she discarded the empty jug on the milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to raid the fridge - practically on her hands and knees as she rummaged for something new to try - her pants, stretched to their limits, pulled themselves down slightly, exposing the top half of her newly fattened ass. Again, Beth didn't notice. The top button on her pants popped open as she chowed down on another hot dog, and still, no reaction. Beth was only concerned with satisfying her newfound appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time Beth reached for something else, she found a new item; Pizza, Pasta, Pies, Quiche, Sausages, Chicken legs, Brownies...there seemed to be an endless menu on offer. Beth's once slender, sexy figure was ballooning at an alarming rate as she stuffed herself even quicker. The rips in her jeans began to wide, allowing more of her pudgy flesh to escape and bulge free. Her cheeks inflated with food, and her double chin steadily grew even bigger as her entire face became soft and chubby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth shifted uncomfortably as her top pulled tighter and tighter across her increasingly spherical gut, straining under the weight of her ever expanding tits and belly. Her pants creaked audibly, barely able to take the strain now that she was at least three sizes too big for them. Her once svelte, slender frame had all but vanished, leaving behind a plump, hungry fat girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth opened up a large bottle of Pepsi and chugged it down, washing down the Cheeseburgers she had just eaten. Her belly bloated once again, rising up and out as it inflated with the bubbles from the Pepsi. Beth put down the bottle and groaned as she felt her stomach fill with gas, then released a huge belch. \"URRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\" Beth moaned as she blushed, red with embarrassment over her gluttonous outburst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to excuse herself when she heard a loud ripping from beneath her. For the first time, she seemed to stop thinking about food for long enough to notice that her shirt was in the process of tearing apart. It ripped one side to the other, bursting off her body as a huge, full, pair of breasts exploding out, She barely had time to react to that sight before another tremendous rip came from her backside. She was momentarily confused before she felt a cold breeze on her ass, and saw her jeans falling away in little scraps around her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning, Beth grasped her food stuffed belly and, finally, saw what had happened to her. For a moment, she could only sit there, completely naked, totally fat, and utterly confused...</span></div></div>",

But no, it was impossible...wasn't it? Nobody gained two hundred pounds in two minutes. Beth tried to move, but felt herself too heavy to even stand. That was definitely not a good sign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not real, not real, not real...BURRRRRRRRRRRP!\" A look of horror crossed Beth's face as she belched noisily. That definitely shouldn't have happened if this wasn't real. But no, it still didn't make sense. She was fine. She was seeing things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newly chubby blonde groaned as she rose to her feet, her bloated belly gurgling noisily. She suppressed another belch as she drew herself upwards, wobbling from side to side clumsily and steadying her heavy frame against the kitchen table. The side of her gravid gut brushed the table, sending a shudder of pleasure through her overly sensitive body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the scraps of clothing on the floor; torn jeans, a split shirt...panties...a burst bra...this really wasn't looking good. On the floor, just next to the remains of her jeans, she spotted her phone and bent over to pick it up. Her bulging belly dropped down, nearly causing her to fall flat on her face, but she managed to grab the phone and activate her camera. \"We'll see about this,\" she muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth screamed as she brought the phone to her face and was greeted by a very chubby looking version of her formerly slender, angular face. She was still pretty, but with a second chin and chubby, round cheeks. She screamed again as tears flooded her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME?!\" She wailed. </span></div></div>",

Beth groaned in annoyance, wondering if Emma was intentionally ignoring her. \"Seriously, Em, stay away from that thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma leaned in even further, barely registering Emma's voice as she took in the sight of a fully stocked, packed fridge. The shelves were so jam packed full of meats, pastries and other delicious foods that Emma found it hard to believe that Beth had so much as snacked on a single Pizza slice. The shelves were practically overflowing. What was it Emma had said? To keep <i>away </i>from the food? Or to try some? Surely it was the latter? Who wouldn't want to try this stuff? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma found herself reaching for a large Turkey leg to her right and biting into it. It was so succulent and tasty, she kept biting, wearing it down to the bone before dropping it to the ground. Her hands next went to a huge Pie to her left, already cut into slices. She grabbed one slice and bit into it, drool running down her chin. \"Urghhhh so good! Man, whoever whipped this up was a great chef!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Emma...\" Beth was waddling towards her friend, concerned that she was starting to pick at anything she could get her hands on. \"That's enough. You tried the food. Come on, step away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma didn't register that. Instead, she continued ploughing through the Pie greedily, stuffing slice after slice into her mouth.

Grinning eagerly, she finished off the pie and moved on to a large bowl of Pasta; shoving her hands into the bowl and cramming handfuls of creamy pasta into her mouth greedily. Losing interest in that pretty quickly, she grabbed another Turkey leg and took a bite, discarding it almost instantly when she spotted a huge wedge of Cheese right next to her face. Not even bringing her hands to it, she turned her head awkwardly and took a large bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mff....so good...urghh...\" Groaning in satisfaction, Emma pushed her head further inside, eager to keep experimenting with different snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind her, Beth could see Emma ravenously tearing into whatever she could get her hands on. She seemed to be sampling everything in sight, which, considering the vast array of food on offer, was quite a bit of sampling. \"Emma, slow it down! Jeez! Can't you hear me?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, she couldn't. Because Emma didn't slow down at all. Beth wondered if this was what she had looked like during her fridge-binge; some ravenous, greedy pig stuffing her face mindlessly? She shuddered at the thought. She really had to do something before Emma ate too much. She took a step forward, but was distracted when she heard a groaning sound coming from Emma's jeans. Looking down, she saw that Emma's already ample butt was visibly expanding, her butt inflating slowly but surely and stretching her tight jeans across her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma, you need to stop eating right now!\" Beth shouted, but still, Emma didn't respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth took another step forward, watching curiously as Emma's plump behind continued to swell. As she got closer, Emma turned to the side, revealing her very bloated looking stomach. She belched nosily and began to chug down a pitcher of milk, absent mindedly wiping a greasy hand on the seat of her pants, oblivious to it's increased size. Beth gasped and went to shout at Emma once again, but suddenly felt a tingling in her own belly; for a second, she thought she was getting hungry again, but the tingling was instead accompanied by a strange lightness in her stuffed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, afraid of what she might see this time, Beth was pleasantly surprised to her her globular gut <i>shrinking</i>! \"Oh my God, I'm slimming down!\" She squealed with glee, before looking back at Emma, who appeared to be inflating more quickly as she devoured a cheesecake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was happening? Could it be that her added pounds were now transferring to Emma?! Beth wasn't sure how to react...</span></div></div>",

Well, until she looked down again and saw both her flabby breasts and bulging stomach visibly shrink back into her torso. Looking back up at Emma, who had tossed the empty milk pitcher aside and had returned to the bowl of pasta, Beth sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry, Emma...\" She said quietly, walking to her friends side and kneeling next to her. \"But the fat look just isn't for me! Hopefully it'll suit you a lot better... Well, even if it doesn't, you don't really have a choice in the matter. Now, eat up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing a silver platter piled high with plate sized chocolate chip cookies closer to her, Beth watched with mixed amazement and guilt as Emma, still cramming handfuls of creamy pasta into her mouth, reached a hand out, grabbed one and took a large bite out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow alternating between the bowl and the platter, it didn't take the ravenous Emma long to clean out both. Simultaneously ramming the last bit of cookie and the last few pieces of pasta into her mouth, a satisfied belch escaped Emma's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving the tomato and chocolate scented stench away, Beth ran a hand over her belly, which had slimmed down considerably during Emma's binge. Her soft gut had vanished, replaced with a still noticeable potbelly. Her breasts had almost returned to their usual size, as had her lower body. What didn't fix itself, unfortunately, was her lack of clothing, but she wasn't too bothered by that at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the reason for this sudden uncaring about nakedness? Well, it was Emma, of course, whose clothes were seconds away from exploding away from her fattening body. During her feast, her body had quickly inflated to the size Beth had been. However, due to her larger assets, Emma sported a softer set of breasts and a wider backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emma let out a groan and started on a platter of thick pink ham, Beth's body finally returned to its usual size, prompting a cheer from the once heavily obese girl. <br>\r\n \"Yay!\" She clapped happily. \"Back to normal!

Tapping her on the shoulder, she tried to get her rapidly expanding friend's attention. \"Emma, time to stop.\" Emma still didn't respond, so Beth tried shaking her by the shoulders, but that also had no effect. Emma just kept eating mindlessly; her bloated stomach forcing her shirt up over her newfound gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she considered her next move, Beth realised she was standing on the tattered remains of her own clothes. Looking down, she spotted the ruins of her stretched out pants and a bra that had torn in two. Her shirt had ripped in half, but it was still usable, so she knelt down and picked it up, tying the two torn ends together and pulling it over her head. It at least covered her breasts and afforded her a little modesty. She repeated this process with her panties; the elastic had snapped, but she slid them back on over her slender thighs and tied a knot at the torn ends, covering herself up. \"There, that'll do for now.\" It was actually kind of hot. If she had her phone she would have taken a selfie. She was just about to look for it when she a deep, gassy belch from Emma caught her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth looked up and saw that Emma's ass was quickly rising out of her pants. All the weight she was gaining seemed to be going straight to her butt, overflowing the top of her jeans, and causing tears to appear across her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, I only looked away for like a second!\" Beth grumbled. She hurried back over to Emma, who was letting out another belch. \"STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill mid-belch, Emma seemed to register Beth's presence for the first time. \"B-Beth? Wh-what am I...am I dreaming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop eating okay? Just stop! You're getting huge!\" Beth grabbed Emma under her thick, flabby arm and pulled her back, or, at least, tried to. She was way too heavy to move now. Beth just groaned uselessly as she tried to yank her friend away. \"Don't look at the fridge dammit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked back at the fridge dumbly, then back at Beth, then down at her massively bloated gut. \"Oh my God...I'm huge! How did I get huge?!\" Emma screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same way I did...I think you uh...gained all my weight,\" Beth admitted, leaving out the part where she had encouraged her to keep stuffing her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...you're thin again! BURRRRRP!\" Emma covered her mouth in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma shuffled back on her ass slightly, forcing her pants down a little more and exposing half of her huge butt. Beth looked away awkwardly, and quickly slammed the fridge door shut, eager to avoid being drawn back inside. Feeling a little guilty, she looked over Emma's chubby, bloated body. Amazingly, her clothes had stayed on, but she could hear them gently ripping and creaking every time Emma shifted her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, time to get out of here,\" Beth said, adjusting her makeshift panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, can't we change me back too?\" Emma asked frantically. \"I can't go anywhere like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth considered this for a moment...</span></div></div>",

There were still two, maybe three, people in this house that had no idea what was happening in the kitchen.

Anyway, how would you even get somebody to eat from it? We don't know where anybody is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth didn't answer. She too seemed to be staring intently at the closed fridge. As Emma watched, she took a step towards it. Emma contemplated letting her go, but shook the thought from her head.

But we can't let her get too big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't,\" Beth assured her. \"Look, she's barely even-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the girls turned their attention back to Katie, she was ravenously forcing two burgers into her mouth at the same time, moaning softly as she chewed down on the greasy, delicious smelling meat. Cheese exploded out of the sides of bun, and she licked her fingers clean to make sure she got it all. The svelte athlete, who would normally eat only the healthiest foods, was now pigging out on some of the most calorie filled snacks she had ever tasted. As she continued to stuff herself, the tight, firm abs beneath her grey tank top were starting to bulge out, inflating rapidly as she ploughed through more and more Cheeseburgers. The top became increasingly tight, once designed to fit her muscular, well defined stomach, it now emphasised her bloated tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Katie's toned, lean arms were starting to lose their definition. As a fine layer of flab covered her arms and travelled down to her legs, her clothes constricted even more. Her angular face softened as her cheeks bulged with food. Reaching further inside the fridge, Katie grabbed a handful of chocolate eclairs and starting chowing down on them, quickly cramming one after the other into her greedy mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was happening, Emma was starting to feel a little lighter. Her large pot belly was receding slowly. She smiled happily as she saw herself begin to deflate every so slightly, her clothes began to feel much less constricting, though still comically undersized for her thicker body. \"I think it's working!\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth nodded in agreement, but she was only half paying attention. Still watching Katie, she could see that her trim athletic physique was starting to melt away. Her tank top was starting to ride up above her belly button as her newfound chub pushed out. The process seemed to be taking a little longer with Katie, perhaps due to her quick metabolism and peak physical condition? Beth wasn't sure, but Katie seemed to be taking a little longer to round out the way she and Emma had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden \"pop\" alerted the girls to the fact that Katie had just lost the top button of her jeans, which were now clinging to her thicker, meatier legs. Her soft, flabby stomach bulged out even further, filling the gap created by the missing button and allowing her stomach to round out into a full blown pot belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think she's gained a good twenty pounds now, maybe we should stop her,\" Emma suggested. Her own body was starting to look a little less rotund, going from fully fat to rather chubby. Her clothes looked a little looser, but when she stood up, there was another tearing noise. \"Maybe just a second more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's pants stretched audibly over her plumpening backside, while her belly lurched forward again, sagging over the waistband of her jeans. Her swelling middle caused her tank top to ride up even further, bunching just beneath her breasts, which were now starting to expand a little too, though not to quite the size of Emma's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Emma felt a little relief as her bra suddenly felt a lot less constricting. Moving forward slightly, she said to Beth, \"do we stop her now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably a good idea,\" Beth said. \"I reckon she's approaching fifty pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, they took a tentative step forward, grabbed Katie by each arm, and yanked her back. The three girls stumbled back towards the kitchen table, breathing a sigh of relief. Katie rubbed her head groggily and let out a loud, gassy belch as she looked around in confusion, then, looked down at her body...</span></div></div>",

The reason for her sudden difficulties quickly became clear as she watched her belly jiggle for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm still growing?!\"<br>\r\nBeth let out a shriek, plump hands going to her belly. Colliding with the soft surface, she felt her belly swell outwards slightly, enveloping a little more of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Emma, who had completely given into the fridge at this point and was now stuffing herself full of whatever she could grab, Beth noticed that, despite the amount she was eating, she wasn't putting on any weight at all. Her perky breasts bounced slightly as she grabbed food, but her belly and backside remained the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emma finished off a rather rich and fatty looking pie, Beth let out a groan as her body expanded. Her legs shook madly, causing the rest of her flabby body to quiver. Stepping forwards again, Beth's legs finally gave out. The heavy girl went crashing to floor with a meaty slap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow pinned under her own steadily increasing weight, Beth was powerless to do anything other than watch her friend gorge herself on fattening treats and not put any weight on at all. As a golden pastry disappeared down Emma's throat, an explanation began to form in the back of Beth's mind. It was far-fetched and she had no idea how it worked, but it was the only thing she could think off that explained their situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Anything Emma eats goes straight to my body...</i> Beth thought in disbelief, her backside inching across the tiled floor as Emma gulped down a pitcher of milk. <i>If that's true, I need to stop her! I don't wanna be any fatter!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Emma!\" Beth called out. \"You gotta stop! You're making me bigger!\"<br>\r\nEmma didn't respond, too busy stuffing her mouth full. <br>\r\n \"EMMA!\" Beth screamed. \"PLEASE, STOP!\"</span></div></div>",

Seeing nothing that would look amiss in a kitchen, her gaze fell upon her own uncovered flabby body. Her plump lips were agape slightly, allowing a strand of stool to dribble out the corner of her mouth, as she stared at herself in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment had passed, Beth shrugged. She lazily scratched her flabby belly before leaning forwards again. Now on her hands and knees, her naked body swayed as she reached a hand out, pulling a plate holding a delicious looking marble cake towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she snatched up a handful of cake and began to messily munch through it, she quickly fell back into her gluttonous stupor. The cake disappeared quickly, greedily devoured by the seemingly insatiable Beth. Plate upon plate of cakes, muffins, pies, eclairs, pastries and more followed it into her black hole of a stomach, where they were almost immediately digested, adding more and more flab to Beth's hefty body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as her body swelled, Beth thought nothing of this. The only thought that occupied her mind was how heavenly everything tasted. Even stuff she despised, such as jam filled doughnuts and cold pizza, ended up tasting utterly irresistible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamming a slice of cold pizza that was laden down with various meats into her mouth, Beth reached out blindly. Finding a bottle of something, she wasted no time in chugging the contents of the bottle, letting out a long belch as she dropped the empty container to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... delicious...\" Beth moaned through bites of a thick banoffee pie. \"Need... even... more!\"<br>\r\nWith the amount of food she was now shovelling into her mouth, Beth's body was growing at a consistent rate. Still on her hands and knees, her belly pressed heavily against the floor, while her nipples were just barely brushing against it. Each one of her basketball sized ass cheeks wobbled and bounced as she reached for more food, the occasional blast of air erupting from between her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving the last piece of pizza into her mouth, Beth hungrily licked her greasy fingers clean before pausing to gulp down the contents of a nearby milk bottle. Letting out another belch, she shuffled her hefty body forwards, drawing closer to the promise of yet more heavenly treats...</span></div></div>",

Her heavy, food laden gut dragged on the floor as she placed her hands inside the fridge itself, then pulled herself <i>inside</i>. The entire front half of her body pushed into the door frame. She barely fit into the gap, her newly fattened body squeezing up against the shelves that now surrounded her flabby form. Had she not been so focused on stuffing her face, she might have noticed the fridge gradually shifting it's dimensions; widening to accommodate it's patron's bulk. Ahead, the back end of the fridge seemed to change even more, lengthening to a full on corridor as it's dimensions warped magically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...so good...more...\" Beth grunted as she dragged her huge rump in behind her and shifted her entire body inside the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, the door gently closed, swinging shut and gently bumping against her exposed ass cheeks, which jiggled ponderously in response. The fridge light, strangely, stayed on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth was dimly aware of something hitting her ass, but she just shrugged it off and kept eating, crawling further and further inside the newly expanded area as the fridge morphed itself into almost an entire corridor of shelves and containers full of food. Beth grabbed at items from each side, rising with a grunt and plopping herself back down on her heavily cushioned behind as she continued to gorge herself. Her thick arms were starting to work more slowly, and she found herself grunting and groaning as she raced to keep herself full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heavy belly bulged and bloated, forming extra rolls of flab as she unknowingly expanded. The rolls stayed only for a moment before they pushed out, leaving her stomach a perfectly round, smooth ball of fat. Her massive breasts continued to swell, growing more round and bulbous, but never once sagging down. Her entire body maintained an impressively round shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRP!\" Beth stopped only to clear more room, before plunging her face into a large pumpkin pie.</span></div></div>",

Her belly and breasts dragged along the chilly floor, causing Beth to groan slightly with pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she inched her way further down the magical corridor, her hands continued to shoot out, snatching treats that only seemed to be growing in size, taste and fat content and shovelling them into her ravenous maw. She paused briefly and grunted happily as she came actually across a huge chocolate eclair that seemed to be almost a footlong. Lifting it, Beth quickly munched through it, moaning happily as the taste of thick cream, rich chocolate and fluffy pastry filled her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it was gone, she scooted forwards again, reaching out and grabbing a strawberry topped cheesecake that could've served a family of four. However, with her seemingly endless hunger, it didn't last long in Beth's hands, the only traces of it ever existing being the stems of the strawberries that Beth had spat out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she continued in this fashion for a while, slowly making her way deeper into the never-ending fridge. Her body continued to swell with every treat she consumed, becoming heavier, wider and rounder. On her thick hands and chubby knees, her globular belly and orb-like breasts took up the entirely of the space beneath her, pressing more and more into the chilled floor. Her round ass wobbled, rippled and jiggled as she pulled herself along, as did the three chins adorning her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Need... even... more...\" Beth grunted after devouring a plate stacked high with plate-like cookies. \"So... good!\"</span></div></div>",

Shuffling forwards, the ravenous girl's eyes lit up as they fell upon the biggest food item she had seen thus far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a massive cake, made up of four different layers. The bottom looked to be chocolate, and was covered with a thick layer of chocolate sauce. Above it was a pale, yet fluffy, looking later with a thin red line dividing it. Atop it sat a tanned layer of cake that looked to be coffee and, finishing off the massive cake that towered over the crawling girl, was a thick layer that was a deep red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth stared at the mountainous cake before her belly roared hungrily, urging her forwards. Wasting no time, she crawled to the base and took a large bite out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer taste buds exploded with flavour. The chocolate was rich and heavenly, making her crave more and more. Leaning back in, Beth began to munch through the lower layer, ignoring the odd sounding gurgles her belly was now emitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely oblivious to anything but the cake, Beth failed to notice her round body begin to change colour. Her pale skin gradually darkened until it was a creamy gold, almost indistinguishable from the colour of the cake she was currently devouring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quarter of the bottom later had disappeared into her hungry maw, Beth pushed her body back so she was resting on her knees. Reaching out, she stuffed the second layer, a light sponge cake, into her body, moaning as the fruity jam brushed over her taste buds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs said jam flowed down her throat, Beth's flabby breasts began to fill with something other than fat. They pushed out and sagged downwards as the new filling caused them to increase in weight. As she shovelled a handful of cake into her mouth, a thick red liquid spurted out from her nipples before beginning to leak down her hefty breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill oblivious to these changes, Beth began on the third layer. The taste of coffee filled her mouth as two handfuls were rammed into her open mouth. As she chewed, her skin softened until it had the consistency of the cake she was eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving past the coffee cake, which hadn't been her favourite, Beth practically rammed her head into the final layer of red velvet. The cake collapsed beneath her, falling atop her body and coating it in crumbs, sauce and jam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as her skin softened even further until it could be ripped away from her, Beth remained blissfully oblivious. Her heavy golden body, which was now made from soft sponge, was buried beneath the fallen cake...</span></div></div>",

Eventually, the silence was broken by Beth, which began to snicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You actually think I'm a cake...\" She giggled. \"Man, you must be really hungry!\"<br>\r\nCarrie's eyes went wide. <br>\r\n \"I am not!\" She protested, an arm reaching out to grab yet another pastry. \"Here! Look at yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into her pocket, Carrie produced her phone. Turning on the camera, she took a step back and began lining up a decent shot. As she looked through the camera, she began noticing small details about Beth's body, such as the vivid red jam leading from her breasts and how soft and moist she appeared to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust take the picture!<br>\r\nTaking a few pictures, Carrie marched back to Beth and pulled them up. Beth stared at the screen, clearly unimpressed by them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What am I meant to be looking at?\" She inquired, looking up at Carrie. <br>\r\n \"Y-You don't see it?!\" Carrie asked in utter disbelief. \"Y-Your breasts are leaking jam! Your skin is made from sponge! Hell, even your hair looks weird! It's like... malleable icing or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth shrugged, or tried to. Her shoulders twitched slightly, followed by her arms. <br>\r\n \"I look like me!\" Beth argued. \"If I look like a cake to you, then you must be both starving and high on something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie stamped her foot, almost dropping her newest pastry. <br>\r\n \"How can you... Are you really that... Is it even possible...\"<br>\r\nShe stammered for a moment, trying to figure out a way to get her point across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Carrie, just look at the picture!\" Beth told her. \"I look fine!\"<br>\r\nLooking down at the picture, Carrie's stomach let out a grumble. Staring at the obvious cake-girl, she found her mouth watering. That sponge looked so good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout meaning, Carrie's arms shot out towards Beth. Gripping her friend by one of her hefty arms, she ripped away a chunk of Beth's arm and began to nibble on it. It tasted exactly as she imagined. Light, fluffy, moist and with a slight fruity twist...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Beth showed no reaction to this. Rather, a moan escaped her mouth. <br>\r\n \"W-What did you just do...\" She asked curiously, her breathing slightly heavier. \"Carrie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie didn't answer. She turned to face Beth, her mouth coated in crumbs. Reaching out, she grabbed another chunk from Beth's arm. And then another. And then another. Utterly addicted to her friend's delicious body, Carrie fell to her knees in front of the arm she was eating, practically ramming her head into the spongy appendage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth, in the other hand, was grunting happily as her body was slowly devoured. The sensation of her flesh being ripped away felt so indescribably pleasuring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the speed she was eating at, it didn't take Carrie long to devour Beth's entire upper arm. Her disconnected wrist and hand went crashing to the ground, where they were quickly savaged by the hungry Carrie. Turning back to Beth, who was panting heavily, Carrie began to inch forwards...</span></div></div>",

She stared in horror at the large bite mark in the middle of Beth's spongy arm and felt like she was about to throw up. \"Oh my God, oh my God! I ate your arm! What the fuck am I doing?!\" She was just about to freak out even more as the consequences of her gluttonous act began to dawn on her, but then her attention was drawn back to the chunk missing from Beth, which seemed to be slowly expanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, the bite mark Carrie had left in Beth's arm began to close up. Her spongy body plugged the gap, gradually refilling with more delicious cake and healing Beth up good as new. Beth moaned as her body plugged the gap, apparently enjoying the sensation. Carrie gawked at the miraculous regeneration, relieved that she hadn't actually eaten half of one of her friend's limbs, but the sudden relief was replaced by a reawakened appetite as she she realised she could keep eating without feeling guilty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie reached up and grabbed another chunk of cake from Beth's arm, ripping it off greedily as she worked her way down, eventually consuming her entire hand, finger by finger. Carrie stopped for a moment and watched happily as Beth's entire arm regrew. She was about to start eating again when Beth suddenly moved her arms to grasp her huge breasts. Carrie looked up to see Beth's moaning as her spongy nipples began to leak jam all down her delicious, soft tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitedly, she moved to Beth's jam filled tits and began to suck, groaning pleasurably as the delicious jam filled her mouth. Muffled sucking noises came from Carrie's mouth as she continued to gorge herself, plunging her face into Beth's soft, moist breasts. As she guzzled all the jam she could, her bloated stomach bulged out even further, causing the buttons on her shirt to stretch apart, revealing her soft, fleshy belly between the newly formed gaps. The buttons just about hung on as Carrie continued to glut herself on her friend's cake-body...</span></div></div>",

She was eating Beth. Eating her friend. But she couldn't stop. She had never tasted anything so delicious in her entire life. Besides, it wasn't like she was doing any harm. Beth was regenerating her soft, spongy body as fast as Carrie could swallow it down. Carrie briefly wondered what had caused this transformation in the first place, but before she could question this insane situation any further, she found her mouth filling with more jam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooming above her, Beth moaned softly, not really able to see what was happening beyond her massive breasts. She barely felt the huge chunks being taken out of her belly before they healed over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More...\" Carrie grunted from below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping her mouth of crumbs, Carrie plunged her face into Beth's soft stomach and started chewing. She was taking such huge bites that she began to create a whole in Beth's stomach the size of her head. It quickly regenerated once again, and Carrie was surprised to find her mouth being stuffed full of sponge. She might have choked were it not for her ravenous appetite, and she demolished the entire mouthful within seconds. She gave a muffled moan as she started again. \"Ugh...so good...\" she murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lost herself in Beth's carb-filled gut, Carrie's stomach was bloating considerably. The vast amount of cake she was consuming was causing her belly to grow at an alarming rate. Her shirt buttons began to stretch apart as her chubby belly inflated like a balloon. As she took a mouthful of jam, the bottom two buttons popped open, followed by the next three, until her entire shirt split apart and hung open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie just about noticed the cool breeze that suddenly fell onto her stomach. She clutched at her stomach idly, feeling her fingers brush against her tight, swollen tummy, then went back to feasting again. Her skirt split down the seams, ripping away from her body as her plump behind expanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClad only in her very tight bra and panties, Carrie finally pulled herself away and stopped to take a breath. She was so stuffed and bloated that she lost her balance and fell onto her back, weighed down by her heavy, food filled gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\" Carrie let out a huge belch as she writhed around on her back, hands massaging her huge belly. </span></div></div>",

With a long groan, Beth dug her fingers into her belly, ripping a handful out. The feeling of having her body taken apart caused her shiver, raining down yet more crumbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her hand to her mouth, Beth stuffed her belly piece into her mouth, moaning as she tasted how delicious she actually was. <br>\r\n \"You... You weren't lying...\" She stammered, staring at her hand. \"I taste... delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffing her hand into her mouth, Beth began to devour her own arm, pausing every so often to let out a delighted groan. However, as her arm disappeared and then regenerated, Beth didn't start growing like Carrie had. Rather, her spongy body began to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth's skin, which was like the rest of her body and was made of soft golden sponge, began to glisten in the dim light of the fridge. Starting at her shoulders, an ivory layer of icing began to spread down her arms, quickly covering them in a layer of sugary goodness. A similar layer of icing topped her round gut, which began to gurgle ominously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it did, the soft interior of her belly was sucked away, adding its mass to the rest of her body and leaving her belly hollow. With each jam-filled breast approaching near double the size of her head and her ass not far behind, a thick white substance began to fill her belly, quickly filling all available space and tightening her spongy gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, her hair, which had remained largely unchanged up until now, began to knot together, forming long blonde strands of sugar that draped down to her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a breath from devouring her arm, Beth sighed deeply.

It was so indescribably delicious that it caused her to stop groaning and sit up. It took some effort, and she grunted from the strain her heavy belly put on her back, but she finally managed to began drawing herself back to her feet. Her underwear barely stretching to cover her enlarged breasts and ass; Carrie stood up and started waddling back towards Beth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smells...so...good...\" Carrie said, entering an almost trance-like state as she headed for Beth's sweet smelling body. \"But...getting...so...fat...\" Her hands rubbed her round, distended stomach absent mindedly. \"Gotta...stop eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut any thoughts of resisting vanished from Carrie's head as she found herself kneeling beside Beth's enormous body. Beth seemed to have grown a few inches taller with all her added mass, and she now towered over Carrie even more than she had before. Carrie barely had time to consider this before she plunged her face into Beth's stomach, mouth wide open. Immediately, her mouth was filled with thick, sweet cream, which gushed forth into her mouth like a jet powered hose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie tried to gulp the cream down as fast as she could, but it was gushing too fast for her to keep up. Her cheeks bulged as it continued flowing inside her body. Carrie flailed her arms uselessly, knowing she might choke, but finding herself unable to pull away. It tasted so good, she just couldn't stop. She continued swallowing it down as best she could, cream spurting out around her mouth and falling down her chin as she tried desperately to devour every drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Carrie been paying attention to anything other than the flow of cream, she might have noticed her body swelling even more rapidly. Her plump, soft body expanded slowly but surely, growing rounder and rounder with each mouthful she swallowed. Her breasts inflated like balloons, pushing her fat nipples through the fabric of her bra, before bursting through entirely. Her ass cheeks swelled to the size of beach balls, shredding her panties entirely as she sat back on her massive behind and continued guzzling from Beth's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's belly bloated even more rapidly, acquiring a perfectly round, taught appearance. Her stomach bulged forward, pressing into Beth's tight gut. Carrie just about managed to pull herself away to catch her breath, breathing heavily as cream dripped from the open hole in Beth's stomach, before quickly sealing itself back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie moaned noisily, taking a long, deep, breath as she pulled away. Her hands travelled to her fat, bulbous gut and she groaned again as she realised how much bigger she had grown. Up above her, Beth smiled down, enjoying the display of the greedy, naked Carrie sitting beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooo Carrie...you're so big now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie could only moan as she looked down at herself, holding her heavy belly in both hands as if to make sure it was real...</span></div></div>",

After another few seconds, they fell to the floor beside her as her eyes closed and her breathing slowed, signalling to Beth that she had fallen asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling down at her slumbering friend, Beth was tempted to join her in sleep. However, an unusual feeling, one that felt familiar to her, prevented her from doing so. Staring down at her soft golden body, she hummed in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't put my finger on it... Like, it's something I should know, but I don't? Or maybe I've forgotten it? It's so weird...</i><br>\r\nLooking over at Carrie again, whose body had slumped forwards and was now resting entirely on her gut, a sudden wave of realisation hit her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait... I feel really light! That's it!</i><br>\r\nSnapping her fingers, which caused her tips to break off, Beth looked down at her body. Sure, she still felt quite heavy, but nowhere near as much as before. Taking a deep breath, Beth unsteadily got to her feet. As she did, crumbs rained down from her body, scattering across the floor beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on her own two feet, Beth grinned. <br>\r\n<i>I can walk again! Thanks, Carrie!</i><br>\r\nWith mobility returned to her, Beth considered waking Carrie and helping her out of the fridge. However, something seemed to be calling her from deeper within...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer curiosity getting the better of her, Beth slowly started walking further into the fridge. Her stride was slow and unsteady, mainly due to her legs which, being made entirely out of sponge, weren't suited to supporting her heavy upper body.

How long she had been out, she couldn't say, but when she opened her eyes, there was no sign of Beth's gigantic body looming over her, and the only sound she could hear was the soft humming of the fridge. Carrie brought her hand up to his face and rubbed her eyes. Only when she tried to sit up did she remember what she had been doing before she passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...oh shit...\" Carrie lifted her head and stared down at her body as she struggled, seeing three huge spheres of flesh sticking out. Panicking, she scrambled to get to her feet, but she was unaccustomed to her new weight, and just jiggled her body uselessly for a while before rolling onto her side. Her huge, round gut hit the floor, and she propped herself up with a thick arm, pushing herself upwards as much as she could. Her huge tits fell to the side, knocking together. \"I'm so fat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie managed to prop herself up long enough to get her back straight, and sat up straight in one difficult motion. Spreading her thick, meaty thighs, she allowed her enormous belly to drop between them and hit the floor. Her hands massaged the sides of her huge, soft gut. She couldn't believe how big she had grown. How big she had let herself get. She was massive. Carrie had always enjoyed flirting with being a bit of a Feedee, but she had never imagined she would get this big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So fat...\" She repeated, groping her soft, plushy stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you are, piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie froze at the unfamiliar voice, then looked up to see someone walking towards her out of the darkness ahead. The figure was wearing a skimpy, two piece bikini and knee high boots, all of which appeared to be made of leather. As Carrie lifted her chubby, double chinned face upwards, she saw that this new arrival also possessed what appeared to be a pair of Bat-like wings on her back, and a very pretty, but slightly menacing, looking face. Long, red hair flowed down her back, almost to her waist, as she stepped into view and looked down at Carrie's naked form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie gawked for a second before covering herself up as best she could. She still couldn't really stand without help, and didn't want to try in front of this new girl. \"Wh-what?\" Was all she managed to ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winged girl rolled her eyes. \"Silly little pig, did you eat too much?\" The girl asked with a sultry smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I....\" Carrie stammered, not really sure what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a glutton,\" the girl smiled. \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrie,\" Carrie blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Serena, and it would appear you have stumbled onto the gateway to my realm,\" the girl said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gateway?\" Carrie asked, confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can take many forms depending on the sins of whoever enters, but it would appear you and your friend were easy targets for gluttony,\" Serena said. \"You fattened up nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be fat!\" Carrie moaned. \"Please change me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena laughed. \"Is that what you want?\" She waved her hand, and Carrie was suddenly lifted up off her colossal behind and placed on her feet. Her stomach hung down, covering her more private areas, but she kept her chubby hands clasped over her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little choice, Carrie followed...</span></div></div>",

The first was the movement of her own body, which bounced and rippled with each heavy step she took. One of her meaty hands remained over one of her massive tits, her sausage-like fingers digging into her soft flesh, while the other slowly floated down to her wobbling belly, which slapped lightly against her thick thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the other was Serena's body. Carrie had never been attracted to women in her life, but watching Serena was making her reconsider that. The way her perfect backside swayed from side to side, the subtle curve of her breasts which were round enough that their sides could be seen from behind her, her vibrant red hair which bounced and swayed in the dim light...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admiring the view back there, piggy?\"<br>\r\nCarrie managed to tear her eyes away from Serena's hypnotic movements. She stared at her face, which wore a sultry smirk. <br>\r\n\"Well, I... Uh... Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena giggled and came to a halt. Spinning on the heel of her boot, she faced Carrie with a smile. <br>\r\n\"Aw, somebody got your tongue? That's not a problem. After all, I see what's in your heart, no words needed! And your heart... Oh, my! Filled with all sorts of... wants and desires! I don't even know where to begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena strutted close to Carrie and began to circle her. Under her intense yet flirtatious gaze, Carrie couldn't help but shuffle nervously. <br>\r\n\"Perhaps... Or maybe something else?\"<br>\r\nSerena mumbled to herself as she stopped in front of Carrie. Reaching out, she cupped one of her enormous tits, inciting a quiet moan from the huge girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, I see... That's what you truly want...\"<br>\r\nGiggling, Serena looked up at Carrie, a mischievous glint in her eyes. <br>\r\n\"Then who would I be to deny that from you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicking her fingers, Serena peered over Carrie's shoulder. Turning to see what she was so interested in, Carrie's eyes went wide as she saw a massive pile of baked goods staring at her. All sorts of pies, muffins and pastries, steam still curling off all of them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"All for you, my prized pig...\"<br>\r\nSerena's sultry whisper emptied Carrie's head. The flabby woman unsteadily made her way to the massive pile and collapsed into her fat behind, thick legs spread to allow her belly to sit between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out, Carrie wasted no time in stuffing everything within arms reach into her ravenous maw. Creamy eclairs and jammy doughnuts quickly vanished in a single bite, their fillings squirting out and covering her flabby body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carrie mindlessly stuffed herself, her body began to expand again. Her flab began to steadily inch across the floor, not that Carrie cared much. Her belly began to envelop her ever thickening thighs, while her heavy breasts filled with even more fat, slowly sliding across the top of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her, Serena kneeled down and watched as Carrie continued to ram food into her mouth. <br>\r\n \"That's it, little piggy...\" She cooed, stroking Carrie's hair. \"The more you eat, the more power I get. And the more power I get, the more control over you I gain... Now, I wonder where that friend of yours is? Compared to you, she's almost mine...\"</span></div></div>",

With a final stroke of Carrie's hair, she spun on her heel and found herself racing what appeared to be a cake with humanoid features. Flabby breasts leaking fruit-filled jam, a rotund belly with cream dripping from her belly button...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Perfect...\"<br>\r\nSerena licked her lips. Not because she was hungry, but because she was really looking forward to what happened next. Hand on hip, she strutted towards the Cake-Girl, who seemed somewhat confused by the appearance of the demonic woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who are you?\" She asked curiously, a spongy hand hovering around her face. <br>\r\n \"Me? I'm Serena. But I'm not the important one here,\" Serena answered, her eyes firmly fixed on the girl's heavy body. \"Who might you be, my delectable girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um, Beth? Is Carrie alright?\"<br>\r\nLooking over her shoulder at Carrie, who was still happily stuffing herself and growing bigger as she did so, Serena nodded. <br>\r\n \"Perfectly fine. You, however...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena fell silent as she circled the spongy girl, who now wore a worried expression. <br>\r\n \"You are so very close...\" She whispered in Beth's ear, causing her to flinch and sending crumbs raining from her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Close to what?\" Beth asked, her voice wavering slightly. <br>\r\nReturning to her front, Serena grinned. <br>\r\n \"To becoming mine, of course!\" She answered gleefully. \"Now, hold very still!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yours?\"<br>\r\nBeth barely had time to whimper before falling to her knees, which cracked beneath the weight they were now supporting. Her head began to ache slightly, with the pain intensifying whenever she didn't look at Serena. Forced to stare into her eyes, Beth let out another weak whimper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's it... Stare directly into my eyes...\"<br>\r\nStriding closer to Beth, Serena kneeled down in front of her. She gently cupped her chin, a smile on her face. <br>\r\n \"You won't feel a thing as you slowly become part of my domain, I assure you. Now, just relax...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth's worry began to slowly subside as she listened to Serena's calming voice.

Her massive, spongy body swayed from side to side as she froze in place. Serena lifted her hand and placed it on Beth's massive gut, smiling eagerly as a glow engulfed the cake-girl's globular frame, dissipating just a moment later. Beth groaned as her eyes slowly opened up, and a strange, tingling sensation went through her entire body, making her feel oddly cold. She moaned as her body seemed to grow darker and more moist, getting wetter and softer as though she was sweating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what's wrong with me...\" Beth asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're about to change, sweetie,\" Serena said, taking a step back to marvel at her handiwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth moaned again as the strange tingling overcame her senses. There was a rumbling inside her bulbous belly as the cream inside her body began to seep out of her sponge-skin, leaking from her pores and pushing it's way out. It began spurting out of her sides, causing her stomach to deflate like a popped balloon. Her breasts, once filled with Jam, now oozed cream as well, and it even dripped from the corners of Beth's mouth. She groaned as the strange, creamy overload engulfed her entire body, causing her sponge to break apart and fall to the floor. Cream gushed out from all directions, as though Beth was springing leaks all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my body...\" Beth gasped. For the first time, she seemed to realise she had changed, but the moment of realisation was lost all too quickly as her head sank into a think layer of cream and her entire body collapsed into a large puddle on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any moment now...\" Serena muttered, gazing down at the pool of cream on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the cream began to reform into a human shape. It joined together and began growing upwards, forming itself into the features of a slender, beautiful young woman. Beth had regained her true, slender appearance in her new form, and though her features were now entirely made of liquid, she seemed pleased with her changed body. She looked down at her rippling, flowing skin and milky white colour and then turned her head to face Serena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creamy,\" Serena smiled, licking her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them, Carrie had just about managed to stop eating mid hot-dog to see what had just happened. The transformation had freaked her out so much that she just gawked at Beth, horrified. Still on her knees, her bloated belly now touched the floor, perfectly round and stuffed full of food. Beth looked back at her, looking equally surprised by how fat her friend had become...</span></div></div>",

Taking a tentative step towards her friend, she felt her new leg ripple slightly. Thankfully, it held, aside from a small sliver that dropped off her knee, so she rushed to Carrie's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I-I-I... don't know!\" Carrie wailed, dropping her half eaten hotdog. \"I just feel so hungry all the time! Like, even now I feel absolutely starving!\"<br>\r\n \"It'll be alright...\" Beth tried to console her friend, placing a creamy hand gently on Carrie's shoulder. Carrie shivered noticeably at her touch, sending her body into a brief wave of jiggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How do you know that?\" She asked quietly, staring down into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth didn't answer. She didn't know that. She couldn't even think of a lie to make it sound like she knew that. Hell, she didn't even think everything was okay! She had lost her body and was now made entirely of cream, Carrie had put on Serena knows how much weight and, if Serena was to be believed, both of them might now be lost just like Stacey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair sat in silence for a minute. However, the silence was broken by the clack of heels on the floor as Serena joined the pair, a grin spread across her beautiful face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I've got an idea, piggy...\" She whispered in Carrie's ear, who responded by lifting her head slightly. \"Whenever I feel down, I always listen to what I want, cause I know best! Maybe it's the same for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What I want...\" Carrie repeated, her voice barely a mumble. <br>\r\n \"Yeah! And what do you want to do right now?\"<br>\r\n Carrie's belly answered that question for her by letting out an almighty rumble. Serena grinned, drumming her fingers lightly on the surface of Carrie's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think you've got your answer to that...\"<br>\r\nSlowly, Carrie turned her head to look at the milky white hand on her shoulder. Beth followed her gaze, unsure of what Serena had just told her, however from the far-off look of hunger in Carrie's eyes, she quickly worked it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Carrie, don't do it!\" She warned, but she was too slow. Carrie leaned her head over and, using only her tongue, lifted Beth's hand into her mouth. The pair let out simultaneous moans, Carrie at the sheer deliciousness of Beth's creamy hand and Beth at the oddly pleasurable sensation of having her hand sucked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no resistance offered by Beth, Carrie wasted no time in sucking more and more of her into her body. Her fat-laden arms reached up, digging into Beth's body and pulling out handfuls of thick cream which were then stuffed into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning as the pair fell deeper and deeper into their own pleasures, Serena stepped back. She could feel her power.growing with each moan that escaped their mouths. Soon, she would have another two subjects to play with...</span></div></div>",

While Carrie had already slurped her way through Beth's entire arm, the cream kept flowing, regrowing Beth's arm as fast as Carrie could guzzle it down. Beth moaned pleasurably as as she felt Carrie's tongue lick at her body desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was already well past chubby; her body was over three hundred pounds already, with her weight mostly gathering in her huge, circular stomach and oversized breasts. As the cream kept flowing, she only expanded quicker. It was as though someone was inflating her like a balloon. Her sizeable gut bulged ominously, rounding out even more as it bloated and gurgled noisily, hanging lower and lower as it became dangerously full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it you butterball, drink it all down...\" Serena muttered to herself, grinning as she watched Carrie's greed grow by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cream seemed to be having an increasingly expansive effect on Carrie's breasts, which were now growing bigger and fuller. They were easily twice the size of her head now, resting comfortably atop her huge gut. Her fat nipples hardened as she became more and more aroused by what was happening to her figure. Beneath her bulging tits, her oversized belly was growing heavier and heavier as massive amounts of cream pumped into her body, becoming so large that it was was almost touching the floor. Behind her, Carrie's ass widened even more, her giant butt cheeks spreading out to match the girth of her enormous tummy. Her cheeks bulged with cream, a large double chin forming as her face grew softer and chubbier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena was practically drooling as she watched Carrie's gluttony go into overdrive. \"Oh my...look at you...you're enormous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was dimly aware of what Serena had just said, but she kept going, unable to pull herself away. It was so easy to just keep drinking. Her now immensely swollen belly jutted out in front of her, perfectly circular in shape. Finally, it had grown so large and full that it hung down and touched the floor. Carrie's arms and legs had thickened so much that she was was starting to look like a large ball, her body so wide and round and fat that she was beginning to have difficulty moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie finally got a rude awakening when the size of her stomach prevented her from getting any closer to Beth. The flow of cream stopped abruptly, and Carrie's confused eyes scanned the room, then her own gigantic body...</span></div></div>",

You did all this to yourself,\" Serena said innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie looked down at her body in horror. She was absolutely gigantic! Her massive breasts obscured most of her view now, pushing up just under her double chin. Considering how much weight she had put on, they were surprisingly round and firm, and stuck out in front of her rather than sagging down. She could just about her stomach jutting out beneath her immense breasts; a third sphere centred between her mammoth tits that bulged even further out. She took a clumsy, slow step forward and felt her heavy, full belly drag against the floor. Carrie let out a pained moan as the consequences of her gluttony hit her. She was <i>huge</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want some more?\" Serena asked, gesturing to Beth's creamy form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" Carrie stammered, her belly gurgling ominously as she waddled from one foot to the other, unused to all this extra chub. \"Look at me! I'm a blimp!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butterball would be my term, actually,\" Serena shrugged. \"But I guess Blimp works too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie groaned. \"Please, please change me back! I don't want to be like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, little piggy, you can stay like this, for now at least,\" Serena chuckled. \"You're not done growing yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's eyes filled with horror at that statement. How much bigger could she possibly get?! She was already pushing what must have been five hundred pounds. Her body was almost entirely spherical, and her arms and legs were tired and stiff. \"Please, no moooooooore...\" she moaned, sobbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the more you beg, the bigger I want you, right?\" Serena smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But whyyyyyy?\" Carrie moaned, cupping her huge breasts in her hands to stop them from jiggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this was your secret kink!\" Serena said. \"You always loved eating and stuffing yourself and pushing out that little pot belly you were growing. I just pushed you along and let you have your ultimate fantasy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't want this much!\" Carrie said, shaking her wide stomach from side to side for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, be careful what you wish for, I guess,\" Serena shrugged. She strode past Carrie and turned her attention back to Beth, examining her handiwork carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Serena's back turned, Carrie knew she had a chance. She wasn't sure what to do with herself now, but she knew she couldn't stay here with that Psychopath and risk getting any bigger. A few more pounds and she might not even be able to move of her own volition. Moving as fast as she could, Carrie took a few hurried steps forward, her body moving so slowly that she felt like she was going in slow motion. She huffed and wheezed as she tried desperately to work her legs and pick up some speed, her massive body shaking and jiggling with each step her thick legs took. It took a few steps, but Carrie's body soon began to work; it was exhausting, but she grabbed hold of her belly and hefted it into the air to keep it still, then she attempted to run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a comically slow pace, but Carrie was soon on the move. Her enormous, fat body rushed back down the corridors, beads of sweat forming all over her skin as her massive frame struggled to move at anything other than a light jog. She looked around and saw that Serena and Beth had not followed her, and breathed a sigh of relief, propping herself up against the wall while panting furiously, wiping the sweat from her forehead...</span></div></div>",

She tried to just ignore the shelves this time around; she was much more aware of what had happened to her and the price of her gluttony, and knew she couldn't risk getting any bigger. But despite her best efforts, Carrie's hand grabbed a Hot Dog as she waddled towards the exit. She chewed through it as she walked, barely able to catch her breath between mouthfuls. <i>God, I'm such a pig. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing surprising restraint, she finally reached the end of the aisle and pushed open the fridge door, quickly slamming it shut behind her and resting her five hundred pound body against it while she panted furiously, her face bright red. <i>Gotta lose this weight, I can barely breathe...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving herself forward with a loud groan, Carrie walked on at a more relaxed pace. It felt very surreal just moving around at her new size; her stomach and breasts shook with every step. Her immensely thick thighs rubbed together, and her ass jiggled up and down. As she moved out of the Kitchen area, she caught sight of herself in a mirror and let out a moan of despair. It was the first time she had seen her reflection since her transformation, and she looked absolutely huge. Her breasts and belly stuck out at least two feet in front of her, being by far the largest parts of her body. Her ass jutted out behind her like a shelf, while her arms and legs were thick and flabby. She resembled a large ball. The only part of herself she recognised was her face, which, apart from a double chin, had stayed relatively the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to focus too long on herself, she turned and exited the kitchen with a sigh. She just hoped there was something here that could change her back. If she had been magically fattened, surely she could be magically slimmed down? Looking around the dark hallway, Carrie saw a faded sign on the wall and moved in for a closer look, the \"Y\" was missing at the end but she was pretty sure it said \"Library\". Intrigued, she followed the sign down another hallway before coming to a large set of red doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Carrie pushed the doors open and waddled inside, the sides of her bulging gut brushing the door frame. Closing the doors behind her, she turned and looked around at the vast, cavernous Library before her. Shelves upon shelves of old, dusty books lined the room, and seemed to stretch on for miles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this place is huge,\" Carrie said, shifting her weight from one foot to the other as she gazed along a row of books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" came a voice from behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie screamed and backed away, pushing herself up against a shelf and nearly knocking it off with her oversized ass. She had half expected Serena or Beth, but instead, found herself face to face with a petite blonde girl wearing thick rimmed glasses. She was smiling broadly and looking up at Carrie, apparently unphased by her size and nudity. \"Uh...hey...\" Carrie said nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you? I'm Josie, the Librarian,\" the girl smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie covered her exposed breasts as best she could, grateful that her hanging belly shielded her other private areas. \"Uh...I'm Carrie, I was looking for something that might be able to change me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to what?\" The girl asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to my usual size,\" Carrie blushed. \"I'm not usually this big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooooooooooooh,\" Josie said, suddenly understanding. \"You were fattened up. Was it the fridge? The kitchen table? The farm? Lady Belview?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie couldn't keep up with the list. \"It was Serenna...and also yeah...the fridge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh she's a naughty one,\" Josie said. \"People really should stop eating things they find in this place. Well, maybe we can find something in one of the books that might help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Carrie asked, excitedly. \"You can change me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I'm kind of an amateur witch,\" Josie said proudly. \"I'm not an expert by any means, but there's plenty of spells in these books. There must be a weight loss incantation somewhere. Come on, we'll go find it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie moved off excitedly, beckoning Carrie to follow. Carrie waddled on beside the Librarian, hopeful they would find something to reverse her condition...</span></div></div>",

They completely towered over Carrie, stretching all the way up to the roof, at least  fifty foot high. Carrie waddled along, feeling more and more tired with each passing second. Her huge, soft body ached after her attempt at running earlier, and her legs felt like jelly. Making her feel even larger was the slender, petite girl walking in front of her. Josie looked around Carrie's age, but she was a little shorter. She was wearing a brown skirt and a white, button up shirt which made her look like a typical Librarian. She hummed absent mindedly as they walked, inspecting the occasional book and checking the spines to see what she could find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie wouldn't have imagined she would ever be in this situation; obese, naked and walking through a library in a haunted house looking for a magic spell, but after what she had been through today already, she was quite accepting of it all now. No use denying the facts, she supposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie suddenly stopped, causing Carrie's bulbous gut to bounce into her back and almost knock her over. \"Oops, sorry!\" Carrie apologised quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, don't worry,\" Josie said, readjusting her glasses. \"Here, I think I found it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie pulled a book off the shelf and showed Carrie the cover. There was a silhouetted drawing of a curvy looking woman with large hips and sizeable breasts. Carrie raised an eyebrow as Josie blew the dust off the front of the book and opened it up, moving her finger along the pages, searching for something. \"So, hopefully this will just be an incantation. I don't exactly have access to a lab right now to brew you anything up,\" Josie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay,\" Carrie said, not really sure how else to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll have you back to normal in no time!\" Josie said happily, finally pointing her finger to a page. \"Aha! Got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie grinned eagerly. \"Oh my God, you can do it? You can change me back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, definitely,\" Josie said. \"Well, I'm pretty sure. Not like I can make things worse, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's uh...not very reassuring,\" Carrie said awkwardly. \"So...how did you come to work here anyway? Does anyone pay you? You're not uh...a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghost?\" Josie laughed. \"Nope. I'm human. I came here for a history project last year but uh...some of the people here weren't exactly happy to have me poking around. I offered to work here by way of an apology and they let me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well I guess that was reasonable of them,\" Carrie said, not sure who the ominous \"they\" actually were. \"So you have a car or something here, right? You drive here...like...to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, actually, no,\" Josie said. \"I'm kind of stuck here. They won't let me leave until I work off my debt. I'm meant to be learning to help Lord Martin with his experiments, but mostly I just try and stay here out of the way. They like to torment me if I show my face too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound good,\" Carrie said. \"So you're a prisoner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like a live in servant, I guess,\" Josie shrugged. \"But hey, look at all the books I get to read! And I'm already picking up some sorcery, so I guess it's worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...I guess...\" Carrie said, wondering how this girl could stay so positive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think I've got the right spell, you ready?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I'll ever be,\" Carrie replied, exhaling slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Bloatus magnificus!\"</i> Josie said excitedly, barely waiting for Carrie's answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie had expected something more dramatic to happen after Josie read the words, but there was no magical energy blast, or flashing lights and glowing body parts. Nothing out of the ordinary seemed to take place at all, and for a moment, Carrie wasn't sure it had worked, and felt rather foolish for even entertaining this idea. But then, she felt a tingling in her stomach. Carrie looked down, hoping that this was the start of her weight loss, but instead of a shrinking belly, she was greeted by the sight of a growing one. Slowly but surely, her already vast gut was pushing out before her eyes, seeming to expand as quickly as it had done when she had devoured Beth's creamy essence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?! NO!\" Carrie screamed. \"Do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, no!\" Josie said, flicking through the book for answers. \"This isn't right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie moaned in horror as her body began growing once again. Her heavy, round belly expanded like it was being pumped full of air, pushing out winder and winder and rounder and rounder. She felt it drop down and hit the floor, pinning her in place as her hands and feet were gradually enveloped by her flabby arms and legs. She tried to lift herself up and move forward, but found her body was now so heavy that she could only move about an inch while her belly dragged along the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it stooooooooooooooooop!\" Carrie sobbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie was freaking out, flicking through the pages of the book as she tried to find something to stop the transformation. She cast a glance up at Carrie and saw the morbidly obese girl's hands drop from her gigantic breasts and drop to her sides as she continued to swell up. Carrie's body was now pushing well into six hundred pounds and counting; her stomach was ballooning at an alarming rate, while her belly double up upon itself, becoming softer and flabbier as it continued to bloat. She flailed around uselessly, trying to regain control of her body, but it was no use. Her vast, ball like form was taking up the entire aisle now, pushing up against the stacks of books on either side of her, wedging her in place. Carrie's face grew more chubby, her cheek bulging as her double chin expanded out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, oh nooooooooooo,\" Josie cried, looking up at the vastly swollen Carrie in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can't...mooooooove...\" Carrie moaned, her massively fat body trapped in place. She finally collapsed onto her own ass, which now acted as a seat for the rest of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the process seemed to have ended, but Carrie wasn't going anywhere. Her whole body was wedged between two book shelves, which creaked slightly as she breathed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...did not expect that,\" Josie said. \"I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-help...\" Carrie groaned, her voice sounding much deeper than before. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josie was panicking, frantically flipping the pages of the old book looking for something that might be able to undo the transformation she had unknowingly caused with that last spell. Carrie, now rendered immobile by her own colossal size and the fact that she was wedged between two aisles of books, just looked on helplessly. Josie finally found something, represented by a two pictures of women; one quite obese, and then another, right next to it, quite slender. This must have been the right one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think I have it this time,\" Josie said excitedly. \"Stay calm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am calm,\" Carrie said through her swollen cheeks, sounding anything but. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Tralatio!\"</i> Josie called, reading the words from the page. She looked back up at Carrie anxiously, hoping to see some sign that the huge girl was slimming back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel any different?\" Josie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...maybe a little...\" Carrie groaned, shifting her weight as best she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>URRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!</i>\" Josie suddenly let loose a huge, gassy belch. She clasped her hands over her mouth in surprise as Carrie looked at her, startled by the sudden expulsion of gas from the petite girl's mouth. \"Ugh...excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Carrie could dwell on that any further, she felt a strange, cool feeling in her massive gut and let out a groan. Praying this wasn't going to lead to her fattening up to an even more obscene size, she looked down at her belly and was surprised to see it deflate slightly. \"Oh thank God. I think it's working!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I did it!\" Josie clapped her hands together happily. \"I knew I could <i>URRRRRRRRRRRP!</i>\" Josie blushed as she let loose another burst of gas. She looked back at Carrie, and saw the fat girl looking at her strangely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Josie...I think you might want to look down...\" Carrie said awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie looked down at Carrie, but then realised that wasn't what she had meant. Carrie wanted her to look down at her own body, and Josie was suddenly greeted by the sight of her stomach slowly bloating beneath her shirt. Josie gasped as her svelte, flat stomach was inflating rapidly, pulling the buttons apart and creating gaps from which creamy, pale flesh was oozing. Josie squealed in shock, dropping the book to the floor with a thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Carrie's stomach was still deflating, transferring the added pounds from her most recent growth spurt straight to Josie. The slender Librarian was quickly turning chubby, as her stomach bulged into a full blown pot belly, pulling apart her shirt buttons so much they looked ready to explode. Her skirt tightened around her thighs as they thickened and squeezed together, ripping her skirt along the sides. The top two buttons of her shirt suddenly flew off, pinging off around the aisle as Josie gasped. Her breasts swelled to fill the newly created gap, creating an impressive canyon of cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie, meanwhile, was finally coming unstuck from the bookshelves either side of her vast tummy. She wriggled herself free and took an ungainly step forward, able to move again under her own weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...I think it stopped,\" Josie said, looking down at her newly chubby figure. \"I think I might have gained a few pounds though...\" She looked down at herself, taking in her expanded form as she waddled back in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, that sort of worked,\" Carrie said. \"At least I'm not stuck anymore, and I lost a few pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, except now we're both fat,\" Josie sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I'm fat, you're just chubby,\" Carrie said, trying to sound reassuring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie hefted her new belly and gave it a jiggle. \"Maybe we should try something else?\"</span></div></div>",

She clutched at her new pot belly uncertainly and let out an involuntary groan. \"Urghhh...why do I suddenly feel so hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie looked down at Josie's bulging stomach, wondering if her remaining shirt buttons might pop off as the newly chubbified librarian rubbed her growling gut. \"I guess maybe there's more of you to fill now,\" Carrie said. While Josie might have a very empty stomach currently, Carrie was still stuffed from all that cream she had ingested earlier. While her feelings of fullness had subsided during her temporary growth spurt a few moments ago, they had quickly returned as soon as she slimmed down. It seemed that the bigger your belly was, the more you needed to eat to keep it going, and Josie's sudden expansion had apparently left her starving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghhhhh...\" Josie continued to moan as her stomach churned and gurgled. \"I'm so empty...I haven't eaten for hours...urgh...I need to eat something fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was about to suggest the fridge, but suddenly remembered what had started this whole ordeal and gave a shudder. \"Is there any normal food in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, as long as I don't eat too much, the dining room usually has some stuff lying around,\" Josie winced, her stomach roaring. \"They always leave it stacked for Lady Aurelia, not that she can taste any of it at the moment, but I guess it's tradition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady who-now?\" Carrie raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind, I think I'm gonna grab a plate or something,\" Josie said, waddling forward slowly, not used to her added weight. \"You want me to grab you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Carrie had to take a moment to think. Her hands travelled down to her fat, globular belly as she considered the question. Did she want anything? Could she actually eat anything else? She thought back to all that delicious food in the fridge and found herself licking her lips at the idea of more cake, pastries and...weirdly...cream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh...sorry...no, I think I'll be okay,\" Carrie said, snapping herself out of her trance. \"I've eaten enough today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, cool, stay here and I'll be back in like five minutes,\" Josie laid a hand on her stomach and tried to suck in a little as she walked past, her buttons clinging on for dear life. \"Stay out of sight if anyone turns up, they probably won't like me letting someone else in here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not exactly easy to hide myself at the moment, I take up a little more room than I used to,\" Carrie said with a smile, gesturing to her still naked body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Josie's stomach rumbled once again, causing her to wince in pain. \"Just stay behind a shelf or something!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was about to protest when Josie turned and hurried off, barging out of the library doors and into the darkness.

She figured at least the walking would do her some good. Her limbs still ached and her thick thighs rubbed together annoyingly with every step she took. She was gradually getting used to the weight of her expanded figure, but her body still felt very alien to her at the moment. Her three hundred pound frame jiggling and bouncing whenever she picked up a little speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze as she heard the library door creak open, and immediately covered herself behind a stack of books, peeking over to check who had entered. To her relief, it was just Josie, carrying what seemed to be a basket and looking considerably rounder than when she had left. Carrie raised an eyebrow as the once svelte blonde walked in and slumped against a desk. She left her hiding place and walked over to her new companion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"BURP!\" </i> Josie belched by way of greeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had obviously sampled more than a little of the kitchen's food, because she her shirt was now hanging open, and her round, bloated stomach was bulging out much further than before. Josie ran her hands along the sides of her stuffed tummy and moaned noisily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...uh...still hungry?\" Carrie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghhh...it was...surprisingly difficult to stop eating that food,\" Josie moaned. She patted her exposed stomach. \"I think I might have filled out a little more. This can't just be a food baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's eyes darted to the basket Josie had placed on the table, she took a step towards it, and saw it was filled with cakes and pastries. \"You...uh...brought some back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figured you might be hungry,\" Josie shrugged. She slumped down into a chair with a long exhale, her round, burgeoning belly spilling into her lap, causing a few ripping sounds to emanate from her skirt. \"Oof...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie felt her stomach beginning to rumble. Instinctively, she reached for a cake, then pulled her hand away. \"I really shouldn't, I'm already so big...\"</span></div></div>",

She knew this was a bad idea, but her stomach just demanded food at this point, and the overflowing basket was too much to resist. If this food was from the kitchen, or worse, the fridge, then it was going to cause further changes to her already overfed, plump body, and she knew she couldn't really afford to get any bigger, and yet...she kept eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, slow down there...\" Josie said from her chair, shocked at the sheer, ravenous hunger on display from Carrie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't...hungry...\" Carrie grumbled in between bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie watched as Carrie's stomach bulged out. More and more of the basket went straight into her mouth and caused her bloated stomach to swell even larger. On Carrie's already hefty frame, the continuous bloating was making her stomach look positively enormous. She was still standing, but as she shuffled closer to the table, her belly had dropped and now rested comfortably on the table top beside the basket. Her soft, doughy tummy bloating steadily along the wood, pushing out past the basket itself as her hand reached for more treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie saw what was happening and was amazed at just how much Carrie could pack away so quickly. She suddenly had a vision of herself doing the same thing, and looked down at her exposed belly self consciously...if she wasn't careful, she could end up just as big as her new friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie stopped suddenly and looked down at her belly, realising for the first time that she was using the table as a shelf to support it. She gave a moan as she saw how bloated she had become. \"What am I doing...I have to stop!\" She tried to put down the half eaten doughnut in her hand, but instead, found herself pushing it past her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie rose from her seat and tried to intervene, her tightly backed stomach groaning as it bulged over the hem of her skirt. \"Carrie, I think you should stop now...you're growing really quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie reached for another slice of cake, even as her ass swelled larger and pushed Josie away, almost consciously, to keep her from getting in the way of her gluttonous rampage. \"I'm sorry, I...I can't stop! I need to finish it all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'll be huge!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie blocked that out and kept going until the final cinnamon pastry had passed her lips. With the basket finally empty, she looked down at her huge, bloated gut and moaned. \"I'm so big...so greedy...what have I done to myself?!\" Carrie grunted as she took a step back, freeing her expanded tummy from the table and letting it drop back down to cover her more private parts. She took an ungainly step forward, feeling her entire body jiggle, even her massive, globular belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugghh I'm never going to get back to normal am I?\" Carrie moaned. \"I'm just a big gluttonous pig!\"</span></div></div>",

Josie had only known Carrie when she was obese, but already the gluttonous girl had seemed to grow larger and larger during their time together. Every time Josie got another look at Carrie, she seemed bigger, rounder...softer. A few pounds had probably been added when she cast the spell earlier, despite Carrie's belief that she was back to normal after the transference, and the greedy devouring of the pastries and cakes had seemed to accelerate her swelling considerably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie sank her hands into her soft, flabby gut and let out a moan as her fingers sank into her belly, forcing out a loud belch, which in turn caused an embarrassed Carrie to moan again. Consciously, Josie moved her hands to her own, taut stomach. It was comparatively tiny compared to Carrie large, beach ball sized belly, but it was definitely a pot belly now. Despite all her time in the house, she had never indulged in the cursed food, always steering clear of the kitchens and cooking her own food in her room. She had to admit, she could see why so many people had become addicted to the food here over the years, even if a small tasted was entrancing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, this is all my fault, me and stupid appetite,\" Carrie groaned, her hands travelling to her breasts, covering them as best she could to try and retain some semblance of modesty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrie, it's okay,\" Josie assured her. \"We can find a way out of this. It's only a little weight gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little?\" Carrie asked, her face flushed. She dropped her hands and lifted her massive gut, then dropped it again. It jiggled for several seconds, right in front of Josie's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJose bit her lip. She couldn't stop staring at Carrie's body, no matter how hard she tried, and the longer she looked, the more aroused she became. Seeing Carrie grow and expand and stuff herself had been bizarrely sexy, and despite her best efforts, Josie could feel a growing dampness between her legs. Carrie looked so cute as she moaned and belched and massaged her bloated tummy, all while being completely, unashamedly nude. God, she was so sexy like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...maybe...maybe it's not a bad look for you...\" Josie suggested, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie looked confused. \"Huh?

Josie rose from her chair, her own bloated stomach brushing against Carrie's for a moment before she gently pushed Carrie down into one of the chairs around the table. The chair creaked under Carrie's bulk, her ass spilling over the side of the seat. Josie knelt down in front of her and started massaging her gut again, then planting kisses on it, moving up and down her body before moving in to kiss her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was taken aback, but enjoyed every minute of it.

The sleeves of her shirt tightened as her arms thickened, and more ripping sounds came from her skirt as the seams began to pull apart. Her breasts bulged within her bra, her nipples beginning to peak out over the tops of the lacy cups. She grunted as the clothes tightened audibly, constricting her arms and legs. Her belly rounded out and sagged down slightly over her skirt, the button of which popped off and flew across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I didn't realise the food still changed you this long after eating,\" Josie moaned, rubbing her chubby belly. The growth seemed to have stopped after adding a good twenty pounds to her figure, and her clothes had just about held on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm not the only one who's chubbing up,\" Carrie smiled, having quite enjoyed seeing Josie get a little bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie looked at her knowingly. \"You've probably got about five minutes before you join me,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie suddenly realised what Josie meant. She'd eaten a ton of the food just now as well, and her already massive body was going to start expanding soon enough. \"God dammit, I really don't need to get any bigger, it's getting tiring just to stand up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably get you some clothes or something,\" Josie suggested. \"We'll be due some visitors soon and I don't think they'll be happy with a naked girl in the library. I'm pretty sure it'll be frowned upon. Come on, we'll whip you something up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie took Carrie by the hand and led her back to the front desk. Carrie sheepishly covered herself up, bracing herself for another growth spurt. Josie leaned over her desk to grab a book, her burgeoning belly squeezing up against the surface as Carrie watched, aroused. Josie produced the book and flipped to a page somewhere around the middle, then turned to face Carrie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you usually wear?\" Josie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to magic you up an outfit, it's an easy spell,\" Josie explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh...I guess jeans and a shirt but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fabricio coveris!\" Josie chanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA purple mist enveloped Carrie's body, and she felt the familiar sensation of fabric covering her body. A bra and panties snapped into place out of thin air, and a shirt and tight pair of jeans seemed to grow out of her body and settle into place on her rotund form. When the mist cleared, she was fully clothed once again, and saw that Josie was too. The librarian adjusted her glasses and brushed herself down; having repaired her earlier outfit, which now fit nicely around her slightly chubby form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" Josie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I feel much better not being naked,\" Carrie sighed with relief. Her new outfit looked pretty similar to what she would usually wear around the house, and thankfully didn't feel tight or constricting at all, perfectly matching her new size. She dreaded to think what size these clothes actually were though. Her breasts alone were probably suitable for a T cup now, at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they stood there, taking in their new outfits, the door creaked open behind them...</span></div></div>",

She secured herself a place where she could still see Josie and the entrance to the library, and peered through a stack of books. She saw Josie struggling to button up her shirt, and was surprised when she actually managed it, though the buttons looked ready to explode at any moment. She felt a little guilty for dragging the poor girl into this; she had been a svelte, slender woman before Carrie arrived. Now she was packing an extra fifty pounds on her once slim frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors finally opened, and Carrie saw who had entered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Carrie covered her mouth to stop herself from gasping as she saw her Beth tilt her head and scan the library from left to right, still wearing that same, blank, emotionless look on her face. After she had finished looking the room up and down, Carrie hoped she would just move on, but alas, she moved further inside, approaching Josie at the desk. The chubby librarian adjusted her shirt buttons, sucked in her bloated belly, and moved to greet the new arrival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I help you?\" Josie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurred to Carrie that she hadn't really even explained about guzzling down half of Beth's creamy body, but it was too late to go over that now. Hopefully, Josie would just put two and two together and ere on the side of caution. She didn't seem too phased by Beth's form, at least, though Carrie wasn't sure if that was a good or a bad thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mistress is searching for one who escaped her domain,\" Beth said, her voice flat and hollow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie cringed from her hiding place, peeking between the books. Whatever had happened to Beth seemed to have completely changed her entire personality. There was barely any trace of the spunky old Beth on that thing's creamy face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, there's just me here,\" Josie said, gesturing to the dark shelves behind her. \"Me and the books, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth regarded Josie for a moment in silence, looking her up and down. \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive,\" Josie replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was impressed by how well Josie was dealing with this. The girl had obviously seen her fair share of weirdness since she started working here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout responding to the answer Josie had just given, Beth lay a wet, creamy hand on Josie's bulging stomach. Her hand, despite being composed of liquid, rested quite firmly on Josie's overstretched shirt, gently touching some of the flesh that was spilling out beneath the gaping holes between buttons. \"You have eaten from the kitchen,\" Beth said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie looked down awkwardly at the hand resting on her stomach. \"Erm...yes...I mean...I do work here. I'm allowed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth studied Josie's face for a moment, then lifted her hand away, revealing a small, damp patch. \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Josie asked nervously.</span></div></div>",

And seeing as I haven't reported anybody, I haven't - MMMPH?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie was abruptly cut off as Beth's other arm, which had been resting on her creamy hip, shot out towards her mouth with surprising speed. Not expecting the sudden action, Josie had no time to react before the creamy body part shot into her mouth, causing her cheeks to bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No...\" Carrie whispered from behind the books. \"I need to do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to move out from her hiding place, Carrie caught sight of Josie glancing towards her. Her head shook slightly, sending a clear message to Carrie that she shouldn't interfere. Carrie reluctantly nodded before crouching back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My Mistress ordered me to find her using any and all tools at my disposal,\" Beth said, her hand still shoved in Josie's mouth. \"Shall we see how much bigger you can get before you break and reveal her to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her hiding place, Carrie could do nothing but watch as Beth's arms began to pulsate and force thick cream down Josie's throat. With every swallow, her plump body swelled. The buttons on her shirt quickly pinged off as her belly bulged outwards, taking on a perfectly round shape. Above it, her breasts began to challenge the remaining buttons as they too began to grow. And as for her lower body, the tears on either side of her skirt began to grow as her thighs and ass grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come now,\" Beth urged. \"Tell me where she is, and I'll leave you be. I might even take back what I've added to your body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to speak, Josie responded by vigorously shaking her head, inciting a tut from Beth. Carrie, on the other hand, was tempted to interfere. Sure, she'd be dragged back to Serena and her fridge, but she didn't want Josie wrapped up in this. And maybe Josie, with access to all these books, could try fixing them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or maybe I could?</i> Carrie wondered, peering down at a book next to her. <i>If Josie can learn magic, what's stopping me? If I find the right book, maybe I could turn Beth back to normal...</i></span></div></div>",

She was standing in the same section where Josie had pulled the transference spell from earlier, so hopefully there was something similar here that might be of use. As Josie continued to swallow down Beth's essence, Carrie hurriedly flipped through the pages; the book contained numerous pictures, some of which Beth could guess the meaning of; a woman with a huge pair of breasts, a woman who was an inch tall, a man with an enormous dick...but some of the pictures were completely bizarre and had some sort of ancient writing next to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie cast a quick glance back up to Josie and Beth, and saw the poor librarian sink to her knees as her ass cheeks began to overflow her skin tight skirt, which was tearing apart in several places. <i>\"Gotta hurry,\"</i> Carrie thought. <i>\"She's going to end up the same size as me if I don't do something...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie flicked through the book faster before something caught her eye; on one of the final pages was a woman with a strange, liquid like form, exactly like Beth's, and on the page opposite that one was what appeared to be just a puddle of liquid on the floor. Was this the one? Would it harm Beth? Causing her to completely lose her form seemed risky, but then again, there was plenty of spells here that could probably restore her, she just needed something to stop her attacking Josie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath and moving out of her hiding place, Carrie read the words, and gestured at Beth, who's cold, dead eyes locked into her very quickly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are,\" Beth said icily, continuing her stuffing of Josie even as she spotted her real target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Devolvulus!\" Carrie shrieked in a panic, pointing her hand towards Beth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth took a step forward, but as she moved, a purple glow enveloped her body. Her creamy form began to quiver, rippling and shaking all over. Blobs of cream began to detach themselves from her flowing body and drop to the floor. Beth looked surprised by this sudden turnabout, and looked down at her changing form as she began to lose mass, more and more cream slipping away from her body as it began to fall apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, what did I do?\" Carrie mumbled, watching as Beth began to shrink down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Beth did not seem phased. Instead, she turned her attention back to Josie, who still had a flowing arm inserted inside her mouth. That arm suddenly grew thicker, as Beth shifted her entire body forward and pushed herself directly into Josie's body. Josie gave a startled moan as she was forced to open her mouth even wider to accommodate Beth's entire essence, which promptly disappeared inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden, massive transference elicited a surprised squeal from Carrie, who stood watching as every part of Josie flowed into Josie's poor, swollen belly. Josie left out a long exhale as she was finally able to breathe properly, but her relief was undermined by the fact that her plump body was still expanding in all directions. Her skirt ripped down the sides, her chubby arms shredded her shirt sleeves, and her enormous breasts exploded out of her bra. Josie groaned as her body fattened up before her eyes, her stomach growing larger and larger as it began to sink towards the ground. Her face grew wider, a large double chin forming as her glasses stretched slightly to accommodate her chubby cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the cream had settled inside her, Josie was even bigger than Carrie. Her massive, four hundred pound body stood helplessly in the middle of the library. She glanced over at Carrie in shock. \"I...uh...think I put on a few pounds...\"</span></div></div>",

I thought, because you learned to use magic, I could use it and I could find a spell to fix my friend! But I couldn't and now you're super big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Calm down!\" Josie said calmly, reaching out a meaty hand to gently pat Carrie's shoulder. \"It'll be fine! Now that she's gone, we can spend more time searching for the relevant spells to fix us. We can also figure out how to remove her from my body and fix her. Properly, this time\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie sniffled and nodded slowly. This day was slowly getting worse and worse by the moment. But, with Beth gone for the moment, surely it couldn't possibly get any worse for her, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright!\" Josie said brightly, taking an incredibly heavy step backwards. \"You search... over there. I'll be over here, going through this pile of books. The incantation you're looking for should be... Um... Per... Perdere Pondus! That's it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Question!\" Carrie said. \"If you know the incantation, why do we need the book as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good question!\" Josie responded with a smile. \"Because we weren't born with the innate ability to perform magic, we need some sort of focus imbued with both magical power and the incantation for the spell we wish to cast in order to cast the spell. You can learn to cast spells without that focus, however it takes a great deal of time and research in order to do so. Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Carrie waddled off towards her assigned search area. Josie had assigned her a smaller bookshelf to search through, however Carrie could see herself gradually boring of her task, even if it would eventually return her to her original weight. Pulling a thinner tome from the shelf, she began to flick through it, looking for the incantation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, for the next half hour or so, Carrie flicked through book after tome, finding all sorts of odd spells. Someone intrigued her, while others utterly repulsed her. However interesting they seemed, she always put the book back if it didn't contain the incantation she needed. After her failed cast on Beth, she wasn't too eager to begin casting any more spells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling what felt like the umpteenth tome from the shelf, Carrie began to flick through it. As she did so, she spotted a familiar word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Perdere! It's gotta be close!\" Carrie said excitedly, her energy rapidly returning to her. \"Pondus... Pondus... There it is! Perdere Pondus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching the book to her flabby chest, she hurried back to the centre of the room, a massive grin on her face. Finally, she would get her old body back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Josie, Josie! I found it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie didn't answer. Instead, a monotone laugh echoed around the room, chilling Carrie's skin. She knew that laugh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Josie isn't here anymore,\" The voice said from behind a bookcase. \"But don't you worry... I'm still here, Carrie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind the bookcase to her right, Josie appeared. However, her vibrant eyes were now lifeless and colourless, while her expression was completely neutral. As soon as she saw Carrie however, she smiled coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now, come along,\" Beth ordered in a monotone version of Josie's voice. \"My Mistress is eager to regain you...\"</span></div></div>",

Carrie wasn't exactly in the best shape herself, but she had already ran today, and reasoned she could do it again. She turned and bolted for the library door as fast as she could, her chubby body jiggling, breasts shaking, butt swaying from side to side as her thighs rubbed together. Sweat was starting to pour from her brow already, and by the time she reached the door, she was nearly out of breath, and Beth was only a few steps behind her, advancing like some sort of zombie with her fat arms outstretched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, Carrie looked down at the book under her arm and decided it was now or never. \"Perdere Pondus!\" She yelled, bracing herself for what might happen now. Once more, her body began to feel strange, and a familiar tingling sensation washed over her skin. She felt a jolt of pain in her stomach, and instinctively clutched her swollen pot belly, only to find it deflating beneath her hands. A strange, blue glow enveloped her enlarged form as it started to shrink, fat melting away and pudge seeming to vanish into thin air. Carrie's body quickly lost its obese shape as she regained her slender, albeit curvy appearance. The little belly she had gained over the last few months remained, but all the extra pounds she had packed on since entering the fridge were now gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it worked!\" Carrie grinned wildly, before remembering she was still in danger. Beth was almost on her now, and she had to act quickly. She was about to use the spell on Josie, but wondered if it would have the same effect...without having gotten Beth's out of her body first? At this point, she decided it wasn't worth the risk. She was worried it might just erase Beth from existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucking the book under her arm again, Carrie ran for the door, barging out of the library completely naked, but free. She turned a corner and ran down a corridor until she could no longer hear the possessed Josie's heavy footsteps thudding behind her. </span></div></div>",

As it did, Carrie let out her own groans, her stubby her immensely thick arms waving uselessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Feel... so... full!\" She managed to get out, although it was slightly muffled by her round cheeks.<br>\r\n \"Don't worry, my little ball of butter!\" Serena practically sang, her hand gliding gently over Carrie's taut belly. \"Just give your body a few seconds to react to all that cream! I assure you, you won't be feeling full in a moment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena's giggle, paired with her light hand movements over her belly, helped lure Carrie into a more relaxed mindset. She stared down into her canyon of cleavage, listening to the sounds of her belly as it processed her gigantic feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a particularly loud groan escaped her belly, a tingle began to spread throughout her immense body. It wasn't an unpleasant one, however it did make her feel cold and, strangely, a little damp. Still staring at her breasts, she saw a thick layer of what appeared to be sweat covering them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh?\"<br>\r\nSerena giggled again, her hand retracting from Carrie's belly. <br>\r\n \"Another moment, sweetie! And then it'll be all over for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the ominous undertone in her voice, Carrie relaxed, allowing her body to begin changing. She began to sweat all over, although her sweat was a thick white cream. Soon enough, she was entirely covered in it. Letting out a final moan, Carrie's huge form melted into a puddle on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And rise!\"<br>\r\nAt Serena's command, the puddle rose upwards, shaping itself into the somewhat pudgy form of a human. <br>\r\n \"W-Why do I feel so weird?\" Carrie asked, unaware that she, like Beth, now consisted entirely of cream. Her skin shifted and swirled as she took a nervous step forwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It'll pass, my dear...\" Serena grinned, licking her lips eagerly. Now she had two more girls under her control, and she could feel her powers steadily increasing... Perhaps, with a few more servants under her command, she could finally expand her domain. Maybe move it out of the fridge in that awful abandoned house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Serena thought about what she could do, Beth and Carrie stared at each other with mixed wonderment and fear. <br>\r\n \"Beth?\"<br>\r\n \"C-Carrie?\"<br>\r\n \"What happened to us?\"<br>\r\n \"I don't know... But it feels kinda good\".<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBeth nodded slightly in agreement, pressing a soft hand against her swirling belly before looking over at Carrie, who was happily inspecting her chest. <br>\r\n \"Like your new forms, girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both looked at Serena, who smiled at each one in return. <br>\r\n \"I'm glad you do, because I have a use for them...\"</span></div></div>",

They turned and made their way back down the corridor they had come from, passing by the rows and rows of delicious food they had once gorged themselves on. Now, their appetites had vanished completely, with no stomachs or organs to speak of in their new, liquid forms. Their bodies moved very gracefully, their cream figures rippling only slightly as their feet hit the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we split up?\" Carrie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Beth said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir voices were different, slow and lifeless and devoid of their usual personality. They acted as though they were in a trance. Without another word, they separated, heading in different directions as they emerged from the Fridge. Beth moved through the Kitchen, onto the Dining room, and back out to the main hall, slowly scanning each room for any trace of her friends. A sudden crash caused her to swing her head to the right and change course. She followed the source of the noise and came to a large wooden door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere once she would have simply used the door knob, now Beth felt compelled to do something else. Her body rippled and collapsed back into a puddle, and she moved forward underneath the door, reforming quickly on the other side. When she looked around the room, she saw the source of the noise; a very alarmed looking Emma, who was cowering in a pile of broken antiques she had knocked over, and had just seen Beth form from a puddle on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-get back, whatever you are!\" Emma stammered, backing away over the pile of clutter she had created. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you recognise me?\" Beth asked, moving closer, her silent footsteps leaving a trail of cream across the carpet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma peered in for a closer look, and her jaw dropped. \"B-Beth?! Is that you? Wh-what happened? What <i>are </i>you?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wonderful,\" Beth replied. She stepped closer, until Emma was pushed up against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma just stared at her friend in horror, looking incredibly confused about Beth's transformation. She opened her mouth to speak, but Beth put a finger to her lips and let out a sinister, \"Shhhuuuushhhh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Emma could react any further, Beth pushed herself closer, wrapping herself around Beth's body intimately...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Beth's sudden appearance as a walking pile of... something had rendered her speechless.

Uh... I don't think...\"<br>\r\nEmma's confused stammering was cut short by a giggle from her liquefied friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Great!

She's patient, but not that patient!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma.slowly shook her head, taking a nervous step backwards. A broken pot cracked underneath her heel. <br>\r\n \"I don't... trust you...\"<br>\r\nBeth let out a sad sigh, sliding towards her retreating friend. <br>\r\n \"Don't be like that! Oh, I get it... You're nervous about meeting her! Not to worry... Our master is super cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"M-Master?!\"<br>\r\nEmma took another step back, crushing another antique piece of pottery. <br>\r\n \"What happened to you?! You're not the Beth I know!\"<br>\r\nBeth tutted as she she drew closer and closer. <br>\r\n \"I know... I'm much better than that old Beth. Anyway, if you won't follow me, I'll just have to make you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunging forwards, Beth covered the few feet between them in a blink of an eye. Reaching out, she wrapped her arms around Emma's arms and her legs around Emma's legs. Lifting her right arm, Emma's right arm lifted with it. Beth watched this with interest from her new perch atop Emma's left shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Perfect! Now, let's go!\"<br>\r\nMarching Emma to the door, Beth led her friend to the kitchen and towards an remarkable fridge. Throwing open the door, Emma found herself being led down an impossibly long corridor, the sides of which were laden down with divine smelling foods. Even the look of them made her stomach grumble, but Beth didn't stop. She made her walk until a winged figure came into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well done!\" She said happily, stroking Beth's cheek, which caused her to giggle. \"And you...\"<br>\r\nShe looked at Emma, who wore a terrified expression. The winged figure inspected her for a few moments before a smile spread across her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Welcome to the gateway to my domain! I am Serena, the current master of the beautiful woman who brought you here, and soon to be your master as well! Now, I wonder what your sin will be? Will you be gluttonous like your friends?

Will you succumb to food? Or perhaps you take a little too much pride in your appearance? Oh, this is always so exciting! Release her, would you?

Now, this almost never works, but I'm going to ask if you're willing to share your weakness?\"<br>\r\nEmma shook her head. <br>\r\n \"Great! It's boring if you immediately tell me. Now, let's get a few things for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicking her fingers, the air around the trio simmered briefly before a number of differing items surrounding them.

However, I could be if you just give into something here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena winked and giggled, causing Emma to blush. She wasn't attracted to girls in the slightest, yet just the sound of Serena giggling sent her heart racing. A few lewd thoughts began to float through her head, causing a slight smile to gradually spread across Emma's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting this, Serena's gentle smile became a little more malicious. <br>\r\n \"I see...\" She murmured to herself. \"Your sin surfaces...\"<br>\r\nPlanting a hand on her hip, Serena slowly made her way towards her next recruit. Making sure to sway her hips seductively, she licked her lips as she drew closer to Emma, whose face was beginning to redden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the blushing girl, Serena pressed her firm chest against her prey's soft one. A grin spread across her face as she heard a quiet whimper escape the girl's lips.

I didn't quite catch that\".<br>\r\nShe didn't respond, obviously embarrassed at how close their lips were to touching. Serena could feel her breath washing over her face, meaning the same was true for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Tell you what...\" Serena whispered in her ear. \"I'll let you do whatever you want with my body...

She looked deep into Serena's eyes, her gaze occasionally flicking down to her firm chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A-Anything?\" She repeated quietly. <br>\r\n \"Anything at all...\"<br>\r\nThe girl swallowed hungrily.

Emma was dimly aware of a tightness at the seat of her pants, and let out another moan as she pushed her face down into Serena's cleavage excitedly. As she did, Serena grasped Emma's swelling butt instinctively, accelerating her growth. Emma's plump cheeks swelled a little larger, stretching out her tight jeans, which creaked ominously as they struggled to contain her plump backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the strain on her pants, Emma lifted her head up, looking a little uncomfortable. Before she could react, Serena drummed her fingers again and Beth let out another moan as her panties stretched beneath her jeans, pulling tightly across her ass.

I saw how tight those jeans were,\" Serena said. \"You like cramming that cute ass into tight pants and watching as people check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma opened her mouth, but all that came out was a long, guttural, moan. She continued to grind on top of Serena, as the sexy demoness amplified her powers, sinking her hands into Emma's soft, plushy butt. Emma's jeans creaked again, the seams of her pants beginning to tear as they struggled to contain her rapidly inflating behind. Emma moaned as her panties grew even tighter, digging into her soaking wet pussy. The tops of her ass cheeks were rising higher, pushing out above the waistband of her jeans, exposing the tops of her rounding cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo....urghhhhhh....tight....\" Emma grunted as her ass widened even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fabric of Emma's jeans couldn't take any more. A loud <i>Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrip </i>sound echoed around the room as her jeans ripped up the sides along her thighs, finally splitting apart at the seat, right down the middle. Emma squealed as she felt the sudden release of her swollen rump, which bulged free and jiggled up and down atop Serena's waist, completely covering her body. It was firm and perfectly round, but looked surprisingly smooth and soft. Emma was only partially aware of what had just happened, and for a second, thought that Serena had simply ripped her jeans right off, but then she felt her oversized ass swelling onto the floor, overflowing Serena's body. She was about to reach for it when her panties gave up the battle against her swollen pussy and snapped off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GOD!\" Emma managed to cry out. \"MY ASS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena smiled broadly, lifting her hands from Emma's delightful derriere as it finished it's transformation.

As she continued to slide her hands over her huge backside, she soon came in contact with another pair of hands, whose fingers were tracing small, slightly arousing circles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at Serena, Emma tried to put on a pleading look. However, she must have failed because Serena merely giggled. <br>\r\n \"Oh, you must really love that!\" She said in a sultry time. \"Having such a fat ass... Being unable to ever cover it... How does it make you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's lips moved, but no words came out. <br>\r\n<i>I hate it!</i> She thought internally. <i>Or do I? All that stuff she said wasn't exactly wrong...

The girl did the same with one of hers, keeping the other firmly planted on her backside. She began to knead one of Serena's firm.breasts, getting a nod from the seductive demoness. Her movements were clumsy, and not at all arousing for her, considering how much it took for her to feel pleasure, but it did give her an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing her hands between them, Serena began to reciprocate, expertly massaging the girl's soft breasts. A long groan escaped her mouth as she felt fingers dig lightly into them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How about a chest to match that magnificent booty of yours?\" Serena suggested.<br>\r\nShe nodded eagerly, staring hungrily into Serena's eyes. With permission granted, Serena began to squeeze her breasts. With each dig of her finhers, they began to swell, gradually pressing against Serena's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma groaned and moaned as her ample bust swelled larger and larger. Leaning her head down, she tried to kiss Serena, but her expanding breasts were forcing her body away from her, much to her disappointment. Unable to kiss, Emma merely submitted to the demoness' touch, allowing her chest to grow ever bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer t-shirt quickly gave in. Ripping down the centre, the fabric flapped down either side of her breasts before being thrown from her body by Emma. Her bra then began to dig into the swelling flesh, causing discomfort, however it was quickly taken care off as Emma practically ripped it from her frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow completely naked, Emma allowed Serena to continue groping her breasts. By now, they completely eclipsed Serena's torso and were now slowly swelling across the floor. Emma would be been happy to lie there all day, but sadly, Serena obviously had other plans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Perfect...\" She whispered into her ear, causing her to shiver. \"You're shaping up nicely... But how about we take this relationship to the next level?\"<br>\r\nUnable to believe what Serena had just said, Emma nodded slowly. By next level, did she mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the girl's eyes light up, Serena grinned.

Pain doesn't exist in my domain! No, the last part... Well, let's just say it's better for both of us if you don't resist. If you do... Then you're just not what I'm looking for. I'll be forced to toss you aside, and I'm sure you don't want that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma shook her head. <br>\r\n \"N-Not really...\"<br>\r\n \"Good! Now, prepare yourself!\"<br>\r\nSmiling, Serena rubbed her hands together. As they began to tingle, she started to gently run her hands over Emma's body, who began to shiver and groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a heat began to build within her stomach, Emma tried her best to submit to Serena. However, a small part of her mind continued to resist. <br>\r\n <i>This isn't normal!</i> It told her urgently. <i>No part of this whole ordeal is normal! One of your friends consists entirely of cream, you've been led into  an impossibly large fridge... And a girl with both horns and wings is now groping you! Come on, Emma...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's hands, which had been busy caressing Serena's firm backside, froze. They shook slightly before inching towards Serena's leather thong, where she began to pick at the hem of it. She could grab it and yank the girl off her, and then make her escape...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What did I say about resisting?\"<br>\r\nEmma moaned as she felt Serena's hot breath wash into her ear. <br>\r\n \"Show me that lust... And give me everything you are!\"<br>\r\nFingernails dug deep into her soft ass, inciting a squeal from the hourglass-shaped brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they did, the last part of her mind that still resisted Serena dissolved. Sensing this, Serena grinned happily. With no more barriers between her power and her new minion, she poured magic in the girl's body. As she did Emma's body shook madly, sending waves across her huge breasts and ass, as Serena's final transformation overtook her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's pale skin was the first to change, slowly darkening and taking on an ashen grey hue. Her blue eyes weren't far behind, quickly turning crimson, while a black streak rapidly spread throughout her brown hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her appearance dramatically changed, Emma's body gained a few new parts. From above her ashen ass sprouted a lengthy black tail that ended in a sharp spade. Two small wings, much smaller than Serena's, sprouted from her shoulder blades, while two horns curved out from her forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning her eye over her developing new minion, Serena licked her lips eagerly. With one more touch, she would add someone new to her dimension, bringing her that little bit closer to finally escaping the infernal fridge her gateway was trapped in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hope you like it, sweetie...\" She whispered into her minions ear. Forcing her fingers, she dug one hand into her flabby breasts while the other gripped her equally soft backside. Focusing her power, Serena felt the malleable flesh in both hands slowly tighten and perk up, until both her minions bust and backside were firm to the touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her hands, Serena rolled off the girl's body. Staring down at her, she smirked. <br>\r\n \"Time to rise, sweetie! We've still got some people roaming the mansion! With them, I'm sure I... No, we can finally escape this abandoned place!\"</span></div></div>",

Your body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Belongs to me now!\"<br>\r\nSerena let out a giggle as she strutted towards the creamy Beth, who merely let out a whimper. Reaching her, Serena gently traced a finger over one of Beth's breasts, causing her to shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait, what?!\" Carrie yelped, struggling to understand what was currently happening. \"She belongs to you? How?\"<br>\r\n \"Oh, that's easy!\" Serena responded, now happily fondling one of Beth's breasts. \"She was way too gluttonous for her own good! And where's there's sin, there's a potential for power, or more power in my case. Creamy's lust for food allowed me to... take over, as it where. So, while her mind is still her own, her body belongs entirely to me! Watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling madly to herself, Serena stretched a finger out and beckoned for Beth to lean in. Beth's body responded, leaning on towards the demonic woman while also pressing her lips together. Serena then leaned in, locking lips with her. For a few seconds, the pair kissed deeply before Serena pulled away, licking her lips clean of any cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See! She obeys any command I give her! And don't you worry, little piggy. The way you've been eating, you won't be too far behind her! Soon, I'll have two more beautiful subjects all to myself! So, my dear little piggy, eat up! I'll be over here, enjoying my new subject!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena gestured for Beth to come in close. As she wobbled towards her, Serena reached her hands out. One attached itself to one of Beth's breasts, inciting a moan from her, while the other gently cupped her backside. Pulling her close, Serena kissed Beth again before moving her head down to her breasts. Licking her lips eagerly, Serena attached her mouth to a nipple and sucked deeply, a moan coming up from her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThick cream flowed into Serena's lithe body, however whatever she swallowed was quickly regenerated by Beth, who seemed to be reluctantly enjoying the whole situation. She moaned and groaned, a milky hand gently running through Serena's hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair fulfilled their needs, Carrie tried to resist her own. She stared at the hotdog she had started on earlier, her belly gurgling loudly as she did. She didn't want to give in and become like Beth, but with each passing second, it was becoming harder and harder...</span></div></div>",

Serena could see that by the way she was chowing down so readily. She was probably someone who enjoyed indulging herself and seeing her body change; would she ever have wanted to change this drastically? Probably not. But you had to be careful what you wished for, especially in the Mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena raised a hand and focused her magic on Carrie, using her powers to begin a metamorphosis. If Carrie was determined to act like a Pig, then a Pig she would become. Her true form would emerge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill stuffing herself mindlessly, Carrie was blissfully unaware of what was happening to her, or the strange way in Serena was gesturing to her fat, naked form. Still sat on her swollen rear end with her legs spread wide, Carrie stifled a belch and took a moment to breathe. She was still surrounded by a mountain of food, which barely seemed to have gone down at all since she started feasting. When she had regained her breath, she grabbed a nearby cupcake and shoved it into her mouth whole. As the cupcake past her lips, Carrie's ears were starting to morph into a strangely large, pointed shape, pushing through her dark hair and turning and a light shade of pink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother cupcake was pushed into Carrie's mouth by her eager hands, and as she wolfed it down, her nose began to grow, rounding and changing into a small snout. At the same time, just above her colossal ass, a curly tail forced it's way out. Carrie felt that change, and tried to reach around to her butt, but found her fingers couldn't quite reach it, so she quickly shrugged it off and went back to her binge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her heavily bloated belly continued to churn and bulge with every treat she swallowed, small pink circles began to appear either side of her belly button, all the way up to her breasts. Carrie let loose a huge belch once again, but this turned into a sudden \"OINK!\" which startled her out of her trance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie froze, wondering why she had made that noise. She looked down at her body, but could see nothing past her enormous tits. \"Wh-why did I <i>OINK </i>do that...oh god...\" Carrie went to cover her mouth, and found her hand pressing against a very unfamiliar snout. She pulled her hand away in horror, then tentatively reached up and touched it again. Carrie gave a sudden, porcine-like squeal as she realised what was happening to her, and looked up to see Serena grinning madly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With her mouth glued to one of Beth's breasts, Carrie's tongue hungrily gulped down the insanely fruity jam. It flowed quickly into her swelling stomach, which pushed the buttons on her shirt further and further part until they finally gave in, exploding outwards, sinking into Beth's spongy body and revealing Carrie's pudgy belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the pressure of her shirt no longer pressing on her belly, Carrie groaned happily. Her tongue eagerly licked Beth's leaking nipple, causing both girls to moan with pleasure. Beth, immobilized by both pleasure and her own body, shuddered, causing crumbs to rain down from her body, while Carrie, anxious for something a bit more solid, bit down and severed Beth's nipple from her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth screamed with pleasure as the jam in her left breast exploded into Carrie's mouth, making her cheeks bulge. Carrie gulped it down, her belly filling quickly. As the breast she had been drinking from was now empty, and would be until the nipple regenerated, Carrie pulled away, letting out a fruity burp as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eyed her friend, who was panting heavily and trying to relieve some of the pleasure she had been left with, with hunger in her eyes. However, Carrie's belly directed her gaze towards a massive pastry, practically exposing with cream. Its golden brown exterior was crispy and flaky, tantalizingly so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie wandered towards the heavenly treat, ignoring Beth's protest as she did. Reaching out, she bit one of the corners off, moaning as thick cream spurted out. Gulping it down, Carrie pulled the pastry from its shelf, falling to her knees with her treat cradled in her arms. Leaning her head down, Carrie began to devour the pastry, grunting as she gulped down heavy cream and crunched through the crispy exterior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrunching through a quarter of the pastry in record time, Carrie paused to let out a groan. <br>\r\n \"This tastes so good!\" She moaned, licking cream from her lips. \"I need more... So much more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamming her head back into the pastry and sending flakes flying into the air, Carrie's skin began to darken as she heartily devoured the golden pastry. Soon, her pale skin was a golden brown, no different from the hue of the treat she was eating. As her skin finished changing colour, it began to harden, cracks decorating its once flawless surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to the fact that her skin now had the same consistency as the pastry she was happily munching, Carrie moved into the centre of her meal. Cream filled her mouth, causing Carrie to moan happily. It felt so incredibly thick and it tasted so indescribably rich... She had never had anything like it in her life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs cream flowed down into her stomach, Carrie's flaky body began to expand. Her belly and breasts filled with cream, her belly pushing into her lap. Her breasts fought briefly with her tight bra, which struggled to hold back the tide of crispy flesh. They quickly lost, falling uselessly to the sides of her filling bust. Her shirt, however, resisted the growing globes, golden flesh bulging through the holes. Beneath her, Carrie's plush backside pushed her upwards, her feet digging into the swelling orbs that were both soft and hard at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the last corner of the pastry into her mouth, Carrie moaned happily, caressing her full belly and causing a few flakes to fall to the floor. <br>\r\n \"Mmmm... So good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face Beth, who was still trying to pleasure herself, Carrie grinned. During her binge, her missing nipple had reappeared and her breast was once again filled with fruity jam. Licking her lips, she crawled towards her spongy friend, unaware of her own crunchy skin flaking off as she moved...</span></div></div>",

She hadn't heard the others take the stairs, and though they looked pretty creepy, she figured the quicker they checked all the rooms in this mouldy old place, the sooner they could leave. The stairs creaked underfoot, and a cold air blew down towards her, causing her to rub her exposed shoulders to get a bit of warmth back. As she reached the top step, there were three different hallways to choose from; one to the left, one to the right and one straight on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth had no idea which one led to what, so decided to start with the left and work her way across. She headed down the dark, barely lit hall, switching the flashlight on on her phone to shine a way. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a spider run along the wall, and gave a shriek, before tripping on an overturned piece of carpet and falling into an open doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding with a crash on the floor, Beth groaned and sat up. \"Stupid spiders...ugh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room she now found herself in was a  was in a rather fancy looking bedroom, with a large four poster bed in its centre and an enormous wardrobe and set of drawers on the far side.

She readjusted her jeans and top, brushed a patch of dust off of her knee and admired her reflection. God, she was hot. Unable to resist, she pulled out her phone and took a selfie of her in the room. Instinctively, she went to upload the picture to her Instagram, but then remembered she had no signal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit, that was a good pic too,\" Beth pouted, sliding her phone back into her pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked back at herself, she saw a strange glimmer of light flash across the mirror's glass. Squinting, she lent in for a closer look...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you change...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whispering voice came from nowhere, and Beth froze in place.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Beth gasped upon entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was, in a word, massive. The single bedroom was easily bigger than Beth\u2019s entire apartment. Directly ahead in front her, it\u2019s head against the wall, was giant king sized four poster bed with thin velvety looking drapes that could be pulled around it. To the left of the bed, past the left side bed table topped with books, was a set of open double doors that lead to a large walk in closet that was practically overflowing with clothes. To the right, past a night stand with a cup of some steaming brew, was another set of open double doors that lead to a magnificent looking master bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCentered on the left was a beautifully built fireplace with a comfy looking armchair in front of it. Right of the fireplace, between it and the closet, was fully loaded vanity with a lovely looking mirror. To the left of the fireplace was a large and imposing writing desk. The opposite wall, right of the door was covered with an ornate bookshelf, reaching from wall to wall and from the floor all the way up to the fifteen foot high ceiling. The shelves held numerous books and odd looking decorations and ornaments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. This is like a queen\u2019s room,\u201d Beth said. She absentmindedly kicked off her flip flops, her petite manicured feet sinking into the soft, plush carpet. She let out a pleased coo at the sensation. So enraptured by the room\u2019s impressive style and imposing size, Beth failed to notice that not only was the room well lit by electric lights and was rather warm but not a single surface was covered in dust. Sitting her round rump on end of the bed, Beth sighed happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis bed is soooooo soft,\u201d she told the empty room before yawning. She rubbed at her heavy eyes. She had to admit she was pretty tired and this room was so so comfy. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to take a small nap would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could decide, her attention was drawn to a large portrait hanging above the doorway. It was probably three feet wide and about five feet tall, it\u2019s frame exquisite and gold. A small plaque at the base read \u201cLady Auriela Belview\u201d and, judging by her portrait, she was a giant of woman. Her face was round with thick plump lips, puffy full cheeks, and a puffy double chin. Glamorous makeup - glittery eye shadow, bright pink blush, scarlet lipstick, and more - covered her chubby face and her hair, a glorious mane of blonde curls, pooled around her shoulders. Her thick neck led into equally thick shoulders that led in very fat biceps, pudgy arms, and swollen looking hands, adorned with dozen of rings. Her hands rested comfortably on her enormously round belly, it\u2019s girth stretching her dress taut and disappearing beyond the frames of the portrait. Propped atop her gut were the largest breasts Beth had ever seen, each easily larger than their owner\u2019s head. A field of squishy, freckled cleavage bulged out of her dress and her thick nipples pressed against the the fabric, painted in absurd detail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit she\u2019s huge,\u201d Beth laughed. Looking around the room, Beth wondered what to explore first. </span></div></div>",

I was betrayed by my servants years ago and my spirit trapped in the building to rot,\u201d Aurelia explained to Beth. Beth was frozen in horror. The portrait did not move and she did not see anything but she knew in her heart of hearts that she was not alone. Beth could feel Aurelia's presence. She felt the woman\u2019s plump hands on her narrow waist, then her curvy hips, and finally Beth felt a playful slap on her pronounce booty. The spirit laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re built much like I was when I was younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me cut to the chase, dearie.

I severely hope that my make-up is where I left it. Otherwise, I'll hunt down the spirits of those servants and torture them for all eternity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrutting towards a dusty table in the corner, Aurelia spent a few minutes cleaning it off. The mirror was caked in a centuries worth of grime, while the dust was so thick that even looking at it made Aurelia sneeze in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a clean table, she pulled the chair out from underneath the table and sighed. Much like the table, it was rife with diet and cobwebs. Blowing the majority of these off, Aurelia sat down and pulled a box close to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think a bit of this... And a little dab of this... And perhaps a touch of this...\"<br>\r\nDigging through the box, Aurelia pulled out various objects. Unlike the rest of the room, these were relatively clean, barring a little dust that had slipped through the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her products chosen, she began to apply them to her face. Grabbing a ruby-red lipstick, Aurelia gently ran it over her lips. As she did, her lips swelled, becoming thick and plump. Pressing them together, she blew herself a kiss with her new lips before moving on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she started on her eyes. The former owner had applied a little eyeliner, but it's wasn't enough for Aurelia. Grabbing her own, she began to reapply it. Beth's brown eyes began to change hue to a light blue as she did, signalling Aurelia's control over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with her progress, Aurelia ran an eye over the rest of her face. It was naturally beautiful, meaning that she could have a much easier time making herself look good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think that should do it!\"<br>\r\nPacking everything back into the box, Aurelia stood up.

I sincerely hope that, whatever they've made, it tastes good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her nose, Aurelia weaved her way through the maze of corridors that made up her mansion. She was disappointed to see the state it had fallen into over the years, but she had a plan. Hopefully, an ancestor of her family still lived and, even more hopefully, they still had access to the immense Belview fortune. With that, she would rebuild her home, signalling her return to the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But before that, I require a form worthy of my name. And I need the other pests scurrying around the corridors dealt with. Perhaps after a good meal, I'll introduce myself to them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling eagerly, Aurelia reached the main staircase. Making her way down it, she rounded a corner into the dining hall, where her eyes lit up. <br>\r\nSpread out before her on a creaking table was a massive feast consisting of all her favourite foods. Chicken, ham, pork, beef... And absolutely none of those awful vegetables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to her usual seat at the head of the table, Aurelia dropped lightly into it. As it had been specially constructed for her old body, her new form had plenty of room. However, she hoped that that wouldn't be the case for long as she pulled a whole roasted chicken towards herself, excitedly ripping a leg off and raising it to her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a large chunk out of it, Aurelia sighed happily. The food was cooked exactly as she had specified all those years ago. It was full of flavour, grease and fat, some of which dropped from the leg clutched in her hand, landing in her lap and creating a small puddle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly finishing it off, she reached back for another, devouring it even quicker than the first. After finishing off the legs, she started on the main body, cutting out huge chunks of glistening chicken that she hungrily rammed into her waiting mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the speed she was eating, it didn't take Aurelia long to finish off the first chicken. She let out a pleased burp before reaching for a plate of deliciously pink ham, lifting a slice and munching through it. One slice became two, which became three and so on until all that was left on the plate was a puddle of grease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is the life...\" Aurelia sighed, running her distended belly. \"But we aren't done just yet... There's still a whole table's worth of food for us to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelia leaned forwards, reaching for another plate...</span></div></div>",

Had Beth still been floating around her head and seen what had happened to her once perfect frame, she probably would have fallen into a deep despair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelia's belly now pressed heavily into the table in front of her. It was split into three uneven rolls, with the top one being the smallest and the bottom being the vast majority of her belly. It rippled and jiggled as Aurelia rubbed it proudly, pleased with her progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her top belly roll sat two hefty breasts, each around triple the size of her head. Her t-shirt had been devoured by the two flabby globes and was now acting as a very crude bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupporting her monumental frame was an ass that now completely filled the specially designed chair. Her pants had been utterly annihilated during her binge, leaving Aurelia's lower body clad in nothing but an incredibly stretched pair of lacy panties that were inches away from following her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'd say I'm almost back to my old size...\" Aurelia mused, rubbing one of her three soft chins. \"Not a bad performance... Of course, the food did have a lot to do with it. It took me years to reach this size with regular old food. This magic stuff makes it too easy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing her girth to her feet, Aurelia slowly stepped away from the table. After a good meal, she liked to participate in her other favourite activity, which was pick a male servant and have him pleasure her to the best of his abilities. And if he failed, then he disappeared!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she now faced a problem. Her servants were all long dead, and in their place were some girls wandering her mansion.

Catching sight of Aurelia's immense form, the girl froze, her mouth agape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And this is where the fun begins...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's search had been going horribly. After everybody had split up, she had decided to investigate the kitchen. This quickly turned out to be a mistake, as bugs and mice basically ruled the filthy kitchen, sending Carrie sprinting from the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the kitchen, Carrie found herself lost in the labyrinth of corridors. She had been wandering for a while before hearing the sound of a chair being pushed back. Deciding to investigate the sound, she had hurried towards an open archway, where she had been met with a titanic woman that looked oddly familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's so big...</i> Carrie thought in wonderment. <i>How does she even move at that size...</i><br>\r\nCarrie continued to stare until she realised that the woman was drawing closer to her, at which point she stumbled backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who are you?\" Carrie demanded, which incited a chuckle from the mysterious woman. <br>\r\n \"Oh, you already know me!\" She replied with a cryptic smile. \"Well... The former inhabitant of this body anyway. But I'm not important. What is important is you, my dear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"M-Me?\" Carrie repeated slowly. It was odd... The longer she looked at this woman, the more relaxed she felt. And, alongside her relaxation, she began to feel a little turned on. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry your pretty little head about it!\" The woman said calmly. \"All that matters is... I need your help with a personal matter. Will you help me?\"<br>\r\nCarrie nodded slowly, causing the woman to smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Perfect...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the chubby girl now at ease, Aurelia moved her bulk forwards. Had the former owner been commanding the body, they probably would've collapsed and been pinned under her own weight. But having carried such a weight for many years, Aurelia was as nimble as a woman of her size could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put this agility to work. Lunging towards the girl, who let a surprised yelp, Aurelia pulled her close, locking lips with her prey. She forced her tongue inside her mouth, playing with their tongue for a few seconds before breaking away, a wide smile on her round face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You'll do...\" Aurelia purred. Clutching her by the wrist, Aurelia quickly unbuttoned her shirt, which fell away to reveal a soft set of breasts and a pudgy stomach. The tight skirt vanished just as quickly, as did her underwear, leaving the girl completely naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips in anticipation, Aurelia wondered where to start...</span></div></div>",

Ignoring her pleasurable yelp, Aurelia peered over her shoulder at the dining table. Sadly, she had devoured everything short of the bones, meaning she would have to try something else if she wanted this new plaything of hers at a reasonable size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I haven't tried this for a great many years...</i> Aurelia thought, running her hands eagerly. <i>But should it work, her body and mind will belong entirely to me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a thick finger dig into one of her breasts, Carrie barely suppressed a moan, instead forcing a yelp out in its place. <br>\r\n<i>Who even is this?!</i> She thought desperately, watching as the woman tapped one of her chins in thought. <i>She looks a little like Beth with an extra two hundred pounds! Wait... Is she Beth? Was Beth possessed by a...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's eyes went wide at the thought. Was she about to be possessed? Have her body snatched from her and then bloated up until she looked like a whale with legs? She didn't want that! She just got a new job! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding upon some sort of escape, Carrie glanced up at Beth's fat adorned face, which turned out to be a mistake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the girl look up at her with worry, Aurelia chuckled. <br>\r\n \"Now...\" <br>\r\nGrabbing her by the cheeks, Aurelia squeezed lightly, forcing the girl's lips to part slightly. With her other free hand, she clicked a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Samantha!\" Aurelia called out. \"Do you still exist within these walls? If so, your mistress has need of you!\"<br>\r\nSilence met her question. And yet, a smile spread across Aurelia's plump face. Silence was exactly what she wanted to hear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>=====</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy hand clutching her mouth, Carrie was immobilized. Despite how soft it looked, the hand was like a vice. She couldn't move her mouth at all, which was beginning to dry her mouth out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please... I don't want to be possessed...</i> She thought desperately. <br>\r\n \"Samantha! Do you still exist within these walls? If so, your mistress has need of you!\"<br>\r\nCarrie's eyes widened. She was going to be possessed! She tried to struggle, however the hand clutching her by the cheeks tightened, ending her attempted rebellion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"None of that...\" The woman tutted. \"Not in front of my favourite servant!\"<br>\r\nThe woman grinned and looked over her shoulder at the doorway. Carrie followed her gaze and, had a hand not been preventing it, would've let out a scream of terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the doorway stood a transparent figure dressed in a long black mail's dress. She had a rather curvy frame, with breasts that seemed to large for the dress and a lower body that flared out the skirt. Her long black hair floated around her head, while her eyes were a piercing blue. And speaking of eyes, the ghost's seemed to be staring hungrily at Carrie...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, Samantha!\"<br>\r\nAurelia smiled at the figure in the doorway, who bowed low. <br>\r\n \"I am pleased to see you back, Mistress.

After all, I didn't have my favourite servant with me...\" Aurelia giggled. <br>\r\n \"You flatter me, Mistress. But I'll take the flattery\".<br>\r\nSamantha floated closer to the duo, closely inspecting the still girl clutched in Aurelia's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, her?\" Aurelia said, noticing Samantha looking at Carrie. \"A few peasants have broken into my mansion. I would normally kick them out, but we haven't had bodies in so long... This one, but the way, is for you. If I am to roam the Earth again, I would like my favourite servant by my side\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Again, you flatter me. But thank you for thinking of me, Mistress\".<br>\r\nSamantha floated closer to Carrie, who let out a terrified squeal.

About an inch away, she paused, a grateful smile spreading across her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I thank you for your body...\" She whispered into Carrie's ear. \"But unfortunately for you, a body cannot have two minds within it at once. And I'm afraid that my Mistress has a much greater need for me, her most favoured servant, than you, an unwelcome intruder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scream began to build within Carrie's throat. However, it was much to late for her. The ghost shoved an arm into her mouth, causing a groan to escape her mouth as said arm forced its way down her throat. The figure floated upwards, pushing more and more of their arm down Carrie's bulging throat until they were up to their shoulder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelia watched as Samantha slowly began to force her way into the girl's body. As soon as she was up to her shoulder, she released her vice-like grip, which caused the girl to fall to her knees. Her hands scrambled frantically at her mouth, trying her hardest to pull Samantha's arm out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer efforts were in vain, as Samantha was corporeal, meaning her hands passed harmlessly through. When this finally dawned on the desperate girl, she began to cry, tears running down her bulging cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, Aurelia didn't care. This girl had broken into her home and then started stomping around the place like she owned it. All she was doing was punishing her. Sure, it was an unusual punishment, but who was going to stop her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Samantha let out a grunt, Aurelia grinned as she floated upwards, beginning to push her torso into her soon-to-be new body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's arms fell helplessly to her sides. She stared up at the ghost currently taking possession of her body, powerless to do anything else. She watched in despair as the figure floated upwards before beginning to force her torso into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Carrie, it slid effortlessly into her mouth. When it came to her rather hefty breasts, however, the figure paused for a moment. Her uneaten hand fiddled with her bust for a moment before Carrie felt two firm breasts fill her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two breasts had disappeared down her throat, the figure began to push her head into her mouth. Unlike her chest, the ghost's head seemed to compress until it filled her mouth with ease. As it did, Carrie's head became increasingly foggier, her thoughts slowly disappearing. Her vision slowly became darker and darker, until Carrie saw and thought no more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the girl's body slump over, Aurelia laughed happily. <br>\r\n \"About time she finally disappeared!\" She said with glee, clapping her flabby hands together. \"Now, Samantha! Take control of her! Return to my side anew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha, whose legs were dangling in the air, kicked a few times before easily sliding down into the girl's open mouth. As Samantha disappeared from view, her mouth shut. For a few moments, she was completely still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"M-Mistress...\"<br>\r\nHearing a quiet voice, Aurelia let out a cackle. <br>\r\n \"Samantha! How does it feel having a body once again?\"<br>\r\nSamantha unsteadily rose to her feet, her naked breasts bouncing lightly. She ran a hand through her blonde hair before pulling away and looking at her hand in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I suppose it feels nice... However, this girl seems to be lacking a few features of my former body...\"<br>\r\nAurelia nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n \"Yes, she is rather thin...\"  </span></div></div>",

I suppose I could always eat, but you never did like anybody with a belly, did you, Mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelia nodded slowly. Samantha didn't know of any methods, but she definitely did. Using them, however, would most likely drain both her energy and her power. But, she would have Samantha to take care of her in the sleep that would inevitably follow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Perhaps... How would you like a gift from your dear Mistress?\" Aurelia purred, smiling at Samantha. <br>\r\n \"What did you have in mind?\" Samantha asked curiously. <br>\r\n \"Just stand completely still... You'll feel a slight tingling, but it's nothing to worry about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning her meaty hands together, Aurelia felt heat building between them. Once it had reached its peak, she opened her hands and poi red her palms towards Samantha. A ghostly green gas emanated from her palm, drifting lazily towards Samantha. Upon reaching her body, it encircled her body for a moment before congregating around her breasts and lower body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moment passed before Samantha's body began to absorb the gas. As it did, her assets slowly began to swell. Her pudgy breasts, sagging ever so slightly, immediately perked up, standing proud on her chest as they grew to the size of watermelons, surpassing Samantha's old bust. Her hips cracked outwards, pushing past her shoulders, while her plush backside filled with fat, becoming heavy and round. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her body swelled in certain places, it shrank and changed in others. Samantha's slight belly retreated back into her torso, leaving a trim stomach in its place. Her blonde hair darkened quickly until it was a midnight black. And finally, her eyes became a vivid blue, completing the changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well?\" Aurelia asked. \"How do you feel now?\"<br>\r\nSamantha didn't answer immediately. A hand went to a heavy breast, squeezing it lightly, while the other fiddled with her black hair. After a moment, a pleased moan escaped her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mistress... Thank you... I promise, I will remain by your side forever more, as payment for this body...\"<br>\r\nSamantha fondled herself happily for another minute, almost pushing herself to a climax before abruptly stopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Apologies, Mistress. I didn't even ask if you wanted to join in. Would you care to move to your bedroom?\"<br>\r\nAurelia grinned and nodded, gesturing for Samantha to head upstairs... </span></div></div>",

She could feel herself gradually growing hotter, a hand forcing its way down the the front of her panties...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not just yet!</i> Aurelia chided herself. <i>Just wait until the bedroom, then you can ravage that beautiful body...</i><br>\r\nGiggling at the thought of the two of them making glorious love, playing with the other's body, Aurelia paused for a second, allowing Samantha's lead to increase a little more.

She looked at her Mistress with a look of pure lust, which was returned by Aurelia. However, as the hefty woman started towards the bed, she stumbled slightly, her eyes drooping. Samantha yelped as Aurelia went crashing to the bed, her bulk narrowly missing her thin body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"M-Mistress?\"<br>\r\nGently poking Aurelia's cheek, Samantha received a snore on response.

Although, I suppose the Mistress has a plan for this place. I think it best to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is somebody there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha paused partway down the stairs, her eyes narrowing. Mistress has told her that there were intruders, but she hadn't expected to run into one so quickly. Should she greet them? Keep them occupied until Mistress awakened and could do what she wished with them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps she could show some initiative. Guide them to a part of the mansion she knew for a fact had some sort of course upon it and then allow them to be cursed? It might ruin any sort of plan Mistress may have had for them, but it would be one less intruder wandering the mansion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to herself, Samantha continued down the stairs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma had not being having the best time searching. She had, rather unwisely, chosen to explore the grounds, where she had stumbled upon a number of greenhouses. Upon entering one of them, she was immediately accosted by a vine that had wrapped itself around her leg and tried pulling her towards some massive plant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially surprised by the magical moving plant, Emma had almost fallen prey to it. At the last second, she managed to grab a set of trimmers and snipped the vine, quickly escaping the greenhouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, that wasn't even the weirdest thing to happen to her. While exploring the cellar, dusty wine bottles that were centuries old had tried to pour their contents down her throat. And in one of the bedroom, a duvet almost ensnared her and dragged to what looked to be the most comfortable bed she had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why couldn't Stacey get lost in, I dunno... Somewhere less haunted?\" Emma complained. \"I feel like we're on an episode of Ghost Hunters of something! Like, are these things actually haunted, or are they attached to some incredibly strong wires? Either way, this place ain't cool...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously making her way down the corridor, Emma paused as she heard a voice, followed by a long creak. <br>\r\n \"Is somebody there?\" She called out hopefully, hoping that it was one of her friends and not a haunted mannequin or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice stopped, along with the creaking. Creeping forwards, Emma found herself in the entrance hall where they had all split up. And standing in the stairs was not Beth, Carrie, Katie or Stacey. Rather, it was a woman with raven black hair, clad in a long black maid's dress that struggled to keep her rather large assets contained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with this complete stranger, Emma could only say one thing. <br>\r\n \"Uh... Hi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha eyed the girl standing in front of her with curiosity. She had a rather noticeable body, nothing compared to her own, of course, and had shoulder length brown hair. And on her face sat a pair of glasses that had slid down her nose slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while the girl's body was normal enough, Samantha found herself puzzled by the clothes. Her Mistress had been wearing something as equally puzzling. Rather than a long flowing dress, this girl was clad in a simple shirt with something scrawled along the front and a set of denim pants with holes in the knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh... Hi?\"<br>\r\nHearing the girl speak nervously, Samantha cleared her throat. She had done this many a time...<br>\r\n \"Greetings to you, and welcome to to Lady Aurelia Belview's mansion. I am Samantha, her head maid. May I ask your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl recoiled slightly before answering. <br>\r\n \"E-Emma. Who is this Lady Aurelia?\"<br>\r\n \"The Mistress of the mansion. She is currently asleep at the moment. May I ask why you have broken into her house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Emma's eyes widened. <br>\r\n \"But this place is abandoned! Has been for years! How can we break into somewhere that nobody owns? But if you must know, a friend of mine disappeared around here. We thought she might be inside...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded in understanding. <br>\r\n \"Unfortunately, I have not seen your friend. However, the Mistress may have. Perhaps you would care for a tour while we wait for her to wake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot giving Emma a chance to decline, Samantha quickly descended the stairs, grabbed her by the arm and led her down the nearest corridor...</span></div></div>",

Normally, her Mistress would be the one to guide intruders and irritating guests to these rooms, but every so often, that duty fell to Samantha. She just hoped that Emma wasn't crucial to any plans...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't see anybody!\" Emma called from within the room. <br>\r\n \"Are you positive?\" Samantha responded, moving so she was standing in the doorway. \"Odd... I was sure I heard somebody in here earlier. Perhaps over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing towards a corner that seemed darker than the rest, Samantha saw hesitation flash across Emma's face. <br>\r\n \"I dunno...\"<br>\r\nSighing, Samantha entered the room. It was another dining room, however compared to her Mistress's own personal one, it was much smaller. Connected to it was a kitchen and opposite the door they had come in was a door leading out into the grounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I assure you. While I am here, no harm will befall you\".<br>\r\nEmma looked at her for a moment before nodding. <br>\r\n \"If you say so...\"<br>\r\nEmma slowly creeped towards the corner. As she did, Samantha stepped out of the room, allowing the room to work its magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emma drew closer to the dark corner, she paused. Her head turned slowly, almost mechanically, before her gaze focused in on..</span></div></div>",

Rather, she looked at the massive portrait hanging over the fireplace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepicted with its full golden frame was a teenage girl, not much older than eighteen. Long golden locks hung down over her face, while her icy blue eyes stared right back at Emma. Her body, average at best, was clad in a bright pink dress with an opening for her breasts, allowing a little cleavage to be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to the rest of the room, which was covered in dust, dirt, mould and other things that had built up over the years, the portrait looked as though it had been hung up about an hour ago. Emma found herself drawing closer to it, her hand reaching out to touch the golden frame...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the doorway, Samantha watched Emma draw closer to the golden frame, her mouth agape slightly. Had she taken the time to read the small plaque underneath the painting, she would've seen that the girl depicted in the picture was Lady Alice Belview, the younger sister of her own Mistress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to her Mistress, who was the very picture of gluttony and lust, Alice had been very vain while she had walked the earth. She spent hours in front of a mirror, making sure her appearance was as immaculate as possible. She had watched her weight closely, making sure that not a pound of fat adorned her perfect frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Alice was incredibly vain, she had gotten on well with her sister. Her Mistress had doted on her, granting almost any wish she desired. While her Mistress had not expressed an interest in her return, Samantha had decided to take the initiative and grant Alice a body. She just hoped that she was around to accept it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her fingers brush against the cold frame, Emma froze. Her eyes widened as a figure, identical to the girl in the painting, floated out, a grumpy look on her face. She floated down beside Emma, her arms crossed unhappily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Get off my frame!\" She demanded, glaring at Emma. \"You'll get dirt on it!\"<br>\r\nEmma didn't respond immediately, still trying to get over the shock of the girl actually appearing. <br>\r\n \"Are you deaf or something? No touching!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl reached out, intending to push Emma away. Instead, her hand phased through her, causing even more shock for Emma as chills raced through her body. She stumbled backwards, almost tripping over her own feet as she did so. Pressing her back against the wall behind her, she took a few deep breaths before laughing nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, guys!\" She called out. \"Very funny! You got me... You can turn the projector off now!\"<br>\r\nOpposite her, the girl frowned. <br>\r\n \"Projector? I don't know what that is, but if there are others here... Well, let's just say my sister won't be too happy to see them. But as for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turned to the door with a grin. Emma followed her look until she saw Samantha lurking in the doorway, her face hidden by darkness. <br>\r\n \"Remind me to thank her, Samantha! I've been waiting years for a body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turned back to Emma with the same grin on her face. Slowly, she floated forwards, an arm reaching out...</span></div></div>",

Feeling the back of her legs collide with what felt like a sofa, she fell backwards into it, her body sinking into its incredibly soft cushions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, I do love that sofa!\" The girl cooed happily, pausing in front of Emma, who was now completely frozen. \"However, we do have a problem with it at the moment\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"H-Huh?\" Emma stammered back, her eyes refusing to leave the apparitions face. <br>\r\n \"Yeah, but it's easily fixed,\" The ghost replied, giving her a cold smile. \"Hold still!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure lunged forwards. Emma barely had time to scream before their arm rammed its way into her mouth and down her throat. She began to choke as the ghostly girl forced more and more of her body into her mouth. Reaching up, she attempted to pull her out, forgetting that she was corporeal. As her hands phased harmlessly through her pale torso, Emma's vision began to darken and her thoughts began to leave her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the doorway, Samantha watched with amusement as the girl tried to yank Alice out of her mouth. Failing to do so, her arms fell uselessly to either side of her body, twitching slightly as more and more of Alice entered her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last of Alice's ghostly form slid into the girl's mouth, which still hung open in shock, Samantha finally left the doorway. Striding into the room, she stood opposite Alice's new body, looking down at it with curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lady Alice?\" She called out. \"Was the possession successful? Or should I call your sister and tell her that something went wrong?\"<br>\r\nThe girl's mouth twitched a little. <br>\r\n \"Is that a yes to retrieving the Mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's... a no...\"<br>\r\nThe girl coughed a few times before lifting her arms. She inspected her hands with interest, before looking up at Samantha with a grin. <br>\r\n \"It's feels so good to have a body again! Especially one more mature than my original one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching her new arms above her head, Alice leaned back in her seat. <br>\r\n \"Ahhh... How I've missed this sofa... I still can't believe whoever this was thought she could sit in my spot! Like, how dare she! How would she like if I broke into her house and sat on her favourite seat? But, it doesn't matter anymore! I've both my seat back and a new body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill grinning, Alice looked around her parlour. <br>\r\n \"Hmmm... Everything seems a little fuzzy.... Do I have a body with crap eyesight?!\"<br>\r\nSamantha cleared her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Perhaps if you adjusted the form slightly, the fuzziness will subside?\" She suggested. <br>\r\n \"But then I'll lose my womanly looks!\" Alice whined, folding her arms under her bust. \"I don't wanna be plain again! It sucks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, Mistress helped me with mine and I ended up a little bigger than before. I realise you aren't as skilled as her, but maybe you could do the same? Change how you look but not your size?\"<br>\r\nAlice frowned. <br>\r\n \"Not as skilled? Rubbish, I'm just as skilled as my sister. And as for you, you do seem a little rounder than before.... Yeah, I'm sure I can make this work! Stand back and let me do my thing, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha stepped away. Getting to her feet, which was an odd feeling now that she had a physical body, Alice rubbed her hands. <br>\r\n \"Here we go...\"<br>\r\nShe began to mumble to herself, a glow building around her as she did. Gradually, both her mumbling and the glow increased in intensity until Samantha was forced to look away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked back, she saw that Alice had...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the glow gradually died down, Samantha looked back over at Alice. Unfortunately, she still had a slight brightness to her, meaning she couldn't discern whether or not her attempt at casting had succeeded or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well?\" Alice demanded in a voice that sounded a little closer to her own. \"How do I look?\"<br>\r\n \"Um, well... I still can't see you, Lady Alice...\"<br>\r\nAlice huffed, placing her bright arms on her equally bright hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Excuses! You just don't want to complement my new body!\"<br>\r\nSamantha shook her head. <br>\r\n \"No! I mean, you're still glowing slightly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looked down at herself. <br>\r\n \"Oh... Right\".<br>\r\nShe mumbled another few lines, causing her glowing skin to slowly return to its normal hue, starting at the top of her body. Samantha watched curiously, interested to see if Alice could actually rival her sister or if she was just bluffing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice's face was revealed, Samantha found that she might not have been bluffing after all. Gone was her old head, replaced with an exact copy of Alice's. Her blonde hair spiralled down around her shoulders and her icy blue eyes darted around the room. The only irregularity was a pair of crooked glasses that had slid down her petite nose and now rested precariously on the tip of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready impressed by how she had remodelled her face, Samantha was even more impressed when she laid eyes on Alice's torso. During her first life, Alice had not been blessed like her sister. She had had a total of one growth spurt, and even then, it wasn't much of a growth. Her breasts had been a pair of bumps on her chest and her lower body could only have been described as 'boyish'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat description was no longer apt, as Alice had managed to retain the curves of her body's former owner, leaving her with a pair of hefty looking breasts, a set of hips that looked close to surpassing the width of her shoulders and a round backside that wouldn't look out of place on a woman ten years older than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glow eventually disappeared altogether, allowing Samantha to inspect the rest of her body, not that much else had changed. She had lost a good bit of height, bringing her back down to her original less than average height, but that was about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So? You can see me now, right?\" Alice demanded, folding her arms. \"How do I look?\"<br>\r\n \"Exceptional, Lady Alice,\" Samantha answered, looking down at the now eighteen year old girl. \"I see your sister has taught you well\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I am great at magic!\" Alice boasted. \"Can't believe you doubted me! Anyway, these clothes are way too bland for my tastes. Lead me back to my room and help me change, would you?\"<br>\r\n \"But Mistress -\"<br>\r\n \"Is probably still sleeping!\" Alice cut in. \"It won't take that long! Plus, I'm not asking. You come with me and you help me, or I complain to Aurelia. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded and headed for the door. Alice followed, but not before giving her new chest a loving squeeze. <br>\r\n \"This new body is great...\" She mumbled to herself. \"I'm glad that spell actually worked...\" </span></div></div>",

Having been present for many spells cast by her Mistress, she had picked up on certain things that indicated whether or not the spell would be successful. When Alice had started to cast, she had struck the wrong pose and mispronounced a good few words. How that would affect her spell, she didn't know. What she did know was Alice probably wouldn't have the curves she so desired once that glow died down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Alice's shine began to die down, revealing her new form to Samantha. As it did, an amused smile slowly began to spread across her face. She had fully expected something to go wrong, but this? She wouldn't have guessed this would be the result of her errors.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What the hell?! Why do I feel so heavy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had got one part right in that she now looked like herself, with her icy blue eyes and golden curls, but what had went wrong was that she was now a good bit heavier. Nowhere near her sister's size, but she was definitely bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than average breasts had swollen into melons of fat that strained her t-shirt. A bulging gut that made her look pregnant had formed, forcing the hem of the shirt upwards. Her boyish hips and flat backside had grown to strain her pants, which clung tightly to her soft lower body. And finally, her delicate face was now framed by a second chin and pair of plump cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the glow disappeared, silence reigned in the parlour as both Samantha and Alice stared at Alice's body. While Alice wore an expression of pure fury with a hint of embarrassment, Samantha still had her mirthful smirk, however a little pity for her Mistress' sister had crept into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Should I call the Mistress to come and fix this, Lady Alice?\"<br>\r\nSamantha finally broke the growing silence. If it was up to Alice, she'd stand there forever, staring at her plump form with disbelief. Plus, she was still a servant of the house. It was her job to serve both her Mistress and Lady Alice to the best of her abilities. To not offer to help would be shirking her duties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No need, Samantha. I witnessed everything\".<br>\r\nAlice looked up from her belly with a look of pure rage. <br>\r\n \"You!\" She growled, pointing a finger at her sister, whose immense form now filled the doorway. \"You had some part in this! Change me back! Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha stepped aside with a bow as her Mistress strode into the room. Her dress, which had specially designed to fit her massive body, swayed and bounced as she moved towards her plump sister, a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's been so long since we've seen one another, Alice, and you accuse me of this?\" Aurelia said, feigning a look of hurt. \"Why, I would be hurt if it wasn't true! But I can't have anybody thinking they're a more advanced user of magic than me, can I? It wasn't hard to overwrite your clumsy spell. After all, you made so many mistakes while casting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's mouth moved wordlessly as she tried to form a sentence. <br>\r\n \"I didn't... You did... I'm better than... Mistakes?!\"<br>\r\nAurelia nodded. <br>\r\n \"Yes, mistakes. Mispronounced words, incorrect gestures and unfamiliarity with your new body... I could go on, but I won't. Instead, I am going to make you an offer. Admit that I'm the superior caster, and I will give you your body back. If your apology is sufficient enough, I may even give you the curves you've desired all your life. What say you, dear sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice glared at her sister, then at her belly, then back at her sister and finally back at her belly. She let out a huff before responding... </span></div></div>",

I'm just not a good listener. But putting that aside, whoever programmed you must be one hell of a programmer! I mean, you're responding to me staring with irritation! That's just... Wow! And the way you're staring at me right now... Your facial expressions are top-notch! Are your creators listening right now? Can I speak to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma spoke excitedly, seemingly oblivious to the now furious expression decorating the girl's face. As she began to ask about who originally created her, the girl let out a scream, stomping her ghostly foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Enough!\" She yelled, shaking her head. \"I don't even understand half the words you're saying! Just... Shut up, stand there and let me possess you already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma frowned. <br>\r\n \"Possess? Aren't you a projection?\"<br>\r\nThe girl growled in annoyance. <br>\r\n \"For the last time, I don't know what that is! I'm a ghost! You do know what a ghost is, right? Actually, don't answer! I don't care! Stand there, keep quiet and it'll be all over soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization finally hit Emma, who gasped. <br>\r\n \"You're an actual ghost?!\" She yelped. \"That's just as amazing! Would you mind answering a few questions for me? What's it like being dead? Or is that too personal? How about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"SHUT UP!\"<br>\r\nRoaring at the top of her lungs, the girl lunged at Emma, who just about managed to duck under her outstretched arms. Realizing that, perhaps, she wasn't too friendly, Emma decided to finally run for it. Sprinting towards the door, she let out a shocked about as she collided with Samantha, who blocked the door with her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Samantha!\" Emma gasped, rubbing her backside. \"Let me out!\"<br>\r\nSamantha shook her head solemnly. <br>\r\n \"I'm afraid Lady Alice requires a body. And as my spirit already possesses this one, you will have to provide for her. It was a pleasure knowing you, Emma. Now, be a dear and remain still. Lady Alice doesn't like unnecessary exercise\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over her shoulder, Emma screamed as she saw Alice racing towards her. Jumping to her feet, she narrowly dodged her for the second time and ran towards the glass doors leading outside. Yanking the handle, she found that it was locked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come on... Open!\"<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the door did not open. Glancing over her shoulder and then back at the door, Emma took a deep breath before putting her foot through one of the lower panes. It cracked beneath her foot before falling away. Dropping to her knees, Emma quickly crawled through. It led to a patio connected to a set of stairs, which she instantly ran towards. Descending the stairs, she heard an angry yell from the room she had just escaped...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I was so close!\"<br>\r\nAfter watching her potential body escape her grasp, Alice had quickly resorted to throwing a tantrum. However, with her ghostly form, she achieved very little with her punches and kicks. <br>\r\n \"Why didn't you help me, Samantha?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha, who hovered near the door, bowed her head in apology. <br>\r\n \"My apologies, Lady Alice. I will endeavour to be of more use in future encounters\".<br>\r\nAlice crossed her arms unhappily. <br>\r\n \"See that you are. Otherwise, I'll complain to Aurelia.

Hopefully Samantha wouldn't let this one get away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the curtain, Katie yanked the fabric back. A cloud of dust flew into the air, making her jump back. As she did, she saw a hand swipe through the cloud, passing  through the area she had just been standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What the heck?\" Katie exclaimed. <br>\r\n \"Goddamn dust!\"<br>\r\nA desperate wail came from the dust cloud. <br>\r\n \"Samantha! Stop her before she runs away or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of arms wrapped around Katie's torso. <br>\r\n \"Please don't struggle. It'll make it easier on both of us\".<br>\r\nHearing an unfamiliar voice whisper into her ear, Katie shivered. It sounded so familiar, yet so unfamiliar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shock at suddenly being grabbed quickly passed. However, it soon reappeared as a pale figure floated through the dispersing dust cloud, an infuriated look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Finally!\" The figure said. \"You did something right! Now, hold her still!\"<br>\r\nOnce again, Katie's shock passed quickly. She began to struggle against the arms holding her...</span></div></div>",

With a smirk on her face, she grabbed it and pulled hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"AH!\"<br>\r\nHer captor let out a pained yell, her grip loosening enough for Katie to break free from her arms. Ducking underneath an attempt by whoever it was, Katie raced towards the door. Behind her, she heard an angry tut, followed by a brief argument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Idiot!

Two! And both of them were your fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whirled to face Samantha, her face twisted with annoyance and anger. <br>\r\n \"Do you even want me back? Or does seeing me stuck in this room entertain you?\" Alice demanded. \"Because let me tell you something! This room absolutely sucks! Whoever decided it was a great idea to put my portrait in here and then bind me to it should be punished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Actually, I believe Lord Martin is also dead...\" Samantha attempted to say, but she was quickly cut off when Alice growled dangerously. <br>\r\n \"I. Don't. Care! I want him punished! I'll have my sister being his spirit back and then bind it to the most horrific body I can find! Then, I'll slowly torture him until he begs for mercy, at which point I'll have his spirit bound to the servants bathroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice cackled madly. <br>\r\n \"But before I can even do that, I need out of this room!

Clutching at her - or rather, Beth's - skull, she winced as her head began to feel like it was on fire. Her vision went cloudy, and she could feel herself weakening, losing her grip on her new host as her concentration waned. \"No...no it's too soon...\" the Lady of the House growled in frustration as she tried to hold on, but the ache continued to worsen, and soon, she found herself slipping away, back into the recesses of Beth's mind. Beth's ice blue eyes faded back to their original brown as she began to regain control of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what...what happened...\" Beth found herself asking out loud. She looked around the room, realising she was no longer in the master bedroom, but the Kitchen. The scent of food filled the air, and when Beth looked down at the table, she saw a vast array of leftovers and plates that had been picked clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also saw a huge, round, bloated belly sitting in her lap, and screamed. \"WHAT THE HELL?!\" Beth squealed as she grabbed her bulging, pregnant looking stomach to make sure it was real. It was incredibly firm, stuffed to the brim with food, and even a slight jostling caused her great discomfort. She stifled a belch and drew herself upwards, her stomach bumping into the edge of the table, eliciting a groan from the hugely bloated girl. \"Ughhhh what did she do to me? I'm huge!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding upright, Beth looked quite ridiculous, her massive, engorged stomach sticking out beneath her shrunken crop top. She hurriedly unfastened the button of her pants to give herself some more room, letting out a moan of relief as she stomach bulged into the gap she had just created. \"This is so gross,\" she moaned, disgusted with her swollen tummy. \"Screw this place. I'm leaving now before she comes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth waddled clumsily towards the doors, trying not to cause too much discomfort in her hugely bloated belly...</span></div></div>",

It had been relatively warm only a moment ago, but now, she found herself seeing her breath in the air, and rubbing her arms for warmth. Her belly gurgled noisily, and she found herself almost freezing in her tracks before she made it to the door handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this mess yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh God, please nothing else, I can't deal with anyone else.\" </i> Beth thought, closing her eyes at the sound of a voice she did not recognise. She turned around nervously, and found herself looking at a man around her own age; he had an aristocratic face, with extremely dark eyes and ghostly white skin. He was particularly well dressed, in clothing that looked as though it belonged in the same time frame that Aurelia hailed from; an entirely black suit with tails and an expensive looking waistcoat and tie. He was not, Beth thought, nearly as menacing as Aurelia, and even quite good looking. \"Uh...hey,\" she said awkwardly, returning his confused glance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening,\" the man said. \"I ask again, did you make this mess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of...kinda...but I wasn't in control!\" Beth blurted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" the man said, looking unamused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll sound crazy, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man held up a hand, cutting her short. \"No need to explain. I assume, by the state of this table, that Lady Belview forced this feast upon you as another one of her hedonistic experiments. Ghastly woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! That's right!\" Beth said, relieved she didn't have to explain further, if a little worried that this guy seemed to know her tormentor. \"You know her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly,\" he said, shaking his head at the leftovers of the feast. \"My name is Lord Martin Harrison, and I was the owner of this mansion before I was forced to sell it to Lady Belview.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The-the owner...before...\" Beth trailed off as she realised the implication. This guy was another ghost. Though he didn't seem as hostile as the last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, had I not needed the money to continue my research, I would never have agreed to the deal,\" Lord Harrison stepped closer to Beth, not really seeming to notice, or care, about her exposed belly. \"But...needs must. Science required sacrifice, and I am still here, I suppose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Beth said, the only thing she could really think of. She just wanted to leave. But she didn't want to anger this guy either. \"Listen uh...my Lord...could you uh...help me out here? That fat bitch took control of my body, I think she's gone now but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more, my dear,\" Lord Harrison said, linking arms with Beth and leading her out of the room. \"I have performed many an exorcism in my time. Perhaps I can finally trap that wretched woman and reclaim my property.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks...uh...and that will get me my body back?\" Beth asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I am a man of my word, unlike my successor,\" Harrison said pleasantly. \"It's amusing really, had she known I had linked my soul to this house, she probably wouldn't have killed me after we closed our deal. Very short sighted of her. Now, come this way to my laboratory...\"</span></div></div>",

Conversation was practically non-existent as they descended a spiral staircase down a dark corridor alongside the dining room. Beth tackled each step with a slightly moan, feeling the vast amount of food Aurelia had consumed sloshing around in her painfully full tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we nearly there?\" Beth asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, nearly,\" Lord Martin said, turning a corner and heading for a large, iron door at the far end of a new hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth did not like the look of that door, and was beginning to regret coming down here, but so far, her host seemed to be mostly quite reasonable. If he'd wanted to attack her, he could have done so by now. Still, she couldn't help but feel a little nervous. What if Aurelia came back before he could help her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead, the door swung open in front of Martin and he ducked inside. Beth took a deep breath before following him inside, at which point the heavy metal door immediately slammed shut behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind the door,\" Martin said, almost as an afterthought. He crossed the room and waved his hand at a sea of lanterns across the far wall, all of which immediately lit up and illuminated the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth looked around and observed her surroundings; this place was clearly a laboratory, but one quite unlike the modern, clinical environments Beth was used to from school. Instead, various potions were stored in large cabinets along one wall, while other mixtures and serums bubbled away in beakers and strange, monstrous curiosities in glass jars were displayed in a large cupboard behind Beth. She took one look at some creepy looking shrunken heads before moving away from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a woman's voice made Beth jump. She suddenly found herself standing right beside a new arrival; a rather exotic looking woman of stunning beauty. She was clad in a tight black dress which looked to be of the same time period as the Lord's clothes. It accentuated her perfectly round breasts and displayed her plunging cleavage. Her raven hair flowed down to her shoulders, and her eyes were a sparking shade of green. She looked Beth up and down for a moment, then moved to stand beside Martin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, possessed by Aurelia though, I'm afraid,\" Martin said, folding his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, such a pity,\" the woman said. She had a strong accent that Beth couldn't quite place; French maybe? Or Italian?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth, this is my associate, Lady Bella M\u00e9chant,\" Martin said, gesturing to the beautiful woman with a degree of reverence. \"She will be assisting my in the procedure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hey...\" Beth said, feeling even more self conscious as Bella seemed to eye her protruding stomach with disdain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, shall we begin?\" Martin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, darling, let's,\" Bella smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, the two of them raised their arms, and Beth found herself thrown into the air, spinning around helplessly. The food in her stomach sloshed around painfully, and she let out a noisy belch as she flailed around in a panic, immediately regretting her decision to come down here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regrettably, my dear, Lady Belview will not be leaving you any time soon,\" Martin chuckled. \"We have waited some time for her to once again take corporeal form, and we intend to make sure she can never again leave your fragile body.\"</span></div></div>",

It's your fault I'm here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The fault is yours for trusting that serpent, Lord Martin,\"</i> Aurelia bit back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, because of course he would be doing this if I hadn't been possessed by his arch enemy,\" Beth hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We can discuss that later, dear.

Her eyes shifted down to her bulging stomach as she twirled around uselessly in the air, beginning to feel rather queasy. \"I'm not going to let you take over again so you can make me glut myself at that table. Besides, why do you need my permission? You didn't seem to care last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence before Aurelia responded. <i>\"I am...weakened...I was too hasty in indulging before I had grown strong enough to take your body...but I couldn't resist.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth considered for a moment. \"Okay...so...if I let you take over so we can get out of here, you have to promise to leave my body. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hmph, I do not make deals,\"</i> Aurelia said, incredulous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess you're screwed.\" Beth began to spin faster. She felt as though she was about to throw up. She saw Martin and Bella's faces smirking at her, or rather, at Aurelia, as she helplessly writhed around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, very well! I agree to your terms!\"</i> Aurelia finally said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth smiled and relaxed her control over her senses. She wasn't really sure how this was meant to work, but somehow, just thinking about letting Aurelia take over seemed to do the trick. The obese woman's smiling face grew more prominent in her mind, and a long, sinister chuckle escaped her plump lips as Beth surrendered control. Though still able to see what was happening, Beth found that she could no longer control her body. Aurelia was, once again, back in the driver's seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Martin turned to Bella and nodded. \"Begin the experiment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before they could act, Beth suddenly stopped rotating and fell to the floor gracefully, landing on her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop her!\" Martin suddenly cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella raised her hands in a defensive motion, but Aurelia was too quick for her. Raising a hand, she unleashed a blast of energy that sent Lady Bella flying back against the wall. With a satisfied smirk, she spoke inwardly to Beth \"I haven't lost my touch!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just get us out of here quick!\"</i> Beth called back, it was strange to speak and not hear her words coming out of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin was unsheathing a dagger from his belt when Aurelia raised her hand again, lifting him into the air and throwing him against the wall. With a smug cackle, she turned and hurried from the door, locking the door behind her as she ran back up the steps. Beth's stuffed belly jiggled and shook with each step, and Aurelia couldn't help but enjoy the feeling...</span></div></div>",

It was at least 14 inches long and almost as thick as her own wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d Beth cried in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs is my favorite,\u201d Aurelia giggled. \u201cQuickly!

She unbuttoned her tight little short shorts and slipped them down her long legs. Next, Beth grabbed the waist of her lacy pink thong and slid that down. Shamelessly, Beth set to strapping on the monster strap on and fastened it comfortably into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now what?\u201d Beth said impatiently, wiggling her hips and feeling the weight of the strap on sway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait for it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth was about to ask what she meant when a spike of pleasure surged through her.

Charging across the room, she grabbed hold of the door handle and yanked it open, but before she could step outside of the room, she felt something grab hold of her leg. With a sudden tug, Beth's body was thrown up into the air and crashed back down onto the floor. Beth groaned in pain as she struggled to stand, but her legs buckled underneath her and she fell flat on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how rude of you, my dear,\" Aurelia chuckled, her huge form looming over Beth. \"Leaving without saying goodbye.

Aurelia gave her a smug smirk and led her down the stairway into what seemed to be a laboratory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my work station, dear,\" Aurelia smiled, gesturing with open arms to the dimly lit room.

Outside, there was another building next to the house that she hadn't noticed when they first came in. It looked like an old barn, and there was a light on inside! Beth figured this was a good place to start looking. The others had headed off in different directions inside, but nobody had thought to check outdoors, nobody but Beth. It wasn't very often that Beth got one over on her friends; she was often seen as being ditzy and forgetful. She smiled as she imagined the look on her friend's faces when she told them she was the one to find Stacey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping to beat the others outside before they noticed the barn too, Beth ran back down the hallway and out the grand front doors. She heard them creak shut behind her as she headed out into the fog. It was freezing, but her hurried jog held off the cold until she saw the barn up ahead. She could see the bright glow emanating from within as she approached, and she pushed open the heavy wooden door and dashed inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. That sucks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barn was empty. Empty of humans anyway. There were, strangely, a lot of animals around. Who was taking care of them, Beth had no idea. Maybe there was some farmer around here who looked after the house? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Anyone here? Stacey?\" Beth called, but all she heard was an oink from a nearby Pig. \"I guess not.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed, Beth turned went to leave, only to find the open barn door swing shut and slam right in her face. A large wooden plank felt down in front of her with a bang, locking the door right before her eyes. She sighed in annoyance and tried to lift the bar, but it was too heavy. Grunting and groaning, he svelte girl strained to even lift it an inch. It was no good. She wasn't anyway near strong enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit...\" She groaned. \"This backfired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around the barn again, noting that, oddly, some of the animals seemed to have quietened to stare right at her. Most notable, the Cows and the Pigs standing in pens either side of her. </span></div></div>",

About six foot, with sandy blonde hair and chiselled good looks. He also happened to have his shirt off, and was currently walking in carrying a bale of hay under one large bicep. His chest was equally impressive, rock hard abs and toned muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sweet Jesus. </i> Beth gawked at the guy as he approached her with a smile, dumping the hay on the floor before he walked up to greet her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you lost?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth had to compose herself for a moment before she replied. Oh, he was <i>exactly </i>her type. \"Yeah...kind of...I didn't realise anybody still lived here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just look after the animals,\" the guy said with a smile. \"I'm Kyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth was trying very hard not to just stare at his abs. \"I'm Beth,\" she said. \"I was looking for my friend, Stacey.

Sorry, if I'd known you were coming I'd have worn a shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth giggled. \"Oh, don't worry about that...\" she eyed him up very obviously, making her feelings on his exposed chest pretty clear. \"So you...look after the animals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just me, they're like my family really,\" Kyle said, gesturing to the animals to either side of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth laughed. \"Well they certainly don't look much like you.

Of all her friends currently searching for Stacey, she had the smallest bust, but not by much. Carrie had been similarly sized until she had started that new job, leading to her putting on a little weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Beth stared at her bust, her brow furrowed. <br>\r\n<i>They are definitely bigger...</i> She thought in disbelief. <i>But how? And by how much?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her hands, Beth began to figure out her second question by lightly bouncing a breast in each hand. As she did, she began to feel increasingly turned on. She giggled quietly, her gentle bouncing evolving into sensual squeezing, which incited quiet moans from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um...\"<br>\r\nHearing somebody cough, Beth froze, her face turning bright red.

Beth followed behind him slightly, her hands continuing to wander. One kept close to her bust, which had a little more of a bounce to it. The other ran over her hips, which weren't the most womanly. Compared to Emma or even Carrie, Beth's body was the most average, something she had never been too happy about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I mean, decent actresses need decent bodies if they want to get anywhere!</i> Beth though as her hand gently cupped one of her buttocks. <i>Sure, I've got the chest and, while I'm not entirely sure how it happened, it's great!

One hand, still hovering around her breasts, began to play with her nipples while the other began to grope her buttocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a quiet moan escaped Beth's lips, Kyle peeked over his shoulder.

Her backside likewise swelled with fat, tightening her jeans and panties, until she sported a decently sized rear end that would draw more than a few eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow pleasantly plump and oblivious to her sudden expansion, Beth continued to play with herself.

His deep brown eyes looked back at her, causing a dreamy sigh to escape her lips. Beneath her bulging bust, she could feel his muscular chest rising and falling as he breathed, the movements helping to turn her in more. And to top it off, a delicious smell that Beth couldn't quite identify emanated from him, causing her mouth to water...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Soooooo hot...\" Beth murmured, wetting her lips. <br>\r\nKyle didn't answer. Instead, he lowered his head so that it was within reaching distance of Beth's. Slowly, she stood on her toes, rising up to meet him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir lips met. Beth's mind went blank and her body went limp, losing all feeling. She let out a moan as Kyle reciprocated the kiss, his tongue parting her lips and pushing its way into her mouth. In response, her own tongue pushed back, the two pressing against one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a hand wrap around her waist, Beth eyes drooped happily. Kyle's handsome face filled her vision, something she found utterly enthralling. He was such a handsome man...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind empty and body numb, Beth was completely ignorant of the changes now washing over her. On the other hand, Kyle, who was still fully aware of what was happening, watched Beth change more and more with glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plump frame got a little plumper, her top tightening until she practically bursting from it. Her jeans slowly slid down her swelling ass until the waistband had slipped beneath the cheeks, fully exposing her struggling panties and thick rear end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, these weren't the changes he was interested in. His focus was on the ever so slight layer of blonde fuzz covering Beth's body. Beneath his hand, he could feel it growing longer and thicker until her body had a lush layer of blonde fur covering it. From above her naked ass, a long yet thin appendage forced its way through her skin until a whip-like tail reaching down to her ankles swayed lazily in the breeze. And finally, two small horns forced their way through her blonde hair, one of which almost jabbed Kyle in the chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill oblivious to her furry form, Beth continued to kiss Kyle, however her hands, which were still wandering, began to explore Kyle's body. One ran over his chest, brushing against her own hefty breasts and causing the damp spot to widen once again. The other fiddled with the waistband of his trousers, groping around for something specific...</span></div></div>",

Beth's moaned noisily as her hand found his sizeable manhood, which seemed to throb and grow in her grasp. Gawking at him in disbelief, Beth began to drool dumbly, moaning in an almost animalistic manner. \"Youuuu...you're sooooooo biiiiiiiiiiig...\" Beth managed to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The biggest,\" Kyle whispered in her ear, his grin widening as he too let out a groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she scrambled to free Kyle's enormous dick from his pants, Beth found herself being pushed away from his chest. But, rather than Kyle pushing her away, it was her own swelling breasts. The damp patches on her top widened as her enlarged nipples began to not just leak droplets of milk, but actively spurt it out, completely soaking the front of her shirt. While the outpouring of milk seemed to deflate her tits slightly, another growth spurt quickly caused them to start expanding again. Beth's cleavage rose up, her fat nipples popping out of the tops of her tight, lace bra, still leaking all over her. There was a ripping noise as her bloated breasts burst through the useless garment and jiggled free in her increasingly tight crop top, stretching it to it's limits as her bra slipped down and fell out of the bottom of her top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth didn't really register what was happening as she triumphantly unbuckled Kyle's pants and yanked them down eagerly, dropping to her knees and marvelling as his massive, throbbing member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked down at Beth proudly, staring into her huge cleavage, delighting at her completely milk drenched top that now clung to her massive, milk filled breasts. Beth just gazed up at him dumbly, the horns on her head elongated slightly, poking through her blonde hair as she moaned in ecstasy. Before Kyle could really stop to appreciate his work, he felt Beth's hand grasp his cock once again...</span></div></div>",

Biiiiiig...\" She moaned again, her head slowly inching forwards. As she drew closer to her goal, her lips parted eagerly, allowing her tongue to flick out and reach for the stiff rod gripped in one of her hands...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her tongue and Kyle's cock made contact, the owner of each let out moans and groans of pure pleasure. Kyle watched with a grin as Beth hungrily pulled his throbbing member into her mouth, giggling again as she began to suck hard. Kyle shivered with pleasure, his head tilting backwards briefly. He didn't know this girl, but from the way she was handling him, she had obviously done this before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back down at the busty blonde, Kyle's grin widened as he both saw and felt Beth's mouth and nose push outwards from her pleasured face until she sported a large snout. Two floppy blonde ears forced their way through her skull and hair, her human ears retreating back into her head as they appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, Beth remained blissfully oblivious to the animalistic changes overcoming her. She moaned happily as she continued to suck away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from her new face, Beth's breasts continued to swell with more and more milk, quickly replacing what squirted out of her nipples. Her crop top had been reduced to a soaked bra that barely covered the immense globes of fat and milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite the amount of milk produced by her mammaries, her body was apparently unhappy with the amount she was producing. The skin above her crotch took on a light pink hue before swelling outwards, the button on her jeans quickly succumbing to the inflating sack. Four teats pushed their way out of the pink orb, thick milk dropping from each. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting the orb Beth now sported, Kyle chuckled evilly. Not long now, and she would be the newest addition to his farm...</span></div></div>",

He moaned pleasurably as Beth's snout greedily sucked every last drop down, gulping down Kyle's cum with abandon. He just stood there and let her do it, knowing the consequences of her hunger. Closing his eyes, he enjoyed the sensation for a few seconds, then forced himself to look down at the ever changing cow girl he had created. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Beth continued to drink, gulping down what must have been an entire gallon of cum, her body underwent further changes. She was already looking more and more animalistic, but the cum seemed to speed up her transition. As her stomach filled up, her relatively small pot belly bloated out considerably, sending her newly formed teats surging forward. They expanded and thickened as the orb that accompanied took on a more pronounced shape, morphing into a large, prominent udder that flopped out into her lap as she knelt beneath Kyle's huge cock. Her jeans, already halfway down her legs, fell uselessly to the floor, her new udder putting so much pressure on her thong-like panties that they ripped in two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs droplets of milk began to form on her extra teats, her human breasts continued to swell larger still. Her bra-like crop top stretched and groaned as her massive, fleshy tits jiggled around, spurting milk through the fabric and sending it leaking down her bulging stomach. The useless garment gradually began to tear itself apart as it became so small and soaked that it seemed to shrink. With one almighty rip, it burst open, allowing Beth's enormous mammaries to finally burst free with a jiggle. They slapped together noisily, her wet, milk soaked tits swinging from side to side as they were released. Beth let out a muffled moan of pleasure as she finally sucked Kyle dry and pulled her head back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo...mm...mmmoooooooo....good...mmmmoooooooooo....\" She moaned dumbly, not even sure what she was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow completely naked, she could only stare up in wonder at Kyle as he looked down at her, smiling with an almost proud look on his handsome face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth was still recognisable as her old self, despite her changes. Her pretty face and beautiful features were still visible, despite her large, floppy ears and snout. But her body had plumped up considerably, with most of her weight seeming to settle in her massive, milk filled breasts and bloated udder. Her ass formed a large cushion which she now sat back on comfortably, while her once flat stomach was now a round, full, pot belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so beautiful,\" Kyle said, running his hand through Beth's messy blonde hair. </span></div></div>",

M-Mooooooo... Bea-Beautiful...\"<br>\r\nKyle nodded and grinned at Beth's halting attempts to speak normally. He ruffled her hair again, causing the chubby girl to moo happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But...\"<br>\r\nHe suddenly kneeled down so he was face to face with his new cowgirl. <br>\r\n \"You could be even more beautiful,\" He suggested. \"How about it? You could be the most beautiful bovine in my collection!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind so suppressed by lust, Beth didn't even register the fact that Kyle had just called her a bovine. She nodded eagerly, her breasts bouncing and sending flecks of milk across Kyle's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"B-Beautiful!\" Beth repeated with her another dumb giggle. <br>\r\n \"Okay then! Just do what you do best!\"<br>\r\nGetting back to his feet, Kyle looked down at his cock and then at Beth. Beth didn't get the hint, just staring up at him with her mouth agape slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Kyle stroked his dick with one of his hands while gently guiding her gaze to it with the other. Upon seeing it, Beth's eyes lit up, an ecstatic moo escaping her mouth. She pushed aside Kyle's hand, quickly replacing it with her own furry one. Slowly, she began to stroke it, laughing as she felt it harden in her grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was fully stiff, she shuffled closer to the throbbing rod so her massive milky tits practically engulfed it. Pushing it between her breasts, Beth began to massage and knead them, moaning as milk shot out from her thick nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilarly, Kyle groaned with pleasure. With the sheer size and surprising softness of her bust, this was much more pleasurable and much more effective than her blowjob. After about half a minute, he managed f get out a grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm about to cum...\"<br>\r\nEven with her animalistic mindset, Beth knew what this meant. Lowering her head, she keep his dick between her breasts but angled herself so the head poked out the top. Taking the head in her mouth, she licked it in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slight tongue touch was all Kyle needed. He groaned with pleasure as his cock exploded again. And once again, Beth hungrily sucked down every single drop, causing another change for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer already pudgy body rapidly filled with fat. Her belly swelled outwards, quickly becoming an orb of pure flab that day atop her swollen udder. Her breasts grew rounder and rounder, pressing against both Kyle's legs and Beth's chins. Her ass spread across the ground beneath her as it grew, causing her to rise in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring down at the obese cowgirl, Kyle chuckled as she fumbled with her flabby tits, struggling to remove his now flaccid cock. Helping her out, he stepped backwards, shoving it back into his pants and zipping them up, which caused a whimper of disappointment from the lust-addled Beth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Perhaps later,\" He said teasingly , causing her eyes to light up. \"But for now, let's get you home...\"<br>\r\nTaking her by the hand, Kyle yanked her to her feet, her body swaying hypnotically in the process...</span></div></div>",

Beth stumbled forward clumsily, unused to her new size. Her legs almost buckled as her swollen udder and bloated gut threatened to drag her back down to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Kyle was strong enough to hold her up, cupping his hands underneath her heaving, milk filled tits to keep her upright, he led her forwards, enjoying the sight of her huge, chubby figure jiggling and swaying with each step. She had gained at least one hundred to one hundred and fifty pounds during her transformation, and was probably feeling even bigger due to vast amount of milk her body was producing. There was little trace of the slender, toned girl who had first entered the barn only half an hour ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-moooooooooooo...where are we...moooooo...going?\" Beth asked, barely registering what was happening as her mind slipped away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhere you can rest up,\" Kyle said, giving her breasts a playful squeeze and allowing her to release a little milk to lighten her load. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth gave a moan as her tits spurted forth a stream of milk, continuing her plod towards the far side of the barn, where there were several large pens awaiting her. Barely noticing them, she just waddled in the direction Kyle was pointing her. His muscular arms steered her heavy, chubby body towards the larger of the pens, and gently pushed open the gate before helping her inside. Beth stumbled a little and had to have some help from Kyle before she sat herself wide ass down on a bale of hay nearby, her fat belly filliping her lap and pressing down on her udder, which began to leak large droplets of milk from the sudden pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, stay here until I get back,\" Kyle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-where are yoooooooouuu going?\" Beth managed to ask, her new snout muffling her word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not far,\" Kyle smiled and pet her on the head, ruffling her long blonde hair. \"You should milk yourself before you get too big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth looked at him in confusion, still not really aware of what had happened to her. \"M-milk?\" She asked as Kyle closed and locked the gate behind him, leaving her question unanswered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, he got you too, huh?\" A voice said from behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Beth turned her head to see...</span></div></div>",

Either way, they had six  flabby breasts, the bottom pair of which rested atop a hefty pink gut. Her face was round and adorned with three chins. Aside from the roundness, a pink snout and two floppy ears adorned her pink face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with this pig-human hybrid, Beth did one of the few things her mind still allowed her to. <br>\r\n \"Moooooo?\"<br>\r\nThe pig frowned. <br>\r\n \"Or maybe you're further gone than I am... You're definitely bigger than I am. Let's see... How about a name? I'm Amelia. Amy for short\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth's mind worked slowly, but she managed to work out what the girl was asking. <br>\r\n \"B-Beth... Where is this...\"<br>\r\nAmy let out a relieved sigh. <br>\r\n \"Thank goodness... You're still somewhat mentally competent. The last girl I was bundled in with got worse by the hour, until all she could do was say 'Baa' over and over again. Anyway, as for where we are, we are in a barn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy got to her feet, her naked body bouncing from the movement. Each breasts jostled and jiggled as she made her way to Beth, planting her soft ass down into the hay next to her. <br>\r\n \"And in case you didn't notice, we're both animal hybrids!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth stared dumbly at her new pen-mate, her mind working overtime to decipher the words again. <br>\r\n \"Animal hybrids?\" She finally answered. \"So yoooooou are actually a pig?\"<br>\r\nAmy nodded. <br>\r\n \"So... What am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, that's easy. You're a cow!

You need help milking them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"M-Milk?\"<br>\r\nOnce again, Beth uttered the word with confusion. Most of what Any was saying didn't make much sense to her. She was a cow? Hadn't she always been a cow? And milk? She didn't always make milk, did she? No... She didn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching her head with both hands, Beth let out a long moo. <br>\r\n \"Yeah, most people react like that. But we need to milk you soon. Otherwise, that's going to get really uncomfortable and painful for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked between her udder and breasts, both of which seemed noticeably filled than when she had first entered the pen. Beth also looked down at her bust, which filled the entirety of her vision. They did feel a little weird...</span></div></div>",

It didn't take much stimulation for Beth to start leaking a large stream of milk from her elongated nipples. Amy recalled going through this process for a few other girls. Of course, back then, she had been much slimmer and a little less sluggish in her movements. Continuous feedings and Kyle's abilities had rendered her once slender body fat and cumbersome, making her movements much slower than they used to be. None the less, she persisted with milking the Cow girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth grunted as Amy's hands squeezed and massaged her huge, flabby breasts. Milk exploded in all directions, spurting from Beth's engorged nipples and soaking the floor of the pen, coating the bales of hay stacked around the two girls and covering Amy from head to toe. The Pig girl didn't didn't mind; she had been through this plenty of times, and since Kyle didn't provide them with a milking machine of their own, you had to get a bit messy to get the job done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooooooooooooooooo!\" Beth moaned, her groans becoming deeper and more bovine-like. \"Moooooooooore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy did as requested and pushed her entire weight into the next squeeze, causing an enormous amount of milk to blast straight into Amy's face. The Pig girl gave a porcine squeal - something she tried to avoid doing if possible - and couldn't help but open her mouth and gulp a little of Beth's milk down. As Beth's tits began to deflate, Amy grabbed hold of her bloated udder and began working her extra nipples, tugging and squeezing to try and shrink it down to a more manageable size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, how much did he put in you?\" Amy grunted, her fingers beginning to ache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooooooo!\" Beth moaned again, her eyes closed, her tongue hanging out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly there,\" Amy said, wiping the milk from her face before giving the udder another large squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth screamed in ecstasy as one final explosion rocked her entire body, emerging with such force that Amy was knocked back onto her ass with a loud squelching noise. Beth's udder gradually shrank down, her breasts following suit, leaving her looking much less full, though no less chubby. For the first time, she made a human sounding groan, and opened her eyes to see Amy's face looking up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what...oh God...oh my God...\" Beth put her hands over her exposed breasts, but was so alarmed by their size that she pulled them back, staring down at her enhanced tits, and seeing her bulging stomach just beneath them. Wincing, she grabbed her soft, doughy stomach and shrieked. \"Is this real?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're you again,\" Amy said, trying to shake some of the milk from her naked body. \"Yeah, it's real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth screamed. She suddenly remembered it all. Kyle's advances. Her growing breasts. Her clothes tearing and ripping. Her stomach bloated and bulging. She screamed as her hands travelled to her face, feeling the large snout and pointed horns atop her bow. \"Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!\" She wailed. \"Change me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...can't do that,\" Amy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth moaned, but her moan turned into another \"Moo\" and she clasped her hands over her mouth and sobbed quietly. \"I don't want to be a cow,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe we can fix that...\" Amy said, placing a consoling hand on Beth's thick leg. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weeping silently into one of her fur covered hands, Beth reluctantly looked down at her body and the owner of the chubby pink hand resting atop one of her thighs. Compared to Amy, she seemed to be slightly fatter, however Amy did have six hefty breasts attached to her torso while Beth only had two, albeit both produced copious amounts of milk. Her belly was definitely bigger, no doubts about that, with Amy sporting a rounded potbelly and Beth struggling with a full globe of fat. And as for asses, Beth once again pulled ahead slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So, Amy...\"<br>\r\nBeth finally spoke, wiping tears from her snout as she did. <br>\r\n \"You've been here longer than me, right? Had anyone managed to escape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Beth had called herself down, Amy removed her hand and scooted backwards slightly. <br>\r\n \"I hate to say it, but I don't think so. Kyle does come in every so often and remove people... animals... whatever they are whenever they've completely lost their minds and been reduced to something that can only make animal noises. What he does with them, I don't know and, honestly, I don't want to think about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy shuddered. After a moment's thought, Beth realized what she was going on about. If he was taking people who were finished transforming, was he then running a farm with them somewhere? Like, milking the cow girls and slaughtering the pig girls for bacon? Or was it slightly more perverted than that? He did seem to enjoy her... company... even though she was a cow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Feeding Time!\"<br>\r\nA familiar voice echoed throughout the barn, which had been silent up to that point. Now, it erupted in various animal calls with a few demands for freedom thrown in. Beth was tempted to join in for calling for freedom, but Amy held her back, tugging on one of her furry arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't try it,\" She warned. \"Otherwise he'll take you away to accelerate your changes. It's what happened to my last pen mate. She was really rebellious and tried to attack him when he came to feed us. Obviously, he didn't like that and took her away for a few hours. When she came back, she was not the person that initially left this pen. She was plumper, her wool was thicker, she couldn't remember her own name... She couldn't even speak anymore! So, for now, go along. We'll come up with some sort of plan to get out, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth nodded reluctantly. She was already fat and furry enough. <br>\r\n \"How are my favourite girls doing, huh? I see you've been milked. Thanks for helping with that. Doubt she could be done it on her own!\"<br>\r\nLooking towards the door, Beth saw Kyle leaning on it, a grin on his face. He looked between the two before reaching down and picking up two heavy buckets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anyway, it's feeding time. For the pig, we have the finest slop and for the cow, we've got the finest mixture of fresh grass and delicious corn! Enjoy!\"<br>\r\nTipping the two buckets into two separate troughs, he marched off, humming a tune that sounded suspiciously like Old MacDonald's Farm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls eyed their dinner with disgust. <br>\r\n \"I assume we don't eat that?\" Beth asked. <br>\r\n \"You assumed correctly,\" Amy answered. \"Althought it does looked rather good today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's stomach growled loudly, which set off Beth's stomach. Looking between the trough and then the other girl, the duo found themselves crawling towards the full trough. As she drew closer, the heavenly scent of freshly cut grass filled Beth's snout, which only made her stomach more demanding. Next to her, Amy obviously picked up the same divine scent from her own meal, a quiet squeal escaping her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in front of their respective troughs, the girls looked down at their meals, mouths watering and stomachs growling...</span></div></div>",

Like an actual salad or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with her stomach grumbling Beth pushes herself away from the trough and turns to her piggish companion. \"Well this stuff does not even look good at-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth releases a gasp that sounded faintly like a moo as she looks at Amy, her entire face shoved into the trough , an oink released every so often as a gasp of air as she continues to gorge herself on the slop in front of her. Beth see Amy's stomach extend the slightly giving a slight sheen in the faint light as her multiple breasts seemingly grow along with her ass. Her arms seem the tad shorter as well but that could be a trick of the light, at least Beth hopes for Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth can only stare at disbelief as Amy finishes the sloop and moves to the pile of grass. Pigs would eat anything and though Beth knew that, a part of her did not want to see Amy degrade herself so she manages to  speak, \"Amy, stop it! Stop eating! <b>NOW!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's eyes widen as if just realizing what she is doing as she spits out the green grass in front of her before sitting on her slightly bigger fleshier rump. Amy gasps for air as she nods toward Beth, thanking her silently for stopping her. In that moment Kyle returns to check things over. He stares into Amy's trough and nods, as if expecting it to be cleaned out. He also seems to be hardly surprised to see Beth\u2019s still full one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not surprising in the least. You must still be full from your meal <i>earlier</i>.\" Though Kyle keeps a straight professional face, Beth can note a slight mockery to it. She knows what Kyle is talking about and a slight flush comes across her face.\"Well I'll just leave this here in case one of you gets hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Kyle leaves and closes the barn doors behind him the barn quiets down, whispering and the sound of animal noises intermix as some fall asleep after their meal. The sound of some duos squealing and groaning with pleasure enter Beth's ears making her groan in disgust as she trails away from the troughs with Amy to the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god you stopped me. The food here changes you, not as quickly, but enough to make it slightly noticeable.\" Amy says as she reaches out to some hay, her pink arms extending fully but just not enough to reach with a snort like sigh the pig girl continues, \u201cAs you can see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that means I cannot eat even a bit?\" Beth asks as her large stomach grumbles. She looks down at the hay. While she normally would dislike it, there might be no choice but to eat the the hay here. \"Even the hay here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle has it all thought out unfortunately. The water as I can tell is not thankfully.\" Amy confirms with a nod as she wipes her face with her pink arm and points to the nearby trough filled to the brim with water. \"The stuff is addictive as well so even if you try to restrain yourself...well you saw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth can only shiver as she realizes how doomed everyone, including herself, truly is. There can only be so long anyone could go without food for so long. Will she soon be like Amy, hoarding all the food into her mouth and losing herself physically and mentally?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways....\" Amy trails off as if hesitating...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He has to rely on something to recharge him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Recharge like...batteries?\" Beth asked, confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like...magic...I guess?\" Amy shrugged. \"Apparently he only does it about once a week, but I've no idea when.

I don't want to go home like this!\" Beth moaned, picking up her udder for emphasis and dropping it back down, causing some of the milk still underneath to squelch noisily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if we can change like this, we can change back, right? Besides, that house is crazy. We just need to find someone to help us, not everyone there can be a crazy sociopath right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome distance away, Kyle was standing  in the fog covered field beside the Barn. He had re-dressed after his earlier seduction of Beth, and was watching some of his fully transformed victims amble around the field, struggling to remember what their names had been before they changed. After a while, it became difficult to tell who was who. He was very impressed with his newest acquisition though; Beth was gorgeous, even more so in her half transformed state. He planned to keep her like that for a while, at least, while he could still enjoy it. She made a stunning hybrid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft footsteps alerted Kyle to the presence of another, and he turned to see the black suited figure of Lord Martin approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord,\" he bowed, mockingly. \"You're late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your tone, boy,\" Martin replied, folding his arms behind his back. \"What have you to report? More of your wasteful dalliances, I assume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's handsome face curled into a frown. \"We had a deal, you and me, you stay out of my business, and I stay out of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't even know what my business is,\" Lord Martin rolled his eyes. \"Do not presume to dictate the terms of our agreement to me. You have failed to provide a single, decent test subject. The milk is useful, but not one of your girls has successfully mastered metamorphosis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a good feeling about some of my new ones,\" Kyle protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, we shall see,\" Martin said. \"Until then. I have decided to withdraw your recharge of magic this week. Perhaps that will motivate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?!\" Kyle raged. \"How the hell can I work without it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use your initiative,\" Martin smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle might have punched the Lord in the face, but he turned on his heel and walked away, disappearing into the mists. Kyle growled angrily. He hadn't been without his powers for so long...this was going to be hard.</span></div></div>",

Neither girl had any idea if this plan would work, and Beth had taken some convincing, but eventually they had decided to try and get away. The key element to their strategy was, embarrassingly, their size. Though Kyle was muscular, both Beth and Amy was considerably heavy right now, and they were confident they could at least stun him for long enough to make good on their escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do you think he's coming back?\" Amy asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth, her enlarged ears listening to something in the distance, waved at Amy to be quiet. The pig gave a disgruntled oink, then covered her snout to silence herself. \"I can hear footsteps...get into position!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy waddled over to one side of the paddock, and Beth the other. The pig girl and the cow girl waited anxiously as the footsteps drew closer, and, with an ominous creak, the gate to their paddock swung open. Kyle stepped inside, glancing around until he laid eyes on Amy. \"What are y-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle didn't have time to finish the sentence before Amy charged at him with her full weight, crashing her huge, pink gut into his chest. Kyle stumbled back, taken off guard by the sudden display of defiance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you think you're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooooooooooooo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle turned, aghast, as Beth charged at him next, shoving him to the floor and knocking the wind out of him. As soon as he was down, Amy swung her thick leg back and kicked him squarely in the stomach. Kyle let out a cry of pain, and she went back for another kick, but Beth quickly grabbed her by the arm and yanked her out of the paddock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to go now!\" Beth cried, waddling as fast as she could with her enlarged breasts and udder swinging from side to side. Amy followed her lead and hurried after her, her chubby body jiggling as she struggled to keep up with Beth's slightly quicker pace. The half transformed women puffed and panted as their expanded figures struggled to break into a sprint, but the sheer adrenaline from their successful escape kept them going until they were free of the barn...</span></div></div>",

Beth was about to turn back and retrace her steps when she heard a high pitched giggle echo through the trees. Freezing in her tracks, she scanned the area once again, but saw nobody. She did, however, see a small plume of smoke rising from what appeared to be a wooden Cabin a few yards up ahead. She was hesitant about approaching someone else after her experience with Kyle, but perhaps they could help her? Perhaps it was Amy hiding out? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth might have thought harder about this normally, but her mind was still a little foggy, so she impulsively made her decision and started to make her way toward the cabin. Her heavy breasts ached, and her swollen udder slapped against her thick thighs as she walked. She felt absolutely exhausted after all that running, and her chubby belly jiggled constantly. She felt so huge now. It was gross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really giving much thought to the fact that she was completely naked, Beth knocked the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, it was pulled open, revealing a curious looking woman who might have been a few years older than Beth. She had long, silver hair and sharp, angular features. Her eyes were a piercing purple colour, and she was wore a long, black dress which reached down to the floor. \"Oh...a visitor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can I come in? Sorry...I know how this must look,\" Beth asked, looking up at the slender woman anxiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the woman seemed completely unfazed. \"Of course you can dear, I can tell that Kyle has been up to his old tricks. What a mess. Come in, quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth hurried inside as fast as she could, feeling her plump behind brush against the wooden door frame. \"I'm Beth,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Alexis,\" the silver haired woman said. \"Have a seat dear, let me get you something to cover up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth breathed a sigh of relief and looked around for a seat. In the far corner of the room was a large, wooden chair which, thankfully, looked big enough to house Beth's enormous behind. She settled down into the chair, which creaked under her weight. Beth just wanted this nightmare to be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis soon returned with a large, purple silk sheet, which she draped over Beth's exposed form. Now that she was covered up, Beth suddenly felt a lot more comfortable. \"Thanks,\" she said, exhaling slowly as she pulled the sheet up over her breasts and tied it around her chunky, rotund body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy to help,\" Alexis smiled, seating herself in a much smaller chair opposite the cow girl. \"So, what can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh...I was actually just looking for somewhere to hide in case that psycho finds me again,\" Beth explained. \"I had a friend with me, but she disappeared on the way here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that's not good,\" Alexis said, shaking her head. \"These woods are dangerous if you don't know them well. Fortunately, you found the perfect Witch to be your guide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-witch?!\" Beth stammered, suddenly feeling rather nervous again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" Alexis giggled. \"Don't worry though. I'm a good witch, mostly...maybe I can do something to help change you back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth's eyes lit up. \"Oh my god, yes! Yes please! I can't take much mooooooooooooore of this body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, elongating your M-words...looks like your mind is slipping again, we better get started,\" Alexis rose from her chair and crossed to a table on the other side of the room, where Beth could see a few bubbling cauldrons and pots. </span></div></div>",

Hurrying as fast as she could, Beth moved clumsily through the dense brush ahead, pushing aside plants and shrubs and large branches as she tried to squeeze her chubby, bloated form through the dense woods. Hearing a porcine squeal, she veered off to the right, following the noise until she finally parted two large bushes and found herself peering down into what seemed to be a thick, green swamp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth turned her sensitive nose up at the smell, and pulled her purple sheet tighter across her swollen, cow-like body. Her heavy tits ached after that attempt at running earlier, and they jiggled ominously with each step. She sighed and looked down into the pool ahead, seeing the her familiar half-pig, half-woman companion guzzling from what appeared to be a large, boiling pot in the centre of the swamp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy!\" Beth called, gently descending the small hill in front of her to get a better look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth?\" Amy turned around, wiping her mouth with her arm. \"Oh my god, I thought I'd lost you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing down here?\" Beth asked. \"Where did you go?! I've found someone who can change us back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have? That's amazing!\" Amy stood up and turned to face Beth. As she rose from the swamp water, Beth saw that her stomach was incredibly bloated, stuffed full of whatever it was she had been devouring from that pot. She belched noisily and rubbed her bloated, pink belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that stuff? What have you been doing here?\" Beth asked, not daring to enter the swamp herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy massaged her full belly. \"Ugh...I know I shouldn't have, but I could smell this stuff a mile away, and I just found myself drawn here. God, I haven't stopped eating it. I don't know what it is, but it tastes amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, you're belly is huge! How much did you have? We need to try and stay moving if we are going to find the ingredient the witch needs,\" she held up the piece of paper Alexis had given her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't eat <i>URRRRP </i>that much...\" Amy blushed, but from the extra pounds that had been added to her body since Beth last saw her, she definitely had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we need to get moving,\" Beth said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy took a longing look back at the pot...then back to Beth...</span></div></div>",

This time, Beth followed her gaze, her eyes locking firmly into the bubbling pot. She had to admit, whatever it held definitely smelt real good. Surely a look wouldn't hurt, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of Amy's hand, which allowed the half human to waddle back to the pot, Beth followed her. Upon reaching it, she peeked in and immediately turned her snout up in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You were eating slime?!\" Beth tried to ask, but Amy didn't answer. She had already dropped to her knees next to the pot and was hungrily scooping handfuls of the thick looking slime into her mouth. Beth watched do so before her own stomach grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>Well... It's not the weirdest thing I've seen today</i>, Beth thought, kneeling next to the pot. Letting go off her robe, which fluttered down into the mud, she leaned over and cautiously scooped up a handful of the sludge. Giving it a quick sniff, Beth licked a tiny bit off her hand. As soon as it touched her tongue, she almost retched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This tastes awful!</i> Beth thought, staring at the goop. <i>Like... mud or something! But... It's kinda...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another lick, Beth found that it didn't taste nearly as bad. Another lick, and she found herself actually enjoying it. Shoving her hand into her mouth, she licked her hand clean before letting out a satisfied belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay... That actually wasn't too bad</i>, she thought, staring at the thick liquid. <i>Maybe a little more wouldn't hurt...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her head down, Beth began to use her tongue to greedily shovel slime into her mouth. As it was slime, she didn't have to waste time chewing it, meaning she could ferry as much as she could into her mouth without worrying about choking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh... Soooo... Goooooood...</i> Beth thought as she continued her gluttonous stuffing. <i>I can see what... Amy was talking aboooout!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Beth gorged herself, her body began to grow. Specifically, her udder began to fill, growing tighter and fuller with every swallow. Next to her, Amy's pink form was gradually growing as she too stuffed herself silly with the goop...</span></div></div>",

She pulled back and made a \"eurghhh\" noise as she licked her lips, before turning to see Amy still snuffling around the pot with her snout. When they had first met, Amy had been the voice of reason; resisting her animalistic changes and cautioning Beth against eating the slop Kyle was serving up, but now, Beth could see her giving in to her inner pig. Since scoffing down the contents of the pot - nearly twice as much as Beth - Amy had definitely grown more pig-like. Her pot belly had grown considerably, and her thighs and arms had gotten thicker, while her skin was becoming a much pinker shade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, Amy, you've really fattened up,\" Beth gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy pulled her more pronounced snout out of the pot and looked down at her globular gut. \"Oh man...all that slime...ugh...I didn't realise, it tasted so good...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth looked down at her own stomach, which wasn't far behind. She had really glutted herself on the slime too, and her furry stomach bulged and groaned beneath her hands. Her udder had inflated once again, and was hanging, incredibly full, between her legs. She resisted the urge to moo noisily as it swung back and forth. \"We need to hurry before we...we...mooo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you're losing yourself again,\" Amy said, taking Beth by the arm and leading her out of the swamp, tramping the purple sheet Beth had been using to cover herself into the mud. \"We need to hurry, come on, where was this flower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth fumbled for the map, but realised she had dropped it in the swamp. \"I...I lost it...\" she said, absent mindedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well, I think I got a look at it,\" Amy said, already sweating from the exertion of pulling Beth around. \"I think it was down this hill here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth was having difficult concentrating. Her huge, heavy udder slapped against her meaty thighs, and her full stomach groaned and churned with each step she took. Amy was holding onto her, but the pig girl's stomach kept knocking against her own, causing her bloated breasts to jiggle uncontrollably. She felt so tired and achy, and her mind was beginning to fog over again. But she was sure Amy was right, they were heading the right way, at least...</span></div></div>",

As she waddled on, Amy gently pulling at her arm to keep her on track, she could make out more distinct voices nearby. She stopped suddenly, looking around for the source of the noises, and the sudden jerk to a halt was enough to cause Amy to lose her footing and crash into her oversized rear. Before she knew it, Beth had lost her balance, and found herself clumsily toppling down a hill, her plump, expanded body practically rolling down the slope before crashing onto the ground in front of a wooden cabin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy hurried down after her, puffing and panting, her naked, pinkish body sweating profusely. \"Beth! Beth are you <i>oink </i>okay?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth drew herself up, letting out a pained \"Moooooooooooo...\" in response to Amy's question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices from the cabin were growing louder now, and Beth found herself drawn towards them, staggering forward clumsily as she made her way towards the wooden structure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth! No!\" Amy called, before forcing herself to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth slowly ascended a set of wooden steps until the voices were right beside her, then saw that the source of the noises were three girls sitting in a hot tub. Slowly, she moved forward until she was standing right behind the bubbling tub, and all three of the girls slowly turned to face her half transformed, naked body as she gazed dumbly at the tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...is that girl watching us?\" One of the girls asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sure that's a cow, look at the fur you idiot,\" said the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I don't think it's either...she looks...weird...\" said the third girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all slowly rose from the tub and stepped out. The third girl, the one looking the most concerned, stepped out first, revealing a head of red hair and a slender body clad in a purple two piece bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl followed her, equally slender, but with more curves; large breasts and an ample behind. Her dark, raven hair reached down to her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girl, looking particularly freaked out, was wearing a one piece swimsuit which accentuated her plump belly and curves. Her short, cropped blonde hair around her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls approached, Amy appeared behind Beth, freaking them out even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, come away from her!\" the second girl said, pulling her red headed friend back as she approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure she's harmless, Allyson,\" the red head replied. \"No need to hide over there, Katie, geez...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curvy girl inched forward a little, arms folded defensively over her chest. \"These two don't look...right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth opened her mouth to speak, but instead just stood there for a moment in silence. Amy pushed forward, her less human features seeming to disturb the girls even more. \"Please...excuse her...she's...not feeling good at the moment. We could do with somewhere to wash up if you don't us using your bathroom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're certainly not using the hot tub,\" Allyson snapped. \"What the hell is wrong with you two? Why do you have a...a  snout?! This is so weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy self consciously covered her face with a pink hand. \"Look, it's hard to explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're turning into animals!\" Katie blurted out. \"Oh God...I can't believe I said that...this is freaking me out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just go inside,\" Lucy suggested kindly. \"You can get cleaned up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankyou!\" Amy spluttered, almost in disbelief, before dragging Beth into the cabin with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had gone, Lucy turned to the others, who were just staring after the two animal-girls in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell did you just those freaks inside?!\" Allyson demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they just looked like they needed help,\" Lucy replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But did you see them? See their faces?! This is some weird shit,\" Katie said frantically. </span></div></div>",

Amy just about managed to stay upright and not fall down with her, but the strain was starting to take it's toll on her out of shape body. She pulled the moaning Beth back to her feet and dragged her forwards into the bathroom, where she quickly bolted the door behind them and ushered the moaning cow-girl towards the bath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Amy panted. \"In the bath you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moo?\" Beth looked from Amy to the bathtub, but after a second or two, seemed to take Amy's point and climbed into the tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped inside, Amy saw that Beth's feet had undergone further changes, which maybe explained why she was finding it so difficult to walk now. Her once dainty toes had thickened and merged together, giving her the beginnings of a cow's hooves. Her tail whipped around as she sank down into the tub, her enlarged butt gradually squeezing into a sitting position which was ill suited to her size. Her udder was squeezed between her thick thighs and squashed by her heavy, chubby gut, immediately causing milk to begin gushing out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that saves time I guess,\" Amy shrugged. She took a step forward, planning to give Beth a helping hand, but caught sight of her face in the bathroom mirror and stopped to gaze at her reflection, barely recognising the chubby, pig-like features she now possessed. God, she was so big now, so fat and piggish. She reached up to touch her face and saw that her fingers were thickening considerably, beginning to change into what resembled trotters. She gave a quiet moan and pushed the thought out of her mind, before moving to Beth's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooooooooooo!\" Beth groaned as her hands began to work her swollen udder, squeezing clumsily and shooting jets of milk all over the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy shielded herself from a sudden blast which coated her four jiggling breasts, which she wiped off with a nearby towel. The residual milk soaked into her pink skin, causing her nipples to swell a little larger and eliciting a pleasured moan which turned into a porcine squeal. \"Beth, stop, you're making a mess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooooo...\" Beth replied, squeezing harder, the bathtub gradually filling up around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sank to her knees, her heavy belly bulging against the side of the tub as she reached forwards and starting helping Beth. The two of them worked furiously to get as much milk out of Beth's massively swollen udder as possible. Milk flew in all directions, coating the walls, floor and ceiling, and completely filling the tub. When they were finished, Beth fell back, exhausted, her body now submerged in a bathtub filled with her own milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...how do you feel?\" An exhausted Amy panted as she sat with her back against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can think again...\" Beth said, sighing happily as she moved her hand through the milk that now surrounded her. \"Oh God...this is so gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lotta milk,\" Amy said, her own body dripping with the same juices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda comfy though,\" Beth said. \"I wonder if it's good for my skin...or my fur...or whatever I have now...\" She moved her hand along her wet, furry stomach, past her bloated breasts and back down to her deflated udder. </span></div></div>",

Me and Lucy can share a room and you two can have mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really <i>oink </i>kind of you,\" Amy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy ushered the girls into her room, while Katie prepared some blankets and bedding for them. Beth clambered onto the bed and tried to make herself comfortable, but her swollen breasts and udder kept getting in the way. Amy, used to sleeping in worse conditions than this, lay down quite comfortably on the bedding Katie had placed on the floor. Exhausted after their long day, the girls didn't take to fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone else had gone to bed, Allyson finally emerged from the bathroom. Three showers later, she was finally feeling clean of that disgusting milk the cow-girl had sprayed all over her. Having scrubbed herself clean, she dumped her soaked clothes in the trash and wrapped a towel around herself, heading back to her room to change into her night clothes. She couldn't believe what had happened, and, if she had heard right, Lucy had been stupid enough to ask those two mutants to stay the night. Unbelievable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson walked back to her room and discarded the towel, taking a moment to admire her slender, toned body in the mirror before grabbing a pair of shorts and a tube top from her bedside table. She was just about to climb into bed when heard a noisy rumbling coming from her stomach. Placing her hand on her flat stomach, she realised she had not eaten since lunchtime, and decided to go grab something while the others were asleep. She planned to spend the rest of this trip hauled up in her room anyway. There was no way she was going back out there in the morning with those two weirdos lurking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly walking back out to the kitchen, Allyson moved to the fridge, which was heavily stocked with food they had brought with them, or rather, that Katie had brought. Katie had a much larger appetite than Allyson and Lucy combined, though Allyson had noticed, with some disdain, that Lucy herself had gotten a little curvier since college. It seemed like she was the only one who had maintained her figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't exactly much in the way of healthy food in the fridge, apart from some salad Lucy had packed, so Allyson grabbed a bowl of pasta that had been leftover from the night before. Dumping the bowl on the kitchen counter, she grabbed a fork and started picking at it. Her stomach growled, still protesting, and she found herself becoming surprisingly hungry the more forkfuls she ate. Idly, she kept going until she heard the fork clang against the bowl. Looking down in surprise, she saw she had finished off every bite, and yet, she didn't feel full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, guess there wasn't as much left over as we thought,\" Allyson said, placing the empty bowl in the sink before hearing her stomach rumble again. \"Maybe just some chips or something to top it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson opened up the cupboard and took out a large bag of nachos Lucy had packed, then started popping them into her mouth. As she ate, images of Amy and Beth flashed into her mind. She kept having visions of their bloated guts, their massive tits, their animal like faces...it made her shudder. She stuffed handful after handful of chips into her mouth, wondering just what the hell had happened to make them like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching for another chip, Allyson realised, once again, that the bag was empty. Groaning in annoyance at the stupid portion sizes, she returned to the fridge and found some more leftovers. Hot dogs from yesterday and cold pizza. That would do. She wolfed down the hot dogs next, practically forcing them down her throat and swallowing them into a few bites. The pizza slices followed, and yet...she still didn't feel satisfied. Her stomach rumbled again, even noisier than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...what is wrong with you...\" Allyson grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, she looked down at her trim stomach to see it had bloated out considerably, leaving her with a food baby. She regretted eating all that junk, but she was starving. Rubbing her exposed belly, she went back to the fridge and started grabbing more food, loading up her arms with doughnuts, cake, chocolate, cheese and meats. She grabbed two large bags of chips from the cupboard, and then hurried back to her room, in case someone found her. </span></div></div>",

A giggle burst from her lips, as he played with her hair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna tag along?\" he asked again. His hot breath warming her ears, making her heart flutter, and her stomach squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she fought for control, she brushed his hand away. It was too distracting, too exciting. She flushed at the thoughts racing through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand brushed against something. Kyle's smile was indulgent... understanding. He knew what she'd just noticed. Her hand returned to her hair. Only to discover, he'd swapped out her earrings, and she was now wearing the same tags that identified the cows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unsettling how he'd managed it without her noticing sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" she purred, \"Is that what you prefer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCupping, cradling and lifting her bust, she displayed it for his amusement... Half-hoping to make his squirm, she was disappointed, as he just enjoyed the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth realised, she was undeniably bigger than before... The thought making her pulse race, and blood pound dizzyingly in her ears. The girls were far too big to fit in any of her bras. Her thumbs rubbing against her swollen bust, she gasped, as her caressing fingers failed to find any trace of a bra beneath her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the shock, she felt her nips stiffen, thrusting obviously forward.

Tilting her head this way and that like a confused puppy, she worked out where the voice came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking quickly across the room, she found the door stuck in the frame. Having to put all her strength into opening it. It squealed in protest, opening temptingly close to wide enough. Another couple of heaves allowed her to squeeze through the gap she'd made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding her jeans already smeared with something black and oily, she avoided touching her jeans. The instinct to run her hand through the stain, and sniff it was strong. But, already the smell was starting to stink, being both chemical and strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, she peeled off the jeans before the... whatever seeped through to her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt left her feeling less than fully dressed. With only a one-piece swimsuit to wear. She'd revealed her crop top, was just the upper part of her swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/17/5f/25/175f25146596f22bf66956ebd6c614f4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/17/5f/25/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt oddly more at ease, as she descended the wooden stairs slowly. There was a sound of water lapping, and each step she half expected a splash to announce she'd reached it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the bottom of the stairs, with a start and without getting wet. Moonlight spilled in through wide, low windows. Revealing a swimming pool. Quite small, but large enough to swim a few strokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to herself, she thought it was perfect timing a chance to rinse any of that stuff off and be sure she wasn't going to be poisoned by the oily slick she'd been smeared by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the edge of the pool, she was surprised to find it was comfortably warm. So she lowered her legs fully into the water. Splashing the water over her thighs. It still felt clean, too. Easing herself off the side, she was startled to find she was at the deep end, as her head vanished beneath the surface before her feet hit the bottom of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't intended to swim. Struggling to get out, quite where she'd entered, she felt an crack. Decided against straining, Beth swam towards the ladder. Swimming was odd, having to pass through parts that were entirely unlit. She reached the ladder. It creaked as she ascended. But despite it's protests survived to let her out the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuivering from the cold, the water streaked from her body. Belatedly, she realised she didn't have a towel. Not here, and probably no-one had brought one at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScraping the excess water from her skin, Beth thought she felt... fuller figured? The muted light made it impossible to be sure. Her wet feet slapping over the chill ceramic until she found an area that was reasonably well lit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/a0/11/cca011d8ecfce8ee8d1ceb0c1c3c8089.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/a0/11/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she was half sure she was broader in the hips. Getting more sure, as she turned to admire her body from different angles. It didn't make sense, so she tried to dismiss it as insecurity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the base of the stairs, another crack was clearer this time. Unmuffled by the water, she felt her hips widen. She felt the extra heft of her rump swelling fuller, rounder, heavier, firmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/34/b9/f6/34b9f626128873ed26d464cfaa6118c2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/34/b9/f6/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmiring her legs, they appeared longer too. Though her ankles ached. The ache eased, as she slipped her heels back on. The angle wasn't too great, but she felt instantly better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending, stretching she tried to ease whatever tension was in her muscles. Sinking down, she crouched to warm her upper legs. She couldn't help but run her hand over that beautifully exposed flank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/65/f1/3e/65f13e0fe92effbad544671805900a28.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/65/f1/3e/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth wobbled uncertainly, as she went to stand up. Her muscles refusing to obey.  Spreading her arms wide for balance, she avoided falling on her ass. Then she felt something else. A warmth spread from her belly upwards. A tension, excitement... arousal... she wasn't sure what... But, it made her bust tingle, as it craved attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Beth's hands came up to gently massage the girls. Play a little in the dark with her nips. She looked guiltily up the steps to ensure she didn't have an audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved no-one was there. A sensual gasp was ripped from her, before she could go to work. Her bust surged, pressing relentlessly forward, growing fuller and heavier. The friction as her nipples brushed against the inside of her suit, was just too much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering, she settled until the wave of ecstacy passed. This time, the change wasn't subtle. She was much bigger, bustier... and with a fuller ass to balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0f/75/91/0f75913ef82018884440a96dc5e86739.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0f/75/91/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there trying to comprehend what was going on.</span></div></div>",

Exploring a creepy mansion in the dead of night while searching for their missing friend; that was a great way to spend an evening. Even if the whole place was a little creepy. Carrie had even left work early to make sure she got here on time. Unfortunately, that had meant being unable to change out of her work clothes, but considering what Beth was wearing...she didn't feel like the most inappropriately dressed person here in the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving work early did have another upside in that it had caused Carrie to skip a meal. She had been a little worried about her figure lately after gaining nearly twenty pounds since starting her new job. Most of her work was office based, and she had found herself exercising less and less, and going to the vending machine more and more. In only a few weeks, she had developed a pudgy pot belly and found her work clothes getting tighter and tighter. She had been meaning to diet for a while, but had trouble sticking to a routine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm...if I was Stacey...where would I go first? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie looked down a hallway full of doors, then back the way she had come.

It was a good job she had seen it, because any closer and she might have taken a very unpleasant fall inside. It was strange that someone would just leave this wide open - health and safety would have a field day. Kneeling down and taking out her phone, she shone her flashlight into the darkness below, but could hardly make anything out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacey!\" She called into the pitch black basement. \"Are you down there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response, but Carrie figured this would probably be a good place to look. If Stacey hadn't been watching where she was going, she could quite easily have tumbled into the open door and broken a leg or something. Carrie moved her phone around until she caught sight of some steps, then climbed down. Each step creaked noisily beneath her feet, and she was a little worried they might break. Who knew how old and rotten this place was now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily though, that didn't happen, and after a few more steps, Carrie found herself back on solid ground. She shone her flashlight around in a circular motion, but the room appeared to be empty. No sign of Stacey anywhere. Sighing dejectedly, Carrie turned and made for the steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Help...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie froze in her tracks. For a second, she thought she had imagined the voice, but it had definitely come from behind her...and it wasn't Stacey's. She turned slowly, shining her phone wildly in the air as she tried to find the source of the voice. \"H-hello? Is someone else here?!\" She asked, her voice shaking with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, her flashlight illuminated the fact of a pale woman right in front of her. Two huge, dark eyes were staring right into Carrie's own, and she screamed in terror and threw the phone to the ground.

When it was finally closed and she was out of the basement, she breathed a sigh of immense relief. She had no idea exactly what had happened down there, but it had absolutely terrified her. She had left her phone down there, so decided to head back and find the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hurried along, casting nervous glances over her shoulder in case something was following her, she suddenly froze in her tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Eat.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?!\" Carrie spun around, wondering where that horrible, chilling voice had come from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Eaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie started running. She had no idea where that voice was coming from, but she knew she had to get away. \"Leave me alone!\" She shouted over her shoulder, though she wasn't sure who she was talking to. She rounded the corner into the grand hall, sweating and panting heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Eat.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was suddenly hit with a churning in her stomach. It rumbled noisily, as though she hadn't eaten for days. She clutched at her middle and groaned in discomfort. \"I...should eat,\" she said aloud, wondering towards the Kitchen...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carrie found herself wondering to the Kitchens. She didn't know how she even knew where they were, but somehow, she found them. The Kitchen was enormous, but it was a total mess; cobwebs and dust covered every surface. Some of the large, oak cupboards had been left open, but when Carrie checked them, they were completely empty. Her stomach continued to rumble, and she sped up her search, pulling open cupboard doors and drawers. But every single one was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie wasn't sure what she had expected. Even if there had been food in this old place, it would have rotted years ago. She regretted not going to the vending machine after work. Of all the places to suddenly feel starving...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing and clutching her aching stomach, Carrie headed out of the Kitchen through a different door. As she pushed it open, she found herself in another huge room, lit with huge candelabras and chandeliers. In the centre of the room was a massive dining table with enough chairs for about fifty people, and at the end of the table...a massive, chocolate, cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's jaw dropped as she stared at the perfect looking cake before her. She hurried forward excitedly, desperate for something, anything, to eat. It looked freshly baked, though she wasn't sure how that was possible. But there was no dust on top, no signs of the cake going bad...it looked incredible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Eat...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie barely heard the voice this time. She was too focused on the enormous cake in front of her. Too focused on satisfying her increasing hunger. Her stomach rumbled again, and she moved closer, pulling out a chair and seating herself right in front of it. Beside the cake was a knife and a small plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what the hell....is this...\" Carrie moaned as her stomach groaned. \"This isn't right...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach gave a huge, thunderous roar, and Carrie hastily grabbed the knife and cut herself a massive slice. Before she could think about the consequences, she found herself pushing the entire slice into her mouth ravenously. It tasted amazing. Better than any cake she had eaten in her entire life. Rich, chocolatey, moist. She didn't know why it was here, but right now, she didn't care. When the entire slice was gone, she had to stop and breathe. She had eaten it so quickly that she had barely savoured it...and that called for another slice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie cut herself another slice, even larger than before, and took a large bite, savouring the entire mouthful. It was so good she let out an involuntary moan of pleasure. It didn't take long for her appetite to take over again, and she quickly finished up her second slice and moved onto a third...</span></div></div>",

It was so light, so fluffy, so delicious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"More...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the voice again, echoing around the dining room, but with her mouth stuffed full of cake, she couldn't bring herself to look up and see where it was coming from. She could barely concentrated on anything apart from the delicious chocolatey treat before her. As she pushed an entire handful of cake into her mouth, her stomach groaned audibly, beginning to bloat out beneath her tight shirt. Her buttons constricted around her slowly expanding belly, which bloated out a little more with each slice she ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmf...mmm...so good...\" Carrie moaned as her messy hands reached for another slice and immediately crammed it into her mouth. She had cake crumbs and chocolate smeared across her face, eating greedily and messily as she tried desperately to sate her hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's already chubby pot belly was getting fuller and fuller, bloating at an alarming rate as every slice of the massive cake found it's way into her stomach. She grunted and moaned, becoming uncomfortably full, but finding herself unable to stop. With a grunt, she slumped back into one of the large wooden chairs behind her, causing her shirt to tighten even more, pulling apart the gaps between her shirt buttons to expose her swollen tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLurching forward, she grabbed what seemed to be the final slice of the cake and gobbled it up in two huge bites. With a triumphant groan, she lay back in the chair and took a moment to breath out. \"URRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\" Carrie blushed as she let out a huge belch. She moaned in embarrassment, and looked up at the empty plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...did I eat all that? BURRRP!\" She clasped her hands over her mouth, not quite believing how much she had stuffed herself. For the first time, her eyes fell to her stomach, and she moaned again. She was so bloated! Her little pot belly had round and stuffed and sitting in her lap, stretching her poor shirt to its limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm such a pig!\" She cried. </span></div></div>",

She'd have been lying if she said this wasn't like her, but the truth was she had been having full on eating sessions like this for a while now. Her appetite had been growing and growing since she started her new job. She'd never eaten anything <i>this </i>size before now though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStifling another belch in an attempt to retain her dignity, Carrie pushed herself away from the table and, with a groan of discomfort, rose to her feet. Carrie looked down at her bloated belly and her poor, overstretched shirt buttons, mortified at how much she eaten to get herself into this state. She couldn't believe how full she was. That cake must have been even bigger than she thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghh....\" Carried groaned, massaging her swollen stomach, her fingers tracing over the gaps between her buttons, which now exposed her fleshy belly. \"God, I hope nobody sees me like this, you can see my belly through my shirt!\" Blushing red with embarrassment, Carrie suddenly found herself licking her lips, and her throat seemed to instantly dry out. It occurred to her that she had just consumed a massive, rich cake without even a single drop of water, so she headed off to find a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked through the door to the Kitchen, Carrie felt her belly groan. She felt so full and heavy, and her normally dainty walk had turned into a waddle. She became aware of her sluggishness and tried to straighten up, but she was so stuffed now that it was hard to walk normally. Feeling her throat getting even more dry, Carrie grabbed a dusty old glass and turned on a tap to wash it out...but no water came out. She sighed. It wasn't a great surprise really, this house probably hadn't had running water for years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, she looked for another source of water, but there were no other taps. She noticed an enormous fridge, behind her, and opened that up instead. To her surprise, there were two large containers in there, each one with a different liquid. One looked like a huge jug of milk, and the other was something resembling blueberry juice...</span></div></div>",

With a groan, she put the empty pitcher back and down and stifled a belch. \"Ughh...stop overdoing it you idiot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Carrie felt a very tight sensation across her chest. She looked down curiously, and found herself staring into her own cleavage - her boobs were staring back up at her, squeezed together, and to her shock, a button had come undone on her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Carrie said, she reached up and tried to button her top back up, but as soon as she did, she noticed that her breasts were moving! Pushing outwards, her boobs were growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie gasped, and stared down at her C cup breasts as they reached a D cup size, they were literally growing before her eyes, growing rounder and bigger and straining underneath her shirt - she couldn't believe what was happening to her, this was impossible! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growing breasts were beginning to get too big for the C cup bra she was wearing, and they continued to swell and bulge to larger sizes beneath her shirt. Another button flew off the shirt, flying across the room as it ripped away from her top - exposing more of her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This cant be happening!\" Carrie exclaimed, and as she spoke, she heard the sound of three 'pops', and looked down to see her enormous cleavage had torn through the last remnants of her shirt and left it wide open - her now massive breasts were barely contained by her bra, which had been pulled so tight across her swollen boobs that it now only covered half of them - the rest of the flesh around the bra spilling out...</span></div></div>",

But the bra was past it's usefulness now anyway - acting as nothing more than a <i>very </i>revealing bikini top pulling thin across her huge nipples - finally, the bra could take no more - and exploded, shredding apart and flying in every direction as Carrie's now unsupported breasts plopped down into her waiting hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugghhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\" Carrie moaned noisily as her incredibly sensitive nipples hit the palms of her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked on in utter amazement as her breasts finally stopped growing, now the size of beach balls.

Carrie waited for the sensation to go away entirely before she began to even think about the situation she found herself in. Yet as her thoughts returned, she found them wandering further from the rational situation and closer to a sudden desire. She looked down at her breasts and gave them an ever-so-gentle squeeze once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhh...\" she moaned again. \"Yessss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow that pitcher of milk had blown her breasts up like this she hadn't a clue. They were actually quite soft, and her investigative squeezes led her to believe they were filled with something. Her boobs were as big as her stuffed belly, but the thought of them being bigger slowly began to pervade her mind. She needed more of that milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Gotta see if there's any more on the table,\" she muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was significantly more \"weighty\" than usual, so trying to rise off her knees proved to be a small ordeal. She slowly and carefully pulled herself back to her feet, trying her best not to let her breasts sway all that much along the way. It was a slow and trying process but she was successful in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back upright, she took a moment to adjust to the new weight she carried around. Slowly she advanced with little surefooted waddles towards the table and the pitcher she left upon it. Though the one she drank from was empty, she scanned the table looking for another. Alas, she found naught as her eyes returned back to the empty container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Carrie lamented. \"There's gotta be some more. There just has to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at the empty pitcher for a moment, when a thought occurred to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's definitely something magical about this place, no doubt about it. I didn't just eat a whole cake and blow up my breasts of my own volition. Maybe this pitcher will magically refill itself if I just wait a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought was rather far-fetched, but then again, so was her situation. She settled upon this course of action as she very carefully hefted her belly upon the table, at the very least to alleviate some of the burden she carried. She would just have to wait for the pitcher to refill itself...</span></div></div>",

Her eyes lifted back to her cleavage, but her attention was caught by something else...the pitcher was full again. Carrie smiled triumphantly, not believing her luck. \"Oh my God you did refill!\" She said excitedly, her breasts shaking as she eagerly reached for the pitcher and pulled it towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step back and letting her belly slide off the table and drop down, she almost stumbled over again, but managed to steady herself, not wanting to spill a single drop of that delicious milk.

Within a few seconds, it was empty again, and Carrie dumped it on the table before taking a deep breath. \"Mmmm...so good...\" she muttered, looking back down at her breasts excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, she saw her breasts beginning to change. Her cleavage bulged upwards, growing towards her face as she out a low moan. She dropped to her knees with a thud, grabbing her breasts as she went down. Her boobs surged bigger and bigger, rising higher and higher, swelling up past her chin to the point where she couldn't even see past them anymore. Her expanding tits were pushing her hands further and further apart, until they finally pushed free of her grasp, dropping into her lap.

Carrie let out a long, guttural, moan as her big, bloated belly pushed forward. She instinctively caught her fleshy middle in both hands, gripping it by the love handles and watching her fingers sink into a layer of soft flab. She had really overdone it this time. She had never felt so full and gluttonous in her entire life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhhhh I'm so biiiiiiiiiiiiiiig!\" Carrie moaned, staring down at her bulging stomach in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cake filled tummy groaned and gurgled, and Carrie spread her legs to allow herself some more room on her lap. Her belly dropped a little as the gap between her legs opened, and her hands fell to her stomach once again, massaging the big round mass in front of her. It was so round, she looked pregnant. Her massaging coaxed out another loud belch, making Carrie feel even more like a pig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You like it. Don't you?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was that voice again.

Carrie could feel herself getting dizzy, her vision blurring. She tried to stand up, but found herself pinned in place by some unknown force. Her legs flailed uselessly, jiggling her bloated stomach. She suppressed another belch and tried to rub her eyes, but that didn't help. The room seemed to be <i>dissolving </i>around her! She gave a nervous yelp of terror as her surroundings changed from the dimly lit dining room to a very familiar setting...she was in her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill sitting in the dinner chair, she looked around, amazed by what had just happened. This was definitely her room, and there, sitting on the bed, was Carrie herself, sitting in her underwear with a phone in her hand. The bed was littered with empty pizza boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Look familiar?\"</i> The voice asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie still couldn't move, but her other self didn't seem to be aware of her presence. She didn't answer the voice, but it did, indeed look familiar. This had been her just a few days ago. She had devoured two large pizzas all to herself, and then feasted on an entire tub of cookie dough ice cream for dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the Carrie on the bed turned, revealing a hugely bloated belly and a tub of ice cream in her lap. She took a picture of herself with her phone and pushed her bloated tummy out for effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"See. You love it. You love the gluttony. Love the way you've grown.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie blushed. Her secret fantasy exposed. She did like it. She had been so turned after her first few extra pounds that she had quickly gained a few more, unintentionally at first, but soon it had become unavoidable as her appetite raged out of control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Who were you sending the picture to? An admirer?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie ignored the voice again, refusing to give it the satisfaction. She had a few different guys she spoke to online, all of whom loved her growing figure and chubby belly. She would often stuff herself and send them pictures of her gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Carrie on the bed belched noisily and laughed, giving her heavy belly a jiggle before lying on her back and taking another picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Look at you. You love it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghh...y....yes!\" Carrie said, growing all the more turned on as she watched herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said the words, the scene of her bedroom faded away, and Carrie found herself back in the dark, old dining room.

She could feel her full stomach shaking uncomfortably as she jogged awkwardly towards the staircase. She was about to shout for the others, but stopped herself before the words came out of her mouth; she <i>really </i>didn't want anyone to see her like this. Not until she could cover up at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than that, she was concerned about what they might find out about her private life. She had always kept her kinky stuffing fetish to herself, and she knew her friends would just be freaked out if they realised she was into it. Maybe that weird voice would tell them everything? Katie would be horrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie stifled a belch as she looked from left to right; she really didn't want to go back down the corridor she had stupidly chosen the first time around, and the dining room was in the other direction, so she chose the stairs. Maybe there was something up there she could find to wear? Or at least hide out until her stomach had shrunk down a little? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie headed up the grand staircase, her heavy belly pressing into her overly tight skirt, stretching the fabric audibly. Once she was out of here, she really needed to get some bigger sized work clothes. She was worried that her skirt was going to rip at any minute. Slowing her pace slightly so as not to damage what was left of her clothes, Carrie ascended the stairs and found herself at another crossroads and another set of corridors leading to different rooms. She looked from left to right once more...</span></div></div>",

She pushed open the first door she saw and dashed inside, closing the door behind her before anyone could see her. A quick glance around the room immediately told her this was some sort of master bedroom for someone quite important; there was a huge, four-poster bed in the centre of the room and lavish decorations and ornate antiques all around her. Strangely, it was also spotlessly clean, with not a spec of dust to be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention was also drawn to a large portrait hanging above the doorway. A <i>very </i>large portrait. She read the plaque underneath, which told her it was a painting of \"Lady Auriela Belview\". If Carrie recalled correctly, the Belview's had been a wealthy family who owned a lot of land around the area back in the 1800's. The Lady in the portrait was absolutely huge, thick shoulders, a double chin, enormous breasts and the biggest gut Carrie had ever seen, and yet, there was a regal beauty to her that Carrie found weirdly entrancing. The eyes of the portrait seemed to follow her as she backed away towards the bed and slumped down with a relieved sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhh...that's better...\" Carrie groaned as she massaged her full stomach. \"Need to sleep this off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell onto her back, her heading hitting the pillow with a soft thud. It was so incredibly soft and comfortable, she clutched at the fine, silk sheets and rolled onto her side, a smile spreading across her face as she quickly settled into a deep sleep...</span></div></div>",

Though it was rather rude of her to break into my private chambers and use my bed without permission. Unacceptable behaviour. But in all fairness...I suppose I haven't used it for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to the other side of the bed, Lady Belview saw Carrie's bulging belly for the first time. Her eyes lighting up, she smiled down at the girl, almost proudly. \"Well, well, it looks like our guest has been enjoying herself in the dining room. By the looks of her poor, round tummy she's encountered my sister, but as usual, she's only managed half a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie stirred in her sleep, rolling onto her front and grabbing at the pillow. Lady Belview watched with amusement, reminded of all the times she had found herself in this position in her youth; exhausted after a gluttonous evening, fit to burst, nursing a stomach ache...good times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auriela. Leave her be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuriela rolled her eyes at the sound of a soft, feminine voice behind her. Turning slowly, she saw her sister standing by the door. \"I have told you about knocking, dear Alice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice, the pale, dark eyed girl that Carrie had encountered in the cellar, stepped towards her sister. Aureila dwarfed her in size, towering over her, but the younger girl did not back down. \"She is mine,\" Alice said defiantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was yours, dear,\" Lady Belview said. \"She is now in my chambers. You failed to keep her in the dining room, so you lose. That is the usual agreement.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's eyes flared with rage. \"No! That isn't fair! She was succumbing! I deserve this one! I did all the work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't raise your voice to me, dear,\" Lady Belview hissed. \"It's rude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHissing at her older sister like a frightened cat, Alice retreated, her body passing through the door silently, glowering at her sister as she went.

With her sister gone, she extended her hand, a blue glow lighting up the room and a strange tendril like hand forming out of the air and clutching at Carrie's exposed belly. Stirring a little, Carrie rolled over in her sleep, her bloated tummy jiggling as she turned onto her back. Aurelia smiled as her magic tendrils grabbed hold of Carrie's stomach and began glowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change to the girl's body was subtle. Carrie's food packed stomach, bloated and taught, began to soften up. It shrank down slightly, looking as though it was deflating, but then rising back up a little as all the food inside her belly was suddenly digested and converted to fat. Her belly grew softer and squishier, while her skirt tightened as a few extra pounds were added to her body. The tendrils faded away again, leaving Carrie looking relatively unchanged, save for a few more curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that should do for now,\" Aurelia smirked, as she too faded into the darkness of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghhhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie groaned as she opened her eyes. She wasn't sure how long she had been asleep, but she woke up feeling surprisingly well rested. Sitting up, she swung her legs off the side of the huge bed and looked down at her exposed belly. Her shirt was still hanging open, the buttons unfastened following her binge in the dining room, but her stomach seemed to have shrunk down considerably. She no longer looked ready to burst, but it still looked rather full somehow. Carrie pressed her hand into the bulge of her belly, and was surprised by how soft she had become. It was definitely a noticeably pot belly now, but at least she didn't look massively pregnant anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing herself to her feet, she decided to try buttoning her shirt again. To her immense relief, it was much easier now. The first three buttons fastened relatively easily, but the bottom one had completely torn off. She blushed, embarrassed she had pigged out so much. Not wanting to leave the bottom of her chubby belly exposed, she tucked the the shirt into her skirt. As her fingers pushed the shirt into her skirt, she was surprised by how tight it felt. She could barely fit her fingers between the fabric and her waist anymore, which was a little worrying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked to the door, she felt her thighs rubbing together, and her skirt chafing considerably. She really was getting rather big. The thought turned her on for a moment, and she savoured the feel of her thighs touching. But then she remembered the kitchen, and all that food...and the voice...the horrible, taunting voice...and she shuddered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously turning the door handle, Carrie headed back into the corridor...</span></div></div>",

There was no sign of anyone, and it still looked creepy as hell, but she needed to continue her search for Stacey. She still wasn't sure how long she had been asleep, so pulled out her phone and checked; to her surprise, it had only been twenty minutes. She wondered where the others were now, and hoped they weren't panicking that she had vanished for nearly half an hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys?\" Carrie called out. \"Are you still here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Carrie wanted was to be stuck here on her own, but it was highly unlikely that they would have left without her. The silence was a little troubling though, but then again, they were probably just searching the other rooms. This place was huge, and there was plenty of different areas to explore. Carrie decided she would continue her search upstairs and headed onward down the hallway. She turned a few of the door handles, but, strangely, they wouldn't budge. It seemed like half the doors on this floor were locked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Carrie reached the end of corridor and pulled the last doorknob, which, thankfully, opened up. \"About time,\" Carrie muttered as she stepped inside. The room was, once again, lit up, with glowing lanterns positioned around the walls. Carrie looked around and  saw that this room was far less grand than the one she had just come from. It was fairly bland and barely decorated at all, except for a small portrait of that enormous Lady Belview on the dresser. Carrie picked it up and took a look, once again shocked by the woman's girth. \"She certainly thought a lot of herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the picture back down, Carrie noticed another doorway within the room, and opened it up, finding herself face to face with a small, but elegant, bathroom. The bathtub was quite small, but nicely decorated and absolutely spotless. Someone had obviously cleaned it recently. Maybe Stacey had stayed here? <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Spinning around, she found herself face to face with a young woman wearing what appeared to be a French Maid's outfit. The girl was pale and had long, dark hair that flowed down her back. She looked around Carrie's age, maybe a little younger, and had a beautiful, angular face with big, dark eyes. Carrie looked her upon and down, taking in her little white apron, the flared skirt of her dress, the black stockings peeking so invitingly from beneath. Carrie gulped audibly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, is this your room?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shook her head. \"Oh my no, this is for my master's honoured guests. The servant quarters are downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie realised this girl literally was a Maid. Having seen that French Maid outfit mostly used for sexy Halloween costumes and kinky bedroom games, it had never even occurred to her that it might still be used for it's actual intended purpose. \"Oooooh, you actually work here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maid nodded. \"That's right Miss, are you a guest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, not exactly,\" Carrie said. \"My friends and I came here looking for another friend, Stacey. I don't suppose you've seen her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maid took a moment to think, then shook her head. \"That name doesn't sound familiar miss, but we have had a few visitors lately. Some of them got themselves into some trouble. I hope she wasn't one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you mean...trouble?\" Carrie asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were peeking in rooms where they shouldn't have been, it was very rude of them,\" the girl said, her voice darkening slightly. \"We had to deal with them. You can't just walk into someone else's house you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie took a step back, realising that she had done exactly that. \"Well...I...uh...we didn't know anyone was living here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" The Maid looked confused. \"I'm so sorry nobody was there to greet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay,\" Carrie said quickly, relieved that the girl seemed to have forgotten about the whole breaking and entering thing in lieu of good household etiquette. \"Say...do you know where the other guests went? The ones that uh...peeked around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd have to ask one of the others,\" the Maid replied. \"I don't really get involved with unwelcome guests. I just keep things clean.\" She produced a feather duster and gestured to it to emphasise her point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie just nodded uneasily, not sure what to make of this girl. \"Okay...well maybe I could talk to them...\" Though she really didn't want to. This place was creepy enough as it was without seeking out any more unsettling occupants. \"I'm Carrie, by the way. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! People don't usually ask me my name! I'm Lauren, Miss,\" the maid smiled excitedly. \"Pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little more relaxed, Carrie wondered if Lauren might be able to help her...</span></div></div>",

She needed answers, and Lauren might just be able to answer at least some of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Lauren?\"<br>\r\nLauren looked at her curiously, her head cocked to the side slightly. Taking that as a sign to go on, Carrie started with her first question. <br>\r\n\"I've been experiencing some... weird things around this place. Voices, ghostly figures, delicious cakes just sitting around...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you were the one who tasted my cake?! Please, how was it?\"<br>\r\nCarrie paused as Lauren let out an excited squeal. Why was the maid preparing food and not the chef? It wasn't like they would have anyone to cook for, given that the mansion had been abandoned for almost a century now. Or that's what Carrie believed, anyway. Lauren was proof that the mansion clearly wasn't abandoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made that cake?\" Carrie asked. \"Aren't chefs meant to be in charge of making food?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yes... But we haven't had a chef working here in a good while now,\" Lauren explained. \"As one of the few people still working here, the role of chef has fallen to me, along with the role of maid and plumber. But please, the cake! You must tell me how it was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay... It was very nice,\" Carrie replied. \"It was really rich and tasty, and the sauce you used went well with the sponge. I'd offer you a bit, but I kinda... ate the entire thing...\"<br>\r\nShe let out a nervous laugh. Lauren probably thought she was a complete pig, having eaten a cake that size all by herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Then that must mean you really liked it!\" Lauren enthused, clapping happily. \"Would you like another one? I'm sure I have enough to make another!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie hesitated as her belly grumbled quietly. She wouldn't mind another one, but she wasn't here to gorge herself. She needed to find her friends, as well as Stacey...<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I need to find my friends. But it was nice meeting you, Lauren\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie turned to leave, but found her way quickly blocked by Lauren. <br>\r\n\"I can come with you!\" She offered enthusiastically. \"I know I said I don't deal with guests, but I do know this mansion quite well! And the other people living here will be more inclined to leave you alone if I'm with you at all times!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's very kind of you, but...\"<br>\r\nOnce again, Carrie's attempt at getting rid of Lauren was brushed aside by the persistent maid. <br>\r\n\"Consider it payment for your kind words about my cake! Now, come along! We can start downstairs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her by the hand, Lauren practically dragged the protesting Carrie from the room, easily resisting her attempts at escaping her firm grip...</span></div></div>",

Her hands travelled to her bulging belly self consciously, and she thought back to her earlier feast in the dining room. Surely she wasn't still hungry? She had eaten so much already, then slept it off, or so she thought. She gave a yelp as she felt another hand touch her stomach, once which was not her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you hungry?\" Lauren asked, her cold, pale hand resting pleasantly on Carrie's tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no,\" Carrie said quickly. \"I've already eaten plenty today. Must just be some indigestion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren didn't seem convinced by that answer, and she quickly took Carrie by the hand and led her out of the room and back into the corridor. Not wanting to argue, Carrie just hurried behind her, being pulled along by the svelte, but surprisingly strong, young Maid. Before she even had a chance to ask where they were heading. Lauren lead her down the corridor, around a corner, and yanked her inside another bedroom, which was, once again, fully lit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little out of breath after being pulled along at such a fast pace, Carrie let out a long exhale. \"So, what are we doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is my mistress's treat room, we always keep it fully stocked,\" Lauren said. \"I'm sure she wouldn't mind you helping yourself to a few things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helping myself to wh-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie stepped forward and suddenly noticed what was inside this new room. Her jaw dropped as she looked around; the room was decorated in a manner similar to the master bedroom, but the room was crowded with lots of small tables, each of them covered in platters of cakes, pastries and sweets. In some cases, the plates were overflowing entirely and spilling onto the floor. Lauren had to pick a few up and put them to one side, her french Maid's outfit pulling up over her butt as she bent over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie looked away awkwardly, but found herself looking at an enormous chocolate cake instead. It was eerily familiar to the one she had eaten downstairs, and she really didn't want to get drawn into devouring another. Her shirt buttons were still tight from earlier, and she feared if she ate any more they would burst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like something? What's your favourite?\" Lauren asked excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm actually not very hungry, I ate some cake earlier so I think I'm good,\" Carrie said, though even as she spoke, she was staring down at a plate full of doughnuts nearby. \"I should probably just get - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Carrie could finish her sentence, Lauren's hand had swiped up one of the Doughnuts and pushed it into her open mouth. Carrie gave a muffled grunt, completely taken off guard by the sudden, unexpected treat. It was already halfway into her mouth, and despite her best efforts, she found herself biting down into it, removing the other half and turning to Lauren with a mildly annoyed expression on her face. She was about to chastise the Maid for nearly choking her, but found herself pre-occupied with what was probably the most delicious doughnut she had ever tasted. \"Mmmff...Lauren...could you not...Mmmfff...do that...\" Carrie mumbled in between bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, did you not like that one?\" Lauren asked, looking confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie swallowed. \"No, it was...it was fine...but I really shouldn't have any more.\" Ignoring her own advice, she raised the other half of the doughnut to her mouth and pushed it inside, savouring the taste as custard oozed into her mouth. \"Mmmfff...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you do like those!\" Lauren said, clapping her hands together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie had just about swallowed when she looked up to see another doughnut heading straight for her mouth, Lauren's grinning face behind it. She was about to shout \"WAIT!\" but all she succeeded in doing was opening her mouth and giving Lauren another clear shot. The doughnut went straight into her mouth again, and this time Lauren followed it up by gently pushing it, forcing the entire, delicious snack into Carrie's bulging cheeks. Carrie muffled a disapproving noise, glaring at Lauren as she struggled to devour her second helping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren, seriously, that's enough,\" Carrie managed as she swallowed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, you should take a seat,\" Lauren said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Carrie could object, Lauren gently pushed her back into a large, golden chair which seemed like it was big enough for three people. It was comfortable enough, but Carrie really didn't want to just sit around and wait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had turned to a nearby table that had a large platter of chocolate chip cookies sitting atop it. Once again, her dress rose up as she bent over to recover the large platter, causing Carrie to blush yet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young maid turned back to her, the platter held aloft in one hand, Carrie swallowed nervously. Cookies were one of her all-time favourite treats, which had led to her having absolutely no resistance whenever somebody offered her some. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Here we are... Fresh cookies!\" Lauren announced, grabbing one and moving it towards Carrie's mouth. \"Open wide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst her better judgement, Carrie's mouth slowly opened. Lauren gently placed the treat inside, allowing her to bite a large portion of it off, before removing it and allowing her to chew. As she did, a long groan escaped her mouth. She had had some good cookies on her life, but this... This was on a whole other level. It was still slightly warm, the chocolate chips practically melting in her mouth, and tasted heavenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, Carrie had allowed Lauren to push another two into her mouth. She chewed loudly, crumbs raining down the front of her strained shirt. As she swallowed and looked up for her next one, she caught Lauren staring hungrily at the treat in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hang on a sec!\" Carrie said, reaching up and stopping the maid's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is something wrong?\" Lauren asked. \"Have you had enough of cookies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, not at all,\" Carrie answered. \"It's just...

Servants have their own meals which they get at the start and end of every day. It wouldn't be right to snack between them. Now, open wide...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie stopped her hand again. <br>\r\n \"I insist,\" Carrie said, gently taking the cookie from Lauren's hand. Gesturing for the young maid to bend down, she moved the cookie into her mouth, allowing her to bite a small bit off. Her eyes went wide as she chewed slowly. Swallowing hungrily, Lauren quickly gobbled down the rest of the cookie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"See? Aren't they nice?\" Carrie asked. \"Why don't we eat together? Here, take a seat...\"<br>\r\nLauren stared at the massive chair for a moment before reluctantly sitting next to Carrie. She set the platter atop her bare knees before grabbing a cookie in each hand. One was held out to Carrie, who leaned forward to bite into it, while the other was pushed into her own mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween them, the mountain of cookies gradually disappeared. Carrie leaned back in her seat, massaging her solid belly, while Lauren licked her fingers clean. Her own trim belly was bulging out slightly, forming a tiny bump in her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Those were nice...\" She said, staring at the empty platter. \"Too bad there aren't any more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie found herself nodding in agreement, her previous reservations about snacking practically forgotten...</span></div></div>",

Carrie opened her mouth without hesitation, allowing the maid to push it inside. As soon as she bit down, an explosion of gooey chocolate filled her cheeks, causing her to let out a quiet moan at the sheer deliciousness of the brownie. Everything here tasted incredible. Fumbling with the plate, Carrie found herself scooping up a brownie for Lauren and repeating the feeding process, cramming the brownie into the eager maid's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmf...didn't realise they tasted so good,\" Lauren said, her mouth full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie nodded in agreement as Lauren shoved another brownie her way. She was finding herself enjoying this experience more and more; the idea of being fed had always been a turn on for her, but she had usually imagined her feeder to be a guy. Having this sexy girl in a maid's outfit stuff her full of brownies was turning out to be way, way hotter. She looked down at Lauren's stomach, and saw that her perfectly flat stomach had swelled up considerably, bulging beneath her skimpy outfit. Carrie smiled to herself, keeping one eye on Lauren's stomach and another on the rapidly shrinking pile of brownies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many brownies,\" Lauren groaned as Carrie fed her another. \"Maybe we should try something new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a sec,\" Carrie said, sandwiching two brownies together and cramming them into Lauren's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid gave a muffled grunt of surprise, but obediently chewed down. While she was busy with that, Carrie edged forward and reached for a plate of cupcakes of various different colours. She couldn't help but sneak one herself before placing the rest down on the chair on top of the half eaten tray of brownies. \"Oh my god these are even better,\" Carrie said, licking her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren had just about finished the brownie sandwich when Carrie pushed a cupcake past her lips. Lauren reacted in kind, grabbing a cupcake in each hand and offering them to Carrie. Carrie took a bite out of the one to her left, then the one to her right, then repeated the process until they were gone. Lauren giggled at the display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More,\" Carrie said, rubbing her cake filled belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren obliged, and stepped up her feeding, pushing cupcake after cupcake towards the greedy Carrie, who ate each one with such enthusiasm that she was starting to edge closer and closer towards Lauren, squeezing the pile of cupcakes between the two girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm getting bigger,\" Lauren said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie looked down and saw that Lauren's belly was looking much rounder than it was a moment ago. All those treats had really filled her up, causing her short uniform to ride up higher, exposing the briefest glimpse of her frilly lace panties. Carrie's own stomach was even larger, still straining beneath her overly tight work shirt, the gaps between her buttons widening as she lent forward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While it felt absolutely amazing having this swelling maid stuff her full of delicious treats, she herself hadn't really been reciprocating. Why should she be the only one growing bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down, Carrie picked up the two most delicious cupcakes she could see and held them in front of Lauren's nose, who went cross-eyes trying to keep them in sight. As the two cupcakes drew closer to her mouth, her nose twitched as she caught the tasty scent wafting off them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie let out a surprised yelp that quickly devolved into giggles as Lauren suddenly shot forward, snatching an entire cupcake from one of her hands and quickly chewing it. The other was devoured just as quickly, Lauren descending into her own fit of giggles as she swallowed hungrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the platter in one hand, Carrie began to ferry cupcake after cupcake to the maid's mouth, who obediently ate each one. At one point, she stopped chewing and just allowed her feeder to push as many treats as she could into her mouth. After five cupcakes had been stuffed into her mouth, she was forced to begin chewing, lest she begin choking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Last one!\" Carrie announced, holding a pink cupcake aloft. \"Open wide!\"<br>\r\nLauren obliged, opening her mouth and allowing Carrie to drop the treat into her mouth. Before she could begin chewing, Carrie stopped her, holding up a finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait!\" She ordered her. \"Don't start chewing until I say so!\"<br>\r\nLauren let out a whine, but obeyed Carrie's cruel order. Carrie smiled as she left the chair and began rooting around the room for something new. After a few minutes, she returned with two new platters, one piled high with delicious looking pastries while the other held a single item, albeit a large one. A three tiered chocolate cake adorned it, the sight of which made both girl's stomachs let out demanding growls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the two platters between them, Carrie made herself comfortable before nodding at Lauren. The cupcake, which had softened considerably from the amount of time it had spent in her mouth, quickly disappeared down Lauren's throat. Before she had time to recover, Carrie had already resumed her convey belt of treats, ferrying various pastries to her crumb plastered mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after a heavenly cream filled bun had been pushed past her lips, Lauren held her hand up. Carrie stopped, a croissant in her hand. <br>\r\n \"Something wrong?\" She asked worriedly. <br>\r\nLauren shook her head. Instead, she moved her hands down to her belly, which had swollen considerably. It now commanded even more of her short dress, revealing her black lace panties to Carrie. As she rubbed the soft globe of flab, she realised that it wasn't the only part to have grown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost every part of her svelte body was now covered in a layer of fat, from her face, which had the beginnings of a second chin, to her breasts, which were beginning to bulge out the neckline and arm holes of her dress, to her thighs, which were now lightly brushing against one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning softer fingers over her bare thigh, Lauren looked over at Carrie, who seemed to be eyeing her hungrily...</span></div></div>",

She was about to reach out and touch that cute, swollen tummy of hers when her stomach gave a gurgle. Carrie was shocked; how the hell was her stomach demanding more food after all those cakes?! Before she had time to dwell on that any further, a hand came out of nowhere and crammed a custard filled doughnut into her mouth. Carrie found herself biting down instantly, looking up to see Lauren's chubbier looking face beaming at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmfwait...wait a mmmffsecond...\" Carrie mumbled, wiping powdered sugar from around her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lauren didn't wait a second at all. Producing another plate, she kept up her doughnut deliveries. Carrie flailed a little, surprised by just how much food she was putting away. Her hands almost reached up to stop Lauren, as she knew she was really eating way, way too much, but somehow, they never found their way past her stomach. Carrie just groaned, unable to do anything other than sit there and allow herself to be stuffed full of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren edged even closer, the bottom of her bulging tummy poking out from underneath her uniform. Carrie eyed it up as another doughnut was pushed past her lips. She briefly wondered why Lauren was seemingly swelling up and gaining weight so quickly, but the thought vanished from her mind as a loud POP came from beneath her chin. \"Wh-what was-UMFFF!\" Another doughnut cut Carrie off before she could see what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's work shirt was now skin tight. The fabric was stretching across her breasts and belly, the poor, pressured buttons pushed to their limits, creating huge gaps that exposed her bloated gut. The top button had already popped open, and the others were quickly giving up the ghost as well. The pressure was so much that Carrie's buttons were now digging into her fleshy middle. She squirmed uncomfortably as another doughnut slid down into her round belly, popping another button wide open. With only two left, an eager Lauren stepped up her game and pushed an entire muffin into Carrie's mouth. Carrie barely had time to chew before she swallowed, gasping as the final two constraints on her stomach exploded outwards, sending her final buttons flying across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time today, Carrie had exploded out of her shirt, but this time, there was no coming back. The buttons had been ripped clean off. Her chubby, overstuffed belly burst free and jiggled into her lap, round and taught with snacks and treats. She gasped for air and clutched the sides of her large, swollen pot belly, feeling like an absolute glutton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren stared, wide eyed, at Carrie's exposed chest, smiling broadly at her round, globular gut and sizeable breasts, which were straining against her white bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo....much...fooooooood...\" Carrie moaned, slumping back in the chair while massaging her belly. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite her body language clearly indicating that she was stuffed to the brim, Lauren didn't stop her feeding of Carrie. She reached over to the overstuffed girl, a doughnut covered in sweet sugar gripped in her hand, and pushed it last Carrie's lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Noooooo...\" Carrie attempted to moan through her mouthful of doughnut, but neither her body not Lauren paid any attention to her weak resistance. Her mouth moved of its own accord, chewing the sweet treat slowly. The more she ate and chewed, the faster she got until the last quarter of the doughnut was ravenously devoured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Lauren didn't stop there. After the doughnut had vanished, she moved onto a cream-filled bun. Holding it millimetres from Carrie's mouth, she giggled as the stuffed girl slowly inched forwards to take a large bite of it. Cream spilled out of her mouth, dropping onto her bare belly. Spotting this, Lauren reached her other hand down and, with a finger, scooped up the fallen cream and stuffed it into her own mouth. She smiled as she tasted the richness, savouring it for a few seconds, before returning to Carrie, who had just about managed to finish off the bun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Please... Lauren...\" Carrie groaned, hands weakly massaging her taut belly. \"So much food... So full... So...\"<br>\r\nLauren didn't let her finish. Grabbing a couple of nearby chocolate cupcakes, one in each hand, she practically forced them into Carrie's mouth, silencing her weak pleas. With nothing else to do, Carrie was forced to chew and then swallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so, she cast a groggy glance down at her belly. It lay heavily in her lap, gradually pushing her thighs apart. It felt so incredibly full, fuller than it has ever felt in her entire life. Part of her wanted Lauren to stop, to allow her belly to digest even a little of the food stuffed within her, while another part of her felt turned on. She had never tested her limits like this before... Why stop here? Why not see how much she could truly eat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the rest of her, which was more turned on by the chubby maid sitting next to her. Her round face, her soft breasts, her pudgy pot belly... Carrie couldn't take her eyes off of her. She had never had the chance to be the feeder before, only the feedee. It felt kinda good, if she was honest. She wanted to see Lauren practically bursting from her dress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lauren...\"<br>\r\nTaking advantage of her open mouth, Lauren rammed a cupcake in. Carrie hesitated before reluctantly swallowing it. Before another could be forced in, Carrie reached out and gripped Lauren's soft wrists, stopping her from doing anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is something wrong?\" The maid asked, eying a nearby plate of cookies. <br>\r\nCarrie paused, following her gaze before answering...</span></div></div>",

She exhaled noisily and slid her hands down to her plump, swollen belly. It was ridiculously hard and firm, a big solid globe stuffed full of food. Carrie had never eaten so much. She had never felt so full. She licked her lips, lapping up a few crumbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you thirsty?\" Lauren asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, kinda,\" Carrie said, slouching in her seat and rubbing her solid tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you something,\" Lauren said merrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maid stood up for the first time, her uniform springing up as he stood, exposing her globular butt cheeks and lacey panties. She tried to tug her uniform back down, but it was stretched tight across her newly chubby figure. Carrie gawked at her as she walked across the room, wondering how she had grown so quickly. She hadn't quite noticed the thicker thighs and double chin before, but that was definitely not normal. What was weirder was that Lauren had eaten even less than Carrie, and other than her bloated belly, Carrie hadn't really changed at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren reached for what appeared to be a large jug of milk and brought it back to the chair, offering the whole pitcher to Carrie. \"Here you go,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that milk?\" Carrie asked, peering into the jug curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really good,\" Lauren said enthusiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Carrie said, uncertainly. She groaned as she sat back up in her seat, her belly spilling into her lap, almost reaching her knees. She gently took the pitcher from Lauren's hands and raised it to her lips, taking a sip, then a gulp, then just full on chugging it down. She hadn't realized quite how thirsty she was, and found herself just gulping and gulping as the sweet tasting milk flowed into her already over burdened belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren placed her hands on Carrie's stomach and started to gently massage it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie twitched at the sudden touching, her body shaking slightly as she savoured Lauren's hands on her sensitive, expanded belly. She swallowed the last of the milk and wiped her mouth with her arm, before giving a groan. \"URRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\" Carrie belched noisily, blushing with embarrassment as Lauren giggled at the gluttonous display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While a combination of the milk and Lauren's gentle massaging had eased the pressure within her stomach, she still felt incredibly stuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm glad!\" Lauren giggled, a hand returning to Carrie's taut belly. Once again, Carrie shivered as she felt the slightly warm hand press against her overburdened stomach and begin to gently rub circles. Relaxing in her seat, Carrie let out a happy sigh. She could easily fall asleep here. Though, as much as Lauren's gentle movements threatened to send her into a deep sleep, an odd pressure in her chest prevented her from doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy do my breasts feel so... full? Carrie wondered, glancing down at her soft bust. Through her groggy eyes, she saw nothing particularly amiss with her chest, aside from the numerous stains from her food. And yet, she could feel the fullness gradually increasing all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, Lauren?\" She eventually mumbled. <br>\r\n \"Hmm?\" The maid answered. <br>\r\n \"Is there something wrong with my chest? It feels really full...\"<br>\r\nLauren paused before letting out a giggle. <br>\r\n \"Oh, that? Nothing to worry about!\" She said cheerfully. \"Just relax, okay?\"<br>\r\nCarrie nodded, sinking further into her seat. However, as much as she tried, she couldn't ignore the steadily increasing pressure within her breasts. It was almost like somebody was stuffing them full of food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's impossible, she thought. The only thing breasts can hold is milk, and I'm definitely not pregnant!<br>\r\nCarrie chuckled at the thought. However, her chuckled were interrupted as a few, almost inaudible pings attracted her attention. Sitting up and rubbing her eyes, Carrie stared down at her body, her grogginess quickly turning to disbelief and shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ample chest, softened slightly from her constant snacking, had exploded in size. Each breast had easily doubled in size, ripping through the last few buttons on her shirt with ease. As for her bra, it was stretched tightly over her huge tits, flesh spilling out of the top of the cups and bulging out from underneath them. Reaching down, Carrie nervously poked a finger into one of them. She shivered as a twinge of pleasure raced through her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was certainly confused by her sudden growth, Lauren didn't seem too concerned by it. She was still massaging Carrie's stomach while also sneaking a few cupcakes from a nearby platter into her mouth. Noticing Carrie staring at her, she swallowed quickly and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is something wrong?\" Lauren asked.<br>\r\n \"You could say that!\" Carrie cried out. \"What happened to my breasts?!\"<br>\r\n \"Huh?\"<br>\r\nLauren stared at her breasts as though she had just noticed them. Dropping her cupcake, she gently rubbed the underside of one, causing Carrie to shiver again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Intriguing...\" Lauren whispered to herself, grabbing a handful of flesh. Carrie shuffled in her seat as Lauren began to simultaneously massage her belly and grope her breasts...</span></div></div>",

At first she dismissed it as just a pleasurable sensation, but as it the tingling intensified, she began to feel her nipples getting damp. Before she could realise what was happening, she found herself letting out a guttural moan as a full blown jet of milk exploded from her nipples, soaking her bra. Carrie was completely taken aback, and from the looks of her face, so was Lauren. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...did I just...leak milk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren's look of surprise turned to delight as she realised what had happened. Grinning wildly, she grabbed hold of Carrie's milk soaked bra and yanked it away from her body in one swift motion. Carrie went red with embarrassment as her bra was thrown over Lauren's shoulder and her breasts jiggled free. She wasn't entirely comfortable with just being exposed like that, but her reservations were quickly quieted by Lauren's hands massaged her naked, swollen tits. She gave a moan as she felt pressure building up once again. Bracing herself for another explosion, Carrie instead saw Lauren place her lips over her right nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's questioned was answered before she could even finish the sentence. Lauren prepared herself for the next stream of milk and started sucking greedily on Carrie's nipple. Carrie's left breasts sprayed another jet of milk across the room, causing her to moan noisily, while Lauren began to gulp down the milk from her other breast, squeezing and kneading her boob-flesh to increase the flow of milk. Carrie just sat back and enjoyed the sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lauren suckled away, Carrie had to clasp her hand over her other nipple to stop milk from spurting everywhere. Lauren noticed this and helpfully moved across, placing her mouth over the other breast and going back and forth between both, hungrily gulping down everything that was flowing out of Carrie's bloated tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the flow of milk continued, Lauren's stomach was steadily inflating. Her already bloated belly began to expand with every mouthful of milk, causing further pressure to be added to her already overstretched maid's outfit. The little black number was rising higher, pushing past her thick thighs and up above her stomach, revealing her belly button and the underside of her rounding belly. \"Mmmf...so good...\" Lauren mumbled between mouthfuls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally managed to full herself away, Carrie's breasts had shrunken down considerably. Not quite back to their old size, but with the milk drained, they could, once again, fit comfortably into her bra. Carrie would have put it back on, but found herself too full and horny to pick the discarded garment back up, so lay back with her breasts exposed, quite enjoying the feeling. She looked over at Lauren, who was rubbing her own distended belly, looking rather full...</span></div></div>",

Like Carrie, she had reclined in her seat, allowing her belly to sit atop her pale thighs. Still incredibly horny after having her breasts drained, Carrie grunted as she pushed herself towards Lauren. As she neared her, an arm reaching out to pull the maid closer to her, Carrie froze as a gurgle emanated from Lauren. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ohhh... Ahhhhhh...\"<br>\r\nLauren let out a blissful moan as she continued to caress her swollen, solid tummy. As if responding to her touch, it gurgled and groaned in a worrying manner, yet Lauren didn't seem to concerned about it. Carrie, however, was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lauren?\" She asked, her horniness gradually turning to concern. \"Are you okay? Cause your belly doesn't sound like it is...\"<br>\r\nLauren didn't respond to Carrie's question, instead groaning loudly as another immense gurgle was emitted from her bulging gut. Worried for her new friend, Carrie watched with awe as Lauren's belly, with another gurgle, began to soften under her touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it did, the rest of her plump body began to swell. A second chin now encircled her cute face, which bore a set of soft cheeks that only added to her cuteness. Her breasts pushed the neckline of her dress downwards, revealing more and more of her gradually deepening cleavage. Beneath it, her belly simultaneously shrunk and swelled until Lauren bore a hefty beer gut. Beneath her, her rear end grew rounder and rounder, her black panties slowly slipping into her crack. And finally, her thighs began to inch towards one another, stopping when her pale flesh brushed together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lauren's sudden growth came to a stop, Carrie stared at the thick maid with mixed emotions. Part of her wanted to grab her, pull her into a long kiss and grope those enticing butt cheeks. Another part of her wanted a little revenge, to stuff her full of as much food as she could find. A third part desired her bigger, to see Lauren fill the chair they currently sat on. And what was left, which wasn't much, wanted answers. Why did her breasts suddenly fill with milk? Who was Lauren? And where was Stacey?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Carrie...</span></div></div>",

Reaching down, she grabbed hold of the now comically undersized Maid's uniform and pulled it up, exposing the entirety of Lauren's round, soft gut. Her eyes widening at the sight, Carrie moved her hands gently over the expanse of Lauren's newly acquired pot belly, sinking her fingers into the soft flab and grabbing at the new rolls that had developed a few moments ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you...you're so...plump...\" Carrie grinned, jiggling Lauren's hefty belly excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren smiled as her flabby stomach was groped and prodded at. \"So plump,\" she repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get so big so quick? I don't get it...\" Carrie asked, but Lauren just moaned in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really caring about the answer to her question right now, Carrie continued her exploration of the maid's once slender body, stroking a hand along her thick thighs, which had widened so much that Carrie could probably have sat comfortably in her lap. She spotted her frilly lace panties, now constrained about her swollen rear end, and wanted to rip them off, but decided to control herself for the moment. Travelling back up, Carrie instead went to remove the tiny, overstretched uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren complied happily, raising her hands above her head and allowing Carrie to pull the uniform up off over her head and throw it aside. As it landed on the floor, Carrie was amazed it hadn't just exploded off a few moments ago. The seams were pulling apart and it was obviously not made for someone of Lauren's current weight at all. Carrie returned her attention to the cute, chubbed-up blonde sitting beside her, now clad in some very tight, sexy black underwear. Her enlarged breasts were practically overflowing her bra, and Carrie had to fight not to just plunge her face into the mountain of cleavage before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she returned to massaging Lauren's cute, bloated tummy, moving her hands in circles as Lauren moaned softly...</span></div></div>",

However, each time she glanced at them, her gaze lingered on them just a little longer and more and more lewd thoughts began to enter her head. At first, she saw herself merely looking at them, then poking at them, then roughly groping them before she saw herself finally burying her face in that inticing cleavage. The thought of doing so made Carrie swallow hungrily. Slowly, a hand began to drift towards one of the maid's breasts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lauren, between her recent filling drink and Carrie's gentle touch, had fallen into a daze. She stared straight ahead, her mouth moving wordlessly to emit the occasional moan. She knew Carrie gazed at her nearly bare chest every so often, but it didn't bother her. What did bother her was that Carrie, despite her lustful looks, wasn't acting upon them. She wanted her bra ripped from her chest, revealing her plump chest to the world. She wanted to know what it felt like to have her breasts sucked on, even though she wasn't producing any milk like Carrie had been. And hell, why stop there? Why not get rid of her panties as well? Everything felt so... constricting. All she wanted was to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"H-Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren finally emitted spoke, albeit a near inaudible noise of confusion. She no longer felt hands playing with her belly. Rather, those hands seemed to pressed against the sides of her bra, squeezing the two flabby orbs together. Glancing over at Carrie, Lauren saw an intense expression on her face as she began to play with her exposed breast flesh and bra. Pleasure began to race through her body, making her breathing sharp and lustful...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Lauren sharply inhale, Carrie took that as a sign that she could try a little more. Pressing her fingers between flesh and cup, she began to pull slightly. She hadn't intending to damage the fairly expensive looking bra, however its owner had different ideas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren's own hands came flying up, joining Carrie's. With one swift tug, Lauren ripped her bra from her body, revealing her bare bust in all its soft glory to Carrie, whose mouth hung open in amazement. She had never seen anything so... soft and round...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Touch them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren practically breathed that into Carrie's ear, making her shiver. Without hesitation, she obeyed, each hand roughly gripping a breast. Lauren groaned loudly as Carrie began to massage and knead the plush flesh within her fingers. As she did, Lauren reached down, fingering the waistband of her panties. She couldn't quite get them off, which disappointed her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Until Carrie noticed what she was trying to do and, with a grunt, reached down and slid them down her thick thighs. They hung around her ankles, joining her black heels, until Lauren kicked them both off. Now clad in only her headdress, she returned her attention to Carrie, just in time to see her plunge her head into her breasts. Both girls moaned loudly as Carrie pulled her head back, her face the very expression of lust and want...</span></div></div>",

She suddenly felt a pair of hands reach up and fiddle with her bra strap, and before she knew what was happening, unclasp it and pull it aside. Carrie's breasts tumbled free, dropping down slightly and bumped against Lauren's own, swollen pair. Carrie hadn't been prepared for the sudden stripping, but her look of shock quickly turned into one of delight as she felt her breasts squeeze against Lauren's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren's hands reached around Carrie's bloated stomach and began to massage it in circles. \"Greedy girl,\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who's talking, chubby,\" Carrie giggled as she gave Lauren's much larger gut a playful pat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm such a pig,\" Lauren grinned proudly, sliding her hands down to Carrie's skirt and gently unzipping it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie initially looked startled as she felt cool air hit her thighs, then she pulled back and allowed her skirt to slip to the floor, leaving her in only her panties. She sat herself down on Lauren's lap, just about managing to perch on her thick thighs and allowing their round bellies to touch. Lauren gave a groan of pleasure as she felt Carrie's body press against her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like me better this way?\" Lauren asked, hefting one of her huge breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie wasn't sure how to answer that. Did she prefer Lauren fat? She wanted to say yes. She was so big, so round, so soft...and Carrie had helped make her that way. \"I...I don't know...but...I like it...\" Carrie said, stroking a finger over Lauren's breasts down to her belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren suddenly reached for Carrie's increasingly damp panties and tore them away from her body in one quick motion. \"H-hey! I need to wear those!\" Carrie protested, but her worries were quickly silenced as Lauren reached up and kissed her. The two naked, chubby girls sat perched on the sofa, their bodies squeezed so tightly together that they could barely move...</span></div></div>",

Unlike her belly, which had swollen into a solid ball of food that pressed against Lauren's malleable gut, her breasts were practically unaffected by her binge. They were a little soft, but nothing compared to the pair she was happily playing with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that wasn't all that annoyed Carrie.  She loved how plump Lauren's belly was, how her finger practically sank into her ass cheeks. While doing it felt great, she wanted to feel what it felt like to have somebody do that to her. She wanted to feel Lauren's hands play with her own multi-rolled belly, to feel her own rear end roughly massaged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lauren leaned in to kiss her again, Carrie found herself pulling away. She instantly regretted it when she caught sight of the hurt in Lauren's eyes, but toughed it out. She fully intended to return to this, but only when she herself was a little... rounder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's wrong?\" Lauren asked, her hands ceasing their massaging of Carrie's stuffed gut. \"Did I do something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, not at all!\" Carrie said quickly. \"It's just... I don't feel like I'm... ready for this yet. But, if you're willing to help me, I could be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do I need to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren's immediate answer both surprised and pleased Carrie. She wasn't sure how she would react to her sudden retreat, but now, she was sure she wanted nobody else at her side, helping her achieve her goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Feed me,\" Carrie ordered her. \"I want to be the same size as you, so we're on equal footing. I want you to enjoy my body just as much as I'll enjoy yours. Now, food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting off Lauren's lap, Carrie planted her backside next to her and eagerly awaited her stuffing...</span></div></div>",

Carrie popped one into her mouth eagerly as she waited for the remainder of the platters to be dumped beside her. Lauren walked back over, smiling in anticipation, her soft, doughy belly and heavy breasts jiggled as she walked, causing Carrie to drool a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Lauren asked, kneeling in front of her and pushing Carrie's legs aside so she could inch closer towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie blushed as she felt Lauren's breasts brush against her thighs. She nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren grabbed a huge, oversized muffin and began the feeding once again, cramming it into Carrie's waiting mouth. Carrie still felt uncomfortably full, but she was desperate to grow some more. She wanted to be bigger, rounder, sexier. Like Lauren. She had always enjoyed the idea of growing as a fetish or fantasy, but never quite accepted the idea of actually getting fatter until now. It was all she could think about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren had really stepped up her game now, sandwiching cake together, choosing the most caloric foods and pushing them past Carrie's lips as quickly as she could. Carrie ate as quickly as she could, but her stomach was already packed full of food, and the extra additions were beginning to cause her to bloat quite painfully, her already solid, round tummy struggled to cope with the constant stream of cakes she was swallowing, and she moaned in discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghhhh...I...I don't think I can...BURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren stopped for a moment and started to massage Carrie's heavy, taught gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I thought I'd have grown by now, like you?\" Carrie asked, suppressing another belch as her stomach gargled ominously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well no...this is just regular food,\" Lauren said. \"I only got this big because I was forbidden to eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's faced dropped. \"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you think you were going to get bigger straight away?\" Lauren asked innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie nodded. \"Well yeah...kinda...URRRRRRRRRRRP!\" She covered her mouth, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooooooooh,\" Lauren said, understanding for the first time. \"Well there are still ways we can make you grow quicker, don't worry!\"</span></div></div>",

She took a deep breath before letting out a shout that startled Carrie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"LADY BELVIEW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shout echoed around the room for a moment before disappearing off into the silence of the house. For a minute or two, there was no response. This didn't seem to worry Lauren, who remained standing in the centre of the room and staring at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um, Lauren?\" Carrie finally asked, only to be immediately shushed by Lauren. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Quiet!\" She said urgently. \"She's waking up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Carrie could ask who was waking up, a loud stomp rattled the door. Her head flicked to the door, just in time to see it physically shake as another loud stomp was heard outside it. Looking back at Lauren, Carrie saw that she still wasn't too concerned with whoever was outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lauren, who, or what, is it?\" Carrie demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why, darling...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie yelped as a disembodied voice, more mature and sultry sounding than Lauren's, bounced around the room. Glancing towards the door, Carrie pulled her knees up to her bare chest as it began to creak open. At the same time, Lauren bowed, her breasts falling downwards as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"... It's awfully rude for the guest to ask who the owner is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door suddenly swung open, revealing an immense woman clad in an antique dress. The hem of it swayed as she strode into the room, stopping in front of Lauren. Her belly, reaching a good number of feet in front of her,  rushed against Lauren's head, the contact making Lauren straighten up. As she did, the figure let out a coo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aw, you're beginning to put on a few pounds!\" The figure purred, reaching out a gloved hand to stroke Lauren's belly. \"While that is adorable, you know I have to punish you for eating from my private stash\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren bowed her head, mumbling a quiet apology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, I could never stay mad at you!\" The figure said, ruffling Lauren's hair. \"But why did you wake me, Lauren? You know what I said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do not awaken me unless Lord Martin returns,\" Lauren said mechanically. \"I regret to inform you that Lord Martin has not returned. Rather, my reasons are more... selfish than that, My Lady\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh? Colour me intrigued...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren turned to Carrie, who was still huddled in a ball. The figure also turned, however her face was obscured in darkness. All Carrie could make out was that her face, like her body, was very round and very plump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure regarded her for a moment before nodding and turning back to Lauren. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see... And what would you have me do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren glanced at Carrie, flashing her a reassuring smile, before turning back to the figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, she wishes to be... bigger, like me. I also wish this and hope that you would grant me this one selfish wish. In return, I can only offer my eternal gratitude...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure nodded again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You have served me faithfully for many years... Consider this your payment for the last century. I assume you have an idea of what you wish done to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I was thinking you could make her a maid, like me. That way, she would be punished for eating the food of the house. Or, if you were willing, you could use your powers to change her. And finally, you could take her as... as your host!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that last one, Carrie pulled herself tighter into her ball. Her new host? Did that mean possession? And did that mean that the dark figure was a... a ghost?! Then, if that was true, then this house truly was haunted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And what does she wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up, Carrie stifled a scream as she found the figure towering over her. Even though she was mere inches away, she still couldn't make out the figure's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's alright!\" Lauren said soothingly, joining the figure. \"All options are completely fine! You'll still be you, only... bigger! And then, we can pick up where we left off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie nodded, taking a deep breath before answering...</span></div></div>",

However, she had a sneaking suspicion that, whatever was happening, it wasn't what she desires. With each second that ticked by, her body felt... lighter, more than anything. Plus, she could feel something forming over her skin, something light and soft...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carrie began to wonder whether or not this had been a mistake on her part, Lady Belview pulled her hand away. The blue glow persisted for another few seconds before gradually dying down. And even when it had fully vanished, returning the room to its dimly lit state, Carrie was still blind, the light having been that intense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"O-Oh my...\" She heard Lauren mutter. \"That wasn't what I was expecting at all, my Lady...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Unfortunately for the two of you, all maids must start at the same point,\" Lady Belview stated. \"That way, there is no discrimination by body type. But now that she belongs to me, I care not what she looks like. Do as you wish. Just remember, the two of you have duties to carry out\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh... Lady Belview?\" Carrie asked timidly. \"I still can't see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh? Oh dear, my apologies!\" Lady Belview chuckled. \"Must have been your first experience with magic! Worry not, your vision should return about... now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lady Belview clapped her hands together with a meaty slap, Carrie's vision slowly returned to her. As eager as she was to see her new body, she kept her eyes firmly trained on Lauren. However, judging by her anxious expression, something hadn't gone quite right. Only when her vision had fully returned to her did Carrie find out that nothing had gone the way she had wanted it to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"W-What?\" She mumbled in shock. \"What... Why... What am I so slim?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than fattening up to Lauren's size as she had been hoping, Carrie had gone on the other direction. Her distended belly had shrunk away into nothingness, leaving her midriff flat. Even the slight layer of pudge she had developed from snacking in her old job had vanished. Even her breasts and behind, which had had a slight ripple to them before, had become more firm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only somewhat welcome change to her body was what now covered it. Her naked form had been clothed in a black French Maid's dress, similar to Lauren's, meaning there was a decent sized window revealing her cleavage and the hem of the skirt just about covered her rear end. However, unlike Lauren's, which had left her legs bare, Carrie had a pair of semi-transparent black stockings covering her legs. And underneath it, she could feel a new bra and pair of panties clinging to her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As I said, all maids start at the same point,\" Lady Belview said. \"I imagine you won't stay like this for long, however, given the state you've left my snack room in. Now...\"</span></div></div>",

She gave a yelp and pulled it back, glowering up at Lady Aurelia. \"What did you do that for?\" She pouted. \"I was only-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough,\" Lady Belview said, her voice growing louder and deeper. \"Do not question your Mistress, ever again. You serve at my pleasure. I decided what you get and when. Do you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie understood well enough, but she wasn't sure now comfortable she was with this arrangement. When she made the deal with this behemoth of a woman, she had expected to just expand her body, not her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \"Sure...\" she said, rubbing the back of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now then girls, I have some tasks I would like carried out, since I'm awake,\" Lady Belview crossed the room to where Lauren stood, massaging her naked, overfed tummy. \"You can hardly work in that condition either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww,\" Lauren sighed, looking down into her massive cleavage sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Belview waved a hand and a cloud of energy enveloped Lauren, crackling and sweeping over her body. When it cleared, she had shed all of her excess weight, and returned to the slender, petite size she had been when Carrie first met her. Carrie had to admit, she was sorry to see all that extra weight just go up in smoke, but Lauren did still look damn cute. Her nakedness lasted only for a second before Lady Belview waved a hand nonchalantly, and a brand new uniform appeared on her body. Lauren sighed, but then smiled happily, apparently making her peace with her transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying, I have chores that I need carrying out,\" Lady Belview said, folding her bulky arms across her ample chest. \"I cannot go into the east wing without that infuriating Lord Martin trying to trap my essence in some sort of reliquary, so I need the two of you to find some items in my old storage closet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of items?\" Carrie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a small lock-box there, with golden trim, which contains some rather...potent magics I was working on before I shuffled off my mortal coil. I'm sure the two of you, working together, will easily be able to retrieve them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound so hard,\" Lauren shrugged, exchanging a smile with Carrie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Belview chuckled softly. \"No, I'm sure it doesn't. Now run along girls, time is a'wasting. Once you get back, you can enjoy as much of my treat room as you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Lady Belview turned and swept out of the room, passing silently through the door.

Sadly, Lauren didn't have the same idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Shall we, Carrie?\" Lauren asked, making her way towards the door without even glancing at the remaining treats. Hesitating for a moment, Carrie eventually followed her partner to the door, albeit it in an incredibly reluctant and slow manner. Upon reaching the door, which Lauren strode through when she reached it, Carrie hesitated again, casting a final longing glance at the delicious treats, before following Lauren out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking their way down the corridor, the duo walked on in relative silence. Lauren was busy humming a quiet yet uplifting time to herself, while Carrie was seriously reconsidering her choice to work as a maid. She had grown quite attached to her old job and had seen herself working it for a good number of years. And now, here she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I'm still employed there?</i> She wondered, following Lauren down a worn set of stairs that had, once upon a time, probably been very grand and opulent. <i>After all, how are they meant to know I got a job as a maid? I wonder if Lady Belview wouldn't mind me working both jobs? It would mean more money and more food for me... Wait, do I get paid for working here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she had the opportunity to ask Lauren about her pay, her partner stopped in front of a set of rotting double doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The item Lady Belview has tasked us with retrieving is through here,\" Lauren explained, gesturing to the door. \"However, a word of warning. The man that Lady Belview mentioned, Lord Martin, made his home in this part of the house. As servants of Lady Belview, he may take issue with us poking around. If he does, allow me to do the talking. He and I... know one another\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Know one another?\" Carrie asked curiously. \"Like, Master and Maid, or something more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Merely Master and Servant.

Unlike the elaborate, fancily decorated grand hall and master bedroom of Lady Aurelia, this end of the mansion seemed much more basic in design. The doors, floors and walls were all a strange, obsidian marble, which looked as though it had been recently polished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this place is classy...I mean...classier...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I have to work pretty hard to keep it spic and span. Lord Martin would have not have it any other way,\" Lauren replied. \"Lady Aurelia let her part of the house fall into disrepair before I came into her service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was about to ask how exactly Lauren had come to work in this place, when she found her eyes wandering down to the petite Maid's bubble butt. It was amazing to think she had been so chubby just a few minutes ago. Carrie had to admit, she kind of missed the fat, greedy Lauren, but the slender Lauren was equally appealing. Unable to help herself, she reached out a hand and squeezed one of Lauren's perfectly round cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren giggled, looking over her shoulder at a blushing Carrie. \"Oh, you like my butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like it even more if it grew out of those panties,\" Carrie said, hardly believing she had actually managed to say those words aloud without cringing. Ever since she met Lauren she had just felt so incredibly frisky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to do our work first,\" Lauren said. \"Fun later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie sighed. She would just have to restrain herself until then. She couldn't wait to get back to the treat room. Up ahead, Lauren stopped in front of a large, black door and produced a large skeleton key from a pocket on her uniform. She looked around anxiously, then quickly turned the key in the lock and pulled Carrie inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the rush?\" Carrie asked as she was yanked inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably be quick,\" Lauren said, closing the door behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie looked around the room; there was nothing particularly grand about this one. No bed, no decorations, just another marble floor and wall with two large stone pillars and a strange looking altar in it's centre. On the altar was a small, wooden box with a gold trim, which Carrie guessed must have been what they were here for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be it,\" Lauren said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls took a step closer, heading for the box...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was an odd feeling, one she couldn't quite identify. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"L-Lauren?\" Carrie eventually said, stopping. \"Do you feel alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few steps ahead of her, Lauren also stopped. Looking back, Carrie caught sight of her expression, which looked rather ragged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"N-No, I don't...\" Lauren mumbled. \"And I'm not entirely sure why...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Same... I'm heading back to the corridor,\" Carrie said, turning on her heel. \"Maybe it's something about this room, but I just feel real strange\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way back to the door, the strange sensation afflicting her gradually disappeared until she had reached the door, where it vanished altogether, leaving Carrie feeling completely fine. Lauren, on the other hand, hadn't followed her back and was continuing towards the box. Carrie watched anxiously as her partner began to visibly struggle the closer they got to the box. Her bare legs began to wobble, while she began to breath heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Maybe you should stop, Lauren?\" Carrie suggested from the doorway. \"There's something wrong with this room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"N-No...\" Lauren coughed in response. \"I was... given a job... and I intend to... finish it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But you're clearly not well!\" Carrie argued. \"I'm sure Lady Belview would understand that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren merely groaned in response. She was only a few feet from the box now, however her pace was clumsy and incredibly slow. She was practically dragging her feet across the ground, her heels leaving faint white scratches on the dark floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, sod it!</i> Carrie thought. <i>If she can handle it, then so can I!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurrying forwards, Carrie did her best to ignore the unidentifiable feeling building within her. However, the closer she got, the more intense and demanding it got. About halfway there, she was forced to stop for a moment to catch her breath before continuing towards the box, which Lauren had now reached, albeit in a bad state. She was panting heavily, sweat running down her brow, and she was leaning on the box's alter for support, her wobbling legs presumably too weak to support her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>C-Come on, Carrie...</i> Carrie urged herself. <i>You... You can make it! </i></span></div></div>",

So she focused on the box and tried to drag herself towards it once again. But before she could get any further, an arm grabbed hold of hers and yanked her back. Carrie moaned, partly out of disappointment, partly out of nauseousness and partly out of fear, but she found herself feeling a lot better as the hand dragged her across to the other side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...wh...what's happening...who are you?\" Carrie asked, rubbing her eyes as the room stopped spinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Martin Harrison, dear girl,\" the man said, brushing himself down. \"As I said, it really is best you do not open that box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie looked over the man, who couldn't have been that much older than herself, but had a distinctly old fashioned sense of dress, if not a stylish one. He was pretty good looking too. \"We were sent to find it, to be fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, by who?\" Lord Martin raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Carrie could answer, Lauren leapt forward and wrapped herself around Martin, entangling his body in an affectionate hug. \"Thank you my Lord!\" She squealed, squeezing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" Lord Martin said awkwardly, gently disentangling himself from her embrace. \"Time for that later. Who is your co-worker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking a little disappointed to have been pushed away, Lauren gestured to Carrie and regained her smile. \"This is Carrie, we work together now. Lady Aurelia sent us to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I might have guessed,\" Martin sighed. \"That corpulent madam should retrieve her own blasted box, if she can still move beneath her ridiculous girth, that is. How dare she endanger my favourite maid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren's eyes lit up as she was referred to as his \"favourite\" and she made a pleased squeak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what would have happened if we had opened the box?\" Carrie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might have been torn to shreds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or just thrown up. I'm really not sure. I only looked in that box once and it wasn't pleasant,\" Martin said. \"Now then, best be on your way ladies, but you're more than welcome to stay in one of my rooms while Lady Belview finds something else to amuse herself.

She could dimly hear Lauren and Lord Martin berating her from across the room, but it seemed to her that the only thing inside the box had been a cloud of dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, nothing to worry about,\" Carrie said, the smoke around her gradually dissipating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...Carrie...you might want to...look up...\" Lauren said nervously, gesturing to the space above Carrie's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was almost afraid to look, but she craned her neck and tilted her head towards the ceiling, where the last of the dark smoke was now disappearing into the air. To her amazement, she was greeted by the sight of three small, scaly little creatures crawling around on the ceiling. Each of the creatures was a different colour; one red, one grey and one green, and they reach had forked tails and a small pair of bat-like wings. They looked down at Carrie and smiled wickedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are those things?!\" Carrie shrieked, backing away towards the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Martin already had his hand on the doorknob, and was slipping out of the room. \"Lady Belview's little helpers,\" he snarled. \"You'll get no more help from me until those repulsive creatures are gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn hearing the insult, the red Imp hissed and flew towards the door, but Martin slammed it shut, sending the shrieking Imp slamming straight into it headfirst.

She gave a yelp and spun around, trying to remove the small, green creature that was now tugging at her Maid's uniform with sharp claws. Lauren tried to intervene, but the red Imp on the floor latched onto her leg. She tried to kick it off, but it was clinging on for dear life, cackling in a high pitched, gleeful voice. The other creature just circled them all, enjoying the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get this thing off me!\" Carrie squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying!\" Lauren said, jumping up and down in an attempt to knock her own tormentor off of her leg. \"These things are stronger than they look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie ran for the door again, but the grey Imp overhead swooped down and landed on her front. It looked up at her with smiling, pointed teeth. \"Don't leave yet,\" it hissed. \"We're not done having fun with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie swiped at the creature, and it leapt into the air again, before swooping down and tearing at her outfit, ripping away part of her frilly skirt. Lauren, meanwhile, finally managed to kick off her own Imp, and reached out for Carrie, grabbing her hand and pulling her towards the door...</span></div></div>",

The third imp let out a disappointed screech as it soared through the air where Lauren's head had been. However, it quickly recovered from its failed air strike and resumed its position floating lazily above their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"T-Thanks, Carrie!\" Lauren breathed heavily, attempting to swat away another imp. \"Hold still a second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing for a brief second, Carrie allowed her to aim a slap at the third imp, who had been trying to sneak up on the duo. Once again, it let out a disappointed screech and floated off, hovering just out of reach of the two girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Guess it's my turn to thank you!\" Carrie said, pulling an imp from her skirt. \"But we can't fend them off forever! We need to get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in agreement, the pair resumed their rush towards the door. As they neared it, however, two of the imps descended down in front of it, cruel grins spread across their faces. With their exit blocked, the duo faltered for a moment, unsure of what they were meant to do next. As they desperately wracked their minds for a plan, the final imp soared towards them, cackling madly as it drew closer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Goodness, could you keep it down?! Some of us are trying to stalk unwanted visitors through the halls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door behind the two imps suddenly swung open, smacking the two imps across the back and sending them hurtling towards the floor. The third imp came to a halt, floating mere inches from Lauren's head, while the two girls looked expectantly towards the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the doorway was a teenage girl with blonde hair and startling blue eyes. An unhappy expression adorned her face as she observed the room. Her gaze lingered on Carrie and Lauren for a few seconds before they flicked up to the imp floating above them, at which point she let out an irritated sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You let the imps out of their box?!\" She demanded, glaring at the two maids. \"You know how irritating it is to get them back in?! They'll only listen to a Belview, of which there are only two left! Luckily for you, you've got the privilege of looking upon Lady Alice Belview, the more powerful of the two sisters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling smugly, Alice strode into the room. As she did, the imps chattered worriedly amongst themselves, retreating as they did so. However, they failed to notice Carrie and Lauren sneak behind them. As they drew closer to them, they reached out and grabbed them. As soon as they made contact, they screeched loudly and began clawing at their hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hurry up!\" Carrie yelled, trying to ignore the pain of having two imps clawing at her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Please hurry, Lady Alice!\" Lauren chimed in, flinching as one bit her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, yes, hold on...\" Alice grumbled, pointing her finger at each one in turn before reaching her other hand out towards the box. The box vibrated and rose up from the ground, gradually righting itself as it did so. When it was upright, the lid flipped open and a sound akin to a hoover filled the room. The imps all let out desperate walls as their small forms were sucked towards the box, eventually disappearing into it. As soon as the third one vanished into it, the box shut itself and fell to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There!\" Alice said, brushing her hands together. \"That wasn't so difficult! However, it was totally uncalled for. You two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren and Carrie exchanged a worried look before approaching Alice, who looked even unhappier now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Tell me this,\" Alice asked, her voice dangerously sweet. \"Why were those deplorable imps outside their box, hm? Which one of you let them out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two maids exchanged another look before Carrie hesitantly raised her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I-It was me, Lady Alice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice turned her icy gaze on her. Under it, Carrie shuffled nervously. The way her gaze drilled into her... She had been in a few uncomfortable situations in her life, but what was happening now went way beyond any of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmmm... I don't recognize you,\" Alice finally said. \"But even so, you deserve punishment for what you have done. And technically, so do you, Lauren, for failing to stop her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren hung her head in shame. Carrie cast a sad glance at her before bravely stepping forwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"N-No!\" She declared. \"It was all my fault! I was curious about what the box held! Lauren tried to stop me opening it! She doesn't deserve any... punishment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie trailed off as Alice turned to her cold gaze to her once more. Maybe she shouldn't have tried to take the entire blame...</span></div></div>",

Well, I'm not sure if she hired Lauren, but she definitely hired me! And that means I'll only listen to her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, you sweet, naive girl...\" Alice tutted. \"You obviously didn't read the contract, did you?

Alice was right, she didn't read the contract. She didn't even ask if she could see one. She just accepted what Lady Belview told her and agreed to it, eager to grow like Lauren had. A stupid reason, now that she looked back on it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now, what shall we do to the two of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice crossed her arms and stepped closer to the duo.

Looking back ahead, she tried to ignore Alice, who was now circling them like a shark circled blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmm... Lauren, I believe the usual punishment will apply for you,\" Alice finally said, pausing in front of Lauren. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-Yes, Lady Alice...\" Lauren replied meekly, nodding slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And as for you, new girl...

Before he realises I'm sneaking around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren began to move forwards, Alice trailing behind her. For a moment, Carrie considered trying to escape, but the way Alice had been treating the two of them... Chances were high that she'd just hoist both punishments onto Lauren, which wouldn't be fair on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hurry up, new girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie jogged after the duo, joining them partway down the corridor. As she did, she fell in line next to Lauren, who was still looking dejectedly at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So, what's our punishment?\" Carrie asked quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your punishment,\" Alice interrupted from behind them, \"Is to...\"</span></div></div>",

Between the two sisters that she had to listen to, Lady Belview was definitely the better.

And believe me, I can think of much worse punishments than helping that Chef. Now, if you'll excuse me, there appears to be an intruder in my parlour\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice disappeared off down the hallway, leaving the two maids alone. Lauren turned to continue towards the kitchens, while Carrie dithered in the hallway for a few more seconds. Alice had mentioned an intruder. Could it possibly be one of her other friends? Or even Stacey?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Carrie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her head, Carrie found herself looking into Lauren's concerned face. She admired it for a few moments, the way her eyes glittered in the dull light of the corridor, her silky brown hair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We need to get moving,\" Lauren said, seemingly oblivious to Carrie's gaze. \"I know Lady Alice is much less... pleasant... to deal with than Lady Belview or Lord Martin, but we shouldn't get on her bad side! I know from personal experience that her punishments can get much worse than helping Elizabeth in the kitchen\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie nodded slowly, allowing Lauren to take her hand and lead her down the corridor. As she walked, she realized that her head felt a little weird. She had been thinking about people earlier, hadn't she? Her... friends?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's right, I came here with friends looking for... someone?</i> Carrie tried to recall, but found she had trouble. <i>Emma, Beth... Um... Kate? No, Katie. And we were looking for... S-Stacey? Yeah, that's right. Why is this so hard to recall? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie did her best to keep the names of her friends in her head, yet as she walked, hand in hand with Lauren, their names kept threatening to float away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Welcome to the Kitchens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the duo walked into the kitchen, which was surprisingly well stocked and well lit for a house that was meant to be abandoned, they were instantly spotted by the lone resident of the room. As she bustled over, a smile on her pale face, Carrie's eyes were instantly drawn to a certain part of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nT-That's definitely a chest... She thought, watching the woman's massive breasts ripple slightly behind her apron. Compared to the rest of her body, which was relatively slim, they looked way out of place. Turning her head slightly to look at Lauren, Carrie couldn't help but envision Lauren with a chest as equally as large...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm Elizabeth, the resident chef for the Mansion!\" The woman introduced herself, pausing in front of the duo. \"Lady Alice has already informed me that the two of you will be assisting me today. Lauren, I know you're familiar with what your tasks are, however I'm sure your new partner isn't! Care to fill her in while I get started over here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth hurried off, chest resuming its hypnotic bouncing, while Lauren turned to Carrie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Basically,\" She began to explain, \"Our role down here is to...\"</span></div></div>",

However, I'm bound to cook whatever is ordered from the Dining Hall, so cook I shall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding what she was looking for, Elizabeth turned to the duo, ingredients piled high within her arms. She flashed the duo a brief smile before dropping them on a nearby countertop, where she began to sort through them. As she did so, Lauren took a seat at a table in the corner and beckoned Carrie over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As friendly as she may sound, Elizabeth isn't a fan of having people help her while she cooks,\" Lauren said with a disappointed sigh. \"She'll only accept help from somebody if ordered to. A shame, as I do so enjoy cooking with her. She truly is a culinary master...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Can I ask something, Lauren?\" Carrie interrupted, take a seat opposite Lauren. \"How is taste testing seen as a punishment? If anything, I see it as a reward\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, it's definitely a reward!\" Lauren giggled. \"But to Lady Alice, it's a horrific punishment that she herself is threatened with by Lady Belview. And so, she utilises it as a punishment for the staff. However, what she doesn't realise is that I personally enjoy Elizabeth's cuisine. It has a unique trait, one I'm sure you'll also appreciate...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren giggled again, flashing Carrie excited eyes. Carrie blushed, glancing away to hide the smile that appeared on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"W-What's so special about it?\" Carrie asked, her curiosity piqued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Just wait and see,\" Lauren responded brightly. \"I don't want to ruin the surprise for you, just so I get to see how you react...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that final cryptic comment, Lauren fell quiet. Her eyes followed Elizabeth as she rushed around the kitchens, attending to various bubbling pots and sizzling pans. Carrie did as well, but soon found her senses overwhelmed as delicious scents floated over to her. Images of food floated through her head, followed by images of her stuffing both herself and Lauren, growing fatter and fatter together, bursting out of their outfits, each feeding the other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie snapped out of her fantasy as three massive platters were dropped onto the table. She glanced at them before looking at Elizabeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You... cooked all this?\" Carrie asked in disbelief. \"In five minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Seven minutes and six seconds, to be precise,\" Elizabeth corrected her. \"But yes, I cooked all this. And I cannot continue cooking until the two of you finish absolutely everything and deliver a final verdict. So, enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhisking the tops off the platters, Carrie's eyes went wide as she saw what sat on each. One held a glistening roasted chicken and a bowl of golden mashed potatoes, steam floating lazily off it. Another held a massive rack of lamb, drizzled with some sort of sauce and served with her another bowl of potatoes. And finally, the one that looked really out of place compared to the first two, a simple plate of fish and chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And remember, I've also got dessert~\" Elizabeth said before leaving the duo to stare at the delicious food laid out before them...</span></div></div>",

Lauren gently peeled her chicken apart into pristine white strips, while Carrie clumsily pulled apart her rack of lamb. Eventually, both maids had a pile of bones and a pile of edible meat sitting in front of them. Looking at one another, they both nodded before inching closer to one another. Carrie stared into Lauren's beautiful face, her hands reaching out and lifting a hefty bit of lamb. Navigating it to Lauren's face, her partner took a bite of the meat, moaning as she chewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh... Oh...\" Lauren groaned through her mouthful. \"So good... You gotta... try some...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she chewed, Lauren's hand grasped a chicken leg. Lifting it to Carrie's face, Carrie hungrily took a massive bite of the glistening leg. A moan escaped her own mouth as she ravenously chewed, quickly swallowing and going back for another. The way the crispy skin blended with the tender chicken underneath... She had never had anything like it before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"More...\" Lauren groaned, taking another bite of lamb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"M-More!\" Carrie agreed, taking a third bite of chicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two maids collapsed back in their seats, massaging their swollen guts.

She must have had incredible upper body strength because the platters were overflowing and looked like they weighed a ton. A couple of the cupcakes fell off into Carrie's lap as Elizabeth placed them, and she gathered them up in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I take it everyone enjoyed the first course? You two look positively spherical!\" Elizabeth said, clapping her hands together with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie popped a cupcake into her mouth and nodded, while Lauren patted her stomach proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was delicious, as always!\" Lauren said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you two sweet,\" Elizabeth smiled. \"Well, eat up, can't let dessert go to waste. I'll be back in a second with the cream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth disappeared again, as Carrie chomped her way through the cupcakes that had fallen into her lap. Her tight maid's dress constricted around her heavily bloated belly, riding up along her thighs and revealing the bottom of her butt. She realised she was revealing a little more of herself than Lauren was, but quite enjoyed the idea of flashing her panties while she was like this. Despite feeling rather full just a moment ago, she was suddenly hungry again after seeing the dessert platter, and leaned forward in her chair to grab a piece of chocolate cake, not unlike the one she had consumed when she first entered the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren, meanwhile, had pulled an entire handful of muffins under her noise, and was cramming them into her mouth, one by one, eating noisily and greedily without much thought for table manners. Every once in a while, she would belch, rub her tummy, and continue, and it was driving Carrie wild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cream, anyone?\" Elizabeth's voice interrupted the sounds of munching and swallowing as she placed a huge pitcher of heavy, double cream in front of the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was practically drooling. \"Urghhhh, my favourite!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more once you finish that one,\" Elizabeth said, walking back to the kitchen once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren grabbed the pitcher eagerly, dropped the half eaten muffin she had just bitten into and raised it to her lips. Carrie watched eagerly as the bloated blonde raised tipped it up and started taking huge gulps of the cream. She practically chugged the thick, white substance down, her stomach visible swelling with each mouthful. When she finally took a breath and placed the pitcher back on the table, cream had ran down her chin, and she had to wipe her mouth clean on the arm of her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....BURRRRRRRRRRRRP...good...\" Lauren moaned, leaning back in her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's a lotta cream,\" Carrie giggled, enjoying Lauren's gluttonous display as she popped a chocolate brownie into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so heavy...ugh...it tastes so dam good...\" Lauren let out a long, satisfied moan as she pushed herself forward again, her dress riding up a little more as her belly pushed out into her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie licked her lips as she looked over at her swollen companion. She had seen Lauren fatten up once already, but seeing it all over again was no less satisfying. Her eyes moved to the pitcher of cream, and she reached for it eagerly, wanting to mimic Lauren's gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo...you're going to love it...\" Lauren said excitedly, watching as Carrie raised the pitcher and started to drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie gave a muffled moan as the cream flowed down her throat. Lauren was right, it was incredible. She had never tasted anything so thick and creamy in her life. The cool, heavy liquid flowed down her throat and into her bloated stomach, causing it to push out further and further, placing even more strain on her dress, which rose even higher now, exposing her frilly, lace panties to the air. As the cold air hit her ass, Carrie slowly lowered the pitcher to the table and looked down at the swollen, round belly in her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone's taken the lead,\" Lauren said, inching her chair closer to Carrie so that she could poke a finger into her stuffed gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof...so much cream...\" Carrie moaned. \"My dress feels like it's going to explode...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren giggled. \"Mine too, look.\" She reached down and hoisted her dress up, exposing her full, round tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...so hot...\" Carrie said, reaching out to rub her hand over the expanse of Lauren's tummy. \"You feel so full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren belched noisily as Carrie's hand pressed into her full stomach. \"Careful...hehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie giggled and hoisted her own dress up, her belly seeming to spill out. It was noticeable fuller and rounder than Lauren's, packed so full of food that it almost reached her knees. Lauren moaned a little at the alluring sight, causing Carrie to blush. </span></div></div>",

Tapping her fingers gently, Carrie shivered with pleasure, a groan pushing past her lips. But as Lauren caressed her belly, a thought came to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, Lauren?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren hummed in response, her focus entirely on rubbing Carrie's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Isn't this meant to be a punishment?\" Carrie asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yep!\" Lauren responded brightly. \"But, here's the thing... What Lady Alice believes a punishment isn't quite so. For us, anyway. After all, don't you just love eating? Watching yourself fill up? Watching <i>me</i> fill up? Growing rounder and rounder, heavier and heavier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie hesitated before nodding, thoughts of the two of them swelling with soft fat filling her head. Bursting through their dresses, then their underwear. Pressing their plump forms against one another, their heads leaning on closer and closer until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>RIIIIP</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie snapped out of her daydream as the quiet sound of fabric cut through the silence. Glancing towards the origin of the sound, her cheeks flushed red and a nervous giggle burst out of her as she saw what had just ripped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"H-Hey, Lauren? Your dress...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping a hand on Carrie's belly, Lauren followed her gaze downwards to her bust, which had visibly swollen and torn the chest of her dress down the centre, revealing her pale, nearly white cleavage. Lauren giggled as well, her other hand poking one of her tits, before glancing at Carrie. More specifically, Carrie's seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Looks like I'm not the only one in danger of flashing,\" Lauren teased, causing Carrie to blush. Glancing downwards, a nervous squeak escaped her lips as she found her backside had likewise swelled, pushing the hem of her dress further upwards and revealing her lacy panties to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's our punishment kicking in!\" Lauren explained excitedly. \"And not a moment too soon... Another cupcake, Carrie, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie nodded, allowing Lauren to push a cupcake through her lips. Savouring its taste for a moment, she swallowed, eyes widening as she felt her rear end swell beneath her. As her growth came to an end, her eyes then flicked to Lauren's breasts. Admiring them for a moment, Carrie reached out and grabbed a brownie, practically forcing it into Lauren's mouth. The other maids eyes widened with surprise, before she began chewing. As she swallowed, the tear in her dress extended a little more as her bust expanded. The two maids stared at one another, smirks spreading across their faces, before they started grabbing various food items and feeding one another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"S-So full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroans escaped the mouths of both girls as they finally relaxed in their seats. Glancing at one another, exhausted giggles were emitted from both as they admired the results of their handiwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmm...\" Lauren moaned. \"You're so big now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie smiled, tracing a slender finger over her huge, uncovered ass, which completely filled her seat and hung down over the edges slightly. Her dress, commanded by her gut, did absolutely nothing to cover it. And at some point, her thighs had joined in, pushing her stockings to their limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm big?\" Carrie asked. \"Have you seen yourself recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren giggled, an arm wedged between her flabby breasts and stuffed gut. Her dress had almost completely split down the centre, while her bra was drawn tight across her tits, each one almost triple the size they had been about fifteen minutes ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, but if I'm anything like you, then I'm fine with it,\" Lauren responded, leaning forwards to touch Carrie's bare butt. \"Oh, so soft... I love it. Almost as much as I love you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's eyes bulged as she heard Lauren utter that. Staring into the face of her partner...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carrie was about to decline dessert, stating that if she ate anymore, she was likely to explode. Before she had the chance to do so, however, her partner sighed heavily, leaning forwards and pulling the final platter towards the duo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lauren!\" Carrie hissed into her ear. \"What are you doing?! There's no way we can possibly finish that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's for the best, Carrie,\" Lauren whispered back. \"Two things happen if we don't voluntarily finish everything she serves us. One, Elizabeth gets upset. And when Elizabeth gets upset, she tends to get a little... forceful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren paused for a moment, glancing over at the beaming Elizabeth, who waved cheerfully at the whispering duo. Waving back, Lauren turned back to Carrie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And two, Lady Alice gets told we didn't finish,\" Lauren continued. \"In her eyes, our punishment wasn't carried out. So, we get another one, one that probably isn't eat loads of food and grow fat. We could be sent out to Kyle in the barn, the greenhouse or to clean the Hot Spring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of the Hot Spring, Lauren shivered. Carrie raised a curious eyebrow, but before she could ask what was so bad about the Hot Spring, Elizabeth interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't want to break up this party, but desserts cooling rapidly,\" She said with a smile. \"And it's best to eat it while it's all still warm\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course, Elizabeth, my apologies!\" Lauren said brightly, leaning back in her chair. \"Shall we, Carrie dearest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie looked between the two, wide smiles on both their faces. Eventually, she exhaled and nodded, prompting Elizabeth to clap happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Great!\" She exclaimed. \"Just give me a holler when you're done! Enjoy~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elizabeth bustled off, Carrie turned her attention to the massive platter she had to work through. Sitting atop it was a weird creation she had never seen before, but would admit she was curious about. A massive three-layered cake, decorated with a pristine white icing and, what made it strange for Carrie, cupcakes and pastries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Elizabeth calls it the 'Treat Cake',\" Lauren explained, plucking a cream bun from one of the tiers. \"It's Lady Aurelia's personal favourite, so as you can probably imagine, a fair few of these were made weekly whenever Lady Aurelia was still alive. I suppose this is the first one to be made in a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping the bun into her mouth, Lauren chewed briefly before letting out a moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And they're still so good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back for another, Lauren grabbed a cupcake and a custard bun, handing the bun to Carrie while devouring the cupcake. Carrie, after a few deep breaths, bit into the bun, eyes widening as the still warm custard exploded out of the pastry and into her mouth. Quickly finishing it off, she, along with Lauren, began to ravenously make her way through the cake, her solid gut groaning as she stuffed more and more food into it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Urgh... So full...\" Carrie groaned, pushing the last bit of cake into her mouth. \"URRRRP... Excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So much cake...\" Lauren huffed. \"I don't know if I can even move after that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie nodded in agreement, eyes drifting lazily down to her body. Initially, their 'punishment' did very little to their bodies. After they finished the first tier, however, it kicked in hard. Each item atop the cake made their soft bodies swell larger, while the cake itself had a slightly more powerful effect. As a result, the two maids had grown massively, their dresses no longer able to cover their immense frames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe majority of Carrie's weight had still settled in her rear end, meaning the chair groaning beneath her bulk had vanished entirely from view, enveloped by her hanging flesh. Her solid yet soft gut hung between her tree trunk thighs, reaching just past her knees. Her once pert breasts sagged heavily to either side of her belly, bra having exploded off long ago. And encircling her cute face were three wobbly chins, complete with flushed chubby cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren, on the other hand, had all her weight settling in her upper body. Her breasts, amazingly, had managed to retain a bit of their perkiness, however they were still almost double the size of Carrie's. Her belly also sat between her thick thighs, however it was much closer to the floor than to her knees. Her lower body hung over the edges of her chair, however the legs of said chair could still be seen. Much like Carrie, three chins and a pair of swollen cheeks adorned her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Heh... We're so big now...\" Carrie groaned, a meaty paw prodding her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That we are...\" Lauren agreed. \"I'm not complaining though... Feels great, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie found herself nodding in agreement. She had never imagined being this size, even in her wildest dreams, but she had admit. There was something... sexy... about it...</span></div></div>",

Look at the size of those bellies!\" The busty red head reached down and placed a hand on Lauren's gut, then another on Carrie's, who looked awkward, but too stuffed to really resist. \"Such good, gluttonous pigs. Well, that's everything for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks for the URRRRP...food...Liz...\" Lauren groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you,\" Carrie added quickly, not wanting to offend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're welcome girls,\" Elizabeth said, pulling her hands away from their rounded guts and gathering up the used platters in her arms. \"I'll take these dishes to the kitchens, and when you can start washing them up when you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wa-washing up?\" Carrie asked, incredulous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren shrugged. \"Well, yes, we are the maids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...keep forgetting about that...\" Carrie grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth took the plates and walked back to the kitchen, while the girls took a moment to recover. After a few moments of panting, belching and shifting their bulk back and forth in their seats, the two chubby women began to rise. Lauren was first to attempt to sit up; her large, bulging pot belly bumped into the table as she tried to stand, forcing out another belch as it pushed down on her stomach. She gave a moan and pushed herself on, her belly bouncing free and resting on top of the table as she arched her back and pushed it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was watching this entire display, growing increasingly horny as she saw Lauren's body standing up right for the first time since their feast. She looked absolutely huge now, barely even recognisable as the slim, petite maid she had met earlier this evening. Her heavy, soft gut bulged out onto the table in such a sweet, sexy way that Carrie couldn't help but give a horny little moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope...\" Carrie blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie tried to stand herself, but it proved harder than expected. The colossal amount of food in her belly was practically dragging her down to the floor, and it seemed that every time she tried to push her bulk out of her seat, there was a great weight dragging her back down. \"Urghhh...can't move...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...I think you might be stuck,\" Lauren giggled. She moved to stand behind Carrie and held onto the chair. \"Your butt is too big for that chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie blushed. \"Oh my god, is my ass wedged into this seat?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try again, I'll hold it down,\" Lauren chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie heaved herself upwards, realising that the heavy feeling before had actually been her butt taking the entire chair with her as she stood up. With Lauren holding it in place now, she finally managed to free herself, and her expanded rear bulged free with a mighty jiggle. Panting, sweating and feeling thoroughly exhausted, she turned around to face Lauren, who was standing incredibly close now. Their stomach bumped together, pressing into one another as the last few scraps of clothing fell from their bodies, leaving them naked in the dining room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Reaching her meaty hands out, she stroked Carrie's soft hips, inciting a moan from her pear shaped partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Carrie, she hadn't a clue where to look. Every part of Lauren's body, from her beautifully round face down to her plump toes, aroused her. Eyes flicking rapidly from breasts to belly to thighs, Carrie eventually settled in massaging Lauren's stuffed belly, which gurgled lightly as she pressed her hands against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmm~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls moaned simultaneously as the other ran their hands over them. Eventually, and to Carrie's disappointment, Lauren pulled away, her cheeks flushed red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As much as I'd love to continue this, we have a job to do,\" Lauren stated, going to turn to the mountain of dishes and cookware piled up behind her. \"Those dishes won't wash themselves, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"N-No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wah!! Carrie?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot entirely eager to wash dishes, Carrie had intended to step forwards and grab Lauren's shoulder. However, unaccustomed to her large lower body and hefty belly, she found herself falling forwards into Lauren. The two maids crashed to the ground, Lauren pinned beneath Carrie and Carrie pinned beneath her own weight. Kicking her thick legs in a futile effort to get back to her feet, Carrie slowly stopped when she realised just how the two of them looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lauren hadn't fully turned when Carrie had tripped, she was lying on her back. Carrie lay atop her, belly pressed against belly and breasts against breasts. Staring into Lauren's startled face, Carrie attempted an anxious smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"U-Um... Sorry?\" Carrie apologised. \"G-Give me a moment to -<b>MMMMPPH?!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a set of cold lips make contact with hers, Carrie fell silent and allowed Lauren to kiss her. As Lauren eventually pulled away, smirk on her face, Carrie let out a content sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"T-That was... lovely...\" Carrie said quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then how about another?\" Lauren suggested before leaning back in and kissing her again.

She felt her nipples pushing against Lauren's bloated tits, and then became very aware of Lauren's hands finding their way to her huge backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the girls could escalate things further, they both became very aware of another presence in the room. Turning as one, the two naked, horny maids looked up to see Elizabeth staring down at them with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hey Liz...\" Lauren said awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, you two are really enjoying your new bodies aren't you?\" Elizabeth said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,\" Carrie stammered.

She was looking up at Elizabeth, but from her angle on the floor, she couldn't actually see the chef's face past her enormous breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was remedied quite quickly as Elizabeth knelt down beside the pair, and, in one fluid motion, pulled her top open. Her enormous tits spilled out, not even contained within a bra, and bounced into full view of Lauren and Carrie's astonished faces.

Carrie noted that, again, she had no underwear, and the now literally naked chef was kneeling back down, extending her hands so that she could grab at her satisfied little piggies. Carrie moaned softly as Elizabeth squeezed a roll of flab from her thigh. Lauren squeaked as the busty red head pushed her other hand into her gut, forcing out a loud, gassy belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such good little pigs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth gently pushed Carrie over, rolling her off of Lauren's body and onto her back with a jiggle.

Navigating her erect nipples into Carrie's mouth, causing the maid to blush harder than when she had stripped, Elizabeth leaned in close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of my undiluted secret ingredient, given to me by Lady Aurelia herself...\" She breathed into Carrie's ear, before groaning as she felt liquid explode from her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's eyes went wide as she felt her mouth fill with a rich yet thick liquid. Swallowing it hungrily, she was about to suckle when she hesitated. Had it been Lauren, she would've had absolutely no issues draining her dry, but Elizabeth? She barely knew her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear, is something the matter?\" Elizabeth asked, concerned. \"I certainly hope not! After all, everything in this breast is just for you, no sharing required! And as for you, Lauren...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her head to look at Lauren, who was desperately trying to grab her other breast, Elizabeth smiled. Pushing her firm tit towards her, a light moan escaped her mouth as she felt Lauren's paws greedily grab it, stuff it into her mouth and begin to suckle. Turning her attention back to Carrie, who was still refusing to drink, Elizabeth tutted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come now, Carrie! Why can't you act a little more like your partner here?\" Elizabeth asked, gesturing to Lauren. \"I don't mind you drinking! After all, it's my thanks to you for testing everything I gave you earlier! Now, drink...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes flicking to Lauren, Carrie watched the other maid drink. Her eyes were half-lidded as she suckled happily, only breaking away to emit a belch or to breathe. Nodding to herself, Carrie began to slowly draw milk into her body. After a few seconds, she sped up. And then again. And then again, until she, like Lauren, had a good flow of rich milk flowing into her body. I<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, that's it...\" Elizabeth murmured happily. \"Drink up, drink up...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not for the first time since she entered the house, Carrie dimly wondered what she was doing. Drinking milk from the enormous tits of a chef who had just served magically fattening food, while lying naked on the floor next to her new, chubby lover. It was so ridiculous that she was starting to think maybe this was all just a dream, but the delicious, warm milk flowing down her throat certainly felt very real, so she continued to gulp it down eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth moaned softly as the girls suckled at her nipples. \"That's it, good little piggies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie, always happy to be teased about her body, shuddered slightly at being called a piggy, and Elizabeth responded by squeezing her right breast, blasting a torrent of milk into her mouth and quickening the flow. Carrie let out a muffled noise and struggled to keep swallowing, but soon adjusted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad they not been lying on their backs with a huge breast blocking their view, the two maids might have been able to see the effect the milk was having on their bodies. As the pure, undiluted juices flowed into their stomachs, their already huge pot bellies were swelling larger and larger, growing rounder and rounder with each mouthful they swallowed down. The milk caused their overstuffed, chubby forms to bulge to a much larger size, thickening their legs, arms and stomachs and causing their breasts and butts to become ever more spherical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie could feel her body shifting slightly, her plump, swollen behind spread out across the floor beneath her as she continued drinking. She wondered how much more of this she could take before she had to stop and breath, but, as if on queue, she got her answer as Elizabeth suddenly pulled away from her and Lauren and staggered back. Carrie let out a long exhale and licked her lips, before looking up at the busty chef, who was now not quite so busty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth looked a little dizzy, and steadied herself against the wall. Her enormous tits had shrunk down several cup sizes; no longer the huge, beach ball sized mammaries they had been a few moments ago. She cupped them in her hands and smiled. \"My my, you two...you two really went to town on me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren belched noisily and rolled over onto her side to face Carrie. \"So...so full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie looked into Lauren's fatter face and smiled. She ran her hands over her own stomach, and was shocked by how much rounder it felt. Propping herself up on her elbows with considerable difficulty, she grunted and looked down at her body. \"Oh my God! How much did I drink?!\" Carrie squealed, shocked at the vast, circular orb of flesh that was her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth slapped a hand on Carrie's belly, causing her to emit a high pitched squeal and fall onto her back again. \"You drank your fill,\" she giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was surprised by how little her belly jiggled. The milk seemed to have caused ever inch of her body to swell, but remain completely taught and firm. Beside her, Lauren looked the same, although Carrie seemed to have grown a little larger...</span></div></div>",

Her thick arms quivered as she pushed herself up, but she managed to keep herself supported. As she went to sit up, however, a hand gently pushed her back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"E-Elizabeth?!\" Carrie cried out, stuck on her back again. \"What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I said you drank your fill, little piggy,\" Elizabeth answered with a chuckle. \"But I never said I was done with you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you mean?\" Carrie asked, but Elizabeth merely chuckled again in response. \"Lauren, what does she mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her head to look at Lauren, who had managed to sit up and was in the process of trying to get to her feet, Lauren cast her a reassuring smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry, Carrie!\" She said cheerfully. \"Elizabeth likes to... play a little... with new staff members. It's nothing dangerous, mind you, but things can get a little intense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmm... That's certainly a word for it, my dear Lauren,\" Elizabeth said, resting her elbows atop Carrie's belly. \"But it is as your lover said. I like to welcome everybody in my own way! But it is also a test of sorts. If you can't survive what I do to you, then some of the punishments Lady Aurelia can inflict upon you could overwhelm you. But the question is, what to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth hummed in thought, drumming her slender fingers atop Carrie's belly. Next to her, Lauren waddled up to her, her belly pressing against Carrie's. Learning in as best she could, she whispered something into Elizabeth's ear. As Lauren pulled away, sly smile on her face, Elizabeth nodded slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, I believe that could work...\" She mused, rubbing her chin. \"The question is, will she cooperate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think she will,\" Lauren answered. \"You know as well as I that she enjoys toying with people, especially strangers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"True...\" Elizabeth mumbled thoughtfully. \"Very well. Go and fetch her. I'll remain here with our newest maid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren bowed as best she could with her hefty milk-filled belly before waddling off, leaving Carrie staring up at Elizabeth's adoring face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I can certainly see why Lauren's taken a shine to you,\" Elizabeth purred, tracing a hand down Carrie's belly to one of her huge breasts. \"Such a capacity for food... And always so ready to eat! A girl after her own heart, I'd say! Lauren always did liked them big... So let's make you more appealing to her, shall we?\" </span></div></div>",

But, to her surprise, Elizabeth stood up, walked over to a nearby cupboard, and pulled out a plate full of gooey, chocolate brownies. Carrie could hardly believe she was about to be asked to eat anymore. She was stuffed to bursting with all that milk from a few moments ago. Eating one of those rich, delicious looking brownies might cause her to explode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth picked one up and raised it to Carrie's mouth. \"Eat up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie gave a moan. \"I...I can't...I've already eaten so much, look at the size of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Elizabeth just ignored her, and, taking advantage of Carrie's mouth being open, shoved the brownie inside. Carrie, despite her best efforts to control herself, just gobbled it up. \"There, see, no problem for a big girl like you. So, how did you decide to become a feedee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie blushed, familiar with the term. \"I mean...I started gaining by accident after college, but I always thought it was pretty hot. I can be very greedy sometimes, and I loved the feeling of my belly getting really bloated. I kept stuffing myself to see what I looked like with a bigger tummy, but I guess my appetite increased too, and well...I put on a few pounds.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than a few now, eh?\" Elizabeth giggled, before popping another treat into Carrie's mouth. \"I myself have always been a feeder. I love to watch people fatten up and gorge themselves like pigs.\" She licked her lips and gave Carrie's belly a pat as she swallowed down the second brownie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be fun...\" Carrie said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, always,\" Elizabeth winked, cramming another brownie into Carrie. \"But Lady Aurelia wasn't always the voluptuous woman she is now. I take credit for her considerable expansion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Carrie said, swallowing again. \"That's really impress-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could finish, Elizabeth pushed another brownie into the maid's mouth. \"Yes, she was quite svelte at one point, before the gluttony overtook her. They say she has to maintain her girth to maintain control of the house, but that may just be a rumour...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was about to respond, but another two brownies came her way, so she just lay back for a while and allowed herself to be stuffed. There wasn't much she could do at the moment other than lye there, so she decided to just enjoy it. The brownies weren't nearly as fattening as Elizabeth's milk or the cake from the table, but each one seemed to add an extra pound to her body, causing her huge form to spread out across the floor, thickening and widening as she fattened up to an even larger size...</span></div></div>",

From her fallen position on the floor, Lauren's head was completely eclipsed by her belly. Even so, Carrie could just imagine the pleased smile spreading across her face as she looked at her corpulent frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, she is rather big...\" An unfamiliar voice stated from Carrie's left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her head, Carrie found herself staring at an ashen-skinned woman clad only in a black bikini, thong and pair of high-heeled, knee-high boots. While all that was fine with Carrie, what confused her was the forked tail and pair of scarlet wings attached to her. She watched the woman's face curl into a smirk, both curious and slightly afraid of what she was going to do to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And you say you want her bigger?\" The woman asked, circling the fallen Carrie. \"An easy arrangement... But I have to ask. What do I get from this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren opened her mouth to answer, hesitated for a few moments and then closed it. Next to her, Elizabeth set a brownie she had been holding atop Carrie's belly and stepped forwards with a slight bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Miss Serena,\" Elizabeth greeted. \"As always, I promise to speak with Lady Aurelia on your behalf about a better gateway to your dimension. It would benefit not only you, but also myself. After all, I've lost too many new staff members to your dimension\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Agreed,\" Serena said immediately. \"Now, maid. Give me a better idea of what I'm doing to your friend\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren waddled over to Serena and leaned in, presumably telling the demon girl what she was to do. Next to Carrie, Elizabeth leant down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I always tell her I'll speak to Lady Aurelia about a new doorway, but never do,\" Elizabeth whispered. \"Keeping her down her in the kitchens makes my job easier, after all. She is an Embodiment of Gluttony, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Carrie could ask one of the many questions swirling around her head about the sudden appearance of the demoness, said demoness re-entered her vision, smirk still in her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your friend has made her decision,\" Serena said, leaning next to Carrie and tracing a finger down her chubby cheek...</span></div></div>",

She spread her legs, and her growing belly spread out between them and started spreading out across the floor. Carrie moaned as she lost control of her body, swelling to levels of fatness she had never even imagined were possible. Her ass pushed out behind her, creating an enormous cushion for her body, while he breasts began to resemble over inflated beach balls.

The obese lady of the house backed away, almost nervously. \"Revert her to her normal size, at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena scoffed. \"Do it yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know full well I cannot!

She glanced back at the huge, circular form of Carrie and made for the door, her heavy bulk causing her to walk in a most unlady like jog, beads of sweat dropping down her forehead. Before she could reach it, however, the floor gave way underneath her. At first, it seemed as though the floorboards had buckled under her weight, but soon, a fiery circle engulfed her entire body, trapping her in place. \"No!\" She shrieked, looking to Elizabeth and Lauren for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth, in a panic, reached out to grab her mistress's hand, but the fiery circle scorched her arm, causing her to scream and jump back. Aurelia tried to free herself, but her body was sinking lower and lower into the fiery circle. Her elegant dress began to tear and rip along the seams, as she was dragged down even further into the fiery chasm below. She gave one final scream as she was swallowed up completely, vanishing into the floor as the fiery circle closed up around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, everyone was silent, then, they turned their attention to Carrie, who was still pinned in place, completely horrified by what had just happened...</span></div></div>",

But I'm not quite ready to part ways just yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three woman exchanged worried looks before looking to the grinning Demoness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you mean?\" Carrie asked, her voice deepened by her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well...\" Serena giggled, rolling over into her front and reaching a delicate hand out to rest on Carrie's swollen cheek. \"You've become a... catalyst of sorts for me. The bigger you are, the more power and control I get. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm naturally very powerful, even more so now that the hag is gone. But I'm a Demoness. It's in my very nature to crave even more power. And apparently, the desire to be bigger is in yours. So... My thinking is we help one another. You give me power, and I'll make you as big as you want. I'll even bring along your girlfriend and make her grow right alongside you. What say you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's gaze flicked over to Lauren, who wore a curious look. She had to admit, Serena's offer was tempting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you think, Lauren?\" Carrie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren smiled in response, stepping forwards to embrace Carrie's belly as best she could at her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If I'm with you, I'll happily go anywhere!\" Lauren replied, stroking her belly with a plump hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide grin spread across Carrie's face as she turned back to Serena, who was busy fondling one of her pillowy breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We'll do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena chuckled, pressing a hand into Carrie's belly. Feeling pressure build within her, Carrie closed her eyes and allowed herself to swell. Fat poured onto her already immobile frame, the room growing smaller and smaller around her. She felt Lauren pressing into her belly, massaging it lovingly. Elizabeth had vanished somewhere, not that she minded much. As long as she had Lauren, she was completely fine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her catalyst grew, Serena moaned and groaned as power flowed through her. Combined with her existing power, and that of the House she now owned, she was more powerful than she had ever been before. Even more than she had been before she had gotten trapped within the internal freezer. And she loved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let's move you somewhere more suitable...\" Serena whispered into Carrie's ear. Floating off of her belly, Serena allowed Carrie to swell until her body was nearly filling the room, at which point she clicked her fingers. The duo shimmered and, in a bright glow, vanished into her old dimension. She wouldn't be needing it anymore, not with this new house of hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, to be free of that dimension!\" Serena exclaimed, lightly landing on the floor beneath her. \"And with each passing second, I feel her size add to my power! A beautiful sensation... But I sense a few more presences running around my house. Perhaps my reign is only just beginning?\"</span></div></div>",

Oblivious to what was currently happening in the kitchen, the bespectacled brunette had somehow managed to get herself lost. How, she had no idea. She had just followed the corridor in a straight line for a little while, then turned a corner, but when she looked back, it seemed as though the corridor had changed completely. She figured she must have just taken a wrong turn or mixed up her left and right...but as she moved further and further away, she started to doubt that. This new area looked completely different. Maybe she was just doing a full circle of the building? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma had long since given up checking any of the rooms. There were so many, either side of her. Many of them were locked, and the corridors were completely silent, so she figured if Stacey was here, she would have at least made a little noise by now. The truth was, she was just getting tired and frustrated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, why does everything in this dam house look exactly the same?\" She sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a moment to stop, rest and polish her glasses. Removing them for just a moment rendered the entire corridor a complete blur, so she quickly put them back on. As she did so, she suddenly became very aware that she was no longer alone. Standing no less than an inch from her face an ashen skinned, winged woman, grinning malevolently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus!\" Emma jumped back, struggling to take in the sight. \"Who...who are you? Are those wings? What are you, cosplaying or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the winged figure just chuckled and started to advance...</span></div></div>",

Taking a few steps back so they weren't face-to-face, she reached out a hand to rest on the Damon's shoulder. The Demon stopped, looking down at her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wow, seems really realistic...\" Emma muttered, pinching and tugging on the skin. \"Wings, horns and a tail as well... Question is, which one of you guys is trying to scare the daylights of me? Carrie? Nah, too slim. With a body like that, it's gotta be Beth, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Beth' merely chuckled again in response, stepping forwards and closing the distance between them again. Emma, now believing it was Beth trying to spook her, merely continued to inspect the supposed costume. Stepping around 'Beth', she began to inspect her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh... They feel real,\" She realised, stroking her fingers down them. \"And they... move? How are you doing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, 'Beth' chuckled maliciously. Just as Emma's hand began to trace the outline of her wings, she flapped them hard. Emma stumbled backwards as 'Beth' floated off the ground, her wings beating lightly as she spun to face her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"O-Okay, maybe you aren't Beth...\" Emma said anxiously, looking up at the figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, maybe I'm not Beth,\" The figure agreed. \"I'm something a lot worse than Beth. Something your friend helped release and grant more power to. And I intend to use that power on the uninvited guests within my new house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure cackled loudly, causing Emma to rapidly back away. She stared in disbelief at the Demon, utterly confused about what was happening. One of her friends helped release her? Was she trapped somewhere? And what was she going to do with her uninvited guests, who she guessed included her, Carrie, Beth, Katie and Stacy, if Stacy was still around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But how rude of me!\" The Demoness stopped laughing and stared down at Emma. \"I never even introduced myself! My name is Serena, and I am the new owner of this house. Which is unfortunate for you, because I have a feeling I'm going to be a lot more unforgiving towards intruders than that decrepit obese old hag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow completely creaked out by the Demoness, Emma decided it was time to run. Spinning on her heel, she sprinted down the corridor, laughter echoing down the corridor. As she rounded a corner and entered a new corridor, she glanced over her shoulder. Her eyes widened as she saw Serena leisurely floating after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crap, gotta get away from her...</i> Emma thought, eyes flicking left and right as she looked for an open door. <i>Don't really want to find out what happens if she catches me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Emma spotted a door that was slightly ajar. Pushing it open, she rushed inside and slammed it behind her, fiddling briefly with the lock. Heading it click, followed by a sigh on the other side of the door, she breathed easy. Turning to rest her back against the door, Emma looked around the room she was trapped in...</span></div></div>",

There were rows of ancient looking books on the walls, and a row of small, marble plinths surrounded her, each one topped with a small, ornate looking statue of some kind. The statues seemed to be of horned, winged creatures, not unlike the woman she had just encountered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I help you?\" The voice asked again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma had been so distracted by the decorations that she had barely even noticed the man sitting opposite him in a large, throne-like chair. She turned and waved awkwardly, managing a smile at the bemused looking guy. He was wearing an immaculate, black suit which looked like it was from another century, but he didn't look much older than Emma. He was quite handsome, but his eyes were cold and dark, and made Emma nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, I just stumbled in here by accident,\" Emma explained, moving closer to the desk. \"You're not friends with that demon lady...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man arched an eyebrow. \"Which one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said her name was Serena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly looking very concerned, the man stood up from his chair and moved closer to Emma. \"Serena? You're sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she said she the lady of the house or something? I turned out after...you know...the general terror I experienced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that can't be good,\" the man said. \"Then again, maybe it can?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Emma, by the way,\" Emma said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" The man was looking distracted, but suddenly remembered his manners. \"Oh, of course, forgive me. Lord Martin Harrison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Marty, listen, can you help me find my friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin looked like he was considering it for a second, then he shook his head. \"No, I don't think so. That doesn't sound like something I would do. But maybe <i>you </i>can help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't sound entirely fair, actually...\" Emma said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I suppose not, but in all fairness, by helping me you will be helping your friends,\" Martin said. \"If Serena has indeed deposed Lady Aurelia, I have a golden opportunity to reclaim this house. She is forbidden from entering any of my rooms, so you should be safe here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well that's reassuring and not at all terrifying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin nodded, oblivious. \"Exactly. It's fortunate you're here actually, I need a mortal to be able to collect the Necronomicon from the library with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's eyes widened. \"Did you say Necronomicon? Like from those Evil Dead movies?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what now?\" Martin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...Bruce Campbell? They brought it back recently as a TV show,\" she could see that Martin had absolutely no idea what she was talking about, so decided to just stop trying to explain herself. \"Okay, never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me, we must hurry,\" Martin said, ushering her towards the door. \"Don't worry, you'll be quite safe with me. Serena's magic does not work on me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so it won't work on me either?\" Emma said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was about to ask another question, when Martin gently shoved her back into the corridor and locked the door behind them. </span></div></div>",

Emma followed him, remaining close enough that she felt something resembling safety, but not so closely that was clinging to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How do you tell these hallways apart?\" Emma mumbled to herself as they rounded a corner, revealing a hallway that looked the exact same as the ones she had been wandering all night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Rather easily,\" Lord Martin answered, causing her to jump. She hadn't been asking him, but rather talking to herself. \"I had a hand in designing and constructing the original foundations. Then that... woman... came along and added wholly unnecessary extra rooms\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see...\" Emma replied, her brow furrowing in confusion. <i>He designed and built the original mansion? But this place has been here for centuries! My Great Grandfather remembered this place! What's going on here...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Lord Martin down another hallway, Emma didn't realise that he had suddenly halted and walked straight into his back. He barely moved, while Emma instinctively bounced backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm sorry!\" She apologised quickly. \"But why have we stopped, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, that would be because of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering around Lord Martin, Emma whimpered as she saw a winged demon hovering in the centre of the hallway in front of them. Her tail swished lazily through the air as she hovered closer to the duo. Emma closed the distance between Lord Martin and herself, her arms wrapping around one of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Serena,\" Lord Martin greeted coldly. \"I see you've escaped your dimension\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No thanks to you, Martin,\" Serena responded, just as cold. \"But as you can see, I have a new dimension now. And there's a few... pests running free in it. And you know how much I enjoy toying with pests...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, I recall perfectly,\" Lord Martin responded. \"It was part of the reason we banished you to that fridge. I suppose congratulations are in order about it as well. You managed to get Aurelia and myself to agree on something, a near impossibility. But I'm afraid I must request that you return to that fridge\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh?\" Serena cocked an eyebrow curiously. \"And for what reason would I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You were a flawed creation,\" Lord Martin answered. \"And because of you, I refused to create another like you. I will not have my past mistakes roaming these halls freely. Now, return at once! Otherwise, you will force my hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena merely giggled and looked past him at Emma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, I see now...\" She muttered to herself. \"You need a mortal for that book.

Emma waved her hand in the air, trying to clear the sudden fog, but her vision seemed to be distorted now too. Through the mist, she could now see colours and shapes beginning to form, and when it finally cleared, she appeared to be in a completely different location. Gone were the old corridors and doorways, gone was Serena and Lord Martin and in front of her was a large, open space which appeared to be a large field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some of the greenest grass she had ever seen, with a flowing river and plenty of trees, flowers and plants. It was weirdly idyllic, and not at all like anything she had seen at the mansion. She took a step forward and sniffed the oddly sweet air. \"Where the hell am I?\" She asked out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Emma!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was caught off guard by the deep, but very familiar voice, and turned and looked behind her. Her jaw dropped as she saw an enormous, spherical woman who looked to be about ten feet tall, her body almost completely globular. Her massive frame was supported by a huge, fat belly and massive, exposed, breasts. She was completely naked, and as Emma looked up at her, she recognised the big, chubby face. It was Carrie. For a moment, she found her throat so dry she could barely speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Carrie?!\" Emma blurted out. \"Is that you? Wh-what happened? Why are you so big...and...and...big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean my height,\" the deep voice Carrie replied, barely seeming to register Emma's confusion. \"I've been growing bigger all over, to support all this extra chub. Growing up and out hehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well...not entirely what I meant...\" Emma muttered. \"I was asking more about the massive weight gain! Did that demon do this to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh,\" Carrie said, shifting her huge bulk from side to side as she took a wobbly step forward, her entire body jiggling. She didn't seem to really be able to move very much with all this weight weighing her down. \"Well, I mostly did it to myself actually...though Serena did give me a helping hand. Isn't it great? I'm enormous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great?!\" Emma could hardly believe what she was hearing. \"Carrie, you're gigantic! You're on the verge of being immobile. How the hell are you enjoying this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie just looked bemused. \"This is what I wanted, Emma. I'm much happier this way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrie, this isn't you!\" Emma protested. \"Nobody would want to be this huge blimp! She must have done something to your mind, how do we get out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you can't get out without Serena's help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma turned as she heard another voice, and stared in confusion once again as a chubby, overfed blonde walked up towards her. Like Carrie, she was completely naked, though normal sized and not nearly as round. Still, she looked like she was pushing over three hundred pounds. Emma tried to look away, but anywhere she looked she was seeing huge boobs and massive bellies. It was highly awkward. \"Uh, hey, and you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm Lauren,\" the girl said, extending a hand. \"Are you one of Carrie's friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Emma,\" Emma said, offering her hand and shaking Lauren's own, while trying to maintain eye contact with her. \"Can you explain to me what happened here? Carrie seems a little...um...confused..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's eaten a lot, I think she's a little food drunk,\" Lauren giggled. \"It's fine though, we were both cool with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma raised an eyebrow. \"You were both cool with being fattened up? What the hell is going on here? My friend is the size of a house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's a lot of temptations here,\" Lauren shrugged, as though that answered Emma's protests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked around, as though to humour Lauren, and found herself taking a closer look at their environment. In the lush, green landscape, it seemed as though there were a few details Emma had missed when she first arrived. The flower was not water...it was chocolate. The flowers were candy canes. The plants had food growing on them. The trees were made of what appeared to be some sort of candy floss. This was weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...is this place...made of food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, most of it,\" Lauren answered, reaching down to the floor to snap off a candy cane and take a large bite out of it. \"Try some!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma backed away nervously...</span></div></div>",

Even its colour, traditional red and white stripes, looked incredibly vibrant, glinting slightly in the bright sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I guess... a bite wouldn't hurt...\" Emma shrugged, reaching a hand out to accept the came. But as she wrapped her fingers around it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"LOOK OUT!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls looked around in shock as a voice, familiar to two of them, let out a scream. A second later, four screams were emitted as a body smashed heavily into the ground a few feet behind Emma. Emma dropped the candy cane and hurried over to the newly formed crater, while Lauren finished off the dropped cane before following. As for Carrie, being ten feet tall, all she had to do was look towards the crater, which had a cloud of dirt obscuring it, to see who had created it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you okay?!\" Emma asked anxiously, reaching the side of the crater and peering into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-Yeah, I think so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dirt fell back to the ground, a slim girl came into view. Her blonde hair was bedraggled and flecked with dirt, while her our jeans and crop top had sustained some damage from her collision with the ground. Slowly, she got to her feet, stumbling slightly as she straightened up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ow, ow, ow...\" Beth groaned, clutching her lower back. \"That really hurt... Oh, hey! Emma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting her friend, Beth's pain seemed to recede as she raced up the edge of the crater to embrace the concerned girl. Emma hesitated before hugging back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"B-Beth?\" She asked, now completely confused. She had one friend the size of a house, and another had just plummeted from the sky. \"Where'd you come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well...\" Beth pulled back and tapped her chin. \"I was in some sort of parlour when this really slim blonde girl found me. She was in tears, saying her sister had been taken from her and she was next! Before I could ask what she meant, this other weird woman with wings and a tail appeared! She just clicked her fingers and suddenly, I was falling from the sky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, you met Lady Alice and Serena!\" Lauren realised, finally reaching the duo. Beth glanced over at her, her face contorting in visible disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why are you so fat?\" She asked, causing Emma to sign heavily. Beth had never been one for subtlety. Rather than being annoyed, Lauren blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aw, thanks!\" Lauren giggled. \"I'd say I worked really hard to get like this, but I had a lot of help from my girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Carrie's your girlfriend?\" Emma asked, slightly shocked. She had never known Carrie to be into girls before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's right!\" A deep voice came from behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three looked up at Carrie, who was happily munching on a handful of flowers. Lauren blushed a vibrant red, while Emma hadn't a clue what to think. Beth, on the other hand... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Carrie?!\" She yelped. \"W-Why are you so fat?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, a lot of help from Lauren and Mistress Serena!\" Carrie replied happily. \"It's great being so big, just eating all the time... Having my girlfriend take care of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren giggled nervously, causing Emma and Beth to exchange a look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's... great,\" Emma eventually replied. \"But we don't want to be fat, so we'll just be leaving now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing Beth by the shoulder, Emma began to march off. She knew Lauren had said they needed Serena to get out, but she didn't believe that for a moment. There had to be a way out of here... </span></div></div>",

Lauren and Carrie made no effort to stop them, quickly returning to eating and giggling amongst themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is so weird,\" Emma said in a hushed voice. \"Since when was Carrie into girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what strikes you as weird?!\" Beth asked, incredulous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that, and her enormous weight gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really creeping me out,\" Beth said. \"She wasn't herself at all. I mean, I know she'd put a few pounds on lately, but geez...she was like a blob! We need to get out of here and change her back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you've got a super rigorous exercise program, I think that might take some work,\" Emma sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma had no idea where they were going, and sadly, Beth seemed to be following her lead. They were heading down a path which crunched under their feet. Emma had initially assumed the path was made out of stone, but when she looked down she noticed it was a much darker shade of brown, and seemed to be cracking under her shoes. She stopped for a moment and crouched down to get a closer look, picking up a piece of the broken path and raising it in front of her glasses. It was chocolate. The path was chocolate. This was insane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing the chocolate back on the floor, she waved away Beth's incoming question and decided to just keep going. The open fields were still around them, but they now seemed to be coming to what sounded like more flowing water. As they neared the source of the noise, they descended a small hill and found themselves at the bank of an enormous chocolate river. There was no bridge, and did not appear to be any way across other than to swim, but in the distance, Emma could see what seemed to be...the house? Were they outside after all? That certainly made more sense than them being in some sort of bizarre alternate reality. She would have recognised that creepy mansion anywhere, although it now seemed to be the day time, rather than night. Had they really been here that long? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we're outside, huh...\" Beth said, looking across the river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but how do we get across? This river seems to stretch on for miles,\" Emma said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls peered down into the flowing, chocolatey river below them. It was swimmable, but would leave them completely covered and their clothes ruined. Surely there was an easier way to get back to the house? </span></div></div>",

She leaned forward and dipped her fingers into the river, pulling them back out and licking them clean. \"Yep, definitely chocolate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...should you be eating that stuff?\" Beth asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one of us had to test it,\" Emma shrugged. \"Besides, not like I'm downing the entire lake. So, we crossing this or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have another choice?\" Beth asked, folding her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I can see,\" Emma said. \"Worst case scenario? Our clothes are ruined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, that's pretty bad, actually,\" Beth replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma realised she probably wasn't going to convince Beth any time soon unless she took some action. She sat down on the river bank and dipped her leg into the river, grimacing as it sank beneath the chocolate. Slowly but surely, she lowered her other leg, up to the knee, into the river, and pushed her body off the bank. With a \"plop\", Emma's body sank, up to her waist, into the river. She breathed a sigh of relief as she realised it wasn't that high after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it...okay?\" Beth asked, approaching her from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't seem too bad, actually,\" Emma said. \"Come on, let's get moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma tried to get moving, but the amount of chocolate surrounding her body made that difficult. It was very hard to wade through the thick, gooey river, but it was doable, so she slowly started making her way to the other side of the river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, Beth was making a nervous noise as she dipped her leg into the chocolate. She was about to slowly lower herself in when she lost her balance and slipped in with  a scream. Thankfully, the thickness of the chocolate prevented her from falling face first into the river, and she managed to stop herself, though her arms were now completely covered. \"Eurghhhhh! Gross!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we can wash off once we get back,\" Emma called back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Beth wiped her hands on her top, smearing it with even more chocolate. \"Oh crap...why did I do that? Ugh. I hate this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls, moving slowly but surely, started to make their way across the river...</span></div></div>",

Hey, Emma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma glanced over her shoulder, but made sure to keep moving forwards. After all, she didn't fancy getting bogged down or caught by something living in the river, if such a beast existed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I... think I might be a little stuck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing heavily, Emma stopped and turned back to face Beth. She had assumed Beth was exaggerating, but soon found that she really wasn't. Beth had gotten herself swept downstream ever so slightly and, unknown to either girl, it was deeper than their chosen path. So much so that Beth had sunk to her neck and, with the majority of her body swallowed by thick chocolate, was unable to move at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Jesus, Beth!\" Emma exclaimed. \"Why didn't you say something sooner? Give me a moment, I'll be right there\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth whimpered and nodded. As Emma began to wade her way towards her immobilized friend, she realised that Beth was still being dragged away by the current. With each passing second, she sank further and further. When Beth realised this, she flew into a panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh God... I don't wanna drown!\" She yelled, shaking her head wildly. \"Emma, please hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you think I'm doing?!\" Emma replied through gritted teeth. She too was beginning to sink into the river. \"Just hold still!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth didn't listen. Continuing her struggle, the chocolate rose up to her mouth and, as she was about to speak again, flowed into it and silenced her. A groan escaped her as thick chocolate filled her mouth, giving her no other choice but to swallow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>T-This is... delicious!</i> Beth thought. <i>So rich and tasty... So creamy... Maybe another taste wouldn't hurt...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping her mouth open, Beth hungrily gulped down mouthful after mouthful of chocolate. Emma, oblivious to her friends actions, pressed onwards towards her... </span></div></div>",

Her face was half submerged now too, and she looked like she was about to go under completely at any moment. Fortunately, Emma reached her in time. Reaching a hand under the chocolate flow, she managed to sift through the thick, gooey water to grab hold of Beth's arm and hoist her up. Beth finally came up, gasping for air, covered from head to toe in chocolate that made her look like some sort of novelty life sized chocolate woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow moving again, Emma kept hold of Beth as they crossed to the other side of the river. This time, Beth, staying oddly silent, managed to stay on track, and eventually, she and Emma reached the river bank and hoisted themselves up, immediately collapsing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We made it...\" Emma said, breathing a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally...\" Beth groaned, lying on her back, still covered in chocolate from head to toe. \"Ugh...I swallowed like a whole pint of that stuff. God, it was sweet. I feel like I've had my sugar intake for the next three years...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad I got you out of there when I did,\" Emma said. \"You do look kinda ridiculous though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth wiped her face with her hands, which had the effect of just smearing more chocolate on her cheeks. She wiped her palms on the grass, but realised that probably wasn't going to work for the rest of her body. \"We should find somewhere we can wash off, I'm completely covered in this stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed, there must be some actual water around here somewhere...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" Beth said, suddenly remembering. \"Where's the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked around, realising that they should have been much closer by now. But the house was still there, in the distance, looking like it was miles away. Crossing the river barely seemed to have brought them any closer at all. \"Looks like we've still got quite a journey ahead of us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get moving, I guess,\" Beth shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls carried on in the direction of the house, leaving a trail of brown footprints in their wake...</span></div></div>",

Eventually, Beth asked if they could stop and Emma, who was getting tired and a little fed up herself, agreed. Spotting a fallen tree, the two headed for it. Beth collapsed atop it, while Emma sat on the grass opposite her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I feel so heavy...\" Beth complained, her body still dripping with chocolate. \"And gooey. And disgusting\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, well, just be glad there's nobody around to see you like that,\" Emma grumbled in response. \"Only people around here are Carrie and her girlfriend and maybe that Demon. And I don't think any of them are the judging sort, anyway, not how they look\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Suppose...\" Beth shrugged, lying on her back and staring at the sky above her. It was still a brilliant blue and completely clear, the sun warming them both slightly. \"When I get out of here, I'm never going to touch another bit chocolate for as long as I live!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'd agree with you, but I do enjoy the occasional treat,\" Emma said, lying back to look at the sky as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, the pair admired the clear skies above them, neither of them realising the effects of Beth's dunk in the river were beginning to show. That was, until Emma sat up to continue their journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ready to move?\" She asked Beth, jumping to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I dunno...\" Her companion whimpered. \"I don't feel so good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma cocked a curious eyebrow and made for Beth. Reaching her side, she froze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Umm... I don't really know how to tell you this, but you aren't really covered in chocolate anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, that's good, right?\" Beth groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I wouldn't say so...\" Emma mumbled, kneeling next to her friend. \"How... How are you feeling, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Really full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, I imagined as much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma watched her friend as the chocolate soaked into her skin. As it faded away, leaving her skin a mixture of stained brown and her natural white, Beth's svelte body began to swell. Her breasts bulged, her crop top tightening around the two orbs, while her jeans creaked audibly as her backside expanded within them. Her belly, however, didn't seem too affected by her growth, merely swelling outwards into a small potbelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay...\" Emma sighed. \"Well, good news, you don't look like a chocolate person anymore. Bad news, I think that chocolate is now inside you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Inside me?!\" Beth sat up, her breasts bouncing. Looking down, a scream escaped her mouth as she found herself staring at her new breasts. A hand gently poked one, while her other travelled to her backside and have it a light squeeze. \"I...I...I... I'm fat now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wouldn't call it fat. It's more of an hourglass figure,\" Emma reasoned. \"But we should keep moving. Just in case...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth nodded sadly and got to her feet... </span></div></div>",

Beth wasn't even fat, but the formerly skinny blonde had always seen anyone even moderately curvy as being chubby, Emma included. \"Beth, you're not even that big. You just curved out a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curved out? Then what is this?\" Beth lifted her top to show her bulging new tummy. \"It's so gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look on the bright side, you always wanted bigger boobs,\" Emma shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth looked down into her cleavage and blushed. \"I guess I did...I wonder if there's a way I can lose the belly and keep these?

Beth had to keep hoisting up her pants as they went, as her enlarged rear end continuously threatening to escape them. Emma was still trying to get the encrusted chocolate off of her clothes and looked an absolute mess, but they soon reached the mansion, looming over them in the sunshine. Strangely though, the entire area looked different; as though the house had changed location completely since they arrived. Emma came to a halt in front of the steps to the front door, causing Beth to bump into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you stop?\" Beth asked, confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't feel right...is this definitely the same place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you think there's another mansion around here that we just so happened to miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma took a furtive step forward, but just as she did, the front door of the house was flung open and a mighty, howling wind knocked both her and Beth onto their backs.

It sat there, lower half warmly enveloped by her breasts, and began to fiddle with her nipples. While that was going on, a second creature unbuttoned her jeans and slid into her panties. Feeling something long and wiry penetrate her, a reluctant moan pushed past Beth's lips. With each second that passed, it got harder and harder to think, to resist them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing this, Emma began to fight towards her friend, swatting away creature after irritating creature.

She stopped trying to bat the Imps away and sank to her knees with a thud. While one of the creatures had crawled into her cleavage and was unhooking her bra with a forked tail, another was pulling at her tank top, causing rips and tears as they tried to remove it. The creature in her panties was giggling and playing with her damp pussy. Beth let out a pleasured moan, despite her best efforts to resist, and collapsed onto her back as the creatures began to have their way with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more of the creatures were crawling up her legs, and began to tug her pants down a little at a time, before they flung them away and began licking her curvy thighs. One of them scurried along her body up to her soft, bulging tummy and began to knead and massage her new flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth shuddered in delight as one of the Imps finally managed to unclasp her bra and fling it away. The other bared it's fangs and took a chunk out of her top, spat out the fabric, then ripped it in two. As the last of her clothes were shredded and removed, Beth was suddenly aware that was was naked and writhing in pleasure on the floor, but the constant stimulation to her body was clouding her thoughts, so she had little choice but to lay back and allow the creatures to pleasure her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off her!\" Emma said, charging through the gap created by the creatures now flocking to her friend. \"Oh crap, Beth, your clothes! What are they doing to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma went to kick the creature in Beth's panties away, but instead, it hissed at her and tossed the torn panties in her face. She recoiled and swatted them back, before making another run, but this time, one of the creatures flew at her leg, wrapping itself around her ankle and clawing at her flesh. She stumbled back, trying to kick it away, but the little monsters were surprisingly strong for their size. She looked back at Beth, whose body was now being groped and squeezed by about seven of the little beasts...</span></div></div>",

However, another quickly took its place, followed by another. The creatures not pleasuring the moaning Beth all soon followed, all them crowding around Emma's ankles. With everything below her knee covered by squirming Imps, Emma soon lost her balance, falling forwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, crap...</i> She thought, managing to soften her fall with her hands. <i>Now it's my turn to get assaulted by these... these things!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes, Emma awaited her fate. But, strangely, it never came. Cracking an eye open, she glanced down at her legs, which were still covered in squirming Imps, none of which seemed to be moving. A few twitched their wings eagerly, yet for the most part, they all stared back at Emma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"W-What?\" She muttered in disbelief. \"Why aren't they doing anything? It's like they just want to keep me restrained...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oooohhhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing her eyes away from her demonic ankle weights, Emma looked back towards Beth. As her friend came into view, her eyes went wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"B-Beth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had been struggling against her own Imps, the ones attached to Beth had gone behind simple pleasuring. They had started to physically change Beth, who didn't seem too bothered about it. Gone was her pristine ivory skin, replaced with an ashen tone not dissimilar to that of the Imps. Her messy blonde hair had darkened considerably, looking almost midnight black. Meanwhile, she had gained a few new body parts, such as a pair of dull horns that protruded from her forehead, a long whip-like tail and, while she couldn't see her back, Emma guessed that a set of small bag wings were currently being crushed beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Beth, look at me!\" Emma shouted after a moments silence. \"Don't let them win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth turned her head to look at the fallen Emma. For a moment, she wore no expression, staring blankly at her friend. However, it soon contorted into a mischievous grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, Emma~\" Beth cooed, rolling over onto her hands and knees. A few Imps remained attached to her, such as the one groping her breasts and the one pleasuring her pussy, but the rest floated away from her, hovering ominously around her head. \"This feels great! You totally need to join me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Beth crawled towards her fallen friend, Emma renewed her struggles. However, the Imps trapping her were finally beginning to become active, crawling up her body...</span></div></div>",

Beth grunted as she was knocked down and rolled away, her Imps screeching and hissing at the sudden attack as they scrambled to recover. The creatures covering Emma leapt into the air and started flying in circles above the area in a frenzy. Emma looked up to see who had saved her, and was surprised to see the familiar face of Katie looking down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to go, now!\" Katie said, extending her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma didn't need to be told twice, she grabbed Katie's hand and was hoisted up off the ground. Katie pulled her in the direction of the house, and they quickly dashed inside. Emma looked back at Beth, who was getting to her feet. Her new wings extended behind her back, and her dark, glossy eyes focused on Emma as a smile crossed her face. Emma hardly recognised her now, and she instinctively shut the door before Emma could advance any further. Katie grabbed a nearby plank of wood and barred the door shut, sealing them inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie! How did you even get here?\" Emma asked, immensely relieved to see her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same way you did, I'm guessing,\" Katie said, dusting her hands off. \"Someone looking a lot like Beth does now found me and sent me here. I came out in a forest and made my way here. What the hell happened to Beth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, those things must have done something to her, I just saw her changing right in front of me,\" Emma shook her head. \"You didn't happen to see Carrie, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I recall,\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...maybe for the best...she's pretty uh...heavy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie raised an eyebrow. \"That's a little insensitive. I know she's put on a few pounds recently but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, seriously, she's huge,\" Emma explained. \"She must have been fattened up or something by that weird girl she was with. When I saw her she was about practically immobile, and seemed to be loving it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked horrified at that. Always a fitness freak herself, she couldn't comprehend the idea of anyone fattening themselves up to such a massive size. \"So we're the only two who have managed to stay normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma adjusted her glasses and sighed. \"I guess so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo looked around awkwardly, not sure what to say. There was still a feint banging coming from the door, but it soon faded, the Imps and Beth apparently giving up their attempt to break through the barrier Katie had created. Emma glanced around the hallway, noting how different the house now looked; rather than the dingy, cobweb covered halls she had seen earlier, the house now appeared spotlessly clean, as though it had only just been built. Light flooded in through the windows, giving it a very different feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we sure this is the same house?\" Katie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was thinking the same thing,\" Emma said. \"It's changed...I'm not sure we're back yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either, let's look around, and this time we'll stick together,\" Katie said. </span></div></div>",

As it was before, when they had first entered the dingy mansion, they hadn't a clue where to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So, uh... Where do we begin?\" Katie asked, scanning the gleaming staircase. \"Upstairs or downstairs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lets try upstairs,\" Emma answered. Personally, she had gotten lost on downstairs before and hadn't had the chance to look upstairs. Now wasn't the time to be curious, but she just couldn't help herself. Leading Katie towards the stairs, the two girls froze as somebody appeared at the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, well. More unfortunate victims...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA teenage girl, perhaps seventeen or eighteen, stared down at them. Everything about her appearance screamed '<i>Goth</i>', from her pitch black hair with dark blue highlights  to her outfit, a long lacy dress that hid her entire body. For a few moments, the three girls remained still, staring awkwardly at one another, before Emma spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh... Hello? Sorry, we weren't expecting to find anybody else in here,\" Emma said, stepping forwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then prepare to be surprised even more,\" The girl replied, her voice borderline emotionless. \"This place has a few inhabitants, such as myself. All trapped here by the Master of this place. And now, we have two more joining our ranks. How... exciting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's voice picked up slightly at the end of her explanation, but returned to neutral when she spoke next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My name is Morganna, however I prefer Morgan. And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm Katie,\" Katie answered. \"And this is Emma\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A pleasure,\" Morgan nodded. \"May I ask how you ended up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, there were originally four of us,\" Emma began to explain. \"We were looking for a friend who went missing in the mansion. Err, the other mansion, not this weird one. Anyway, we split up and all ended up here. One of us is hugely fat, the other was... changed by the Imps just outside the door. So, we're the only two unchanged\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see... My condolences about your friends, but I'm afraid nobody but the Master of the Mansion has the power to save them now,\" Morgan said. \"And I'm certain mercy isn't a word known to her. However, this missing friend of yours... Describe her for me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Her name's Stacey. When she went missing, she had a pink tracksuit on. Brown ponytail, brown eyes, fairly fit,\" Katie recalled from an Instagram post Stacey posted just before she went missing. \"She went jogging near the mansion and just disappeared\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see... Perhaps she wanders this mansion. Perhaps she was caught by the Master. I know not. However, I would be willing to assist with your search. It gets awfully boring just wandering this place, hiding from any... unsavoury creatures\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I guess that's fine,\" Emma replied. \"You probably know this place better than either of us. Lead on, I guess\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan bowed in response. As the two made their way upstairs...</span></div></div>",

Beth looked away, embarrassed. \"You can't just-\" But Beth suffered a similar gagging to Emma. Lauren rose back, spun around and stuffed three small chocolate truffles into Beth's mouth. Like Emma, she bit down out of habit, splitting the chocolates open and filling her mouth with an overpowering sweetness which caused her entire body to tingle. She had never tasted chocolate so good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't they amazing?\" Lauren cooed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma, sucking on the candy cane, nodded her head. \"Yeah...they're...really good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So good...\" Beth said, drooling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have more if you like?\" Lauren suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...we shouldn't...\" Emma said, still sucking. She knew this was a bad idea. Lauren had clearly instigated Carrie's own massive weight gain, and now she was trying to encourage her and Beth too follow the same path. She managed to summon enough of her senses to slowly withdraw the candy cane from her mouth. \"That's enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth wiped some chocolate from around her mouth, and glanced at Emma. \"Are you going to finish that candy cane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not, I'll have it,\" Beth said, her eyes glazing over as her hand began to extend towards Emma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma pulled her hand away. \"No!

Beth hurriedly took them out of Lauren's hands, and looked down at the floor to see that the truffles, apparently were all growing from a small flower bed beneath Carrie's bulk. Beth hurried to the spot, sank to her knees, and started sampling some more. With each one she bit into, she let out a small groan, savouring the explosion of flavour that hit her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie, towering over them, smiled contentedly as she watched them start to enjoy themselves...</span></div></div>",

However, Lauren did not pull it away after she had taken a bit, instead forcing the slice further into her mouth. Forced to devour the entire slice, Carrie groaned uncomfortably as she finished it off. The discomfort in her belly, which had started to dissipate, was beginning to return...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lauren?!\" Carrie cried out. \"What are you- <b>MMMMPH!</b>\"<br>\r\nAgain, she was silenced as Lauren forced another huge slice of the cake into her mouth, pressing it into Carrie's mouth until she had finished it off. As soon as she did, her other hand came swooping in to repeat the action, forcing the massively overstuffed girl to swallow yet another bit of cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly swallowing, Carrie tried to stop Lauren as she grabbed the last quarter of the cake, but she was easily overpowered. Lauren crammed the last quarter into her mouth, smiling happily as Carrie chewed slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lauren, please...\" Carrie groaned as she swallowed. \"I can't handle anymore!\"<br>\r\n \"Don't worry!\" Lauren said cheerfully, brandishing a plate of hammy doughnuts. \"Only good things happen in this room! It's impossible for anything bad to happen to you, so eat up!

Letting some of the doughnut fall out of her mouth, she struggled to say, \"Lauren...too much...too much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was swelling out even more, causing her a good deal of discomfort. She felt like she might burst at any moment. It was so incredibly round and taught that she was starting to look pregnant. She shifted uncomfortably, trying to push herself away from Lauren, but it was no use. Her skirt was now practically glued to her legs, her belly placing a huge amount of pressure on it. As Lauren crammed another doughnut into her mouth, she could hear it audibly groaning as it struggled to contain her massively overstuffed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BURRRRRRRRP!\" Carrie suddenly let out a huge belch, which stopped Lauren's feeding onslaught, if only for a second. \"Stoooooooooooooop URRRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren patted Carrie's tight belly and smiled. \"Good Carrie, keep eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooooooooo-URFFFFFMMP!\" Carrie was cut out off by a huge slice of cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to take any more, Carrie's skirt began to slowly rip along the sides. Her stomach pushed out even further as she swallowed down the enormous cake slice, groaning as it struggled to free itself. Carrie heard the audible creaking of the skirt material as it began to pull apart at the seams, splitting along her thick thighs and accelerating along to her butt, before the material gave way and split apart in what seemed like slow motion. Carrie gave a muffled groan as her entire skirt exploded open, the top half fluttering to the floor, while the underside was pinned beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning, Carrie spread her legs and allowed herself some more room as her heavy belly spread out on her lap. Despite the humiliation, it felt good to be out of the restrictive skirt, which had been a size too small even before she arrived at the mansion. Now clad only in her underwear, she looked over at a smiling, beaming Lauren, who was eyeing up her body eagerly...</span></div></div>",

Lauren took that as acceptance of her next stuffing, and turned and left the room, her entire body passing through the door. Carrie would have been more concerned by that, but in her current condition, she was more worried that her stomach was about to burst. She really needed to get out of here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, she sat up in her chair, her firm, spherical belly filling her lap. She ran a hand over it's stuffed, taught surface and gave a moan. She had stuffed herself before, but never been this big. She looked about nine months pregnant! With another groan, Carrie heaved herself up from the chair and to her feet. Her stomach stuck out in front of her, obscuring her view of her feet. She took a step towards the door, but stopped when she saw herself reflected in a body sized mirror on the other side of the room. Walking slowly up to the glass, she turned to the side and grimaced at the size of her food baby, which could probably be better described as food triplets at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a hand over her stomach as she surveyed her reflection, she felt a shudder of pleasure, and could feel herself getting even damper within her panties. Her hand traced along her stomach towards her throbbing pussy, but she stopped herself before she got any further. She needed to stop enjoying this. It was going too far. But this big, round belly was so sexy...she had to turn and do a few more poses in the mirror, admiring just how full and tight it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...so big...\" Carrie moaned, biting her lip. </span></div></div>",

Casting her glance towards the door, Carrie was relieved to see that it was Emma, who would likely be the least judgemental; Katie would be horrified by how the unhealthy, high calorie content of the cake she had just devoured, and Beth would probably make fun of her for being such a pig, but Emma was usually pretty chill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrie, there you are, you found anything yet?\" Emma asked, walking up to the table. \"Oh, hey, cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie did a double take as Emma gestured to a large, chocolate cake on the table. How the hell had that gotten there? She had eaten the entire thing just a second ago and there definitely hadn't been another one in sight. Shocked, she pushed herself back from the table, relaxing her belly a little so that it puffed out against her shirt, straining the buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was not oblivious to Carrie's bloated state, even with the poor girl trying hard to hold her breath. \"Erm, Carrie, you didn't like...eat any of that cake did you? I mean, who knows how long it might have been there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" Carrie blushed, realising how ridiculous that probably sounded when there were obvious cake crumbs in her lap. \"But I'm sure it's perfectly...erm...fresh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie rose from her chair, putting added pressure on her buttons as her stomach bulged out in front of her. Emma had the decency to ignore it, but her eyes wandered back to the cake. \"Who leaves a cake just lying here? You think maybe Stacey left it for us? As a \"thank you for coming to rescue me\" present?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, probably not her style. Or anybody's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie shifted awkwardly, tugging at her shirt to try and hide the very visible bulge beneath it. \"This is going to sound crazy but...that cake literally just appeared out of nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Emma raised an eyebrow. \"Erm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know how it sounds, don't give me that look!\" Carrie protested. \"I swear, it just appeared the second you walked in!

She pulled the silver platter containing the cake towards her until it was directly beneath her nose, and then started helping herself to more and more. Carrie watched from just behind Emma's chair, watching helplessly as her friend mindlessly ate her way through slice after slice. Was this what she had looked like a few minutes ago? Just a ravenous, greedy pig devouring cake slices whole? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma, slow down, you're going to choke,\" Carrie warned, taking a step closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't, cake too good...\" Emma responded, wiping chocolate from around her mouth as she went for another slice. The cake was around halfway gone now, but Emma showed no signs of slowing down. In fact, her appetite only seemed to increase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the table, Carrie caught sight of Emma's stomach slowly swelling out. Emma had always had a curvy figure, but her stomach had stayed pretty slim over the years, never really accumulating any of the extra chub that Carrie's had after her college years. Instead, any excess weight Emma put on seemed to go straight to her butt, which now seemed to be straining a little against her tight jeans as her belly exerted extra pressure on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRP!\" Emma belched suddenly, but didn't seem bothered by her gassy outburst, instead just following it up with extra cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside her, Carrie glanced down at her own burgeoning belly, still packed full of the same cake. Her buttons looked ready to pop open, and her skirt dug into her soft belly. She ran a hand over the expanse of her bloated tummy, before looking back at Emma, seeing her in a similar state. Emma's t-shirt was much more form fitting than Carrie's work shirt, and was beginning to constrict around her expanding stomach, riding up above belly button and exposing her midriff... </span></div></div>",

God...\" Emma suppressed another belch, covering her hand with her mouth and trying to hide her gluttonous display. \"Yeah well...I'm pretty sure you overdid it on the cake front too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie folded her arms further down her stomach, trying to hide her own greed. \"I may have...but at least I didn't have someone right beside me telling me what a pig I was being!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not an URRRRRRRP...pig...\" Emma moaned. \"Okay, I was a bit of a pig just then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm hmm,\" Carrie said. \"Anyway, we should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie trailed off as she looked back at the table, her eyes widening in surprise. There, right where the empty plate had been a second ago, was another enormous cake, exactly the same shape and size as the first two.

She popped them one after another like sweets. They were delicious, and meant to be good for you. Carrie knew she'd... lost a little tone with her new job. It wasn't her fault it was mostly desk bound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greenhouse disappeared around the corner, and the aroma of fruit drew her forward. There were more blueberry bushes bedded around the path, and grapes on vines trailing up the outer wall of the house. The greenhouse windows were grubby, but gave a dulled view of the garden beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spotted a path running parallel to the greenhouse and the mansion. A selection of fruit trees planted every few feet. Alternating between apple trees, and various fruit bushes. The air was filled with the scent of herbs to add to the inviting aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from the path, she spotted what looked like a dense forest. But it was too close, and too regular to be that. Walking carefully off the path, she approached the outer glass, and rubbing it clear with the sleeve of her jumper, saw it more clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a maze... an actual hedge maze! The grass was wild, but it didn't look too overgrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the far door to the greenhouse, Carrie left it, and found herself outside the kitchen door. A gravel path leading into the maze.</span></div></div>",

A witch carried an Oujia Board up the creaking steps while followed by a parade of fiends and villains. A more accurate description would actually be a costumed witch was followed by a line of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're here!\" The witch named Sara proclaimed. \"I told you we'd be here before midnight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you gals sure this is a good idea?\" Annabelle spoke as she saw her six other friends move towards the doors. The cowgirl quivered a little from the cold. \"I'm not part-tickulary inclined towards messing with the second world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,you really believe in those old tales about this place?\" Ashley stated. She twiddled her pirate outfit to pull down near her knees. \"I mean its--like--stuff to scare babies or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't 'fraid of no ghost!\" Melissa screamed out. She gladly rushed past Sara and pushed open the dusty door, all the while her ghost costume flapped in the wind. \"What are you gals waiting for? Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some food Kim?\" Beverley said. Her pumpkin outfit tight against her fairly plump form. \"I got blueberries, your favorite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you Kim!\" Kim happily stated as she was handed a fruit snack from her friend. She chewed absentmindedly, doing her best not to color her pilgrim outfit. Rounding out this motley crew was Dallas, who babbled on her phone to a unknown caller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Honey-Bun! Me and the girls--or is it the girls and I, whatever--are going to be back before one o' clock! Don't worry we'll be there to watch the spooky flicks. Love you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll seven women crowded into the main lobby and looked around. Dust, broken wood, and old furniture greeted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew\" Ashley stated. \"Do we have go anywhere else? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. We can just do it right here.\" Sara happily replied. \"Everyone ready to set the place up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the girls nodded and began to place down their accompanying materials. Candles, flashlights, and chalk were all placed down onto the floor. Two of the girls began to draw the appropriate circle and place the candles onto the floor. Sara in turn began to take out a tome and began flipping through the pages.Finding the pages she wanted, Sara placed down the Oujia board and book onto the ground. Sitting down, she began to recite while the other girls took their places.Dallas helpfully placed a clock down to indicate the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Aurelia Belview. Oh Aurelia Belview. Come back towards our realm and manifest your will onto this material plane. Oh Aurelia Belview. Oh Aurelia Belview. Come back to the home you took your final breath in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool!\" Beverly stated. Snacking on another snack with Kim. The six girls watched as Sara began to repeat her chants. Her tone growing louder and louder and her arms raising higher above her head. Finally she chanted out the last verse from the tome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Aurelia Belview. Come back to the Earthly Kingdom. I, Sara Hensley, call you home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara chanted the last word out and all six ladies braced themselves for an apparition to form in the circle. Nothing appeared. They tapped their feet or twiddled their thumbs in waiting. The clock ranged, indicating it was midnight. The girls waited again,but like before, nothing appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought there was going to be a pale lady or a spooky mistress,Sara? Where is it, come on!\" Dallas whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess she was too scared to come!\" Melissa screamed out. \"We'll I'll get rid of this stupid circle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Meliss-\" It was too late, Melissa already rubbed her foot down onto the white chalk on the floor and got rid of the stains. The other girls didn't seem to care much for the action and shrugged when nothing came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like this was a waste of time.\" Ashley proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who needs to see some fat lady anyways?\" Kim spoke. Stuffing another blueberry into her mouth. Beverly nodded before she turned to glare at Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not talking about you. You're plump, not fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabelle chewed her lower lip in apprehension,tapping her foot mindlessly. Sara got up and began to flip through the book. Not seeing anything to mediate  the situation she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry girls, it looks like I was wrong. Stupid book.\" Sara tucked her tome into her bag and began to clean up the lobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInvisible and above them flew the spirit of the manor, Aurelia. She glared down at the assembled girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Fat! Too sacred! A waste of time?\"</i> Aurelia screamed. \"<i>It wasn't my fault that mouthy girl of your's didn't know how to properly calibrate a freaking clock! And that idiot destroyed the circle before they could even dispel me! Don't you dare insult me about my worth if you can't even possess some caution.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelia tapped her ghostly finger against her chin as she saw the girls begin to clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You want me to show you my worth? My talents? My skills? Well I'll show you just how 'talented' I can get.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing out wisps of blue smoke, the weird air traveled down and began to caress the ladies' forms. A sudden chill went over all of them,but they brushed it off as the cold night. Opening the door, Melissa held it as the ladies  moved outside.</span></div></div>",

She had thought the leggings she wore would've warmed her up, but it only mitigated the effects by a small margin. In fact, it seemed to be clinging to her body a little tighter than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its probably late-night shrinkage.\" Ashley mumbled. Behind her, Annabelle the country girl cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, it's so cold...\" Annabelle whined, rubbing her bare arms in a futile attempt to heat them. \"The mansion may have been spooky, but at least it was warm\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it was so warm, why not go back in?\" Ashley suggested with a grin on her face. \"I'll even go with you, just so you don't get lonely. Or scared!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley giggled internally at the suggestion, Annabelle wasn't one know for her courage. So the light-hearted ribbing would probably take her mind off the tightness of her skirt.. It seemed that Ashley didn't quite keep those giggles inside of herself as Annabelle pouted at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm not scared!\" She protested. \"I just think messing with the dead is... unfair to the dead! Yeah, that's it! I mean, how would you like it if a bunch of girls tried talking to you after you died and just wanted to rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest? I wouldn't spend my time resting!\" Ashley replied. \"I'd be one of those annoying ghosts that moves stuff around the house and makes spooky noises in the middle of the night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's mind wandered to the thought of her floating around and moaning at those bitches from Atticus Academy. White sheet not touching the ground, blank face hidden under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course you would...\" Annabelle mumbled under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you two, give it a rest,\" Sarah said, interrupting the duo. \"In fact, while we're here, why not have a few dares? After all, we just proved that Lady Aurelia isn't currently home\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you have in mind?\" Kim asked, wiping some blue juice from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go in and find a certain room?\" Sarah suggested. \"And don't worry, Annabelle, we won't force you if you don't want to go\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What? I do wanna go!\" Annabelle said bravely, straightening up slightly. \"In fact, I'll go first! Pick a room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Find the Master Bedroom!\" Sarah said. \"And take a picture so we know you've been there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master bedroom? E-Easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's eyebrow rose at Annabelle's new-found courage and was really tempted to follow her just to see her go through with it. Shrugging, she and the others opened up the doors to the house to allow Annabelle entrance. Closing it gently, the girls sat down and began to converse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what would you even ask the ghost if we summoned her?\" Dallas questioned. \"I mean she's not exactly up to date with world news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would've asked about her wealth of course.\" Sara chirped. The girl's eyebrows rose at her response. Ashley was the only one not to do so, for she was the reason Sara knew about that in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just going ask for some recipes, but your's is way cooler!\" Beverly replied, she tugged on her shirt a little, and was that pudge Ashley saw? Shaking her head, she listened on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. You see Aurelia may have been very wealthy, but it seemed that she didn't leave behind any will. And while the banks fatten themselves on whatever they could get, they never really got the true juiciness of the Belviews.\" Sara replied. The other girls eyes grew wide in wild thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, Annabelle voice came from behind the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls! I wanna get outta here! Please!\" Annabelle said in her most steady voice, but she couldn't quite keep the terror down. Slowly the door began to open, greeting Annabelle with faces of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Annabelle?\" Beverly stated, looking at her friend. Ashley had a playful grin on her face as she saw the woman, while the others faces were covered with various degrees of worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabelle weirdly moved herself in front of the others, but Ashley just jotted that down to the country girl trying to warm herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, riggghhhttt...\" Ashley teased. But she did wonder if Annabelle actually got any pictures from the place.Dallas however pushed past everybody to proclaim her annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone ready, good, awesome? Okay, because Honey-Bun has made snacks and they're getting cold right now, so lets get to my house, chop-chop!\" Dallas announced. She walked down the steps of the manor and motioned for the girls to follow her. Sara shrugged, going over to Dallas. The rest of the girls fell into place with Annabelle being the last one to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn skirt, It seems even tighter now!\" Ashley whispered under her hushed breath.</span></div></div>",

Ashley shifted her booty a little bit, her tights still weirdly clingy to her lower half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I might as well see what wrong in the bathroom.\" </i>Ashley thought, but before she could go forth, somebody else beat her too it, five somebodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dallas, my gal, can I use the Lou?\" Melissa announced. Ashley looked over to her the ghost girl and swore she could hear something like a balloon blowing up under the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dallas, can Kim and me both use the bathrooms? Beverly pleaded, while Kim nodded in approval. Kim's skin seemed to be colored in a strange blue hue, while Beverly seemed a little flabbier near the arms. Which given the amount she usually eats, didn't surprise Ashley that much, it seemed like the weight had finally caught up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dallas, my friend, I may need to use you latrine.\" Sara spoke. Ashley stared at the Gothic witch and her eyebrows rose a little. Ashley could faintly see that Sara had gained a minor hourglass figure or maybe Ashley was just hallucinating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. Dallas I think I need to use the potty.\" Annabelle humbly said. Ashley looked over to her and could see the cowgirl adjust her top in discomfort. Ashley swore she saw Annabelle's breasts constrict against the bindings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas looked over to her friends--and Ashley saw her lips had grown a little plumper--scratching her head in thought. She spoke a little while later, after coming to her own conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls. We have two bathrooms, you don't have to ru-\" Before she could finish, the group raced past the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt being a one-story house, didn't allow much room for movement, but it's linear path did allow a straight shot to the latrines. And it seemed like somebody had already won. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Melissa screamed out,somehow not tripping in her large cloth costume. Melissa closed the door, while the others looked at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine!\" Ashley rushed forward,leaving the others dazed for a bit, taking a few ticks to get their nerves working again.</span></div></div>",

I do wanna go!\" Annabelle said bravely, straightening up slightly. \"In fact, I'll go first! Pick a room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay... Find the Master Bedroom!\" Sarah said. \"And take a picture so we know you've been there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Master bedroom? E-Easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why'd I say this would be easy?\" Annabelle whispered to herself, creeping along the dark hallway. \"T-This place is super spooky...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter marching into the foyer of the mansion, and the rest of the girls had pulled the old doors shut behind her, shrouding her in almost complete darkness, her bravado had disappeared instantly. But as much as she wanted to bang on the door and beg to be let out, she knew the other girls would never let her forget it, especially Ashley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, reluctantly and with an odd feeling within her chest, Annabelle began her hunt for the Master Bedroom. The first place she tried was up the once Grand Staircase, whose wooden stairs creaked beneath her feet. Until she had reached the top, she held her breath, just in case she needed to scream for help should she fall through. Thankfully, she didn't, meaning she let out a relieved sigh when she reached the top, which presented her with a choice. Left, which led into darkness, or right, which also led into darkness. After a moment of deliberation, she chose the right path, bringing her to now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>At least it's warm in here</i>, Annabelle reasoned, adjusting her top slightly. Since she had entered the building, an odd feeling had filled her chest. Annabelle assumed it was apprehension, as she was incredibly nervous about being here. But as she crept along the hallway, the feeling persisted, as did an odd tightness in her chest...</span></div></div>",

Looking at the vase for a moment, Annabelle let out a sigh as she turned back to stare at the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I guess it was too much to hope for plaques on the doors...\" She mumbled despondently. \"Suppose I should just start checking rooms...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to the door nearest her, Annabelle took a calming breath before pushing the door open. Its hinges squeaked as it swung open, revealing a bedroom of sorts that was illuminated by moonlight streaming through a dusty window. Stepping in, Annabelle froze as the floorboards creaked beneath her feet. Taking another deep breath, she stepped forwards again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, it's a bedroom</i>, Annabelle thought, glancing quickly around the musty room. <i>But it doesn't appear... grand enough to be the Master Bedroom. Aw, well... Onto the next room, I suppose. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Annabelle turned to leave, she caught sight of something that looked as though it didn't belong in the forgotten room. A gleaming mirror with a gilded golden frame, its surface shining and clear. Taking a cautious step towards the mirror, Annabelle found her nervous reflection staring back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why does this look so new?</i> She wondered, running a hand over the smooth frame. <i>Does somebody still live here? N-No, they couldn't... This place has been abandoned for almost two centuries!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back, Annabelle stared at her reflection again. She wasn't a part ugly girl, nor was she anything great to look at, but this mirror somehow made her look attractive. Her brown hair, tied back in a ponytail, swayed back and forth as she looked at herself. Her brown eyes flitted around anxiously, inspecting her average body, which was clad in an outfit that made her resemble Jesse from Toy Story, minus the hat. And yet, something seemed amiss with her reflection. Running her eye up and down her body, Annabelle quickly figured out what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"M-My chest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabelle's hand flew to her chest, where her once nearly flat bust had been replaced with two, rather hefty melons that were straining to escape her top. Making contact with one of the fleshy orbs, a groan of pleasure escaped Annabelle's lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"They're... They're so sensitive!\" She gasped, lightly poking her other breast and groaning again. \"W-Why are they so big all of a sudden?! Something isn't right... I need to leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to leave, Annabelle let out a long moan as her tits knocked lightly against one another. While the majority of her mind was screaming at her to run, a small part wanted... more. More pleasure and bigger breasts. After all, she had always desired a more noticeable body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why not stay?</i> A voice whispered, making Annabelle scream. <i>Staying means a bigger chest, after all... </i></span></div></div>",

Walking about for a bit, Annabelle search showed no fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe its the..the house?\" Annabelle stuttered out. Steadying herself, she took out a shaky hand, holding an equally shaky phone. Angling the device, Annabelle began to take pictures of the room.Her nerves became firm again,but it seemed the voice wasn't quite done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You can always take more pictures if you'd stayed here.\"</i> The same voice whispered again. At this second event, Annabelle yelped out again, causing her to kick open the door and rush outside. Her feet shot off the ground like a bullet. Through the halls and down the steps did she fly out,until she landed back into the foray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing out puffs of breath, her back ached a little from her enlarged bosom. Wiping her forehead, Annabelle rushed forward and began to knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls! I wanna get outta here! Please!\" Annabelle said in her most steady voice, but she couldn't quite keep the terror down. Slowly the door began to open, greeting Annabelle with face of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Annabelle?\" Beverly stated, looking at her friend. Ashley had a playful grin on her face as she saw the woman, while the others faces were covered with various degrees of worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Annabelle stated, bending her back a little to hide her new melons, she continued to speak. \"Just a little cold and I wanna get back to a place a little warmer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, riggghhhttt...\" Ashley teased. Dallas however pushed past everybody to proclaim her annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone ready, good, awesome? Okay, because Honey-Bun has made snacks and they're getting cold right now, so lets get to my house, chop-chop!\" Dallas announced. She walked down the steps of the manor and motioned for the girls to follow her. Sara shrugged, going over to Dallas. The rest of the girls fell into place with Annabelle being the last one to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about her friends seemed weirder though, they all seemed a little <i>bigger</i> in some shape or form.</span></div></div>",

While she was relieved that she had chosen to run, a miniscule part of her was slightly disappointed that she had done so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Though, I suppose it's best I did run...</i> Annabelle thought, rubbing some warmth into her arms. <i>Who knows what would've happened if I'd stayed? Maybe our summoning ritual did work and it was Lady Aurelia, trying to trap me in that room and possess me! And once she did, she'd capture all my friends! Oh, man, I'm so glad I chose to -</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whatcha thinking about, Annabelle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"AHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a scream as a cold hand rested on her shoulder, Annabelle jumped backwards, sending her unrestrained breasts bouncing. Her fear turned to pleasure as they brushed together slightly, almost inciting a moan from the cowgirl. Thankfully, she managed to stifle it and, after a few calming breaths, turned to a confused Beverley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"D-Don't do that!\" Annabelle pleaded, folding her arms over her chest in an attempt to hide it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry~\" Beverley responded, pulling a bar of chocolate from her bag. \"You just looked so deep in thought, and I was curious about what you were thinking about! Is it the mansion? Or is it the party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh... Y-Yeah, the party!\" Annabelle lied. \"It's been a while since I've been to one, that's all. I hope I'm not too embarrassing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Eh, you'll be fine!\" Beverley said brightly, finishing off her snack in one big bite. \"Just don't drink too much and you'll be completely fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabelle nodded. She wasn't too big on the whole alcohol thing, unlike Ashley and Dallas, who both enjoyed a good drink, usually to the point where they ended up having to be escorted home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Speaking of Ashley... Was her backside always that... big?</i> Annabelle thought, her eyes drawn to her friends rear end, which seemed to be swaying a little more than usual. Not that Annabelle knew how much it normally swayed, but even Ashley's hips looked a little wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was the same for the rest of her friends, not just her and Ashley. Sarah, Melissa and Beverley all looked a little... softer. Sarah was sporting a small potbelly that pressed against her Witch costume, while Melissa's face looked a little puffier. And while Beverley had been a little chubby for as long as Annabelle had known her, she now looked rounder than before. Not in a fat way, but literally rounder than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Kim and Dallas, they weren't softer, but both still had something amiss about their appearances. Dallas' lips looked to be a bit plumper, as did her breasts, while Kim had an odd bluish tinge to her usually pale skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I know I'm not imagining these things</i>, Annabelle thought, casting a quick glance down at her own change. <i>What happened to us in that house? Was Lady Aurelia unhappy with us summoning her? Oh, I knew it was a bad idea...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabelle continued to worry about her friends sudden changes, as well as her own, until they arrived at an old community hall decorated with banners. Inside, music could be heard, along with a multitude of voices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Here we are!\" Sarah announced. \"Time to party, girls! And Ashley, Dallas, please be careful. I don't really want to end up covered in vomit again\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, I said I was sorry!\" Ashley responded, heading straight for the door. <br>\r\nThe rest of the group followed her and, after a quick check from the Bouncer, they were all in. Ashley and Dallas immediately headed off to the bar, Sarah joining them after a quick chat with Beverley. Beverley and Kim disappeared off in the direction of the buffet table, while Melissa remained with Annabelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fancy a dance?\" Melissa suggested after an awkward moment of silence between the duo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"S-Sure!\" Annabelle agreed, following Melissa to the dance floor.

Melissa's feet touched colored tile with delicate taps before going into a wild swing. Annabelle's dance was more of a controlled ritual, more in tune with the wide fields of old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Annabelle, that's not how you're supposed to do it!\" Melissa proclaimed, her costumed tied around her waist. She smiled, before a small hiccup issued forth from the girl. Annabelle giggled at her friend and tried to do her best emulation of her. A lot more clumsy emulation, but the thought was there. Many times she almost tripped on her own feet from her hazy dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"One of these days I'm going to get her moves\"</i> Annabelle thought happily. Right before a coldness caressed her breasts like twin vices. A weird sound that reminded Annabelle of rushing water filled her ears. Her began to beat a tidge faster and the cowgirl looked down to see her breasts beginning to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" She only got out before her corset tighten against her globes. The girl moaned out in pleasured horror as her boobs grew. She cupped her arms over her breasts. Melissa didn't seem to notice the fact and Annabelle didn't feel the need to show off. In fact, she almost appeared to be dealing with her own problem. A sound more reminiscent of a balloon hissing was coming faintly from Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Annabelle was probably imagining that noise. Thinking quickly, she whispered a few words out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa, I gotta get outta here for a moment. Got some bad chaffing on me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine Annabelle.\" Melissa quickly hurried her words out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabelle nodded and ran away from the dance floor. She looked around for a bit before she saw the sign for the ladies bathroom. Rushing into the room, she breathed out a sign of relief, which resulted in a small snap of her corset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did this to me?\" Annabelle cried out.</span></div></div>",

They were isolated, out of the way and easy to miss, so had been left untouched and unappreciated for some time.

She was a little ditzy, but loved to have a good time, and was constantly in a good mood, always seeing the positive side of any situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them sat their friends, Mark and Debbie. <b>Mark </b>was a lot more slender than Zac, but still in good shape. He had dark, well styled hair which drew attention to his pale skin and dark eyes. He was wearing jeans and a black t shirt, and was holding a map, trying to give Zac directions. Mark had a sarcastic, cynical sense of humour, but could always be relied upon in a crisis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting next to Mark was <b>Debbie</b>, who was currently reading a book she had packed. Debbie had short brown hair and wore a loose, knitted sweater and jeans. A pair of round glasses sat on her pretty face, and she kept brushing a strand of hair out of her view. Though she had never admitted it, she had quite a crush on Mark. She was quite bookish and geeky, and usually could be found reading a book rather than out partying like the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back seat sat, currently asleep, was <b>Taylor</b>. Taylor's hair was dyed purple, and she had a punk like style, with a lip and nose piercing, tattoos and dark lipstick. She wore a striped tank top and a tight, leather skirt. She was quite a daredevil, usually found encouraging others to get into all sorts of trouble and always ready to try new things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think we're finally here!\" Zac announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd find it babe,\" Tiffany said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would've found it much sooner if you'd listened to my dam directions,\" Mark said, lowering the map and glowering into the rear view mirror. \"We nearly went off a cliff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't a <i>cliff</i>, Mark, just a...small hill...\" Zac said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark exchanged a look with Debbie, who laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taylor, time to wake up, we're here,\" Debbie said, reaching around to give Taylor a prod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh...right...the cabin...\" Taylor groaned as she awoke, rubbing her eyes and yawning nosily. \"Cool, we made it here alive. Never doubted you, Zac.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car pulled up outside one of the two cabins, which were reasonably close together and probably about a five minute walk apart. They were nestled just on the edge of the forest, with the trees looming behind them, and a fine layer of fog starting to creep in as night settled. The group jumped out of the car, happy to stretch their legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, me and Tiff will take the one on the right,\" Zac said, before remembering something. \"Oh wait, ours has three beds and the other has two...but ours has the jacuzzi...didn't you want that one babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany nodded eagerly. \"Only reason I came.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I'll take the spare room,\" Taylor shrugged. \"Keep it down though...you two can be...noisy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac and Tiffany exchanged a knowing look and smiled at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we'll take the other one,\" Mark shrugged. \"You happy with that Deb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure, no problem,\" Debbie smiled, trying not to hide her contentment at the arrangements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark grabbed his and Debbie's stuff and headed off, with her trailing behind him. She waved goodbye to the others and hurried to catch him up. Zac grabbed everyone's stuff effortlessly and carried it off to the cabin in his muscular arms...</span></div></div>",

A front room with two armchairs and a large couch and a kitchen and bathroom. Adjacent to the cabin was a large Jacuzzi. Tiffany took Zac by the arm and led him to the window which overlooked the hot tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we try it?\" She asked, excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, if you want, babe,\" Zac said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany clapped her hands together excitedly and ran off to get changed. Taylor headed off to her room and closed the door behind her, apparently uninterested. Zac found the hot tub control on the inside of the cabin and switched it on, along with a set of heated lights above which lit up the entire area. There was a cover over the top, but Zac had been told everything had been cleaned for their arrival by a local maid or something. He hadn't questioned it, but they had apparently done a great job because the entire place was very clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany emerged from the bedroom a few moments later and Zac's jaw dropped as he saw her approach. She posed in the hallway, leaning against the wooden wall of the cabin as she showed off her swimsuit; a tight fitting red bikini which drew attention to her perfect body and sizeable breasts. \"You like it?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that...\" Zac said. \"Head on out. I'll get changed too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac hurried to the room, giving her a pat on the butt as he went. He stripped out of his clothes and put on a pair of swim trunks, taking a moment to admire his muscular, toned body in the mirror and flex a bicep. He hurried back out, eager to get to Tiffany, who had removed the tarp from the top of the tub and was lowering herself inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac quickly followed her in, savouring the feel of the hot water and the bubbles on his skin. Tiffany gave a soft moan as she submerged her body beneath the water...</span></div></div>",

She's not going to get much sleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark laughed. \"Maybe, she can sleep anywhere though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Debbie giggled. She was enjoying getting to spend some time with Mark without the others around. She had had a crush on him for as long as she could remember, though she had never plucked up the courage to tell him. He was very hard to read sometimes; they always seemed to get on so well, but he had never made any moves, which made it seem like he wasn't that interested. Maybe this weekend away would change that though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark opened up the door to their cabin and stepped inside. He flicked a light switch and a dim light flickered on above them. The cabin itself was immaculate and untouched. It was smaller than Zac and Tiffany's, but very cosy. It had two bedrooms, a small kitchen and a front room with a fireplace, sofa and set of drawers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rustic,\" Mark said, nodding towards the fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it, it's cosy,\" Tiffany said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark took his stuff off to his room, and Tiffany unpacked her clothes and books. Her room was small, but she really liked it. The bed was only a single, but when she tested it, it was plenty comfy. She exited the room again and collided with Mark. \"Oops, sorry,\" she blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries,\" Mark said, gently touching her arm as he walked back to the front room. </span></div></div>",

Since when do cabins have basements?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's for storage or something?\" Mark suggested. \"Weird though. Shall we take a look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Deb could answer, Mark pulled the hatch open and climbed down. Deb wasn't exactly keen to go down into a dank, dark basement where she couldn't see, but decided to follow him down anyway. Stepping down a rickety ladder, she missed the last step and dropped the rest of the way. Fortunately, Mark caught her before she fell flat on her face. \"Thanks,\" she said, adjusting her round glasses with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries,\" Mark said, gently brushing her arms as she steadied herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved to flick a light switch on and the basement area lit up, revealing a work bench, chest of drawers and a bookcase. Examining their surroundings, the pair checked out the four corners of the room. Mark batted a spider away from his head awkwardly, apparently not a fan of bugs. Deb blew the dust off a book on the shelf, which was a very old, thick looking tome. She flicked through some of the pages, which were written in a language she couldn't make out. The other books looked to be trashy romance novels, some Harry Potter books and a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1994 annual. Quality reading material, obviously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was looking at an antique mirror, in which he was adjusting his hair. He didn't really see much of value around here, but it had been worth checking it out just so he could catch Debbie when she tripped on the step. She was so cute when she was looking worried. He'd often wondered whether to ask her out, but she never really seemed that into him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's everything,\" Mark shrugged, taking one last look around. \"I'm going to hold on to this mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to check this book out,\" Deb said, holding up the ancient looking volume. \"I'm interested to see what language it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went back up stairs, closing the hatch behind them. It was getting late at this point, and the journey had tired them out, so they said good night and went off to bed...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When she was back in her room, Debbie sat on the bed, cross legged, and opened up the book. She felt a sense of disappointment that Mark hadn't asked her to stay up and do something fun, but she guessed he had just been tired. Maybe she was getting her hopes up. It didn't seem like this was going to be the weekend he asked her out after all. She sighed and looked down at the book; at least she could satisfy her curiosity and get some reading done in the tranquil forest environment. It was pretty peaceful up here, and she wondered whether to find a nice quiet spot in the morning where she could catch up on her books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now though, she was interested in that weird old book she'd picked out of the basement. She looked down at the fad ed, crumpled pages and started flicking through; the words were in a foreign language, but not one she recognised. There were, however, some odd pictures scattered throughout the book of men and women; some short, some tall, some fat, some thin...every different type of body really. She carried on flicking and came to an image on the inside of the back cover of a beautiful,  winged woman with small horns. Underneath the image was the word \"Zellera\". Subconsciously, Debbie read the word out-loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Debbie noticed a strange, purple smoke coming from the floorboards. With a shriek, she jumped off the bed and went for the door, but found herself turning back as the smoke engulfed her vision. She coughed and spluttered, fanning the air with her hands, fearing the entire place had been set on fire somehow. Then, as soon as it had appeared, the smoke began to melt away and form into a human like shape. Debbie gasped as the smoke formed into a feminine, human silhouette and a woman stepped out, the same woman she had seen in the drawing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in front of her had long, red hair that reached all the way down to her butt. She wore a red corset and knee high boots, and had a long, forked tail. The corset accentuated her curves, bubble butt and impressive cleavage. She was wearing a dark red lipstick which drew attention to her pale, milky skin. Smiling as she took a step forward, she looked Debbie up and down. \"Thank you, mortal, for freeing me. I thought nobody would ever find that book.\" She stretched out, her wings extending across the room. Her cracked her neck and extended her arms like she had just woken up from a long nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie couldn't believe what she was seeing. She kept fiddling with the door knob, trying desperately to escape, but she couldn't seem to get a grip on it. As she continued to struggle, she felt something wrap around her waist, and looked down to see the girl's forked tail snaking around her middle. She let out a little yelp and found herself being pulled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be scared,\" the winged girl said softly. She pulled Debbie to within an inch of her face and smiled at her. \"My name is Zellera, but you know that, you read my name from the book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...\" Debbie tried to find the words, but could not. She was terrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I'm a succubus,\" Zellera said, her hand brushing Deb's cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't make Debbie feel any better. She knew full well what a succubus was. \"Please, don't hurt me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZellera rolled her eyes. \"Silly girl, I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to help you. You do know what a succubus is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie nodded nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me look at you,\" Zellera said, taking Debbie's face in her hands and raising it to hers. She stared into her eyes. \"There's something here you want...no...someone...and he's sleeping in the next room. I can help you get what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Debbie asked, unable to look away from Zellera's red eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make you irresistible to your friend, is that what you want?\" Zellera asked. \"You freed me, and I owe you a debt. Let me repay it. Let me give you the man you most desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie's mind was racing. Never mind that Demonic creatures were real and that she inadvertently summoned one, now this creature was promising to help her with her love life! It was all too much to take...but it was a tempting offer. \"How would that work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZellera grinned. \"Well, I can enchant you to make you his perfect woman. I could change your body, your mind, your appearance, your hair colour...anything...I can see into his heart too, and I know what he would like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does he like?!\" Debbie asked, desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can't tell you that, that's not part of the deal,\" Zellera giggled. \"But if you are willing to try it, you can find out. He will never know anything has changed. I will change reality so that he thinks you were always this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie considered the offer, did she really want to risk this? Did she really want to change herself just so Mark would like her? </span></div></div>",

But there will be a price next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie didn't like the sound of that, but before she could ask any further questions, Zellera raised her hands, spread her wings and was engulfed in a bright, green glow. She pointed her hands to Debbie, and she flinched as the green glow engulfed her as well. Zellera began chanting something in a strange language, and Debbie found head going a little fuzzy as a strange, tingling sensation overwhelmed her and the magic began to take effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie's slim body began to change quickly, though she had no awareness of what was happening. Beneath her loose, knitted sweater, her breasts were starting to swell from modest B Cups to enlarged D cups. Her bra strained against the sudden growth, eliciting a moan from the stunned Debbie as she felt her nipples pop out over the lacy cups. Her skinny jeans tightened and began to stretch as her legs thickened considerably, her rear end inflating from an almost completely flat ass to a juicy, swollen bubble butt not too dissimilar to the succubus's own. Tears began to form along the seams of her pants as they stretched to accommodate her thick thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghhhhh...\" Debbie moaned, still blissfully unaware of what was happening to her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZellera smiled eagerly as the transformation continued. Debbie moaned again as her sweater grew more constricting around the arms. Her flat, concave stomach began to bloat, a fine layer of flab forming over the visible abs before bulging out over the waist band of her jeans. The swelling continued, and her stomach was quickly changed into a soft, burgeoning pot belly. The top button of Debbie's jeans popped open as her growth continued, her stomach widening and rounding out even further, forcing the zipper on her pants all the way down and sagging down over her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that'll do for now,\" Zellera said. \"Nice and chubby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green glow dissipated, and Debbie slowly opened her eyes and clutched her head. \"Ugh...what...what happened?\" She asked, before catching sight of herself in the mirror. Her jaw dropped, and she screamed. \"Oh my God! What did you do to me? I'm fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly fat,\" Zellera said. \"Just a little chubby. Nice and thick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie grabbed her new, soft belly and squeezed her added chub. She was mortified to discover that her pants had burst open, and her ass was overflowing from the back. Her jeans and sweater clung to her once svelte, petite figure uncomfortably. Her face, thankfully, remained largely the same, though it did seem a little rounder and less angular. She couldn't believe it. She had put on about sixty pounds! She felt huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made you two hundred pounds, exactly,\" Zellera said. \"Not too big, not too small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't want to be fat! I can barely fit in my clothes!\" Debbie cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course, I always forget about that,\" Zellera said. She clicked her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie watched as, at the click, her clothes began to mend and repair themselves, expanding to fit her new body. Her pants stretched and grew to accommodate her chubby belly, the button re-appearing and the torn seams fusing back together. She felt her swollen tits settle back into her bra, and her sweater became much more comfortable, though still a little tight across the chest. She felt better now, at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, why don't you go and show Mark your new look before you decide you hate it?\" Zellera asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie looked herself over in the mirror. Would Mark really like her like this? She wasn't so sure now, but maybe it was worth a try. \"Okay...you're sure he'll like me like this? I feel like a total chubber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll love it,\" Zellera said, giving Debbie a reassuring pat on her juicy butt.  </span></div></div>",

Zellera had told her that she would change reality so that Mark had always thought she looked like this, but what if she was lying? Or what if the spell didn't work? Or what if Mark didn't like this kind of thing at all? Deb's mind was cycling through every worst case scenario, but she steeled herself and knocked on his door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" Mark called from inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie took a deep breath and stepped inside. Mark was sitting on the bed looking at his phone, though what he was doing with it out here when they had no signal at all, she had no idea. She stood by the bed for a second as he looked up at her and smiled. His eyes flickered with what might have been surprised for just a moment, and she spotted a green glow in his pupils which flashed and disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how are you doing?\" Deb asked, wondering how he was going to react. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I'm good...felt a little weird just then,\" Mark said, rubbing his eyes. \"You look...uh...different...something new with your hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, don't think so,\" Debbie said. He knew something was up, but clearly didn't know what. Zellera's magic was working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Show him some skin,\"</i> Zellera's voice echoed through her head, making her jump. <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Huh? Where are you?\"</i> Debbie asked back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Watching, now, lift that sweater and show him your cute, soft tummy...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie felt compelled to listen. Subtly, she lifted her sweater with one hand, exposing her soft, bulging belly. She pretended it was just a casual movement and that she wasn't aware she was even doing it, but she saw Mark's eye immediately drift to her stomach, so she held the sweater up as she spoke. \"I'm so bored, do you want to hang out?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Mark stammered, quickly getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie led him back out and they made their way to the couch and sat down. She felt up a little more of the seat than she used to, and noticed her plush and squishy her butt felt as it sank into the cushion. Her belly bulged over her pants, forming into rolls as she sat down. It was a weird feeling. Mark sat pretty close to her, and she smiled. It was actually working. But then again, she'd never asked him to sit with her like this before - was it the weight or the confidence she felt now? She wasn't sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did you want to do?\" Mark asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Debbie blushed. \"What do you think Zac and Tiff are doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably trying out that hot tub, she hasn't shut up about it for the last few weeks,\" Mark laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dread to think what they're doing in it,\" Debbie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they can't keep their hands off each other for five seconds,\" Mark laughed. \"I'm glad I'm here with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I'm here with you too,\" Debbie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey inched closer together, and Debbie reached out to touch Mark's leg, squeezing his knee. Mark put an arm around her waist. \"You know...I've always liked you...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you have?\" Debbie gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, didn't you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I've always liked you too!\" Debbie said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you were interested!\" They both said at the same time, before bursting out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I was, you're like, my favourite person,\" Mark said. \"You're smart, and funny, and beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie blushed. She couldn't believe this was finally happening. Was it really all because of her body? She wanted to speak with Zellera again, but before she could, Mark leaned in and kissed her. She kissed back, wrapping her arms around him as he ran his hand along her back. It was finally happening, and she couldn't have been happier...</span></div></div>",

Mark's hands travelled around her back, running along her sides before settling on the bulge of her new tummy. She flinched a little at his touch, unused to having this extra bulk, let alone having her long standing crush caressing it, but she had to admit it felt quite soothing. She reached under his top, sliding her hand over his stomach in return; he wasn't nearly as ripped or muscular as Zac, but still had some nice abs. She felt a little embarrassed that she was now the heavier one out of both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mind this, right?\" Mark asked, keeping his hand on her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" she replied, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's hand ran over her bulging stomach, pushing down a little into her extra chub. She let out a little moan, enjoying the new sensation. She raised from the couch and switched positions, sitting right on his lap. Her changed body meant that she occupied more of than she would have liked, but he didn't seem to mind, gripping hold of her plump behind and giving her a pull towards him. Inching further towards Mark, she felt a familiar, tingling sensation throughout her body...the same sensation she had felt before after the magic had taken effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh no...\"</i> She thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mark lent in to kiss her again, she looked down and cringed as she saw her stomach bulging visibly before her eyes. Her thighs spread out even further, thickening across Mark's lap. Fortunately, her clothes were adjusting to her new changes as she grew, which was a relief, but even with her sweater, she could see that her belly was becoming more and more rounded and prominent, making her look a little pregnant. Mark, however, appeared oblivious, apparently Zallera had been right about him not noticing any changes...but she felt a lot bigger now. It was hard to tell how much she had put on, but as the tingling faded, she feared it was about another fifteen pounds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not too big for your lap...am I?\" She asked, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No!\" Mark said. \"I love your body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie blushed again and coyly lifted her sweater. Her round, soft tummy bulged free into Mark's lap, pushing against his chest, and he instinctively caught it in his hands, eliciting another moan from Debbie. \"You don't mind this chubby belly?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's great, your curves are amazing,\" Mark said, squeezing her belly playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her growing embarrassment over her new size, this was actually going really well, though as she looked down at her exposed pot belly, she wondered whether it was getting a little too round. From her current vantage point, it looked huge. She had always been so skinny, and wasn't used to seeing herself so big and full. Her concerns were quickly silenced from her mind when Mark grasped her swollen butt cheeks, causing another moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you like my butt too, huh?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" Mark said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie giggled, enjoying the attention. Perhaps this wouldn't be so bad after all...</span></div></div>",

Mark was still groping her exposed tummy, so he didn't seem to have noticed, but she was concerned about where that noise had come from. Zallera had told her that her clothes were grow with her body...so why had something suddenly ripped? Unless it wasn't her? Maybe she was just being paranoid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pop!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie cringed she felt the top button of her pants pop open, her stomach bulging forward and pushing down the zipper of her jeans. Her belly covered the gap, keeping Mark oblivious, but it was clear that there was something wrong. Her fears were confirmed as she began to feel an increasing tightness across her legs, her jeans digging into her new curves painfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Teaaaaaar!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pants were stretching so much that the seams were beginning to tear apart, becoming thinner and more delicate as her thighs struggled to co-exist with them. She looked down at her stomach, still in Mark's lap, but it didn't seem to be growing this time. It was perfectly still, and yet, her sweater was getting tighter too. She had pulled her top up to just beneath her breasts, but now it seemed to riding up even further, her enlarged boos spilling out as it rose above them, shrinking around her new body. It was then she realised that she wasn't growing bigger again, her clothes were returning to their original size! The magic that had been used to make them growth with her was wearing off! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark noticed something was up and looked confused, apparently realising that Debbie's clothes were changing. \"Oh...you uh...you lifted your top up a little more...heh...\" He said, as Debbie's breasts spilled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie went red. \"Uh...yeah...hope you don't mind,\" she said, cupping her hands over her breasts self consciously. She could feel her bra shrinking as she spoke, and was worried it was about give way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Mark breathed. \"They're amazing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Debbie said, not releasing her grip. She could feel her bra straps digging into her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rrrrrrrrrrrrrip!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the tearing had come from her ass. She could feel cold air on her cheeks as the seat of her pants became much, much smaller. Her ass spilled out, panties shrinking with the rest of her clothes and turning into a thong beneath her rounded, soft, cheeks. She couldn't take anymore of this...Mark was going to see her clothes split at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in just a sec!\" Debbie announced, shuffling backwards off of Mark's lap and hurry from the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deb! Wait!\" Mark called. \"Is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Just give me a minute!\" Deb called back over her shoulder, hurrying to the bathroom.  As she rushed down the hall, her pants started to rip away from her body, her ass spilling out the back as they tore right down the middle. She squealed as she darted inside the bathroom and locked the door behind her. \"Oh God, oh God...\" she repeated, horrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step forward, and her jeans split down the sides, her fleshy thighs spilling free as her ass demolished the back seat and the useless garment fluttered to the floor. Her sweater had grown so tight it was starting to become uncomfortable, so she ripped it off over her head and tossed it aside. Walking to the mirror, panting heavily, she came face to face with her reflection, and realised just how big she had become. Her face looked rounder, and her breasts were way too big for her now undersized bra, and breast flesh was rising over the lacy cups, spilling out and fighting for freedom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to take the pain any longer, she tried to reach around and fiddle with the clasp, but the movement of her arm was enough, and her tits exploded free, her nipples ripping out of the bra and jiggling in front of the mirror. She instinctively grabbed her huge boobs in her hands, feeling her fingers sink into the soft flesh. Seeing them exposed for the first time since her transformation, she was amazed by how large they had grown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClad in nothing but her thong-like panties, Debbie could only stare back at herself in the mirror. She adjusted her glasses, and wondered how the hell she was going to explain this...</span></div></div>",

How was she even going to leave the bathroom now? She was completely naked! She should have gone to her room instead. She cursed herself for being so stupid. She should never have made that deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, she saw a purple mist began to form behind her, reflected in the mirror. She spun around, relieved, on this occasion, to see her Demon benefactor. \"Oh, you're back!\" She squealed, excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense things are going well,\" Zallera smirked, noting the girl's nudity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, kind of...Mark was really into me, but...my clothes starting shrinking back to normal,\" Debbie said. \"And I grew again! I mean, he didn't notice anything just like you said, but why I did grow even bigger?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZallera looked confused. \"That's weird, I didn't use that spell, it was just a one time thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh...I think I may know what's happening,\" the Succubus said. \"So...um...I may have failed to mention this, but this was the first time I've tried anything like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?!\" Debbie exclaimed, her belly jiggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I was still in training when the last people to visit this cabin trapped me in the book,\" Zallera looked a little sheepish. \"I've not really experimented with desire transformation based spells before. I think maybe the more you and Mark fall for each other, the more you grow. I may have goofed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May have?!\" Debbie snapped. \"Look at me! I had to run out of the room before he saw me naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why is that a problem?\" Zallera asked, genuinley confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...\" Debbie stammered, taking her point. \"We're not there yet! Besides, I couldn't just explain away that my clothes had spontaneously shrunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, good point,\" Zallera conceded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, he said he's always like me anyway, I didn't need to do any of this,\" Debbie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did? That's great!\" Zallera said. \"But...I mean...he definitely likes you like this though.\" She grabbed Debbie's pot belly and shook it for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie pulled away awkwardly. \"Maybe he does, but I'm way too big now! I would have been okay with a few extra pounds, but I'm pushing 225 now, and I don't want to be any bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Zallera said. \"I think I can change you back, but like I said, there's still a price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Debbie asked. </span></div></div>",

She instinctively covered herself up, before remembering she had locked the door and nobody could actually see her in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deb? You in there?\" Mark called from outside the door. \"Are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie wasn't sure what to say. She adjusted her glasses and stared herself down in the mirror as she cycled through a series of ridiculous excuses in her head, but what excuse could she realistically give for what had just happened? Her clothes were ruined, shredded. Her body was huge. She was trapped in a tiny bathroom in some very tight panties with her crush knocking on the door. The only way out of this, to her horror, was to face Mark and tell him the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand extended towards the lock, trembling. She gripped it in her hand and, when she had stopped shaking, unlocked the door and slowly opened it. Covering her breasts with her folded arms, she stepped back into the corridor, where Mark was waiting. His jaw dropped when she merged, blushing, covering herself as best she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deb...you...your...\" Mark stammered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Mark...my clothes just...couldn't hold on,\" she said. If Mark liked her body like this, she had decided she was just going to embrace it and hope for the best. \"I've just gotten so big lately...I'm sure you've noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...uh...\" Mark looked down at her chubby, bulging stomach, then back up to her barely concealed breasts. \"I actually hadn't but uh...you look amazing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just so embarrassing,\" Debbie said. \"I was tearing right out of my clothes, I've gotten so...so fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deb, you look amazing,\" Mark said. \"I think you're absolutely gorgeous! I always have! Who cares if you've put on a few pounds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mind how chubby I've gotten?\" Deb asked quietly, deliberately pushing out her belly to make it seem even larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to take anymore, Mark moved forward and kissed her. His body squeezed against hers, pushing her into the wooden wall of the cabin. She felt her soft butt cheeks spread out against the wall, her panties straining audibly as they were stretched beyond their limits. She prayed they wouldn't break. They were all she had left. And yet, in that moment, she found herself releasing her grip on her breasts, allowing them to drop free and push against Mark's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark noticed this and pulled away to get a better look. \"Wow...Deb...your boobs...my god...\" He gasped, his eyes lighting up as he stared down at Deb's enlarged breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're so big now,\" Deb said, cupping one of them in her hand and hefting it closer to Mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark extended his hands and gently squeezed her tits, eliciting a moan from the chubby, bespectacled girl. She couldn't believe how good they felt. Her nipples hardened and she felt her increasingly useless panties getting wet. Wanting more, she grabbed hold of Mark's shirt and pulled it off over his head, revealing a toned, but slender figure. Mark unbuttoned his pants and fumbled with them, eager to get undressed, and Deb helped him by yanking them down. Now only in his boxers, Mark kissed her again, his hands running along her curves, up to her breasts and down to her plump behind. He took her by the hand and led her back to his room... </span></div></div>",

Even Mark heard the noise, and returned his attention to her soft gut, massaging it gently as it continued to rumble. Debbie blushed, surprised by the sudden onset of hunger. If she had to guess, she would have said that her sudden weight gain had greatly increased the size of her stomach and the amount of food needed to fill it, and that sandwich she had eaten in the car ride here probably wasn't going to cut it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark gave her tummy a gentle pat. \"Hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very...\" Debbie admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me get you something,\" Mark said, hurrying off to grab the cooler of food they had brought with them. He dumped it down beside the couch and opened it up, revealing it to be packed full of meat, cookies, cakes, chips, cheese and bread. \"I could make you a sandwich?\" He suggested, to which Debbie nodded eagerly, cradling her roaring belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark hurried off with an armful of ingredients while Debbie sat and groaned, her hunger growing stronger by the second. Mark finally returned after what seemed like an eternity, carrying a huge, footlong sub he had made up, crammed with what looked like every ingredient from the cooler. Debbie felt herself drooling at the sight, and eagerly grabbed it from Mark's hands, taking a huge bite before he had even had a chance to offer it to her. He didn't seem to mind though, settling onto the couch beside her and watching her eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie knew she was acting like a pig, greedily inhaling her food and munching through her jumbo sized sandwich, but she didn't care, she was ravenous. \"It's so good, thanks Mark,\" she managed to say in between bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you like it,\" Mark said, directing his gaze down to her bulging, exposed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie could feel his eyes on her, and had barely realised that her top was still pulled up, but she just kept eating, demolishing the last of the sandwich in three large bites. \"Mmmm...that was so good,\" she lay a hand on her stomach, only to feel it rumble again. \"Oof...I guess I'm not quite full yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark eagerly pulled the cooler nearer and offered her some chips and cookies. \"More?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie nodded, taking the chips and immediately tearing into the bag. She popped one after the other into her mouth, one hand resting on her stomach and the other feeding herself. Mark pushed the cookies towards her, and she began alternating between the two, popping a few cookies into her mouth then a handful of chips. Mark slipped in more snacks as she went, offering her brownies, doughnuts and small cakes. Debbie didn't really notice the difference, she just kept reaching for more, shovelling more and more food into her face to stop her protesting tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she had finished was feeling incredibly bloated. Letting out a long, gutteral, moan, she reclined in the couch seat and spread her legs, allowing her overstuffed gut to spread out. She was so <i>full</i>. She had never eaten so much in her life. The button of her jeans dug painfully into her pudgy belly, while her newfound love handles seemed to have swelled out in every direction. She doubted she'd have been able to pull her top back down even if she tried. It seemed that her clothes only grew when she fattened magically, not when she made a pig of herself naturally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's hands rubbed the sides of her engorged belly, stroking her tight, stuffed gut. \"Wow, you can really eat,\" he said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I made such a pig of myself, Mark...\" Debbie blushed, enjoying the feeling of his hands on her swollen middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to apologise,\" Mark said. \"You were just hungry. Besides, you look amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie was about to thank him for the compliment, but found a pressure rising in her chest. Before she knew what was happening she opened her mouth and let out a long, gassy \"URRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\" Blushing intsenely, she turned away, mortified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're cute when you burp,\" Mark replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to him, surprised, and found herself more at ease. \"Hehe...sorry,\" she giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pop!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both heard the noise and looked down to see Debbie's belly bulging forward. The top button of her pants had popped open, unable to bare the pressure any longer. Debbie was embarrassed, but grateful for the extra room. \"Ugh...oh God...I'm such a pig,\" she moaned. \"I need new pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark leaned in and kissed her, passionately, one hand still on her globular belly. Debbie moaned softly, loving every minute. </span></div></div>",

Their cabin, while bigger than the one Mark and Deb were staying in, was still rather small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, not small...</i> Taylor thought, glancing towards the set of double doors that led out to the jacuzzi. <i>More... cosy. Yeah, cosy.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from the jacuzzi, where she could hear a few giggles, Taylor wandered into the other room in the cabin. She wasn't quite sure what to call it, as it was an odd mixture between a living room, a dining room and a small kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess this is the living corner</i>, Taylor thought, collapsing into an old sofa and sending up a cloud of dust. Coughing, she waved the dust away and inspected the rest of the room. Opposite her, in what was now the 'Dining Corner', sat a table with four chairs set around it. And on the other side of the room was the kitchen, complete with an old stove, a fridge-freezer combination and a sink. <i>As I said, cosy!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemaining on the sofa and staring out an adjacent window at the sun, which was setting behind the nearby forest, Taylor's silence was soon broken by a grumble. Glancing down at her svelte belly, she sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later... Well, let's see what we brought with us\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBouncing to her feet, she made her way towards a bag that had been unceremoniously dumped in the table. Unzipping it, she was met with various food stuffs, ranging from cans of soup to a freezer box filled with meat. Leaving the meat alone, she pulled out a loaf of bread, some cheese and a bit of ham and, ingredients cradled in her arms, made her way into the kitchen side of the room. Spreading her ingredients atop the stove, Taylor went about making herself a sandwich. It wasn't the most extravagant of meals, but it was simple and delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And... perfect!\" Taylor announced, dropping a slice of bread atop her meal, completing it. \"Should store this stuff in the fridge, make sure it doesn't spoil... Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling open the fridge, which she had expected to be empty, Taylor was met by a couple of plates, both stacked with various treats. She could see cookies, brownies, doughnuts... All delicious looking, and probably very heavy on calories. And yet, compared to her simple ham and cheese sandwich...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A cookie or two wouldn't go amiss, would it?</i> Taylor thought, grabbing a couple of cookies from the plate nearest her...</span></div></div>",

Crossing the room to the couch, she took a bite of her sandwich, which, while decent, was far less appealing than those soft, chocolatey cookies. None the less, she finished the sandwich off in a few bites. She was about to reach for a cookie when she heard a moan from Tiffany and some splashing around. <i>Hope they clean that tub after their finished...</i>she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sandwich gone, she eagerly reached for the cookies and bit into the first one. They were amazing! Perfectly chewy and soft. She didn't know who had stocked this place up, but they were clearly an amazing chef. Her hand reached for another cookie, and another, and she continued popping them into her mouth as she sat and looked at her phone. The signal out here wasn't great, so an attempt to load her Instagram failed. \"Ugh, hate being without technology,\" she grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was beginning to regret coming along for this trip. While Mark and Deb would probably hook up and Zac and Tiff would spend the whole weekend fucking, she was pretty much a spare part. She felt disconnected from the world and wasn't really sure how she was going to pass the time. She had slept plenty in the car, and wasn't feeling at all tired. With her mind elsewhere, she looked down to see that the plate of cookies were now a plate of crumbs. Surprised, she got back up and returned to the fridge, loading up her plate with more snacks; half a dozen brownies, two doughnuts and another handful of cookies. She told herself she wouldn't eat them all in one go, but when she got back to the couch, that was easier said than done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man these are good...\" Taylor said in between bites, crumbs spilling down her top as she greedily munched her way through the brownies. \"Well, if nothing else, at least I can enjoy the food up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGobbling up everything on her plate with increasing speed, Taylor soon found herself reaching for a pile of crumbs again. \"Jeez...gone already? Dam, these are moreish. Think I'll get more. Heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother trip to the fridge and another plate full followed, with Taylor settling comfortably onto the sofa with a larger portion, chomping her way through the delicious snacks. Her stomach was slowly beginning to bloat, pushing out against her tight leather skirt. When she had finished her third helping, she was starting to feel a little full, and noticed the prominent bulge beneath her top. \"Oops, guess I overdid it on the snacks,\" she laughed, patting her full tummy. \"Bit of a food baby there, Tay.\"</span></div></div>",

Giving her belly a final squeeze, her belly grumbled lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But you're so full!\" Taylor told her, earning another gurgle in response. \"Well, play then... You've convinced me! A fourth plate won't hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her feet with a sigh, Taylor grabbed her plate and returned to the fridge. Despite having greedily gobbled down three full plates, the two platters in the fridge still seemed as full as ever. In fact, it looked as though she hadn't even touched them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Weird...</i> Taylor thought as she began to stock up her fourth plate. <i>But whatevs. Treats are good...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she scooped a couple of brownies onto her plate, she heard a door behind her swing open, followed by a few giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Stop it, Zac!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmmm... I think I'll have to punish you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh? In that case...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the sound of flesh being slapped, followed by an excited squeal from Tiffany, Taylor rolled her eyes in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not like I'm right here or anything...</i> She thought, topping off her pyramid of treats with a jelly doughnut. <i>Whatever, I've got my treats to keep me company!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffing a whole custard doughnut into her mouth, she closed the door with her hip and began to make her way back to the sofa. As she passed by the hallway, the door on the left creaked open, Zac and Tiffany practically falling through it in one anothers arms. Falling up against the wall, Taylor watched them whisper into each others ears for a moment before, with an amused cough, she made her presence known to the two lovers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"O-Oh! Taylor! I didn't see you... there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany broke away from Zac, the bright smile on her face morphing into a slightly more confused one as she caught sight of the massive pyramid of food Taylor held. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Where'd you get all that?\" Zac asked, cocking a curious eyebrow. \"Pretty sure we didn't pack that many sweets\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This? There's plates full of the stuff in the fridge,\" Taylor answered, lifting a cookie and devouring it hungrily in two bites. \"Dunno how it got there, but they're super tasty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I... can see that,\" Tiffany noted, her eyes glued to Taylor's swollen gut. \"Maybe you should cut back on them? And stop eating them? I mean, who just eats food they find in a cabin in the middle of nowhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor didn't answer immediately, her mouth stuffed full with a jelly doughnut. Swallowing, she grinned back at the duo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nothing wrong with them! Unless being too tasty is a crime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from her friends, Taylor rammed a brownie into her mouth, crumbs raining down between her breasts, and returned to the sofa. Planting her rear end back on the sofa, she quickly lost track of time as she gobbled her way down the pyramid. With each bit of food swallowed, her belly pushed outwards a little more, her tank-top gradually sliding up and revealing more and more of her belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aw, man... Those are good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the final eclair into her mouth, Taylor let out an exhausted groan. Stoking her belly, a quiet burp escaped her body. While she would've happily returned for a fifth plate, her belly was stuffed to capacity. Any more, and she might burst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Urgh... So full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting as she pushed her full body to its feet, Taylor rested a hand on her lower back. With the amount she had eaten, her food baby had reached the latter half of its second trimester. Her walk having devolved into a waddle, Taylor started for the hallway, intending to rest off her meal. Zac and Tiffany watched her go, concern on their faces...</span></div></div>",

The rather judgemental looks she had gotten from Zac and Tiff had shamed her into not eating anymore tonight, though, oddly, she felt that she could easily have scarfed down a couple of extra brownies. She had become increasingly annoyed at how judgemental those two fitness freaks had been since they got together; constantly talking about how fit they were, how much time they spent at the gym, how hard their abs were...ugh...it was tiresome. How dare they make fun of her just for eating a few extra snacks? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouting, Taylor unzipped her skirt, breathing a sigh of relief as her stomach bulged forward, free of it's leather prison. She shuffled the skirt down her legs and kicked it away, kicking off her shoes and socks and sitting down on the edge of her bed. Her hand immediately went to her bloated tummy, massaging it in small circles. She hadn't noticed before, but her tank top had ridden up, embarrassingly, over her belly button, which might have explained why Zac and Tiff had looked so concerned. But oh well, they'd seen a belly button before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor pulled her top up even further, exposing the entirety of her very full, very round, looking belly, and gave it a pat. \"Maybe they were right actually...I look pregnant...feeling kinda tired though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot bothering to change into her pyjamas, Taylor lay down and let her head sink into her surprisingly comfortable pillow. The whole bed seemed incredibly comfortable actually, and surprisingly roomy for a single. She shifted a few times, trying to gain a more comfortable position, which was made difficult by her gurgling, stuffed belly. She finally settled on her side, hand resting atop her stomach as she drifted off to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rolling over onto her other side, a cute noise escaping her mouth as she did so, her hand fell away, only to be replaced by her other one. Unlike the first, this one was a tad more active, slowly tracing circles around her indented belly button. As it did so, her belly gurgled and groaned quietly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly yet steadily, her gut lost its solid shape, taking on a much softer and more malleable one. As Taylor rolled onto her back, both hands coming up to rest atop it, her belly bulged outwards, sagging down over the waistband of her panties. As it did so, the rest of her trim body seemed to thicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts, nowhere near the size of Tiffany's yet still larger than Deb's, grew slightly, gaining maybe a cup size and making both her bra and tank-top for around them a little more snugly. Lower down on her body, her black panties stretched as her hips gained a layer of pudge that bulged over their waistband. Her ample ass swelled slightly, her panties slipping a little between the soft cheeks, while her thighs pushed closer to one another, stopping with about an inch of space between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as quickly as it had started, Taylor's growth came to an end. Her hands, which had been rather rigid atop her belly during the whole ordeal, fell limp before falling to either side of her body. A yawn escaped Taylor's mouth as she seemed to sink further into her mattress, a content smile on her face as she dreamed of that fridge and its delicious contents...</span></div></div>",

I mean, look at this belly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan escaped Taylor, followed by a feeble slap on the hand poking her soft gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Even your breasts and backside are bigger! What have you been eating, girl?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a hand rudely cupped one of her breasts, Taylor finally awoke.

Meanwhile, they let out their own yell, however theirs was slightly more surprised than angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What the hell, Tif?!\" Taylor demanded furiously, protectively crossing her arms over her plush chest. \"What kinda wake-up was that?! I dont know how you and Zac do it, but you can't just walk into somebody's room and start touching them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry, sorry...\" Tiffany bowed in apology. \"But I couldn't help it! You're getting a little... soft...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Taylor blushed a furious red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I...I...I'm what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Just look at your belly, Taylor! You've put on a little weight recently! But not to worry, Zac and I can help you work it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Tif?\" Taylor asked sweetly. \"Get outta my room. And come back when you learn some manners\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany was still for a moment before nodding. Getting to her feet, she headed for the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you want our help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"GET OUT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany let out a squeak before slipping out, the door closing behind her. Taylor, breathing heavily, stared at it for a few moments, trying to calm herself down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God, she's so dense!</i> Taylor thought. <i>You can't wake somebody up by groping their tits, then call them fat! Like, come on, Tif, we aren't all fitness freaks who live in a gym with our hot boyfriend! Though, as much as I hate to admit it... She wasn't wrong...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her belly with both hands, Taylor gave it a light shake. Its surface rippled slightly, the underside bouncing lightly against her panties. Letting go of her new pudge, Taylor then turned her attention to the rest of her thickened frame. Before she could properly inspect it, however, there was a knock at her door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, Taylor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up, her eyes narrowed dangerously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Zac, I swear to God, if you comment on my weight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your weight? Nah, not at all. You watch it well, why would I comment on it? We're about to start the barbeque. You in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh... Oh, yeah. Just give me a few to get changed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Mark disappear down the hall, Taylor bounced out of bed. Ignoring her belly, which bounced with her, she scooped up her shirt and began to pull it up her legs. It went up fine, until she reached her backside. Designed to cling tightly to her body, it didn't agree with her plumper backside, quickly getting stuck beneath her cheeks. After a brief struggle, Taylor managed to yank it over her backside. Unfortunately, due its tightness, a band of flesh bulged over its waistband. Tugging her tank-top down as best she could, Taylor left her room and went to join her friends outside...</span></div></div>",

Taylor rolled her eyes, though she couldn't deny he looked good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac had a whole cooler full of burgers and hot dogs he was tossing on the grill, way too much for the five of them, but maybe he was planning on bulking up again. He always ate a lot of food when he was trying to pack on muscle. Taylor took a seat beside Mark and Deb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep okay?\" Mark asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty good,\" Taylor said. \"Hey, did you guys have a fridge full of goodies, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Deb exchanged a confused look and shook their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, just ours then,\" Taylor shrugged, feeling her bulging tummy push against her skirt. She wondered if Mark and Deb had noticed too, but neither seemed to be staring at her the way Tiff had, so that was a plus.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac soon served up the burgers, and Taylor eagerly went for one. Despite her binge last night, she was feeling like she could easily eat some more. There seemed to be a huge pile of meat, so Taylor loaded up her plate with two burgers and two hot dogs. Even that seemed to draw a judgemental look from Tiff, who glanced knowingly down at her choices.

Grateful for Zac's interference, Taylor stocked up again, piling three burgers and two hotdogs onto her plate this time. As she returned to her seat, she overheard Mark and Deb's conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I dunno, I think we should tell them...\" Deb muttered. \"Maybe they can help us explore it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The only things those two are exploring are each other,\" Mark replied with a smirk. \"And Taylor... Well, it's right up her alley. She loves exploring weird places. But...

Thankfully, the garment was still in one piece, but barely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, God...</i> Taylor thought, setting her plate on her seat and poking her swollen hips. <i>If Tif sees this, she'll force me on a diet.

Just as she was about to take her hand off her side and pull the door open, she heard an audible <i> Rrrrrrrrrip!</i> from below. \"Ah crap, that better not have been what I think...\" Taylor grumbled, casting a glance over her shoulder to make sure nobody had seen, or heard, the sudden tearing. Fortunately, the others were all busy crowding around the BBQ, all apart from Tiffany, who was, Taylor now realised, standing to her right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tif...\" Taylor greeted awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tay,\" the redhead replied, hands on her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just on my way to the bathroom,\" Taylor said, gently pushing on the door. <i>Oh God, where did that rip come from? Has she noticed the skirt? Just my luck...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tay, you're skirt just ripped right down the middle, I can see your panties,\" Tiffany said, shaking her head judgementally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it what?!\" Taylor went red and felt the back seat of her skirt, her fingers slipping inside a large tear right down the middle of her butt. \"Ah, fuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tay, I know you think I'm getting at you, but I'm only trying to help,\" Tiffany said. \"This isn't normal. You shouldn't be literally eating yourself out of your clothes, it's not healthy, and it's kind of embarassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, really feeling the embarrassment angle, thanks Tif,\" Taylor said, hand pressed firmly to the open gap in her skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry if was rude to you before, but you know I'm only looking out for you, right? If you want I can help you diet, remember the last time, you got those awesome abs!\" Tiff said, excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Taylor appreciated the peace offering and the apology, she couldn't stand to try another of Tiffany's crazy-ass diets. \"That's really nice of you, Tif...I'll uh...think about it, after I change into something more comfortable.\" With that, Taylor ducked inside the cabin and hurried to her room. With an immense sigh of relief, she let go of her skirt and turned to face her reflection in the mirror; Tiffany hadn't been wrong, she could gotten bigger, but had barely even noticed it happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why didn't she say anything before today? Not like her to miss when someone puts on a few pounds. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor unzipped her skirt at the side and let her tummy bulge free. With a groan of relief, she sat down on the edge of her bed and let her bloated stomach bulge over the top of her skirt, forming a chunky roll of flab that she could have sworn had only just appeared. Prodding it gently, she was surprised by how soft her stomach had grown. With a sigh, she pulled her skirt down over her thighs, squeezing it pass her wider legs and kicking it away. It was useless now, which was really a shame, considering it had been her favourite one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stupid belly,</i> Taylor thought, poking at her newfound flab. <i>Not my fault my metabolism sucks. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor rose from the bed and picked something new from the clothes she had packed; a pair of jeans  which had been a size too big when she bought them. She usually wore them with a belt, but as she slipped them up over her legs and past her thighs, she realised that wasn't going to be necessary this time. Buttoning them up, she found her stomach had much more room to breathe, and wondered whether the skirt had shrunk or something? Maybe that was the problem after all? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left her room and walked back outside, following her nose back to the BBQ...</span></div></div>",
