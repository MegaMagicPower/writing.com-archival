As anyone who has followed the series should know, Mikoto Misaka was involved in a project that required 20,000 clones of herself to be produced. Long story short, more than half of them were killed by a character named Accelerator, who was the focus of the experiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, about this story... I wondered what kind of chaos could happen if all 9,986 remaining clones suddenly grew into giantesses. It would definitely have a lot of possibilities. I obviously don't expect you to include detailed descriptions of what each and every clone is doing at any given time, but I would like you to at least make it clear that there are a lot of them out there. I don't want it to seem like one clone is doing all the work. And just so you know, all of the clones are connected to the Misaka Network, which allows them to transfer their memories and experiences from one clone to another. Basically, if one clone learns something and she wants the rest to know it, they will know it instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings that I would enjoy seeing:<br>\r\n&gt; the army of giantess clones taking over the entire world (one city at a time, or all at once)<br>\r\n&gt; some of the clones finding and playing with the original Mikoto Misaka<br>\r\n&gt; some of the clones hunting down Accelerator and taking revenge on him for killing so many of them<br>\r\n&gt; the clones, after taking over the world, live their lives as evil dictators of the world (preferably with post-apocalyptic scenes of cities in ruin <br>\r\nor being burned to the ground)<br>\r\n&gt; the clones, after taking over the world, use their authority to lead society into a Utopian age without any more wars (or freedom)<br>\r\n&gt; an \"Our army is bigger than yours\" type scene where the military tries to take on one of the clones, only to be surrounded and wiped out <br>\r\nby several of the others<br>\r\n&gt; one of the clones being tied to the ground in her sleep, Gulliver-style, and being rescued by another clone a few minutes after waking up<br>\r\n&gt; some hot lesbian action between two or more of the clones<br>\r\n&gt; some tiny people being picked up and sandwiched between two or more of the clones' boobs<br>\r\n&gt; the original Mikoto trying to oppose her massive copies, only to be completely outmatched and imprisoned as a slave<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I wouldn't mind seeing, but don't necessarily encourage:<br>\r\n&gt; one or more of the clones being wiped out by the military, and the others taking revenge by stomping them out of existence<br>\r\n&gt; some of the clones finding a way to get even bigger than the rest of them and turning on the others<br>\r\n&gt; one of the clones falling in love with a tiny man, and keeping him as her boyfriend<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I don't want to see:<br>\r\n&gt; male giants (DO NOT WANT!)<br>\r\n&gt; the original Mikoto Misaka getting killed off (if the clones find her, I want them to either play with her like a toy, imprison her to use as a <br>\r\nslave, or take her on their shoulder to watch their actions up-close)<br>\r\n&gt; the original Mikoto being turned into a giantess (that defeats the whole purpose of it being a \"clone giantess\" story)<br>\r\n&gt; anything related to futa<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor info on the series, Toaru Majutsu no Index: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.com/wiki/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index_Wiki\" target=\"_blank\">http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.com/wik...</a><br>\r\nand<br>\r\nFor info on the clones themselves: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.com/wiki/Radio_Noise\" target=\"_blank\">http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.com/wik...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are some pictures of the clones so you know what they look like<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loli clone in front is 'Last Order', the one who was created to control the Misaka network.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100630200132/to-aru-majutsu-no-index/ima...\" target=\"_blank\">http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis picture is actually what inspired me to make this story.

Just give it up, you can't escape!\" Accelerator shouted as he chased after a fleeing Misaka clone through the power plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisaka #1095 had foolishly engaged Accelerator in battle with an overconfident attitude. Fighting against Accelerator in a power plant, she thought that her ability to control electricity would give her an easy edge in this fight. The location of the battle should have given her a greater advantage in her fight than the other clones had been given. But instead, it did absolutely nothing to aid her in her battle. Accelerator's vector-change ability allowed him to redirect any attack that she launched against him away harmlessly, and he had easily forced #1095 into a full retreat. It may have been her destiny as one of the clones made specifically for the 'Sisters Project' to be killed by Accelerator, but she was still terrified of dying nonetheless.She was now retreating as fast as she could, but it was pointless in the long run. Accelerator was merely toying with her, and he eventually got bored of this game. He quickly used his vector-shift ability to catapult himself over the clone's head and land directly in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, tsk, tsk... Didn't I tell you that there was no escape? Just accept your fate!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccelerator then placed his hand on #1095's stomach, and used his abilities to send her flying in the opposite direction. The helpless Misaka clone was thrown like a rag doll, and she quickly collided with a massive generator behind her, and got tangled up in power wires. Accelerator was now walking slowly toward her, laughing at her futile struggles to untangle herself and escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n#1095 soon realized that she wouldn't be able to escape in time, and decided to try one last desperate strategy before she was killed. Grabbing one cable in each hand, the Misaka clone began drawing the electric energy from the generator in an attempt to recharge her power. She had only intended to use the energy to amplify one of her own lightning bolts enough to stun her attacker and give her more time to escape, but she was amazed by what began to happen instead. As she continued absorbing the energy, #1095 felt her body beginning to grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin mere seconds, she had almost doubled in size. From her original height of 5'3\", Misaka #1095 was now at least 10 feet tall! She was still growing, and she easily snapped through the cables that only moments ago held her captive. Upon reaching a height of 25 feet tall, she turned around and smirked at Accelerator. At her new size, the intimidating boy who was about to kill her earlier looked to be only slightly above 1 foot tall. Needless to say, she couldn't help but find it amusing how pathetic he now looked. Even Accelerator himself was fairly nervous upon seeing his victim's sudden growth spurt, but he wasn't about to show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... You sure grew pretty fast. Maybe now you'll be able to pose a decent challenge for me!\" Accelerator bluffed. On the inside, he was shaking in his boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#1095 simply burst out laughing. She just couldn't believe that this puny little creature was still trying to threaten her given the obvious exchange of power between the two. It amused her to no end that she was cowering in fear from this fool only minutes ago, and now she had him completely at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, Accelerator... I doubt you have it in you to even try attacking me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccelerator scowled in anger. As terrified as he was, he wasn't about to let himself be told off by a girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?! Just watch me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then launched himself off of the ground with his powers and aimed a flying kick straight at the Misaka clone's stomach. It connected perfectly, but #1095 didn't even flinch. She simply giggled as Accelerator's valiant attempt at attacking her bounced off harmlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jee, little guy... That tickled!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccelerator now stood frozen with a look of terror now clearly visible on his face. As he looked up at the devious face of the towering Misaka clone above him, he immediately realized just how helpless he really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The result: a formula that can turn any normal human into an abnormal on par with Medaka Kurokami herself. However, before the formula could be tested, it is mysteriously stolen. The thief is a female student at Sandbox Academy, and when she drinks the formula, she learns that it was much more powerful than initially intended. The formula grants her unlimited power, turning her into an omnipotent goddess. What she does with her new power is up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Try to keep the characters in character. I'm fine with them going a little power-crazy when they become a goddess, but don't make them do anything too extreme. (Ex: There's no way a kindhearted character like Medaka would start killing entire cities for her own amusement.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The formula can only be used by one character. She can share her power with other characters, but she is the only one who truly becomes omnipotent. As such, the one who drank the formula is always in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. The girl who drank the formula can do anything she wants. Be it growing to giantess size, brainwashing hundreds of boys to serve her every whim, or even creating an entire new universe, she is able to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No super-short chapters. I will allow choice chapters, but if you don't add a real chapter to one of those choices, I will delete it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. No male characters can be given power in any way. The formula's effects only work on women.</span></div></div>",

A simple formula of green liquid, held within a single test tube that was now hidden in the desk of Sandbox Academy's principal. This formula would change the world. It held the power to turn any human, be they Normal or Special, into a superhuman Abnormal on par with even the great Medaka Kurokami herself! This revolutionary formula would usher in a new age for humanity, and soon everyone on the planet would be able to surpass their limits and do things that they could never have dreamed of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was the dawn of a new age. The only thing that needed to happen now was to test the formula, and then it could be mass produced and released to the world. However, fate had something else in store for the world. That formula would never see the light of day. On the night of its creation, it had been left locked away in the principal's desk. One girl, knowing of the formula and what it was capable of, resolved to steal it for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that night, the girl snuck into the principal's office without ever being detected. With incredible ease they broke through the lock that was keeping the principal's desk shut; keeping that formula out of their reach. She stole the formula and then swiftly escaped into the night, leaving not a single trace behind. Her path illuminated by the light of the moon, the thief ran off into the night to begin the execution of her own plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we continue, who was this girl?

The formula was surprisingly easy to get, considering that they must have known that Abnormals would want to steal it. And she was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally she wouldn't steal the result of someone else's hard work, but it started once she heard that the Flask Plan was complete. As soon as she heard that, she felt a pull, a pull so strong that not even the beast woman could resist it entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, here it was. The formula that would supposedly make anyone as Abnormal as Medaka Kurokami. As such, Medaka was quite interested to see what would happen if she herself drank it. More to the point, she NEEDED to see what would happen. She felt that it was odd how strong her desire was, but she just shrugged her shoulders. She'd find out the cause of that later. For now, she had a formula to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the liquid reached her mouth, Medaka felt a rush greater than what she imagined was possible. Quickly downing the rest of the formula, Medaka felt the rush multiply itself again and again and again. It was a feeling similar to what she felt whenever she went Altered God Mode, but it was if that was just a drop of water to the bottomless ocean she was now. She didn't just feel powerful, but she KNEW that there was nothing in existence she couldn't do with utter ease. If she could imagine it, she could do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedaka smiled warmly at this knowledge. It would appear that stealing the formula was the right call after all. Snapping the fingers in her free hand, she made the test tube disappear without the slightest trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, she pondered what she should do with her power now. It would sure be fun to play around with her new abilities, but ppart of her thought she should wait until tomorrow to inform her student council on what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive or so nanoseconds later, she decided to... </span></div></div>",

Ever since she was born you had helped your parents take care of her. Unfortunately, your parents both died in a car accident soon after your 18th birthday. You had planned to move out and live on your own, but you knew that you couldn't just leave your sister behind. Five years later, you're a 23 year old young man and are living alone with your little sister Sarah. Now she's 16, but her disease keeps her from doing much in the way of physical activities. Without the strength to take care of herself, you appointed yourself as her caretaker to make sure she was able to live a happy life. However, when something strange causes you to shrink down to 6 inches tall, your roles are suddenly reversed. Now you are the helpless one, and to make up for everything you did for her over the years, Sarah has promised to do everything she can to take care of you from now on. Thus, our story begins with you and your sister as you try to maintain the peaceful life that you worked so hard to create.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert (you): Age 23. Robert is an average young man appearance-wise. He's fairly muscular, but not enough to really stand out from the crowd. He's a caring and selfless person who has dedicated his life to taking care of his little sister and making her happy. Over the years he's worked hard to earn as much money as possible. Combining these earnings with the money that he inherited from his deceased parents, he was easily able to afford a small house and all the necessities. With plenty of money left over, he was planning on retiring from his many jobs so that he could take care of his sister full time. Unfortunately, things didn't quite work out that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah (your sister): Age 16. Sarah is a cute girl with a fairly attractive appearance. She's very pretty, but due to her condition she's also very skinny as well, and she is generally a little self conscious about her outward appearance. She was born with a disease that left her incredibly physically weak, and so she hasn't been able to do much by herself since the day she was born. In recent years, however, she has begun to come up with several innovative ways to get things done on her own. Not wanting to burden her brother for her entire life, she began to work hard to become increasingly self sufficient. And it's a good thing she's been learning how to take care of herself, because soon she'll need to be able to take care of her precious brother as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy (your nextdoor neighbor): Age 24. Sammy is a mature young woman who lives next door to you and your sister. Much like you, her parents disappeared as well and she was forced to move out with her little sister. Due to the similarities of your circumstances, the two of you instantly hit it off and became close friends. She's very kind and has helped you out greatly on more than one occasion. She's a bit of a tomboy, but she tends to flirt with you every now and then. A bit of a tease, she loves a good prank and once helped Sarah position a bucket of water over your bedroom door on April Fool's day. You've known her ever since you moved in next to her, and over the course of five years she has become something of an elder sister figure to both you and Sarah. She would gladly do anything she could to help you and Sarah if you ever needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya (Sammy's little sister): Age 8. Maya is a hyperactive little girl with a deep admiration for Sarah. Never being able to hold still herself, she was amazed when she met your sister and saw how calm she was. After meeting Sarah when she was only three years old, Maya began to look up to her and aspired to become like her. The way she used her creative mind to make up for her weakness was a major inspiration to young Maya. Although she's still just as hyper as ever, she's recently started taking after Sarah by creating all sorts of gizmos and gadgets to assist her own older sister's daily life. Unknown to you, while your sister is amazingly smart for a girl her age, her intellect pales in comparison to Maya's. Maya is nothing short of a child genius, and her most recent creation was actually the cause of your sudden shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No male characters other than you.<br>\r\n2. Keep the characters in character. Sarah isn't going to take advantage of you once you shrink, she's going to try and help you.<br>\r\n3. No single sentence chapters.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It started out as an ordinary day. Nothing at all seemed out of the ordinary. You had just woken up and were walking to the kitchen so that you could prepare breakfast. As you walked down the hallway, Sarah's bedroom door opened and she came rolling out in her wheelchair with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, big brother. How are you doing today?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling back, you responded to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, sis. I was just about to get breakfast ready for us. Come on, I'll make you something special today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said as you grabbed the handles of her chair and wheeled her along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you big brother... You're too good to me... Really, you don't need to go to such lengths for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not another word, sis. I'm not doing this because I need to. I'm doing it because I want to. You're my precious little sister. What kind of brother would I be if I didn't take care of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah simply closed her eyes, smiled, and kept quiet. Just spending time chatting with you like this was the highlight of her day. And today was off to a great start. Both you and Sarah honestly believe that this day would turn out great. After parking your sister's chair in front of the table, you began getting to work on breakfast. However, this was when your day suddenly took a turn for the unexpected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly out of nowhere, a bright green ray of energy blasted through your kitchen window and struck you. Soon your body began glowing in a brilliant green light, and before you knew what was going on, you found yourself dwindling away in size. Sarah looked up when she saw a flash out of the corner of her eye, and when she saw what was happening to you, she immediately panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big brother!\" She yelled as she jumped out of her wheelchair and rushed over to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need the wheelchair really, but with how weak she was, even something as simple as walking tired her out easily. She rarely did it, and so you were shocked when you looked up to see Sarah walking toward you with that worried look on her face. By the time Sarah reached you your shrinking had stopped, and you were only 6 inches tall. With tears in her eyes your sister scooped you off the floor and hugged you against her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big brother, what's going on?! What happened to you?! Why are you so tiny?!\" Sarah asked in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know... It just suddenly happened.\" You said, looking up at Sarah's massive face looming over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't worry, big brother. Your little sister isn't going to let anything bad happen to you. I'm going to protect you and keep you safe no matter what. Now I can finally do something useful. I can finally make up for everything you've sacrificed to make me happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean that it's finally my turn to be useful to you for once. Ever since I was born you've taken care of me. And after that day, you worked yourself to exhaustion just so that we could have this house to live in together. I've never been able to do anything for you. I've just always been too weak. All these years you've given me the most perfect life imaginable, and I couldn't give you anything in return. But now... Now there's something that even a weakling like me can do. I can keep my tiny big brother safe and give him the same amazing care that he gave me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah then held you out in the palm of her hand and smiled at you, wiping the tears away from her eyes. This whole situation was just so bizarre. Everything started out like any other day, but now look where you were. Within seconds you had shrunken to the size of a toy, and now you were sitting in the palm of your weak little sister's hand. What's more, she said that she was going to take care of you from now on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, bro, I know just what to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah said as she carefully dropped you into a pocket on her nightgown that was directly over her heart.You could feel the warmth of your sister's left breast through the silky material, and so you began to blush. Patting her pocket to make sure you had landed safely, Sara began walking toward...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you want your gift points immediately, please message me that you added so that I can get back to you.&gt;</font></div><br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"> (choice chapters are not included in the offer and you will not receive gift points for writing them.)</font><br>\r\n</div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am flat out amazed that, with a big of a series as Precure is, there is only 1 interactive for it on this entire site. To remedy this issue, I'm making my own Precure interactive. As with most of my other stories, this is going to be another giantess interactive, this time starring the girls from each of the various seasons of the Precure anime as they grow to monumental sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those of you who don't know about Precure or its characters, here's a link to the Precure wiki so you can inform yourselves: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://prettycure.wikia.com/wiki/Pretty_Cure_Wiki\" target=\"_blank\">http://prettycure.wikia.com/wiki/Pretty_...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, on to the rules:<br>\r\n1. No male giants. Only giantesses.<br>\r\n2. The when the Precure girls grow, you can choose if you want them to be in either their civilian outfits or their Precure uniforms. If you pick the former, then they'll still have the ability to change into Precure mode later on. If you pick the latter, then they're stuck in that form and can't change back while they're giant, but they have unlimited access to all of the powers they have in those forms.<br>\r\n3. Their clothes grow with them. You can have them undress at will, but they won't burst out of their clothes if they grow too much too fast.<br>\r\n4. The Precure aren't the only ones who are allowed to grow. Their are plenty of female villains in the series too, and they can also be made into giantesses if you want.<br>\r\n5. Keep the girls in character. The Precure won't randomly turn evil after growing to massive size, and the villains won't randomly turn good (unless they actually did have a heel-face turn within the series, then it's acceptable to have them be either good or bad).<br>\r\n6. No super-short single sentence chapters. Make your additions a reasonable length.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The dragons were massive and powerful, but they lacked intelligence. Since they acted only on instinct, humanity had been able to hold their own against them. One day, however, a massive dragon with human-like intelligence arises and unifies the dragons under her rule. Now that the dragons have access to the one thing that the humans could use as an advantage over them, what exactly will become of the human race?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Some information about the races and characters in this story</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans: Humans are as you would expect them to be. They are exactly as they are in real life, relying on their superior intelligence to overcome adversaries who would otherwise outclass them in every way. In the war against dragons, humans have been able to hold their own by setting traps and engaging a single dragon with many well organized soldiers acting in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragons: The dragons in this story are different form normal dragons. They are an entirely female race and have a mostly humanoid form. They possess powerful wings and tails, and their bodies are coated in thick scales that act as a natural armor to protect them from all but the sharpest of blades. Although they look fairly similar to humans, they have very little in the way of intelligence. They act almost entirely on instinct, and humans are their favorite prey. The average height of a dragon is 25 feet tall, with the tallest capping at around 30. In addition to their massive size and monstrous strength, they also possess the ability to breath fire freely. In addition to their low intelligence, they have difficulties dealing with multiple fast moving targets simultaneously, and thus a large organized group attacking in unison would have an advantage and be able to defeat one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExedra: The dragon queen. Exedra appeared out of nowhere one day, and her arrival signaled a major turning point in the war between humans and dragons. Unlike most dragons, Exedra is not driven by instinct. She has intelligence beyond even most humans, and is able to command the dragons at will. Even compared to other dragons, Exedra is truly massive, towering at an enormous 150 feet tall. In addition to all of her power and intellect, Exedra is immortal, never aging no matter how much time passes. She may even have access to some kind of magical powers. Little is known about her origins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Rules</u><br>\r\n1. Male dragons don't exist.<br>\r\n2. Humans can't grow. The dragons are the only giantesses.<br>\r\n3. Other rules may be added later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Humans and dragons had been at war for thousands of years. While humans are smaller and weaker in most aspects, they held one key advantage over their dragon adversaries. The dragons were like animals, driven only by instinct and their desire to feed on humans. As such, up until that fateful day, it had been possible to fend them off using human ingenuity to outsmart and overcome them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one day all of that changed. Suddenly and without warning, the dragons begin to unify. Where in the past they would attack at random and without any semblance of a plan, now working together systematically to tear apart any weak points in the humans' defenses. It was as if someone were giving them commands and instructing them on how to successfully capture their prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was revealed that this was indeed the case. A massive dragon, towering over all others in the same way they towered over humans, announced herself to humanity. She called herself Exedra the Dragon Queen, and unlike all other dragons before her she seemed to have the same level of intelligence as humans did. Under her command, the dragons who had once been a disorganized mob quickly became an unified force and drove humanity to the brink of extinction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when it seemed that the dragons would wipe the human race off of the face of the earth once and for all, Exedra issued an ultimatum. Surrender and be enslaved by the dragons, or become extinct as the dragons raze them to the ground. The humans, left without any other option, chose to surrender to Exedra. That moment signaled the end of an era, and the beginning of another. Humans no longer ruled the world, now it was the dragons who were in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral generations passed since then. While the lives of all of the dragons and humans from the time of that war had long since been lost to the passage of time, Exedra alone still lived. Since the day she first appeared, she never once aged. Humans had hoped that she would one day die, and that the dragons would lose their sense of order along with her. Unfortunately for them, this would never happen. Not only was Exedra immortal, her influence had changed the dragons' very nature. Each passing generation of dragons grew increasingly smarter, until the day came when all dragons shared Exedra's monumental wisdom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that humanity would never again exist for any purpose beyond serving the dragons. Many villages existed for the sole purpose of breeding humans as food for the dragons. Others for training humans to become properly submissive slaves for their dragon mistresses. Some villages were built around massive colosseums, where humans would fight to the death against their own kin for the dragons' amusement. There was great variety among the many human villages that existed, but they all had one thing in common. They were enslaved. They only existed because the dragons allowed them to exist, and if they failed to satisfy their owners, they would be burned to the ground or trampled underfoot without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the role of humanity in the new world. Dragons had taken over and built up a society of their own over the ashes of the fallen humans. Exedra was the supreme authority in the world who was worshiped as a goddess by both humans and dragons alike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, from whose point of view would you like to observe this new society?</span></div></div>",

Ever since her game was canceled, she has tried many different methods to steal the role of main character from the hero of the games she appears in. So far, she has yet to succeed. Now she's pissed. Things all start going her way, however, when she finds a magical gemstone that gives her a new power: the ability to control her size at will! Now she has a new plan to become the main character, and the netherworld has one really powerful new giantess to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those who don't know who Asagi is: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://disgaea.wikia.com/wiki/Asagi\" target=\"_blank\">http://disgaea.wikia.com/wiki/Asagi</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is actually another story based on one I read elsewhere on the net. This time, I actually remember the source: The story 'Asagi Forever' on VGGTS World.com<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to read the original story that inspired this one, here's the link: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vggtsworld.ta-host.com/stories/multi/asagi.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://vggtsworld.ta-host.com/stories/mu...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. This story takes place in the universe of Nippon Ichi's main series, Disgaea, unless stated otherwise in the story itself (see rule 7).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Only Asagi can grow/shrink (she can also return to normal at any time if she wants to)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Asagi's clothes DO grow with her, but she can strip down on her own if she wants to. Basically, that means that I will allow her to be either clothed or naked. However, if she outgrows her clothes while not wearing them, then they will grow to fit her new size when she touches them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. The characters from any Nippon Ichi game are allowed to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. No ending the story (I will end it if I feel that it's appropriate)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Always leave at least 2 options at the end of a chapter. If you can't think of a second choice, then just put it down as 'other'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. I will allow you to have Asagi pulled out of the Disgaea universe and put into any other videogame's universe as one of her cameos. I would actually encourage this, as I would like to see what she would do if she were forced into another sideline role with these new powers. Just be sure to leave an option open for people to continue the story in the Disgaea universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all, have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Asagi was currently sulking next to a lake over her most recent failure to become a main character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang it! I can't believe that I messed up again! I was sure that I was going to be able to take the role of main character from that lame power ranger wannabe! I thought that if I dressed up as the main characters from other famous worlds, I would be able to pull it off! How can I keep failing! Is it really so wrong for me to be a main character?! It's bad enough that my game was canceled, but I keep getting thrown into all these other games as a permanent sideline character! It's like the company is trying to make fun of me or something! I can't stand this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsagi then kicked a nearby rock into the lake. As the rippling water settled, a faint glimmer caught Asagi's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsagi decided to examine the water for the source of the light. It wasn't in a deep enough area of the lake for her to need to swim. She simply tossed off her sandals, rolled up her pants to keep them above the water, and waded out through the shallow water to the light's origin. She bent down to look around, and what she located was a sparkling red gemstone. Asagi immediately picked it up out of the water and returned to shore. Slipping her sandals back on, Asagi began turning the red jewel around in her hands and examining it from every angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... This is beautiful! I wonder why it was just thrown into a lake like that... Maybe this day isn't going to be so bad after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the red gem began getting absorbed into Asagi's hand. She tried to pull it out, but it only continued to disappear into her palm. Asagi was panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is happening?! Why does everything always have to go wrong for me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the rock had completely vanished into her hand. As soon as it had been fully absorbed, Asagi's mind was flooded with information. She now knew what the stone was, as well as the new powers that it had provided her with. A broad and devious smile spread across Asagi's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I can't believe that such a harmless looking gem could have that much power! If that thing gave me the ability to control my size at will, then this could be my ticket to becoming a main character once and for all! Hahahahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsagi then decides to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Conveniently, it also has a rather large female cast. As such, I found myself thinking: \"what if they actually did a parody of the giantess genre?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those who want to add to this story, I would like you to remember the nature of the series that the story is based on. I would like you to keep the characters' personalities consistent with the series itself. Feel free to include all of the wacky antics that occur in the series. You want to have a 50 foot tall Hyatt spontaneously die and crush an entire city block as she collapses, feel free! She'll just end up popping back up as if nothing ever happened a few minutes later anyway! You can feel free to go as crazy with this as you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut there are a few rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) No male giants, futa, or shemales!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) You can stick to the typical giantess stuff if you want, but remember that this is meant to be a parody. Be sure to throw something out there to show this every few chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Lesbian is fine, but no male/male stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Please use proper grammar! If a chapter is too messy for me to read, then I will edit it to make it more legible... But I really don't want to go through all that work, so please try to write properly on your own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, please know that this story is based on the anime, not the manga. If there are any contradictions between the 2, the anime takes priority. Sorry to those who prefer manga to anime, but I prefer anime, and this is my story...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, that's all.

So, please- don't blame me for what happens next!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MENCHI, GET BACK HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cries of the hunger-crazed woman echoed through the air, disturbing neighbors. Excel accelerated after her whimpering dog, knocking various objects off the dressers and walls. Her roommate, Hyatt, lay peacefully on the ground, the hurried footsteps and shouts not disturbing her temporary death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nF Prefacture, F City was once a wonderful, bustling metropolis, with nice green spaces, and buildings far enough apart for someone between 50 and 250 feet to walk between without much difficulty. Yet, due to the recent economic crisis that had struck Japan, living conditions were poor. Innocent people found themselves violently tossed between jobs, unable to keep a steady income, and desiring to crush the upper class beneath their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, the secret ideological organization, ACROSS, was born. An underground revolutionary group, lead by the charming and charismatic Lord Il Palazzo, they swore to bring the world to justice, and end all forms of war and inequality. But for now, since the group consisted of four members- said leader, Excel, Hyatt, and Menchi- they'd lower their goalposts. First, conquer the city. The rest would come naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, despite her optimistic devotion, Excel was stuck on a limited budget. So, there were days where her fridge was empty. On those days, Menchi, her pet dog, doubled as a living pack of emergency rations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Menchi! We all have to make sacrifices for the good of the city! I've done my part, Hyatt's done hers- it's your turn! It won't be so bad, I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bare feet slammed against the wood floorboards as she dashed forward, reaching out for the horrified canine. Drool ran from her mouth, fangs protruding slightly, her green eyes dazed in the hunger-driven trance. Excel's legs became a blur, her orange ponytail flapping as she ran. She was clad in ACROSS' uniform, showing off her cleavage and legs. Recently, Il Palazzo had sent her to the crocodile pit for failing to conquer the park- she'd just recently gotten out, and hadn't had time to change. Oh, that Il Palazzo! So cold and straightforward; and yet, somehow, that made Excel long for him even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Menchi swerved outside the open door, leaping off the balcony, her feet pitter-pattering away. Unable to keep up with the dog's nimble legs, Excel crashed into a wall. Lying on the ground, dazed from pain and gluttony, the young woman felt her consciousness leaving her body, mumbling incoherently:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just picture a great big steak... Fried, roasted or stewed...Oh, food, wonderful food, marvelous food... Glorious food... Aaah, how am I supposed to serve the glorious Il Palazzo in this state? How can this nubile young woman possibly eat, take out her financial and romantic frustrations, and improve the state of the city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so came a plot device. Of course, the actual method a girl grows in these stories isn't usually all that important- the result matters, not what started it. The Puchuus, an alien race, had been working on a growth ray to wage war on humanity, and dropped it nearby. The Great Will of the Macrocosm took pity on the woman, and blessed her with size for her loyalty to ACROSS. Nuclear waste was dumped right onto Excel. Poemi, the magical girl, misfired a growth spell. Some rare growth hormone went into effect. An afro'ed man drugged her with growth liquid, or tossed a growth potion down her throat. Something like that. Take your pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, the revolutionary felt a strange sensation floating from her booted toes to her empty head. A zap of electricity, surging through her veins. It would be almost relieving, orgasmic, even!... If it weren't for the cramps floating over her body. Excel grimaced, feeling her skin and muscles stretched out in a way human skin and muscles weren't designed to be stretched. Her entire body became heavy, as the Square Cube Law was slammed onto a table and penetrated. Raising to her bottom, Excel's head crashed painfully against the ceiling, leaving a clear mark. Soon, her right elbow and heels followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this? What's happening to Excel's innocent, untouched body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman gasped as she heard her rapid voice echoing back to her. The next door neighbor, Watanabe, opening the door to complain about the noise, stood speechless. Before him, the suddenly massive woman was struggling to fit within her crumbling room. The walls protested against her arms as her legs tossed knickknacks this way and that. Slowly, Excel's outfit tore, conveniently leaving her nipples still covered despite her rapidly increasing size. Her hapless neighbor had just enough time to dash away in fear as her head tore through the roof. Hyatt still lay dead to the side, smiling. With a massive crashing sound, debris flying everywhere, Excel peeked out of the house to the streets below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-what? I don't get this! Help me, Il Palazzo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer screams cracked nearby windows and made nearby people cringe, holding their ears. The neighbors dashed away as Excel's legs popped out of the walls, leaving her wearing the house like a costume. Soon, her shoulders emerged from the ceiling, followed by her chest, bouncing a little. Wide-eyed, she gazed down, panicking. Desperate to avoid sinking any deeper into dept, she carefully stood, crushing her belongings with her clumsy footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowering over the surroundings, Excel gazed over the City of F, shocked, hands over her head. Stepping out carefully, gazing as her careless boots caused unspeakable property damage, she found herself at loss for words for a moment. Dumbly, she watched as faceless crowds stared towards her towering form, shocked, unmoving, practically begging to be snuffed out violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh... WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strength of her shout tossed half of the crowd away- but it was her rapid, panicked movements that did the most destruction, as she dashed this way and that, tearing her hair out. People below ran in terror as her panic attack destroyed their homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, this is bad! Like, I've been in bad situations before, but this is probably somewhere within Excel's top ten! Wait, why am I panicking, I'm practically a living weapon! GAH! I won't have anything to eat! Not that I had much before, but I won't be able to watch TV and play video games! Not like Excel COUUUULD afford them, and yet, and yet! How am I supposed to associate with the brainless masses and spread the word of Il Palazzo and get a part-time job at this size? People will fear me and loathe me and laugh at me! Oh, the promising, adventure-and-romance filled life of the main character, turned into a circus show for the sake of a fanfiction!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out an exaggerated leap of melodramatic sorrow, Excel landed face-first into the commercial district, her chest easily reducing a small business to an unrecognizable pile of rubble. With a sigh, she stood, dusted herself clean, and whacked herself on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, Excel. That'll do for the angst. Hm, surprisingly, I'm actually okay with this. Like, despite never doing anything like it before, growing feels pretty natural!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, she stretched her arms up, before feeling over her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, for some reason, Excel feels every little trace of her previous characterization being sucked away so that it can be replaced by a cruel, murderous tyrant! Yay! Is this because a maiden's heart is so fickle and emotion-driven that any change in size can completely change her as a person, and make her forget everything and everyone she loves? Was my previous sociopathic behavior in the series proper a roundabout justification for this? Has the entire series continuity been derailed over a fetish? Aaah, who cares~!\" Rubbing her eye a bit, she tilted to the left slightly. \"Well, actually, I don't feel all <i>THAT</i> different, honestly, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a scratch of the back of her head, she suddenly grinned, and started a deranged, happy dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT! I just remembered- I'm supposed to be conquering the city! Ahhh~ Lord Il Palazzo, how could I let hunger get in the way of my duty as your loyal servant and admirer?\" Slamming her fist in her palm, she went back and forth like a wrecking ball of joy. \"This size must be a gift from you, to help me conquer the city! Yes! Your genius never fails to amaze me and arouse me, Il Palazzo! I accept! I'll do it for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now dancing on a pile of wood and cement that was once a neighborhood, Hyatt resting peacefully on the bottom of her sole. Every movement she made shook the Earth- and, with her attitude, she made LOTS of movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do ANYTHING for you!\" The gigantic Excel blushed, hands to her cheeks. \"I'll crush, crumble and chomp left and right, should you order me so! I'll trip over banana peels, tear my body in half, eat through solid steel, fight military forces, clean bathrooms... If you so wish, you can use me for ALL your fantasies, and won't have to feel guilty, because I have a position of relative power! Isn't that what big girls are all about? Yay, horrid, unpardonable actions, for the good of the city! For the good of ACROSS! For the pleasure of the mindless masses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with one mighty leap, buildings came crashing down. Standing among them, the long-winded girl pointed to the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a great woman once said, there is one Earth! If we split it in half, there will be two! All of mankind is scum- and beeeeautiful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped into the air again, flipping around with perfect coordination, landing perfectly on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"HAIL...\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn authoritative, powerful stomp on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"IL...\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA perfectly-postured salute, taking over the skies, signaling to a new future for the diminutive City of F.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"PALAZZO!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yet, amidst the noise, Excel heard a tiny murmur from under her boot. Curious, the monolithic girl lifted her shoe- only to find her friend and coworker stuck to its sole, in a small pool of blood, weakly coughing. Her body was mixed with dirt, grime, and Puchuu, pancake-flat against the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyatt? AAAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale, limp body made a sickening noise as Excel peeled it off, shaking it desperately in her hands. In shock, her eyes wide, Excel took a step back, her backside stumbling into the remains of a building- it effortlessly caved in under her weight, breaking into diminutive splinters of wood. Ignorant masses too stupid to run away were assaulted with the torn chunks of wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I killed her! I killed her so hard, she died to death! Oh no, oh no, this means she's the first victim of my tyranny and the author's crush fetish!\" She grasped Hyatt close to her cheek and stroked her, as the woman tried to get a word in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senior Excel, I'm actually-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcel bent over, rubbing the woman tightly against her titan bosom. Tiny tears formed in her eyes, raining down- and practically flooding the streets. Her movements grew more and more panicked, corresponding to greater horror from the faceless crowds below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a boundary between 'kinda-nasty-but-still-gentle' and 'irredeemably violent', and I have officially stomped across it! Now Excel will have to murder everyone she loves and won't be allowed feel anything! Hyatt, it'll be hard, but I'll do it for you! I won't ignore how you sacrificed yourself to become an excuse for my violent behavior! You are the start of my slippery slope!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Hyatt! Sorry, Hyatt! ...Hyatt? HYATT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Excel stopped moving. Quietly raising a hand from her friend's grip, the smaller woman smiled blankly upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm alive now. I believe I was dead before you started growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, the titanic lady hugged her friend, cuddling her tightly against her massive chest once more. \"Yay, Excel can stay on the 'Gentle route' for a little longer! Wait- you're awfully nonchalant about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I? My apologies, senior.\" She started slowly flailing around in Excel's hand, her arms waving limp in the air like an inflatable tube man. With all the energy of a sloth and volume of a mouse, she shouted out: \"Oh, no... Excel is currently large. Excel is big. Excel is a giant. A real giant. I am scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady soon found herself with a giant thumbs-up in her face. \"Ten out of ten, Hyatt! Your acting classes paid off! Now that we've got that out of our system... What should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back up, Excel rested her partner on her shoulder, and raised a foot, tapping it idly. Each impact dug a hole into the cement below, and caused great tremors across the land. The crowd gathered around, which had suddenly become completely irrelevant as the plot called of it, held their breaths in horror, awaiting the woman's next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It always ends up like this- big girls don't have anything to do, so they just go on rampages. I mean- it's not like they have to take any time to get used to their surroundings or anything, so they run out of options really quickly. And when they're out of ideas, then they just start squishing things and stuff. And when they run out of things to squish, then the stories kinda screech to a halt... Ah, think, think, think! Is there not an angel and devil upon either shoulder, but two-to-five demons on two-to-five shoulders each time a new chapter spawns?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she scratched at her scalp, the quiet voice raised again. \"Perhaps you could go speak with Lord Il Palazzo about this new development? It may affect his plans, somehow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. For once, silence. Hyatt looked up, and found her partner with a determined glimmer in her titanic eye. Excel was struck by the arrow of a cupid, and inspiration- which, in her hands, were a deadly combination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Had I known the Internet was of this quality here, I would never have constructed a base underground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dignified leader of ACROSS sat in front of the dully flickering monitor. His glove tapped on the throne's armrest, eyebrow twitching above his strange glasses. A chill ran through the wide, curtained halls, with decoration that had cost them several leaks in the roof. Before him, the title of the webpage slowly spread: \"GTS Interactive - Select your giantess\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd. I never had a particular interest in this kind of fiction before this morning. I did not even have knowledge of this genre. Moreover, I am fairly certain I am not interested even now. Why do character suddenly develop fetishes in the middle of a plot? I would be ashamed, were I not so perplexed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the screen, multiple options spread out, each leading to a different branch of the interactive story. A draft ran by his head. This link had a white giantess, this one a black giantess. The one labelled \"Asian\" had an asterisk next to it, marking the route as unavailable- nothing had been added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lord of ACROSS rubbed his forehead, grunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does the race of this woman even affect the story as a whole, or the writing style of this author? Hm. Well, for the time being, I shall select the 'white' route, and pretend the woman is Asian. Since there's no way large girls can become a reality, everyone who reads these stories is required to have SOME imagination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that, the ground started shaking. Il Palazzo let out another annoyed sigh, until he noticed the tremors getting larger and larger. Another cold wind- he began glancing around. Tiny chunks from the ceiling began raining onto his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumbling worsened each passing second, as if Thor was having a tantrum. Finally lifting from his seat, the long-haired man glanced from side to side, laptop in arm. A chunk of what was once the ceiling landed flatly on the throne, crushing it into nothingness. With a moment of silence for a lost friend, and a wooshing of his cape, Il Palazzo turned around, and sat on the floor, tapping on the keyboard. The floor became nearly a trampoline, bouncing his lean body up and down. All around, the lair kept crumbling like a poorly-prepared desert. Dodging one bit of debris, he shook his head at the flickering monitor, facepalming at the words displayed upon it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andthen the giant gril wakked thru the city the city was like noooooooooo n she cam to da big billdin and borked it an da jiant gril sed.............................\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaa~il Il Palazzo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark shadow spread over the leader of ACROSS. Turning his head up, he saw green eyes peering at him, wide as a flying saucers, bearing the expression of a dog who had just seen her master for the first time in years. And beside it, leaning lopsided on the shoulder, rested Hyatt's body. And, most importantly, there was a gigantic hole in the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he looked over the two, Il Palazzo's eyes sunk back down to the screen. He tapped on a key, raising a window to cover the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Regretfully, the power of my imagination seems to know no bounds.\" The leader of ACROSS turned, and walked to a piece of rubble that had taken the place of his throne, climbing and taking a seat on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say, my Lord! Oh, how unappreciative I've been of you! I didn't deserve this gift!\" Excel grinned, leaning into the underground base; and, losing her balance, fell in. Her chest landed squarely into the center of the red rug, as Hyatt plopped off the shoulder, half-dead from shock. The floor cracked under the breathtaking pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIl Palazzo glanced at her, expressionless. \"Whatever I gave you, I am sorely tempted to agree. Tell me something, Excel...\" He adjusted his glasses, taking a close look over the gargantuan face before him. \"What inspired you to compromise the secrecy- and structural integrity- of ACROSS' headquarters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced up at the ceiling, her orange hair brushing over Hyatt's fallen body. Realizing the damage she'd caused, her eyes widened, and her mouth spread out in horror. \"My apologies! Forgive me!\" Excel began bowing, moving up and down to beg for mercy. The rapid movements made her head and backside slam into the crumbling ceiling again and again. \"I-I just thought I'd knock, and s-suddenly the house came down! I'll accept any punishment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can be arranged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccordingly, the man pulled on a rope beside him. A massive trapdoor opened under Excel, taking up most of the floor. She fell in instantly, saluting, causing a massive rumble as she hit the ground, shaking the two remaining people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nACROSS' ruler spoke again. \"Now, Hyatt- how DID Excel grow so large?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill above the ground, the dark-haired woman wiper her lips of blood. \"I'm not sure, Lord Il Palazzo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded sadly. \"That's fine. It will just make finding an antidote somewhat more difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANTIDOTE? Now, wait a minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at her full height, Excel's face peeked out from the pit, face parallel her boss. \"Take a moment to consider the possibilities, my lord! Excel can do so much in this state- like, shower you with her affection and appreciation! Or assassinate corrupt macrophile authors! Stuff like that! I can more than make up for our lost secrecy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping onto the top of the walls, she pulled herself up, spluttering in Il Palazzo's face:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, I SWEAR I won't by like those other giantesses who kill-slash-enslave their love interests instantly!... At least for this route!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gigantic hands to either side of him- one pinning Hyatt to the ground- he brushed his hair back, glancing at the computer screen. Stepping off the throne, her saucer-like eyes followed him as he moved closer to her. After inspecting her for a moment, he grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Excel...\"</span></div></div>",

Oh, my Lord, I've been waiting four long years and eleven months for this route with you to continue! The anticipation has made your loyal servant tense and achy!\" She saluted, her fingers cutting through some of the elegant drapes, before reaching her thick forehead. With every movement, a thousand of her joints popped, and floods of dust erupted everywhere. \"I'm ready for whatever trials may befall me! Through style inconsistencies, retcons, and abandoned plot hooks! Whether you're Lord Il Palazzo of ACROSS, or Ilpallazo-sama of Across, Excel is at your service!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyatt, from the floor, weakly murmured: \"Not as if there weren't typos or inconsistencies before, senior senpai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, we must put that energy to use.\" Il Palazzo sat on the piece of ceiling replacing his throne, his purple hair flowing in the wind. He made a mental note to fix those gaps in the ceiling and walls. \"Your new assignment... Is to press the 'back' button on your browser twice. Then, select the other route. The violent path, if you will.\" The valiant leader flipped his laptop monitor upright once more, letting his yellow eyes focus on it. Interactives were currently unavailable. He reloaded the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked in confusion for a moment, eyelashes loud enough that people outside the secret base could hear. \"Huh? Choose the violent path? But Excel's under your power! How many times has a gigantic girl in a story surrendered her free will for a normal-sized guy's desires?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyatt counted on her fingers, looking pensive. \"How many giantess stories were written by normal-sized guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIl Palazzo scratched his narrow chin. \"Precisely. It just so happens that many people's desire is for a girl to step on or eath them.\" He swung his hand out dramatically, and pressed F5. \"Let me make my request clear and succinct: return to the beginning. Leave this base, and do as you will on the other storyline. Try not to snap any modem cables on the way out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyatt stood to her trembling legs, smiling. \"I understand, Lord Il Palazzo. I don't have any preference about which option the reader selects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumping her arms in excitement, the larger agent's emerald eyes glimmered, lighting up the base from corner to corner. \"Oh, great Il Palazzo! You trust Excel so much, you'd let her follow the violent route! And without displaying any fear or hesitation!\" She hugged him, smothering him in the massive orbs of her chest, flesh partly revealed from the tears. \"They say 'If you love something, let it free' - and I feel so much like a something! But additionally, even more so, like a someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she shouted, her body rocketed and bumped with the energy of a pinball. It gave Il Palazzo the experience of being on a roller coaster - with a lower cost, fewer children, and louder screaming in his ears. Between bounding tit flesh and fabric, the fearless leader turned his head to the laptop screen. The webpage wasn't loading; he moved a compressed arm to refresh it again. \"I'm glad you agree. But should you disrupt me again during the next few hours, I will not hesitate to attack you with the most powerful weapon available.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcel stepped away; her boss fell on his feet, unglued from the mountains of meat. She smiled. \"Understood! I'm certain that won't come back to bite me in the rear quarters!\" Shedding a few tears, she braced her fists, and turned to Hyatt. \"Well, it's sad to say goodbye so soon... Are you ready to take the alternate option?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyatt calmly put her palms together. \"I'm prepared. Now, if I remember, I was stuck on your sole in that first chapter. So to make sure everything's in order...\" She silently flopped into the deep pit, letting herself fall to the bottom. Upon reaching the end, splattered flat below on her stomach, she slithered underneath her senior's turquoise boot - and lodged herself underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few stomps, Excel made sure her red-clad companion was firmly in place. Wouldn't want her to fall off and get hurt. She saluted him. \"Godspeed, Il Palazzo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe refreshed the page, lifting an eyebrow in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with the force of a rocket, the titanic redhead launched herself in the air. She fell in reverse, apologized in reverse, broke the ceiling in reverse - like a videotape on rewind. As she retraced her steps through the streets, turning rubble into buildings, she chattered happily:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!OZZALAP !LI !LIAH ...no sekarb eht tup emmeL !retpahc suoiverp eht dehcaer ev'ew ,thgir er'uoy ,hA ?ttayH ,tazzahW ...!tsap eht ot kcab ,kcab teg attog tsuJ !erutceferP F ,ytiC F ,0002-9991 ni evil attog uoy ,nehT .bmud si ni er'uoy tnemom eht sselnU !etirw annaw uoy tahw etirw dna ,tnemom eht ni evil attog uoY !yllautneve detadtuo eb lliw gnihtyrevE !etaroceder dna xif ot evah reven uoy taht esuoh a dliub ot elbissopmi s'tI !reverof gninaem dna txetnoc emas eht speek taht yrots a etirw ot elbissopmi s'tI !noitacirbaf decaf-dlab ro ,eil tnatalb a rehtie saw stnemetats s'lecxE fo eno yreve ,yllautcA .esuoh taht tuoba yrros ,hahA !lanrete si semina ydorap tsidrusba yrutnec-eht-fo-nrut no desab scifnaf rof tekram ehT !reverof ynnuf niamer lliw snoitulover enitsednalc dna sesirc cimonoce tuoba sekoJ !tnaveler yats htiw seirots evitcaretni moc.gnitirw ot secnerefer eseht lla ,llew sA !hserf eb SYAWLA lliw ecnerefer tahT !tsap eht ot kcab ,kcab teg attoG !sdrawkcab gniog ,segassem kcartkcab neddibrof dna neddih ,sdrawkcab gniog ,sdrawkcab gnioG !ozzalaP lI ,deepsdoG\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the base, the leader of ACROSS turned his gaze away from the unbroken ceiling, and to his laptop. With the rubble having rewound itself off, he could once again sir in his throne. His gloved finger slammed F5 - until, after many retries, his efforts and patience were rewarded with a response from writing.com's servers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Oops, Writing.Com had the following problem(s):</b><br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">Item ID #1049138 was not found within Writing.Com's system.<br>\r\nThis could be a temporary error, so please try again in a few minutes.

I have no regrets. But it's time for me to take a break. New conquests await.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe folded his laptop, and unfolded a Visual Kei magazine.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Excel basked in self-awe from her last declaration. She stood like an unmoving statue, the very image of a revolutionary heroine. Well, except for the fact that she moved. A lot. Even in this sudden moment of stillness, her long-stretching hair caught the wind, her stomach moved in and out with each giant breath, and her green eyes scanned everything around. This was it. No more limitations of strength, money, or network censors. The towering ACROSS agent was free from the fetters of rationality and good taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to work right away. Her eyes narrowed as she trotted confidently towards a large building, pantomiming a grabbing movement, filled with the glee and energy of a child choosing a new toy. Suddenly, she punched a hole in it, the materials cleanly crumbling around her fist, falling to the streets below. The woman smiled, admiring her handiwork on this corrupt infrastructure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a test, a sample of the changes she'd make in the name of Il Palazzo's will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the nondescript masses below gazed up in horror and awe. At first glance, the entire population seemed captivated with Excel's beauty. But upon further inspection, there were numerous straight women in the crowd, some gay men, and an odd few asexuals. And at another glance, most other people were too horrified to be aroused, and wouldn't even consider a giantess to be remotely attractive in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Weirdos.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, an atmosphere of panic filled the air. Excel had already started fishing her hands through the buildings, humming to herself as the fingers tore windows apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the best rampages have the pretty lady grabbing some random nobody off the streets... Carrying him in inappro-pro places while he sits around oogling her and-slash-or quivering in fear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a rubble-covered finger to her lips, she leaned over, tearing another chunk of building out and shaking its contents into her palm. To her dismay, nobody seemed to be offering themselves to her conquest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, I'm completely un-relatable! We need someone to get the reader involved! My unmentionables are absolutely secure! Crash-tested, I promise! I can even get seat belts or stuff if you don't believe me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew had seen this girl before, or what she had in mind. Those who HAD seen Excel before had even more difficulty guessing what the giant woman was about to do next. Even at normal height, she was destructive and unpredictable. They shuddered thinking how that would manifest here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatanabe navigated through disturbingly aimless crowds, huffing. Every so often, he tilted his head back to the woman - but couldn't bear to look at her for long. It made his mind wander to painful places. Instead, he focused on running. If he reached City Hall in time, the Municipal Force could launch a counter-attack!... As long as Iwata didn't start drooling over the giantess. With silent prayers, he kept dashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Ayasugi... Please be alright.\" He turned his head up to her one last time, grunting. \"Oh, you maniac...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyatt coughed up a bit of blood, peacefully resting under the sole of her senior's boot. She was slammed on it again and again as Excel continued her hunt for a companion/victim. As the rampaging woman's patience fell, she kicked her way through a massive building, all of its contents spilling on the streets below. The long, peach leg flew into the air, dislodging Hyatt; the woman was airborne for a second. Leaning in, Excel let Hyatt fall onto her nose, between globe-like eyes, cheeks spread out on either side in a deranged smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Hyatt! You may know me, sure, but you're good as any stranger! Wanna be a hostage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyatt shook for just a bit, maintaining her peaceful, detached gaze. \"Thank you, senpai. I accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesss! Excel will no longer be forced to speak to herself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick fist-pump, the massive woman leaped into the air, casually crushing a few buildings under the weight of her body. Hyatt was jolted from her position, before landing safely onto Excel's orange hair. She peered down at the city below, enjoying the rapid movement and smoking wrecks of social infrastructure, along with the reduced oxygen from her height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, this feels nice. How high are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It depends!\" The massive woman grabbed a car in her hand, watching it fill her palm, flipping it around as she continued marching through buildings. Her voice quieted to a still-booming  whisper: \"I mean - 'tween you and me, some size authors have NO sense of scale. The 50 foot woman? She was probably closer to a one-fifty.\" She squeezed the car between her fingers, grinding it into dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so you're as tall as the story needs you to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcel nodded, nearly sending Hyatt flying off again. \"On that note, let's just return to our feature presentation: city domination! Tiny person obliteration! Fuel for masturbation! Hyatt, in this situation, how would you go about conquering the population?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rested her head on her chin for a few moments. \"I never was good at political sciences, but we usually use senseless terrorism, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClapping her hands together, Excel made another leap, kicking a building down. \"Bingo! And we shall take terror to new heights and new lows! We march over to any nearby authorities, demand they give us the city, and tame the masses once and for all! And the nearest authority looks like...\" Her eyes focused on a building in the distance. \"That place! City hall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling wistfully, the passenger followed her line of sight. \"A good plan, senior... But how do we run a city when we get it? I'm sure if we didn't repair buildings you compromised, work around the economic crisis, and balance the industrial, commercial and residential sectors, there'd be wide-scale revolts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe destructive footsteps paused for just one moment, as Excel scratched her head, fighting instincts to toss a dirty look at her hostage. \"T-that's Lord Il Palazzo's job, not mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, she continued her march, skipping playfully and watching people and cars fly into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, who cares if they revolt? Let them eat cake! It'll fatten them up! They'll taste better! We're in a giantess story, and here, might makes right!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took one great leap with her right leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three lefts make a right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcel stomped three times with her left foot, grinding it into the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there will be no one left but the righteous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA left step, then a right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's natural selection! Social Darwinism! God is Dead in his Heaven, all's right with the world! So you mustn't run away, Shinji- we should seize that Carpe Diem by the tail, and he shall evolve into a Gyarados Diem! Righting lefts and triumphing over evil, and that means we aren't looking left or right, just dashing forward aimlessly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaken with each little movement, Hyatt clutched onto a strand of orange hair, gripping tightly as she smiled. \"Left! ...Pardon. Right! Ah, correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two women carried on their conversation, absolute anarchy reigned below. People scurried out of the way, only to be met with a titanic turquoise boot, or pillar-like fingers coming from a glove. Those who stayed indoors weren't safe, either - Excel's lumbering often knocked small chunks out of houses, when her curiosity didn't lead to her outright smashing portions of the city she deemed offensive to Il Palazzo's righteous rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run! Haha! In our presence, you are but ANTS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another massive step, wiping some cars off the heel of her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crawling into my picnic basket and stealing my well-earned food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a building in her way, Excel simply started dashing, letting her body tear through the structure. Bits of debris and office rooms slid down her chest and legs - the whole structure bore her shapely silhouette for just a moment before it crumbled under its own weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then just giving it all to a queen like the brainless workers you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyatt kept struggling to stay alive, bits of blood leaking from her lips. The world below felt distant, her senior's wild screams the only reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ants can carry many times their relative weight and have really tough exoskeletons- which is more than can be said about you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a finger to her mouth, Excel's heels swept the streets as she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it'd be more accurate to compare you to termites, gnawing at the foundations of our glorious society. Well, anyways, I'm depriving you of your humanity! Psychological warfare, yay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, she brought her hands down, grabbing as many bits of F City as she could - people, cars, Puchuus - and tossing them into the air like confetti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of weirdo talks to ants or termites, anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rained down over her body, some getting stuck on her uniform, or against the expanse of her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, the whole point of calling smaller people 'insects' is to imply they're of little importance to me. If a chick found an insect nest in the park and spent an hour killing them all, they would mean SOMETHING to her - she couldn't just use that 'they were in my way' excuse. If I keep on using a sufficient amount of my energy on you and holding a conversation with you people, that means I probably do care about you, at least a smidgen-or-so. And considering the whole point of this one-sided discussion was to express how insignificant and unnoticeable you are compared to me, Excel can't help but get this strange feeling that she's stomped into a circle-type-shape and self-defeated herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking a bit dejected at her inability to psychologically dominate the city, she contented herself with physically dominating it, headed for City Hall to enforce her lord's will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyatt, please let this be a lesson if you ever get huge: deeds, not words!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, senior.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One rapid step from the Goliath-sized boot sent Watanabe nearly flying in the air. In the reflections of the trembling skyscrapers, he could see brief glimpses of Excel's short-clad legs, the bounce in her bosom as it inadvertently crashed into another structure, and, as she leaned over the people, a toothy, wild-eyed smile. Most disturbingly, she was getting closer; though he dared not look behind him, the details in the reflections kept getting clearer. Though he dared not peek back, her fleeing neighbor could nearly make out the exact buildings she'd destroyed simply by the rubble...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to move his head away, he spotted two familiar faces at a low-budget ramen stand. Iwata, with spiked hair, sat next to the rather pudgy Sumiyoshi; both fellow Municipal workers. Both fully focused on the meal on the table before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Watanabe approached, Iwata could feel the man's angered breath ruffling his shirt from behind. Without even glancing to his friend, he swallowed some noodles and said: \"Look, I know what you're gonna say. But the lines here are shorter than they've ever been! Panic and anarchy really makes getting food easier.\" Ever-silent, Sumiyoshi nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prove this statement, fingers the size of tree trunks suddenly fell around the stand, scooping it up from the ground. The chef fell out of it, a loud thud on his elongated head. The table lifted away, along with the two bowls. The neighbors remained still, necks craning up in terror to see Excel's tongue wrap around the shop - and quickly engulf the entire thing in her mouth, chomping it into nothing with a few solid bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom atop her scalp, Hyatt waved down: \"Why, hello, Mr. Watanabe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped, reaching his arms as high as he could, leaping up into the sky. \"MS. AYASUGI! H-hang in there! We're going to save you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Excel's enormous eyes suddenly darted downwards. Her neighbor could see him and his coworkers reflecting in them. \"Strangers! A singing voice in my head says I should trample and kick you down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer turquoise sole lifted from the ground, hanging above the three paralyzed companions... Before the revolutionary's head twisted to a building in the distance. The F City Tower; specifically, her reflection in it. She waved to it inquisitively, watching the mirrored image mimic her action. Placing her boot down absurdly close to the trio, she snapped her fingers. \"Aha! It's my insidious doppelganger, Excel Kobayashi! I have no idea what you're doing this big, but you won't escape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis distraction was JUST what they needed. Watching everything shake as Excel dashed away, Watanabe wordlessly grabbed his friends, continuing his journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcel's neighbor kicked open the door to City Hall, tugging both of his neighbors in with him. He darted to a familiar room, marked by the word \"POLITICS\" in capital letters. The planning table for The Department of City Security sat in the center; this was where the pen-pushers could figure out how to best respond to a major threat. Two figures had already taken their seats. At one end, Dr. Kabapu. Nobody really knew where he got his doctorate, or what exact authority he had; but his fake mustache and glasses simply demanded attention. At the other side sat a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Misaki Matsuya<br>\r\nAge: 20-something<br>\r\nHair: <span class=\"clred\">red</span><br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nWearing: <span class=\"cplum\">White</span> dress shirt with <span class=\"chotpink\">yellow</span> vest and skirt<br>\r\nHeight: Her trading figurine is approx. 5.5 inches<br>\r\nPersonality: the type who gets angry when people try to summarize her personality in one line<br>\r\nVoice Actress: Yuka Imai/Tiffany Grant/Barbara De Bortoli<br>\r\nFavorite interaction: Iwata once told me she likes handplay but I don't trust him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsuya angrily shooed away her character profile. She hated it when those things followed her around. The municipal worker gave a long look over the room and asked: \"Have we reached the breaking point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man answered: \"Yes. I feared we'd reach this position...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill catching his breath from the long dash, holding a hand to the wall, Watanabe blurted out: \"What? What's with the ominous mumbling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the head of the table, Kabapu explained with the most stern, grim gaze possible: \"We've officially hit the DEEP LORE. The point in the story where the author assumes readers are looking for something other than quick laughs, and freezes all giantess interaction so that talking heads can give exposition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumiyoshi's lips didn't budge, but the look in his glasses told everyone his thoughts: <i>Lasted longer than giantessfancomics usually do, at least.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Department of City Security sat together - an aura of fear and despair floating over their heads, the smell of Kabapu floating in their noses. Occasional tremors and battle cries outside did nothing to calm their nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good doctor was the one to break the silence: \"Briefly state your ideas on how to neutralize this threat. Too much time, and we get stomped out. Or bored to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand why we're having this conversation.\" Matsuya shook her head bitterly. \"I say we just nuke her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mustached man said: \"Size change interactives run under the assumption that nuclear weapons are unpredictable magical black boxes. At best, they'll do nothing. At worst, we risk giving her goddess powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIwata leaned back in his chair and shrugged. \"Meh, that wouldn't be so bad. If she has Benten's powers, she'll be a great artist. If she gets Athena's powers, we'll get a cool Saint Seiya sequel. I can live with that. Now, if we go into the Norse goddesses- that's where things get tricky...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumiyoshi's silence spoke clear words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming both hands on the table, Watanabe asked: \"Why don't we just send the JSDF in, and shoot her to the ground? Then maybe, Miss Ayasugi...\" He held back a few tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKabapu answered: \"The military cannot spare much of their budget to F City. Besides, her flesh is either too thick to pierce - like her skull - or at her size, skin cells rebuild faster. There's always some sort of pseudo-scientific explanation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like AT fields! Or a wall of psychic energy!\" Iwata squealed. \"Sweet, we need a special plot device to kill her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few footsteps echoed from a shady corner. A mauve-haired man in a doctor's suit came in: the team's roboticist, Dr. Shiouji. He played with his glasses before enunciating: \"May I join in? I've <i>thoroughly studied</i> the multitudes of commissioned art and fiction involving giant Chibiusa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsuya pontificated: \"Go neuter yourself, doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiouji ejaculated: \"Ah, you make me laugh.\" He ejaculated again before continuing: \"Think in terms of the narrative. When given the choice, what type of self-respecting interactive reader picks 'giantess shrinks and everybody is happy and the story ends', when the option above reads, 'giantess keeps on rampaging'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're doomed.\" Watanabe let out a groan, grasping at his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doomed,\" Shiouji said, \"unless the option where we win seems appealing to the readers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what would appeal to- aaaah, I see where this is going!\" Iwata's eyes gained a sudden blaring fire to them. \"Fight giantess with giantess! A sexy catfight between the rampaging woman and some girl on our end - and a quick victory for the Municipal Force!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where do we find a giantess?\" Matsuya glanced around, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiouji gave the smile of a priest at a funeral. \"Well, we come up with some convoluted way to grow you. Or Ms. Momochi. Or, I build an immense Ropponmatsu unit. Then, as Iwata said, we engage with this foe in combat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shook her head, getting up to leave the table. \"I refuse. What will the public think of their municipality? We'll be seen as monsters, or worse: sex objects! I will not surrender my dignity for the sake of a fantasy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKabapu stood up more triumphantly, hands on her hips. \"You either surrender your dignity, or the city. It's a choice I made long ago- and I, for one, am glad I chose F City, F Prefacture!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, Sumiyoshi stared blankly forward. <i>YOU had dignity once?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's always a second option...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom an even shadier, more-poorly-lit corner, emerged a wonderfully handsome man with an astounding afro, a smoking cigarette, a completely original jacket-and-tie combo, and a suave demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nabeshin? When I came into City Hall, I didn't see a sign reading 'open house emergency response meeting'!\" Watanabe glared towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Heh heh heh.\" He snickered with the same ambiguous laugh of a man about to teleport behind someone with a katana. \"Don't be so quick to show me the door. You're talking to the author's super-powered self-insert character.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, all eyes pointed to him. Kabapu stepped closer, inquisitively. \"How can we trust you and your afro, Nabeshin? You're a loose cannon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabeshin just nodded his head slowly, with his arms crossed. \"True, but - like many of my kin - I HATE seeing uppity ladies challenging my control of the narrative. I'll take care of her with my bare fists. And my charm. And my scathing, tongue-in-cheek, elbow-in-rib, dick-in-hand meta-humor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Iwata said: \"If there's one thing you can rely on more than a writer's lust, it's their ego.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsuya paused for a second, before her head tilted. \"But... If you're the author, aren't YOU the one who made her grow in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lower lip bulged out in a pout back to her. \"Look, do you want me to save your rear windows, or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKabapu said: \"I wish we had more than two choices here... But the cost is too high!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The cost of what?</i>, Sumiyoshi silently asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Writing.com Paid Membership!\"</span></div></div>",

If nobody arrives within a year, I will add chapters branching from these choices reading 'what height should she be'? And if nobody answers that distress call, I'll make more chapters, this time reading 'how should she grow'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mustached man's glasses fell right off his face. \"That's too dangerous. Nabeshin, it looks like our hopes are on your dandruff-covered shoulders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe author's self-insert shrugged, bearing a grin worthy of a Dreamworks poster. \"Suits me. If the reader chose the other option, I'd find some way to sneak myself in, anyway.\" Tearing a rocket launcher from his fluffy afro, he charged out the window, shattering the glass as he jumped into the city below in an action-ready pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, the team's roboticist stepped away. \"It suits me, too. A project of this scale would've interrupted my conveniently timed vacation to Thailand.\" He swept all the contents of his desk into a suitcase, and snapped his fingers; a pair of robots broke through the wall and pulled him away before anyone could<br>\r\nquestion him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not happy!\" Iwata groaned, holding his hands over his spiked hair. \"Urgh, I was all worked up for a real catfight! Is ANYTHING sexy going to happen here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisaki's hand collided with that hair sharply. \"Nobody cares what you want! Our job is NOT putting on shows for creepy fetishists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumiyoshi kept still, but silently emoted: <i>Nobody cares what any of us secondary characters want, really. We'll be lucky if we even show up after this chapter.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Watanabe stared through the undestroyed part of the window, gazing dramatically over the trembling F City. His fingertips touched the glass softly, as he looked over his reflection and the skyscrapers still standing. \"Then let me use this last moment to say... Nabeshin, you'd better not screw this up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the F City tower was missing from the skyline. In its place rested a mountain of floorboards, office supplies, shattered glass, people who weren't very fast, and, mostly, Excel. A very frazzled, red-skinned Excel, panting, removing tiny bits of glass from her body, and struggling to pull back up her now-moistened shorts. Her thighs rested on what was left of surrounding landmarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Hah...\" Her words came out as a low murmur, rumbling the ruined neighborhood. \"...I really don't know what happened there. First, I see my evil twin, and challenge her to a fight. We get into this intense duel, and she's holding up to all my blows. Punching back pretty good, too! Then, I can't help but notice how... How charming and attractive my double looks! After that, after that - shame clouds Excel's mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyatt, quietly wiping her face clean of blood, lifted a finger from her place in her partner's enormous ponytail. \"Senior, from where I'm standing, it seems that you tried to have sex with reflective glass at that point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for reminding me!\" Excel groaned, pausing to fiddle with the buttons on her torn leg-wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in the process, destroyed the building that this glass was coating.\" She smiled brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good recap.\" The gargantuan woman winced as she tugged another bit of pokey glass from her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed! A building that has previously withstood magnitude 6 earthquakes and 50 m/s winds couldn't stand to bi-curious urges. Or were they auto-sexual urges? Objectum-sexual urges?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THANK. YOU. HYATT.\" These earth-shaking words came from behind her shut fangs, forced into a pained grimace as her fingers tightened into fists below. \"This cunning trick can't fool ACROSS again! Once this city rests under Lord Il Palazzo's guiding thumb, Excel's poking finger will suggest that he makes all windows one-way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusting off a few remaining chunks of rubble again, she stretched her massive neck, trying to remember what her destination was - and inadvertently tossing the hair-bound passenger back and forth. City Hall came back into her line of vision; it took her about five seconds to process this information, focus on it, and regain her stride. Not nearly enough time for people in the neighboring city block to run away from the soles of her turquoise boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her confidence and shamelessness back in full swing, she called out gleefully: \"We now return to the Attack of the Arbitrary-Number-Foot-Tall Excel!\" Arms stretched like an airplane, she cut through previously untouched areas, leaving only dust trails behind her. The fingers cut buildings like knives through butter, leaving the inhabitants with nice sunroofs and relief that noisy upstairs neighbors would no longer be a problem. In her absent-minded jog, she barely bothered to keep her eyes on the road. A skyscraper at a dead-end soon found itself with an Excel-shaped hole cut right through it; a few of the inhabitants squirming across her bosom, more sitting with their hearts beating in the unharmed area. They watched on dumbly at the girl, seemingly nothing able to stop her from reaching her destination...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing but a cool-headed, frizzy-haired, red-suited man. He aimed his rocket launcher right at the immense revolutionary's laughing face; the rocket flew right into her mouth. She gagged; faceless citizens could see the outline of the ammunition bouncing off the sides of her esophagus, into her gut, and finally exploding. Smoke floated out of her ears as she stared down at the source of this attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nabeshin!\" She shouted out, pointing a finger down. The goliath paused for a moment, peeking to Hyatt - who'd made her way back up on her senior's shoulder. \"Uhm, this isn't an optical illusion, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer partner's dark-gloved hand went over her eyes; she needed to squint to make out the author self-insert. \"No, senior. That's indeed - \" another blow from the weapon interrupted her. In surprise, Excel inhaled this one, too; this time, it entered through her right nostril. With one sneeze, she evacuated the object from her body; the rocket flew out, causing an explosion in the distance. The shock from this sudden impact made Hyatt flop over, upchucking blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man below stared up calmly from amid the rubble, his eyes half-open. \"This Excel Macro's been running too long - I'll shut it down before your spreadsheets cover the city. It's time to kick ass and chew gum. Excel brand breath-freshening gum. And after it's chewed, I'll blow it up and burst it. With guns.\" Suddenly turning his head to the ground, he murmured: \"Did that sound cool enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Excel slammed her fist to the ground. Buildings trembled under her awe-inspiring weight, ones with weaker foundations crumbling with a great roar. In only a sudden blow, it covered an immense region of land, both untouched and otherwise - and soon, everything became unrecognizable under the knuckles. A cloud of dust floated above the edge of her fingers, taking a moment before the impact settled down. When she lifted the hand back up, she'd formed a new canyon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabeshin dodged. He tugged an assault rifle from his floofy hair, and began firing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you!\" Excel dashed forward, kicking off the side of a building; the kinetic force pushed her into the air, and bent the skyscraper firmly. Now moving through the sky, she quickly removed both boots, and tossed them into her opponent's direction one after another. The dirt clouds these brought up completely covered the rubber soles. In the clouds above, her bare feet stood without cover. This was a dangerous technique. As every size fetishist knows, the foot is the most sensitive, erogenous zone on a giant person's body. She nearly wet herself as she felt a breeze blow on them; but no, this wasn't the time to get distracted again! Keeping her mind pure with thoughts of Il Palazzo, she bounced off another building, positioning her toes vertically... And aiming her jump at the spot where her boots might have missed. It took some serious effort for her not to instantly cream herself as they dug roughly into the concrete, grinding in deep. Her heels finally slammed down, completing the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabeshin dodged. He put his hands together, firing his signature Nabe-hame-ha at the woman; tearing into a previously undamaged potion of her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Take this!\" With the twisted buildings providing a barrier to avoid escape, Excel kicked her left leg into the air, and stomped its heel into the ground. Her digits swept the city in a wide-spanning roundhouse. Bystanders who weren't knocked clean out of F City by the attack soon discovered, up-close, what this young woman smelt like. A young woman with limited funds to spend on personal hygiene, even fewer funds to spend on an air conditioner, and a pervert with a foot stink fetish writing her actions. With that sweep finished, she tripped down - bust and stomach landing in the arena, flattening still what few people were still standing. As she struggled with her own unbelievable weight to get up, she rolled over; another region demolished by her astounding backside. It would take years to rebuild the area with this damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess what? Nabeshin dodged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcel stared down angrily. \"You can't keep inexplicably surviving forever! No matter what your narrative powers, no matter how you twist the rules... as long as there's SOME choice in the story for the beautiful girl to live on and keep fulfilling the reader\u2019s jerk-off fantasies, said giant girl CANNOT FALL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, gritting his teeth together. \"Well, then - I'll just have to remove that choice. This chapter will only have one branch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the chapter's character count neared its limits, Excel screamed: \"WHAT THE-\"</span></div></div>",

He felt the spirits of citizens who'd bravely sacrificed themselves looking over him. They were flailing their arms aimlessly and screaming, if not just standing there dumbly - just as they did their whole lives. With their wishes fueling him, and rage over their glossed-over deaths pounding in his heart, he unleashed a beam attack from his hands once again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NA-BE-HA-ME-HA-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glowing blue ray fizzled out to an ember before gently tapping Excel's nose. She blinked, poking the impact spot inquisitively. \"Hm. So that's what the accumulated hopes and dreams of faceless masses feels like. Kinda like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe self-insert character below cut the towering revolutionary off with a double-barreled shotgun's fire. This was enough to send her tumbling down, defeated. Her head lay against the ruined pavement, spinning, laced with battle scars. The weary eyes kept rotating before focusing on the red-coated victor. Hyatt lay down next to her - she would look at peace, were it not for the copious portions of blood flowing from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a wise man once said: explosions solve everything.\" Cocking his shotgun and pointing it to Excel's forehead, Nabeshin grinned. \"Now, you'd better give up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! I... I surrenderrr...\" Her massive mouth stretched into bizarre shapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held the weapon closer, poking her. \"Say you'll be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna be a baddie anymooore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now rub that building between your boobs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Excel could protest, or even register the full meaning of the statement, her arms shot out towards a featureless house - the fingerless gloves tore it from its foundation. She began vigorously squeezing and kneading it against her chest, looking more confused than anything at the furniture falling out. It eventually compressed under the mountainous pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like that. No harm in bumping the story's ratings before I finish it off.\" Nabeshin mused contentedly, stroking his clean-shaven chin. \"For my next trick, I want you to squat over and say 'Mitsuo menda naha naha' while gyrating your hips!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No way, I won't - \" And like a marionette on strings, Excel sprung up, positioning her rear end over the few surviving architectural works. Her hips forced themselves in a painful, jerking circle; she tried to stop them, but found her arms frozen. She cried out: \"Mitsuo menda naha naha!\" Her jaw fell with terror and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stretched his arms up, his laugh slowly turning into a yawn. He turned to the plot-bound titaness again, tapping his forehead for ideas. \"Okay, for the last thing... Eat up what's-her-name there. Hyatt! She's done nothing useful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again moved by forces beyond her comprehension, Excel's fingers opened - the index and thumb plucking her friend up by the collar. \"Well, Hyatt, this - *sniff* - looks like it's it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, already? Well, it was *cough* pleasant while it lasted.\" Her eyes still shut, the half-dead ACROSS agent choked a little, her extremities flopping around as she lifted in the air. \"Weeee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still remember the first time we met...\" The giant woman, normally full of energy and an unfathomably rapid voice tempo, was now slow and low-pitched. \"You looked so pale and fragile. Like the corpse of a heroin chic model.\" Her hand kept lowering, no matter what she did to stop it. Hyatt dangled right above the mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you were in widescreen.\" The red-and-black clad girl's hand met with her cheek. She peered down to the expanse of her coworker's face below. It seemed to get larger and larger every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, and I can still see you on that electric horse ride, enjoying yourself too much!\" She laughed, despite herself; the wind from her voice blew up Hyatt's skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller woman smiled back. \"I recall the time we recalled all those times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, Ep. 13! But now, Excel's heart is only filled with regret that we...\" Her mouth fell wide open; she struggled with the forces of the plot to mouth out the last few words: \"...can't have... more times to remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And mine is full of...\" Her captive, when faced with the warmth of the gaping jaws, coughed up some blood, which dripped on the titanic tongue. \"Well, that, and regret that I couldn't grow with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabeshin's finger snapped. Both girls froze in place. \"That's what this story was missing! Multiple giantesses! The readers will love that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, a twist of fate happened to Hyatt, just like in the first chapter. An alien laser beam hit her. Hormones from her dark and mysterious past leaped into action. A growth pill came in through the mail. A super-powered bouncy ball fell on her blue hair. Something to that extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcel felt her junior's body stretching within her hand. The pale, doll-like figure became harder and harder to contain. Her muscular legs hit the larger agent's tongue; but by this point, Hyatt was too large to swallow whole. The red-and-black uniform, like the blood of angry men and the dark of ages past, spread out and shot upwards as it struggled to fill the expanding curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... AHN~!\" Her face flushed red as she kept sprouting, the growth now coming in quick, consecutive bumps. Each made her shut her eyes tighter. Her voice, normally a whisper, became an ear-splitting cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcel placed her down, backing away with her hands shielding her - as if this woman were a bomb. Now free, this once-demure creature writhed across the pavement, bearing an absolutely unique expression somewhere in the midpoint between \"enduring crushing pain from the weight of one's own body\" and \"an o-face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer partner shook her head. She twisted back to the author, the entirety of her titanic body trembling. \"No! Please stop! Excel can't bear to see her partner put through such horrible torture! It's making me cry oversized waterfalls!\" She fell to her knees, drawing huge holes in the cement, pleading to the afro'd man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senior, I'm done now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HWA-!?\" Her body shot up in a defensive pose. Hyatt had grown just as huge as her. She seemed completely unaware - or uncaring - of the last few buildings that now lay beneath her red heels.Whatever survivors were nearby could look up and see, in the skyline, two members of ACROSS staring at each other, lips shut in awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabeshin dusted his coat, satisfied. \"Alright, that's probably enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the turquoise-clad woman's green eyes began to narrow. The ground creaked as she leaned over to Hyatt's ear, and let out an ear-piercing whisper: \"Excel has a cunning plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to sound so surprised!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a melodramatic leap backwards, her soles shook the earth. She pointed an accusatory finger to her partner, cleared her throat, and shouted: \"Curse you for standing there, so big and large and stuff! I am jealous and confrontational for some reason, and want to grow bigger than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabeshin blinked. \"Huh, that'd work.\" With a snap of his finger, she shot up nearly double her previous height - Hyatt's head now parallel to her partner's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller agent gazed upwards, lips pursed in concern. \"Oh, no. I also feel this sudden antagonism. My dreams would all come true if I could be bigger than my senior...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a continual nod, the red-clad man clapped his hands. Hyatt sprouted upwards, stopping exactly one inch above Excel. \"I can feel the ratings going up now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he turned away, they both smiled. The woman in red and black suddenly wrapped her giant-but-dainty hands on Excel's pauldron-clad shoulders, her eyes turning extra-glossy and reflective. \"Senior, I realize now that my envy was actually a way of manifesting hidden lesbian love for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turquoise-booted girl cooed back softly, enormous hair strands blowing in a suddenly intense wind. \"Growing big has inexplicably made me a lesbian, too!\" Excel let herself fall into Hyatt's lips, their mouths locking in a long, intense kiss - occasionally peeking away to see if the author-avatar was still buying it. Some slobber and blood dripped to the ground in gross puddles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcel groaned, pulling her face away briefly. \"I hope Lord Il Palazzo doesn't see us like this...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabeshin snapped his fingers again - and just as she'd planned, Il Palazzo was there, in all his glory. That flowing hair! That disapproving glare! That gloved hand clutching a Visual Kei magazine in frustration! Surely, he could find a solution to this! She screamed with excitement, breaking a few windows on ruined buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a palm to his head, the glorious leader of ACROSS turned to the self-insert. \"You there. I'm impressed with your firearm collection. Pray tell, which is the most powerful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's easy!\" He tugged an unweildy minigun from his hairdo, depositing it in Il Palazzo's arms. \"The Deus Ex Machina. It's powered by uranium and plasma, comes with a built-in chainsaw and silencer, has a homing device that prevents it from hitting me or my allies, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish, Il Palazzo fired a blast directly at Excel's body. The recoil made him fall over flatly. A beam of energy swept over her body, moving to Hyatt's. Both of them felt a strong tingling sensation rushing through every part of their body, and - the ground was getting further away once more! The two were growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Stop!\" Nabeshin snapped and clapped in protest - but nothing happened. Just as Dr. Kabapu predicted, nuclear energy acted like unpredictable magic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcel saluted, kneeling before Il Palazzo - her nose practically pinned him down against the pavement. \"My Lord! You're so smart to think of that! I knew we could count on this city's rightful ruler to save us!\" Hyatt was behind, moaning ambiguously again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared back, unimpressed. \"You may interpret my actions however you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big do the duo grow?</span></div></div>",

He could clearly see the shape of her pupils and irises above, expanding even faster in excitement than the white surrounding it. Alongside the excited gusts of air from her nostrils, every time she blinked, the sound of her eyelashes brushing together echoed out like thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis own eyes shut gently. \"Excel. Would it trouble you terribly to get off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! A thousand apologies, Lord Il Palazzo, sir!\" Her head quickly sprung back up from the pavement, with a force that brought her boss flying up with her. With astoundingly quick reflexes for a man who never seemed to leave his throne, the leader of ACROSS grasped the bridge of his subordinate's nose. A skid mark from the movement rested in the concrete below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow the two - and the newly enlarged Hyatt - Nabeshin was in an uncharacteristic furor. He unloaded every weapon he had on them - machine guns, ancient fighting techniques, cease-and-desist notices. Nothing! He placed his fingers under his manly jaw in contemplation. \"Dammit! I knew the Deus Ex Machina was strong - but strong enough to make them invincible to my power to control the plot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afro'd man fired a rocket to the ground, the explosion sending him flying into the sky. Now parallel with Il Palazzo, he stretched his arm back, charging up a deadly punch - which he unloaded into the man's delicate features. \"You pompous jerk! I had those two on the ropes!\" Through the physics of anime, he was still flying as the long-haired man fell off the fleshy platform from that hit. The self-insert was taking out his rocket launcher again. \"Oh, you're gonna eat a LOT more than lead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a wind with the strength of a tornado pulled him in. His frizzy afro and red jacket floated upwards, followed by the entirety of his body. Screaming like the hero of a cheesy action movie, he fell into the gust helplessly - inhaled into Excel's still-expanding black hole of a nostril!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP RIGHT THERE!\" She shouted, though everyone could hear her perfectly well. \"You've forced Hyatt and I through completely humiliating experiences! You DARED to lay a hand on The Great Il Palazzo's perfect body! Not only that, but Christian Wesdon Chandler cited you as direct inspiration for his own self-insert! Un-for-give-a-ble!\" Holding one hand out to catch Il Palazzo, and using the other to point a finger forward dramatically, she finished with: \"In the name of the toons, I will punish you!... Hey, did you run off during my long-winded speech?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" ACROSS' leader lay in her hand, staring up at the confused mountain of a girl. \"You inhaled him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Well, Excel needed enough air to say all that so quickly, and - WAIT! My lord! My lord! Are you harmed?\" She shook his body quickly, desperately, trying to read his stoic face. Both her hands gripped around his torso harshly, the fingers twitching in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\" He paused to glance at the surrounding skin. \"Normally, the inertia from your movements and the impact from landing on this hand would have been enough to kill even the strongest man. And yet, I feel no pain from this.\" He lifted a finger under his nose, pensively - cape blowing gently against the massive fingers below. \"Perhaps a side-effect of the firearm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyatt's body continued to stretch out, her long hair approaching the clouds. \"With that distraction done, should we continue our mission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer partner nodded in agreement. \"YES! Using our new gifts from Il Palazzo, we'll now have no problems conquering the city in his name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down to F City - only to find it gone. All of it but City Hall. Through multiple chapters of rampaging, fighting, and accidental destruction, all that remained was a few ruins of buildings, huge craters in the ground shaped like Excel and Hyatt's bodies, and ridiculously-dressed gangs fighting for turf in the indents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcel could say little but: \"Aw, crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that,\" Il Palazzo said. \"This city was only the starting point. Our goal is nothing less than complete conquest - and for that, we need you to continue your growth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Y-you NEED me? Il Palazzo, this - this is the greatest day of Excel's life!\" She cuddled him tightly in a massive hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. But the author has run out of ideas - so he's decided to just have the heroines grow to ludicrous heights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Department of City Security twiddled their thumbs anxiously, watching from the other side of City Hall's broken window. Kabapu kept glancing back to his novelty watch, tapping his fingers on the table. \"Our man is taking his time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second.\" Matsuya peeked out the window, noticing the skyline changing radically. Not far off, peachy legs the size of skyscrapers ascended, a pair of firm, shorts-clad buttocks above. She shook her head, trying to keep her cool at the ominous sight. \"He's failed. The monster's even bigger now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIwata leaped to her side, surveying the ruined landscape. \"Alright, this view's WAY clearer!\" He tugged a swivel chair over, resting back in it and grinning. \"Hey, wonder if this means we get tomorrow off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumiyoshi quietly scooted in beside him with a popcorn container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You IDIOTS!\" Watanabe stomped around in a nervous pacing motion. \"Everything's falling apart, we're WAY over our heads - and you aren't thinking of fighting back? Or even escaping? We're just going to watch like a bunch of sitting ducks?\" He gritted his teeth, smoke erupting from his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe largerr man by the window quietly pointed out. <i>Isn't that the Ayasugi girl?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe froze, and darted up. Yes - right beside the hyperactive girl, Hyatt was making her ascent. Her legs, clad in dark silk, trembled slowly. Far above, her uniform became more and more tightly fitting, the angle only accentuating her mountainous curves. A calm expression rested on her face, which only got larger. And closer. The girl was fainting. Her doll-like, milky facial features fell towards City Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watanabe's right!\" Their moustached leader nodded, headed for the door. \"I'll make preparations to fight the monsters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself pulled back by Watanabe's hand. \"Are you crazy? Look at that innocent face!\" He smiled a touch too wide, motioning to Hyatt's descending head. \"She couldn't possibly want to harm anyone! I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding - they're just as scared and confused as we are!\" Gluing himself to the glass, he started laughing, tears flowing from his eyes, arms held out as if in a sun salutation. \"Miss Ayasugi, I'm so glad you're safe... Now, bless me with your kiss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the woman's pink, plush lips had captured City Hall, the last surviving building, in their shadow. Sumiyoshi was scribbling down his will: <i>burn my hard drive and scatter its ashes into the ocean</i>. Iwata felt a sudden pressure on his hand - familiar, but it felt gentler than usual. He turned his head. Misaki's hand rested on his. He waited a moment for her to twist it, or suplex him. Nothing. She let out a small tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iwata... I... Should've done more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited for him to make a corny joke, or let his fingers wander over her. Nothing. Almost in sync, her ponytailed head and his spiky-haired head just slowly rested on each other. Everything they'd worked for came apart outside. Doom fell on them from above. Their hands stayed connected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiouji watched the clouds float by on the other end of the plane's window. His robots took the two seats around him, remaining quiet. Slowly, a warning light came on above. Sirens screeched through the speaker. Instinctively, the scientist raised his arms to the air, shaking. \"I swear, she told me she was eighteen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRopponmatsu tapped him. \"Master, the siren isn't for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slumped down awkwardly in his seat. Out the window, a foreign object rested not far in the distance. The plane's efforts to steer away from it were naught; the mountainous surface kept expanding outwards, eating up more of the sky. Everyone on-board rushed for the exits, grabbing parachutes - but it was too late. Excel's backside, high in the clouds, had already hit the vehicle inadvertently. Defying physics, it instantly became a blazing fireball, leaving only a teensy scorch mark on her butt cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the rolling fields of Columbia, a lone figure ran across an empty shore. Weights rested on his sweaty legs, face twisted with exhaustion - yet, he pressed on. He had to train hard, for the sake of his son and his sexy wife...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething trembled under his feet - and the man froze cold in terror. A face loomed in the sky. That woman he'd worked with in Japan as a construction worker - Excel? Her cheerful grimace raised far into the sky, tinted with atmospheric distortion. He could see chunks of former buildings descending from her body, blazing towards the ground. An errant movement of her leg sent a massive shockwave towards him - followed by an immense tidal wave, large enough to swallow his hometown!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shouted to the air in agony: \"\u00bfWhy, Great Will? \u00bfWhy does this always happen to Pedro? I cry out with all my soul - NOOO!\"<br>\r\nFrom the side of his eye, Pedro spotted that stupid Gomez swept by the waves, too. \"Well, that helps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove the atmosphere, a lone spaceship passed by. By now, both of the girls' bodies were visible from space, nearly doubling in size every minute. In the captain's room, a Puchu with a scar watched the blue planet below, shaking his head. \"Was this their plan? Grow the moon princess and her stupid colleague? What depths will those invaders not sink to...!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fleet of battleships followed the smaller shuttle, firing intensely. The main Puchu invasion force. They surrounded the rebel ship, ready to open fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyatt regained her senses, getting back up on her legs. The cloud layers shifted rapidly to accommodate the ascent. Her scalp obliterated the entire armada without her even noticing.</span></div></div>",

What size were our plucky heroine and her cool-headed companion now? Nobody on Earth could tell - they'd never thought to manufacture a measuring tape that long. Besides, except for those with a fetish for multiplying numbers, it didn't really mean anything without landmarks to compare to - and by now, F City was in desperate lack of landmarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Hyatt and Excel kept pushing upwards and outwards. By now, their growth came in (relatively) tiny, consecutive bursts - each little \"bump\" sending an electrifying sensation through their body, and letting more of the sky fall to thick coats of turquoise, red, and black. From the Japanese islands, it was impossible to see beyond either of their ankles; people more interested in breasts or butts than feet began mass exoduses to Korea, the Philippines, and California.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange-haired titan started panicking, the quick movement of her feet sinking deep into the earth. \"Oh, no! We've reached mega-sizes! This is bad, this is bad! It's impossible for any meaningful communication now! The story can't go on like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA finger tapped her back. \"Uhm, senior? I'm still here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head, a little surprised. \"Oh. Uh. I mean, neither of us can speak with small people! That's just unrealistic! How are readers supposed to self-insert now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHEM. In your right ear, Excel.\" Il Palazzo cleared his throat angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" The girl shut her eyes. \"Well, that was considerably less disastrous than Excel thought. She should maaaybe stop leaping to conclusions like that. Sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld leaders met to discuss how to fight this threat - but collectively decided that with this economic crisis going on, it wasn't a very high priority. In that time, Excel and Hyatt had reached the right size to exit Earth's atmosphere - they jumped off the ever-shrinking platform of Japan, sending even more immense waves crashing over surrounding nations. Now, floating in the dark void, either girl hovered above a hemisphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-m-my...\" Hyatt trembled from the sudden lack of oxygen, sputtering meteor-sized blood drops over the Midwestern US. \"It's s-so beautiful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer senior's eyes glittered, reflecting the surface of the Earth. Years upon years of history, wars, injustice, and heroes, all leading up to this one point, all contained in this little thing in front of her. \"Aut Caesar, aut nullus... Everything, everything under Il Palazzo's guidance...!\" Overtaken with glee, she caressed the globe, popping a heel up. Thousands died under the weight of her chest; more still from the ruptures her arms caused. Within the blink of an eye, a horrible snapping sound came from the Earth, and cracks slid across it. Though the woman before it took quick notice and tried to haphazardly glue the tectonic plates back together, it only brought the magma from the Earth's core rushing out more quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excel!\" Her superior's voice called out from within her ear. \"What on Earth - or off Earth - what did you just do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeell...\" The booming words slipped from between her nation-sized teeth. \"There was one world. And we sorta, in a way, split it in half. So now, there are two.\" Wiping some of the searing rocks off her uniform, she groveled as much as one possibly could towards someone too small to even see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll discuss this later.\" He groaned, and moved his hand out. \"For now, I command you to GROW! There is much more to conquer beyond this planet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the two grew, larger and larger. Excel tried to keep the two halves of their home planet as a bra - but they quickly diminished, barely even qualifying as pasties within two minutes' time. After four more minutes, the oceans and continents were small enough to slip through her somehow-still-existent clothes, and fall into a milk duct. The stars and surrounding solar systems became fine and fragile, like tiny snowflakes. Hyatt was able to squeeze a few together into a starry snowman. It wasn't long at all before the outer boundaries of the universe broke against their combined strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow! We\u2019ve gone giga!\" Excel grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe the correct term is \u2018ultra\u2019.\" The unfamiliar voice came from behind. Alongside Excel and Hyatt was a red-ponytailed woman, who'd somehow managed to grow to the same size as them... Misaki? Misaki Matsuya?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother girl floated into the void, wearing a plain white outfit. Ropponmatsu? \"I\u2019ve heard this height referred to as \u2018luma\u2019 height before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody says that. \u00a1This is teragiantess height! \u00a1TERAGIANTESS!\" Pedro's sexy - and suddenly enormous - wife cried out to all four of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Momoichi was the next to join the crowd. \"You\u2019re spelling it wrong. There are two \u2018r\u2019s. Terra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough this whole situation, Excel and Hyatt simply stood there, dazed. The latter shyly lifted a finger, and said: \"I've... I fail to follow here. What's happening? How did you get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing her arms, Misaki pointed to the glowing, milky orbs around. \"You see these? These are alternate universes, much like yours. Each of us was in one of them once, but then we starred in a giantess story. And, like you, we outgrew our dimension.\" She shook her face gravely, quietly stroking a microscopic head of spiky hair resting on her chest. \"Then our stories ended - and we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyatt glanced at all the faces around, astounded. \"So many of you reached the same end! And you're all women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPedro's sexy wife smiled, waving her hand. \"\u00a1Oh, no! There are some tera-sized men here and there. But that's against the rules of the interactive, so they're all conveniently hiding behind that multiverse-sized cardboard box there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone glanced in the direction she pointed. Sure enough, there was a box. They could see a bit of someone's arm sticking out - before a seventh girl pushed it back. The second Ropponmatsu unit. \"We\u2019ve gone way beyond tera and terra, we\u2019re in Macrogiantess territory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, MACRO-GIANTESS. Isn\u2019t that the MOST inventive name ever.\" An woman with purple drill-hair harrumphed, placing a gloved finger to her ridiculously-sized chest. \"I, Elgala, didn\u2019t know you could be a giantess without being macro-sized, but it seems I, Elgala, was wrong. Pfffft. That's stupid. I, Elgala, am sticking with Yottagiantess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcel pointed to her, curious. \"And who the heck are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElgala glared back. \"An Excel Saga manga-only character! Did you think your little anime was SO special that it's the basis for EVERY universe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhara Haruko nodded from the side. \"Yeah, you'd be surprised how many illogical crossovers happen in giantess interactives. Most don't even add to the story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlps Electric's young corporate hair floated into the crowd, laughing. \"Yottagiantess sounds like the name of a breakfast food. We\u2019re Petagiantesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you calling a Pedo-giantess?\" The pink-haired assassin, Cosette, pouted and stamped her foot on a pile of universes. \"I'm totally over 18!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, what now?\" Excel asked, grinning nervously. She lifted a universe in her hand, squeezing it. \"Can we use these things as massage beads or marbles or something? Should we make out? I mean - what do you all do for fun here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all turned to her - including the men hidden behind the box - and in a single voice, shouted: \"WE ARGUE ABOUT WHAT TO CALL THIS SCALE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in Excel's universal eardrum, Il Palazzo's voice was still a commanding presence. \"You're not finished. If this macrophilic corruption - this fetish-pandering trash - has spread over so many realities and characters... Then ACROSS' job shall not end until we purify them all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Growing again? I'm a little exhausted now...\" Hyatt laughed, as she felt the familiar tingling over her body. \"And I think this size is excessive already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no way to talk!\" Excel shouted to her. She laughed, hands on her still-expanding hips, breaking into song: \"Banana peels, pratfalls, and every mistake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey expanded more, quickly outgrowing the crowd of girls around them. Glistening masses of galaxies sparkled like gemstones around, squeezed by the growing bodies. \"One ideal through it all, everything is for his sake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyatt felt her heel colliding with one tiny universe - the one where Excel chose to thank Il Palazzo instead of conquering the city. That branch would never find its conclusion. She spotted dozens of other tiny universes that contained this interactive's worlds - Asagi's Big Debut. Stella, My Universal Girlfriend. And there were thousands of these dimensions out there, hundreds of writing dot com stories, all laid out for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if nothing else, I guess that would be...\" Excel grinned, diving in and rolling around in them like a girl in a ball pit. \"...A really weird kind of love... called loyalty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, if you log in to writing dot com and find a perfectly-good giantess story gone, don't blame the site owners - its universe may have been lost in the valleys of Hyatt's flesh. If a furry size interactive you liked is missing, don't blame the staff for deleting it - Excel may have considered it emergency rations, and added it to those in her stomach. And don't be too mad when you can't view items due to heavy server loads - any website trying to bear ACROSS' explosive expansion would have trouble keeping them contained. Just hope that they don't break out into our dimension some day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn infinitesimally small whimper sounded out. Excel felt something beyond microscopic crawling over her skin, scurrying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MENCHI!\" Her scream was loud enough to reduce a galaxy to dust. She groped over her body, trying futilely to grab him. \"You still haven't put in your part for our conquest! Come on, come heeere, girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Quack Experimental Animation Excel Saga<br>\r\nGiantess Parody Fanfiction<br>\r\nToday's Experiment......

But although she has come to know and love each and every person who has ever been born throughout the ages, she had never managed to find anyone who was able to win over her heart the way that Mike had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were very few who possessed the same level of unconditional kindness as Stella herself, and even among those few who did, most of them had possessed a hidden darkness in their hearts. Something small hiding in the deepest corners of their minds that would eventually grow to corrupt them if they were placed in a position of power. Only one who possessed both Stella's unconditional love for all beings and a pure heart that was completely void of any temptations could possibly be considered worthy of such a perfect being as her. To date, Mike was the first and only person to ever meet these steep conditions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything about him seemed completely impossible, yet he was certainly real. Stella knew that a chance like this may never come again, so she had to take it. Mike was without a doubt the one who was meant for her, and although she could have simply used her powers to make him her boyfriend in an instant, she didn't want to. Doing that would be taking away her beloved's free will, and she knew that for their love to be true Mike would have to choose to be with her on his on. With these thoughts in mind, Stella set her plan to win Mike over in motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella had observed all planets since the beginning of time, and earth was no exception. As such, she knew everything that she needed to about how human society worked. In order to make contact with Mike, she would first need to create a human body to serve as her avatar. She knew that many humans were terrified of the unknown, and while she was confident that Mike would still accept her even if he knew of her true form, she felt that he would find interacting with a member of his own species to be more natural to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her powers, Stella crafted a replica of herself in human form and prepared to place it on earth. While she herself had always lived in solitude, and as such had no need to ever wear clothing to cover herself, she knew that humans were much more sensitive about showing their naked bodies to eachother. With this in mind, she had crafted a modest outfit for her avatar to wear. The last thing that Stella needed to do was locate her beloved before placing her avatar in the ideal location to make contact with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In front of the gate to the same highschool that Mike went to, nobody noticed as a beautiful 18 year old young woman had appeared from thin air. She had long blonde hair reaching half way down her back, and dazzling blue eyes that seemed to shine as brightly as the stars themselves. She had a beautiful figure, with C-cup breasts, a decently sized butt, and great curves all around, but nothing about her seemed to be too extravagant or out of proportion for someone her age. She was clothed in a light pink tanktop and short jeans, and on her feet were a pair of cute blue flipflops. This girl looked toward the gate with an excited smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike entered his first class and sat down at his desk the same as he always did. To him it was just another ordinary day. As everyone else entered the class, he turned his attention to the front of the room where the teacher, Mrs. Daniels, was just walking in. To his surprise, however, Mrs. Daniels wasn't alone today. By her side stood the most beautiful girl he had ever seen in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class, I would like to introduce you to our new transfer student. Her name is Stella Cassiopeia, and she'll be joining us for the rest of the year. I expect that you will all be able to get along together. Now, Stella, please take your seat so that I can begin my lesson.\" Mrs. Daniels said to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Stella smiled and walked to the back of the class, sitting down in the one empty seat right next to Mike. Before taking out the textbooks and class materials that she had prepared for herself, Stella turned toward Mike and smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, I'm Stella. I'm new, so I hope that you'll be willing to help me get used to things here.\" Stella said as she reached out her hand to Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course, I'd be glad to help you. If there's anything that you need, feel free to ask. I'm Mike Thompson, by the way.\" Mike said as he nervously reached out to accept Stella's handshake. He was surprised that such a beautiful girl was even talking to him. He was completely average in every way, and she was so... So perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they introduced themselves to eachother, Stella and Mike turned their attention back to the class. Things continued normally from that point, and nothing else interesting happened until the bell rang. At that point...</span></div></div>",

She grinned back widely, but toned it down a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't want to come on too strong... or I might scare him off.</i> She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\"Stella asked, getting up from her desk, her meager backpack slung over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, the backpack had nothing in it, but with but a whim she could reach in and conjure up anything required for the mundane tasks that school required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You uh... mind eating lunching with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked briefly. The universe had no need for subsistence, but then she remembered that she was trying to be human, and humans had to eat three times a day, every day. Such fragile creatures, tied to their routines, yet interesting as well, which is why she had taken interest in Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" She pipped out cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike nodded and motioned for her to follow. He lead her out to the football field, most of the bleachers set up empty and the grassy field bare of any athletes, most of the student body in the cafeteria at the moment. Mike seated himself down in one of the bottom bench rows, patting the spot beside him, and Stella eagerly joined him. Mike pulled a bag lunch from his bag, and Stella pulled one from her bag as well, except hers simply appeared out of thin air when she reached into her sack for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bring your own lunch too?\" Mike asked, opening his bag and pulling out a measly sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella nodded.\"Cafeteria food is pretty gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled, taking a bite out of the bread and meat. Stella pulled a sandwich out of hers as well, chewing as slowly as possible, this whole 'eating' concept strange and new to a being who never had to thrive on another energy source for her entire existence. It was a rather pleasant experience, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Stella began, Mike perking up to her voice. \"Could I ask you something? Theoretically, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" The boy nodded after swallowing another bite of his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if... in theory... there was this girl, and this girl happened to be really... different. She could do anything she wanted, yet had nobody to share it with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Interesting enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if... that girl was me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say she should look somewhere else than the guy sitting beside her. There are definitely plenty of better guys out there to choose from.\" Mike joked, getting a chuckle out of both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Modesty, one of the many traits I adore about you, Mike.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, anything you want, right? What are you, some kind of rich kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, your parents don't enforce any rules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do you mean, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can... control everything and anything to my will. Reality is simply my whims.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can prove it too!\" Stella exclaimed, hoping she wasn't about to scare him off. She proves it by...</span></div></div>",

I can control everything. I wanted the sandwich to be whole again, so it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike stood silent for a moment, looking from the sandwich, to Stella, and back and forth. Then he fled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike, wait!\" Stella called after him, but he simply looked over his shoulder and ran faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning herself, she made her sandwich vanish and shifted her bag onto her shoulders from ten feet away. She caught up with him just as he, not looking where he was going in his panicked dash, was about to run right into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thought from the universe he ran through it, and Stella followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two found themselves in the entrance hall of the school building, except that they were dangling above the basement, the floor intersecting them roughly around their belly buttons. A few students noticed them, but Stella simply made them think nothing of the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella thought again and the two swiftly lifted up until they stood on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I couldn't let you run into a wall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Stella, this, this is just too much. Just... just, I need some space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella was rooted to the spot as Mike ran again, this time not getting ten steps before running into the school's biggest bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's bag stayed on his shoulders, but the other boy's books went flying. Mike picked himself up and began to gather them, apologizing as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bully lifted him bodily, motioning for his gang to get his books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch where you're going, you little twerp. I think you need a lesson in respect for your betters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella was frozen into inaction as the love of her life got his nose broken, his jaw dislocated, the wind knocked out of him with a swift kick to the gut and ended up screaming silently in pain on the floor after a hard knee to his groin. She couldn't decide whether to help Mike, and risk scaring him off for good, or not help, and risk him hating her for not helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mike picked himself up and dragged himself to the nurse's office, his tormentor looking on smugly, Stella looked after him longingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want a little shit like him for?\" the bully said, ogling Stella. \"You need a real man.\" His gang laughed obediently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what a real man does,\" replied the universe, indicating the trail of blood on the ground, \"I think I'll stick to unreal ones.\" Then she walked off in another direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella wandered her way into the school's cafeteria, gravitating toward an oddly-dressed girl sitting alone in a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I join you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked up briefly. \"No, not at all. Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella sat down and, as she pulled out her sandwich, she changed it into a garden salad. Opening it, she took the little container of vinaigrette she had made with it, poured it over the vegetables and began to eat, finding the experience different, but still pleasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer companion looked up again. \"Hey, aren't you that new girl? S... something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stella. Stella Cassiopeia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. I'm Cecilia Margaret Voclain. Pleased to meet you, Stella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I you, Cecilia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecilia Margaret. Cecilia's my aunt, and Margaret's my other aunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella nodded. \"I'll remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're new here, so a bit of advice. If you value your social life, find another friend. I'm not exactly Miss Popularity around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella looked around.  \"They don't seem as interesting as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret sipped a bit of soup before replying. \"So what brings you in here? I saw you heading out to the bleachers with Mike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this and that,\" Stella said, hiding her pain. \"It... didn't go well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Tell me about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella probed her companion in silence, then decided she could trust the strange girl. \"We had a bit of an argument, then he ran into someone and got beat up for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big, tough guy, gang of big tough guys with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real piece of work, Lauren. Always been ticked off about having a 'girl's name'. What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do? Nothing, I just stood there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't even try to intervene? You're a better person than I am, I probably would have at least tried to get him on the floor. Brown belt in jiu-jitsu, but don't tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret looked at Stella closely. \"But what really happened? He didn't run off for no reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella made a decision. \"I'll tell you, but you've got to promise not to tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise,\" and Stella could tell her new friend was sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was scared of me, well, of what I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What can you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you mean, anything you want? Anyone can do anything they want, they just have to face the consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean I can do anything. If I want to do it, I can do it.\" Stella indicated her half-eaten salad, then changed it into a bowl of cottage cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret blinked, and Stella waited, hoping she hadn't made another mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! What else can you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella ignored the question. \"Anyway, I showed him some of what I could do, and saved him from running into a wall, and, well, I think I might've scared him off for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he say, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella repeated Mike's words verbatim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him a little time and a little space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want him,\" Stella said, very softly. \"He's so special, and he doesn't even know it. I love him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just it,\" her friend replied, just as quietly. \"He doesn't know. He doesn't get how special he is that someone like you would love him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella smiled faintly. \"That's not the only thing that makes him special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret changed topics. \"So, tell me, you live around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... no. I live rather far away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you come to my place after school? I'll help you figure out Mike if you show me some more of your cool powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella looked up into her new friend's eyes, and saw someone she could trust. \"All right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Meet you out front after school then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the bell rang, warning the students to get to their next class. Stella and Cecilia Margaret went their separate ways, the human's eyes going wide as Stella made her bowl of cottage cheese vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked to her next class, Stella rearranged the seating plans for her classes, putting herself as far from Mike as possible. She had to force herself to appear to pay attention to the lessons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the final bell, Stella rushed straight to the front door, and waited for about a minute until Cecilia Margaret showed up. The two rode the bus in silence until it stopped at the side of the road and the human led the universe off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waited until the bus was reasonably far away, then Cecilia Margaret walked straight into the brush. Stella followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my place. It's a bit secluded, but I prefer it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of trudging through tall grass, the two emerged onto a packed trail, with nobody in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you wanted to see some of my powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's fine. I like this walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you insist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. I like the walk, but hey, I promised to help you with Mike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I promised you show you some of my powers. Just envision your house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella picked up the clear image from her friend's mind and in an instant they were standing at the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! Just who are you, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the universe. Reality is me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret unlocked the door and went in. Stella followed to find herself in a large, ornate foyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My folks are rich,\" the human explained, \"and they gave me this place on my eighteenth birthday. I could have had a number of different places, but I chose this one for the solitude. It's a bit of a hike to get the bus, but it's worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if they're so rich, why aren't you popular?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I'm a bit weird, not really cut out to be one of the cool kids. I don't like what they like, don't think like they think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a nerd,\" said Cecilia Margaret, leading Stella into a room with one wall dominated by a huge flatscreen television, and the others with floor-to-ceiling shelves of DVDs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella scanned them with her mind, familiarizing herself with her friend's interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, and I've got, well, eclectic beliefs, or, rather, not really any. Not something you really want to admit around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything you do believe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as such. I look at various religions and spiritual traditions, try to find what's good in them. There's pearls in all of them. 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.' 'An it harm none, do what ye will.' That sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella nodded and subtly altered her friend's collection. \"And I don't shake any of that for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless you're going to tell me I have to worship you or something,\" Cecilia Margaret chuckled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm everywhere at once--I'm everything at once, really--and it's so easy just to reach out and change something. I could micromanage everything if I wanted to. But I don't. Mostly I just watch things unfold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human began pulling things out of her fridge and turned on her oven. \"And what about having a human body for your own consciousness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, not much different. I knew exactly what it was like to have a human body before, of course, but I never took control of one. It's interesting to choose the sensations I experience, but most of them I've experienced anyway, through others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except that there aren't really others, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I mostly observe instead of interfering, from my point of view there might as well be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Stella seemed to notice what her friend was doing. With a thought the food was prepared and on the table in the next room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret blinked. \"Please don't. I enjoy cooking--preparing my own meal makes eating it all the more satisfying to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry.\" Stella restored matters to the way they had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" replied the human, who resumed her preparations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what else can you do?\" asked Cecilia Margaret after a silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything I want. Reality is what I want it to be, so if I decide that something should happen, it will. If I decide it shouldn't happen, it won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking quickly back and forth between two tasks, the human said, \"So if you decided that I should be in two places at once, I would be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would, yes,\" said the universe as she granted the human's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way cool!\" said Cecilia Margaret in stereo. The one on Stella's left continued to talk, her other body occupied with both arms in use and holding a wooden spoon in her mouth, at least until Stella noticed that and granted the mortal four arms, and she continued working as if she had always had them, not noticing the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you do stuff like alter history, time travel, that stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you perceive as time is just another thing I can control. I could alter history, if I wanted to. I could fix part of the future, too. But those are the past and the future as you perceive them. I generally choose to perceive them that way also, but I do not have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can control everything, change anything, but usually don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much. I want nothing but the best for everything in me, but I know that they have to be allowed to make mistakes. It always pains me when those mistakes prove disastrous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine. I don't know anything about the rest of the universe, but I know that even here we have experienced horrendous atrocities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And each of them hurt me, as did each of those that occurred on other worlds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there is life out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's life out there if I say there's life out there,\" the universe said lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But absent your intervention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a discovery that I let species make for themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret finished her work and put a dish in her oven. Setting a timer, both her bodies turned to face Stella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but as I said, I let species discover that on their own. I've told you, but you'll have to keep that knowledge to yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And what are you going to do to stop me?\" the human asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already done it. You can discuss these matters with me, but not with anyone else. I am sorry for interfering with your mind, but it is better than interfering with all of humanity, so I can't let you communicate that knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, even if it doesn't happen in my lifetime--and I don't think it will--at least I'll know.\" Suddenly she noticed her extra limbs. \"Whoa, awesome! It's like I've always had these--I didn't even notice them until now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see? I didn't want you to notice them until now, so you didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret waved her eight arms around for a short time, until her face fell when Stella restored her to her original condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps another time,\" said Stella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose a taste is better than never experiencing it. I will treasure the memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human set about setting the table, hesitating on putting down a second place. \"Will you be joining me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not require sustenance, and as such I could not take what is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. I made something for two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Stella thought, and the additional ingredients used appeared back in her friend's fridge and cupboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe timer went off, and Cecilia Margaret took her concoction out of her oven. Half the pan was normal, but the other half had a moving pattern of galaxies on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that half is yours, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I created it myself and have given you back the ingredients you used in making that part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could not take from you that which you might need in future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human shrugged, took the tray into her dining room, divided the meal between the two plates--the pan went back to normal as she did--put the rest of her cooking implements in her dishwasher and motioned for Stella to join her at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, food made by the universe. May I try some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella silently, but noticeably, switched small portions on their plates. She popped her piece of the human's meal in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad,\" she said. \"To be honest I had thought that food prepared by others would not compare to what I create, but you are talented.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret ate her piece with a bit of trepidation. Then her eyes rolled up, and she leaned back and moaned in pure pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she recovered, she said, \"I do not compare to you. That was, without a doubt, the best food I have ever tasted. I think some people would quite literally kill for even a small sliver of anything you make.\" She took another bite of her own creation. \"And I am glad you enjoyed what I made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad you found what I made pleasurable. But I cannot give you more--it is plain that doing so at this time would cause brain damage, and while I could repair it, I would be unable to let you remember anything but that first piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret cocked an ear back. \"So your powers are not limitless?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a loud buzzing was heard from the human's back pocket. Pulling out an advanced phone, she took one look at it, said, \"Sorry, I have to deal with this,\" and busied herself for a few minutes tapping away madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella knew what her friend had been doing, but nonetheless asked, \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know?\" the human said with a grin, then continued. \"I take a look at my investment portfolio at least once a day. Normally I've finished dinner by now, but it's not every day I'm entertaining the universe.\" She took another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry I have disrupted your usual activities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be. I invited you, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a short time passed until the two finished their meal, and then Cecilia Margaret cleared the table, put it all in the dishwasher--she noticed Stella's plate, cutlery and glass were perfectly clean, but out of habit put them in anyway--put in detergent--\"My folks have one that'll take regular dish soap, but they weren't willing to spend quite that much on this place\"--started the machine and headed for the stairs to her basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella followed and emerged into an open space, support columns dotting the area. Cecilia Margaret was looking in a cabinet filled with musical instruments. A few seconds passed before she took out a clarinet and some sheet music, then walked over to the area's lone chair and stand and began to warm up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella looked on and, after a minute of listening to the music, thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret stopped shortly after. \"Please don't. I play because I wish to improve. If you give me the ability, I do not feel as if I have earned it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you have earned my friendship, and with it what I may do for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for that I shall always be thankful. But to me, part of being human is the struggle to better myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems I have more to learn than I had thought.\" But as she restored her friend to her former ability, she thought again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time that evening, Cecilia Margaret experienced perfection as Stella's music enfolded her, supporting and enhancing her own, giving her an infinitesimal glimpse into the nature of her friend's true existence.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Cecilia Margaret recovered from the experience, she put her clarinet away and unsteadily walked upstairs to the second floor of her house. She opened one of the doors down the hallway from the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is one of my guest rooms,\" she said. \"You're welcome to it, if you want. Or,\" she said, grinning and with a twinkle in her eye, \"my bed is always warm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you,\" Stella said, easily discerning her friend's meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Well, there's a bathroom just through that door there\"--she indicated a door inside the room--\"fully stocked and all. Which reminds me: does the universe ever need to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know. I suppose this human body may, if I let it digest my food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, maybe you'd better not, then. I've got top-notch purification systems here, but I don't know if they could handle whatever parts of your food might seep out. I might just get that brain damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" and Stella removed all traces of her lunch and dinner from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Well, if you feel like it, the master bedroom is two doors that way on the right. Just come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret walked off and Stella entered the guest room, closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt opened again. \"Oh! Almost forgot. If you want to use the computers, go ahead. They're really advanced--you can't get that stuff in regular stores. They run just about everything. Just choose a username and password and it'll set up an account for you on my central server. If you want any games, other programs, whatever, just order them and don't worry about the cost. It'll fill in the details automatically. My folks never take too close a look at the bills.\" She grinned broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could not impose in that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I insist. I would do no less for any other guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella smiled. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret nodded and walked back to her bedroom, and Stella closed the door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the bathroom, she quickly took in everything there. She supposed any human would find it luxurious, but she simply envisioned herself clean, then shifted her clothes into comfortable pyjamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning on one of the computers, after a few seconds it prompted her. She chose \"universe\" as a username, smiling as she did, and for a password entered a random 107-character string which she easily committed to memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a closer look at it, she noticed its components were decaying very slowly as she used it, so she repaired the damage done to date and put the parts in a state of stasis, allowing them to function but preventing the negative effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found nothing of any immediate interest, and her thoughts wandered to Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the computer back to the login prompt and walked outside, making her clothes vanish as she went, feeling the night breeze on her bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, she banished the clouds, revealing a starry night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stars began to move, changing colour and brightness. As Stella commanded, they formed into a perfect image of Mike, looking as he had that morning. The model rotated, showing Stella her love from all sides. As it came back around, it smiled and waved. Stella waved back, then reached back in time and restored the stars and clouds to their original positions, leaving the vision as a memory for her and her alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned against the wall of the house, so lost in thoughts of Mike that she didn't notice the intruders until a spotlight was shining on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she came to her senses. She could hear talking and, through the darkness, see dark-clothed men with weapons surrounding the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nab her,\" she heard. \"We can have some fun with her later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then the other one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella, still naked, walked over to stand in front of the main entrance. Three men crept out of the darkness, muzzles pointed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said, \"but I cannot let you do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?\" said one of them incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warn you--leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the voice in the speaker's ear. \"Forget about the fun. Kill her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately three fully automatic weapons opened fire on Stella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the bullets hit her body, felt the blood pouring from her wounds, knew she should be blind from the shots to her eyes, mute from the ones through her throat, damaged from the ones through her brain, one of them taking half her scalp with it, and dead from the ones through her heart. She knew her lower jaw was half exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armed men advanced, still wary, expecting her to crumple any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did warn you. I am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men charged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, they vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella turned around and walked through the door of her friend's house, just in time to see Cecilia Margaret rush down the stairs, equally naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella hadn't looked at her friend's body, but suddenly realised just how attractive others might find it if she showed it off. Quickly sifting through her memories as an omniscient universe to determine her friend's usual attire, she determined that she hid her shape through a minimizer bra and baggy clothing, which were clearly quite effective at hiding her hourglass figure, large ass and huge breasts, and she supposed nobody knew that Cecilia Margaret went Brazilian. Her makeup, Stella realized, was designed to make her appear less attractive, as her natural beauty was stunning. Sensing a physical reaction from her human body, Stella deadened her sexual responses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? And what happened to you?\" she shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella looked down at herself, having forgotten to repair herself. With a thought she was as good as new. She held out a hand. \"Let me show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, Cecilia Margaret came down the rest of the stairs and took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the two found themselves looking down on Stella, outside the house, as she looked up and rearranged the night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really do love him, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I do. I hope he will love me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could make him love you. He'd never know the difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene progressed. \"You're the only human who will know that any of this happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret watched as the men appeared, as they planned to kidnap the two of them and rape, then kill, Stella, as they emptied their ammunition belts into Stella's body, and as Stella banished them with a thought and walked back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't kill them, or erase them from existence, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I did the same as I had with the stars--send them back where they came from, make it so that never happened--except for the physical evidence on me, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you give me a look inside their minds? I think I may know why they were here--above just kidnapping me--but I'd like to be sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella rewound the scene and put her friend in the mind of everyone present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry I cannot let you know more than my surface thoughts, but, and I mean no offense by this, to understand the thoughts of a universe, you must be a universe, and that is yet another thing beyond my power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take no offense at simple facts,\" Cecilia Margaret said, shrugging. \"Rather I am touched by the fact that, apart from Mike, my safety was foremost in your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter witnessing the scene again, the human found herself in her foyer again, releasing the other's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" she exclaimed. \"I knew my dad had a lot of enemies, but fuck it, I never thought they'd find me here. Dammit, that's why I took this place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of them managed to slip a tracking device in your backpack,\" Stella explained. \"I had hoped it would come to nothing, but that was clearly a vain hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, now I'll have to move. And only six months after getting here, dammit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you won't. I've altered the nature of this house. The only people who can even find it now are you, me, and anyone either of us allows to find it--as I cannot limit my own power, I must ask that you trust that I will not bring anyone who might wish you harm to this place--as well as anyone for whom it is necessary that they find it, so don't go abusing this gift to do anything illegal. Law enforcement officers will find it and you if I don't stop you first. But for anyone else, it will be as if it does not even exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret hugged her friend, whispering thanks in her ear. Letting go, she said, \"Thank you. I realise we are safe now, but the memories you gave me... I do not think I will sleep soundly tonight. Please. I beg you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella took her friend by the shoulders. \"Since I am responsible for your unease, I will comfort you this night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand in hand the two naked girls walked to Cecilia Margaret's bedroom, the human violently shaking her head when Stella gave them clothes, practically tearing hers off and attempting to do the same to Stella, who let her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sank into the bed, holding each other. Stella noted the time, and the time at which the alarm would sound. Slowing the universe, she held her friend, comforting her, allowing her the time to recover from what she had witnessed and come close to experiencing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stella stayed awake all through the night, maintaining a bubble in which she and Cecilia Margaret existed, a bubble outside of which time crawled. She slowed the human's aging processes, making her a few hours younger than she would have been had she aged at the rate at which her body then existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took hours for the nightmares Stella could sense in her friend's mind to subside. Once they had, Stella sent Cecilia Margaret into a deep, restful sleep, still cradling her, timing it so that she would be ready to awaken when her alarm went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun had not yet risen when it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret sprang awake. Stella pretended to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wake up! Don't tell me the universe gets tired. I know I'm not--I don't think I've ever had as good a rest as that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella faked a yawn and stretched. \"Mm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll be downstairs making breakfast once I've used the bathroom. You want some of mine or will you make your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll join you shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella heard a toilet flush and a tap running for a time. Tracking the human through the house, Stella waited until she was in the kitchen, then got up and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret stood at her stove, managing multiple pans, wearing nothing but a white apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout turning, she said, \"I've only just started, so if you want some it's no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you, but what are you making?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omelet, with bacon, four cheeses and various veggies. Yeah, I know it's not the healthiest thing, but after last night and with how I feel this morning, I figured I needed something tasty.\" Folding the omelet, she moved to a juicer and began squeezing a few large oranges, filling two glasses. The first she drank, while the second she put on the table before rushing back to check the stovetop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you don't have to go naked. I do because I find it more comfortable, especially here where nobody can see me--and especially now thanks to you--but I don't mind if you don't like it. If you want, I'll rush upstairs and get dressed. Normally I'd strip off as soon as I got home, but I wasn't sure how you'd take that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's okay. I already know--or can know, if I want to--everything about you, so it's not like you'd be hiding anything. As for me, well, I can look however I want, and besides, I could just wipe your memory of seeing me naked. I have no need for modesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you won't, will you? Nah, that's okay. If you do, you do. For all I know this is still lunchtime yesterday, and you've frozen time or something and are making me think all this is happening. Maybe I didn't have this body two days ago. Hell, maybe I didn't exist two days ago and you just made me up because you needed a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes,\" said Stella, \"I'm not entirely sure if I actually exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The universe, questioning its own existence in my kitchen? Well, all I know is that I can touch you, see you and hear you, and that I've seen you do impossible things. I'm as sure that you exist as I am sure that I exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, there is still one difference in the nature of our existences: I cannot cease to exist, but I can end yours with a thought. I could, should I want to, cause you to cease to have ever been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you could, but since there wouldn't be anything I could do about that, I'm not going to worry about it.\" She checked her omelet, then transferred it onto a waiting plate. Grabbing some cutlery, she asked, \"Will you join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella followed Cecilia Margaret, who had thrown her apron onto a low chair, into her dining room, causing an identical meal to appear on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human eyed it a bit hungrily. \"Can I try some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want. It is not like what I made yesterday, though, but is rather an exact copy of what you made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I'd like to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella cut off a piece and Cecilia Margaret reached over and stuck her fork in it, Stella's powers this time being not forthcoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, an exact replica. I can't tell the difference. Here, see what you think,\" and this time after the human cut off a slice of her meal, it floated through the air to alight on Stella's plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! I wonder what that feels like for the omelet,\" and with those words, Cecilia Margaret found herself hovering in midair, moving around the table before settling back in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! If you're doing all this for me, I can only imagine what you'll do with Mike once he accepts you for who you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to share my existence with him, but I cannot, not fully, but he will experience as much as I can allow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret finished her omelet, while Stella simply made hers vanish. Walking to her sink where her pans were soaking, the human quickly washed her dishes and put them on her drain rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her stove clock. \"Okay, right on schedule. Just a few more things to do and then it's off to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran upstairs, leaving Stella waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella's thoughts wandered to Mike again, and she caused an apparition of him to appear, one so solid she could reach out and touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you,\" she whispered in her creation's ear, but it did not respond, because Stella knew its words would be hollow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe banished the vision as she sensed her friend leave her room. Walking down the stairs, Cecilia Margaret moved toward another door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing nothing but a strapless bra that exaggerated her breasts and skimpy panties, she opened it to reveal an electric dune buggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, hop in! You might want to wear something, though, just in case we run into someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella shrugged and made clothing appear on her, identical to Cecilia Margaret's but sized for her own, less spectacular proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove out of the garage, the human asked, \"So this whole 'hidden house' thing, how does it work when we leave the area where you've put your spell, for lack of a better term?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll seem to have come out of nowhere, but anybody who sees it won't think anything of it. They won't be curious or anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret whistled. \"And you just set that all up with a thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella shrugged. \"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep asking things you could well just know,\" the human laughed. \"But we're going to check my mailbox. It's not far, not in this thing anyway. There's maybe ten houses there, and the mail's always delivered really early. My folks might have enemies, but they've also got connections. The others haven't figured out just how early the mail comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's delivered right to this box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've got an apartment in the city. I almost never go there, but it's my official address as far as almost anyone else knows. It all gets forwarded here, but like I said, my folks have connections, so that information's kept under serious security by the postal service. They do background checks and everything on anyone who might be in a position to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the boxes, and Cecilia Margaret punched in a combination to open hers. Reaching inside the spacious box, she removed three newspapers and a few envelopes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you want to drive? I've never had the chance to look at my mail en route.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella found the vehicle easy to operate and soon returned to her friend's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter parking the buggy and plugging it back in to recharge, Stella followed Cecilia Margaret back to her dining room, where she was taking a final look over her mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything interesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Nothing about your little trick with the stars last night, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there shouldn't be. It never happened, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other than that, not much. Junk mail. Bills and statements always come at different times, though--my folks pay them but I get copies. Apparently I managed to run up over two thousand dollars on one credit card last month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that typical?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's a bit on the high end. I need to check my randomization algorithms, see why it was using that card that often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can fix that for you, if you want. I could make it truly random.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, if you want. Just remember that sometimes randomness gives you long strings of the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. But at least this way I'll know there's nothing biased about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella waved a hand unnecessarily. \"It's done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFolding her paper, Cecilia Margaret hopped up from her seat and went upstairs. Stella, knowing how much time remained before the bus arrived, made clothes and makeup appear on herself, and pulled her backpack and books from the nothingness to which she had consigned them the previous evening. Soon after her friend appeared, dressed in loose clothing to hide her figure, makeup as it was the day before, diminishing her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, shall we walk or will you just take us there in a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'd rather walk,\" said the universe. \"I feel like I could use one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the front door still locked, Stella pulled Cecilia Margaret to her from the foot of the stairs, turned and walked through the door, pulling the human after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Stella and Cecilia Margaret walked to where the school bus would stop, Stella amused herself and her companion by showing off some of her powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrees flashed through a year's cycle in seconds as they passed, leaves turning from green, to red and gold, then to a brittle brown, before falling off entirely and regrowing. The weather changed, variously becoming bright and sunny, overcast, rainy (the two sheltered under huge umbrellas the universe created for the occasion) and snowy (on which the human found she could walk without leaving a mark). Stella even changed their clothing, making them nude, or in bra and panties, or more typical teenage clothing, or even in formal evening wear, backless, strapless V-neck dresses showing both Cecilia Margaret's prodigious cleavage and that which Stella had given herself for the occasion, open to the waist, going down only as far as a microskirt, held up by nothing other than the universe's will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" said the human as they walked in the dresses, their outfits complete with three-inch heels clicking on the runway which Stella had made of the packed dirt path, \"if I showed up like this, or if you did, well, the school has a mild dress code for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but here where nobody can see us, it's fun, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly Stella reverted all her alterations and grabbed her friend's hand. \"Run,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bus is early and even then we've been going a bit slowly. Run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret realized the world was blurring around her, seeming almost at a standstill, yet she felt unaffected as Stella led her on a direct route, rather than the meandering one the path took. They dashed right through flowers and trees, leaving no sign of their passage until they reached the short stretch of tall grass separating the wooded area from the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How fast did we just go?\" asked the human, looking at her watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not fast,\" replied Stella as she trudged through the grass, trampling it underfoot. \"The bus was about five minutes away, and at our pace we were around fifteen. I know you like to get there with a few minutes to spare, and we'll have four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four? But I know that it takes about a minute to get through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Cecilia Margaret. You're the first human to have travelled faster than light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... relativity? All that stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Physical laws that I made. They hold because I want them to hold, and right then, I didn't want them to hold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about last night? I could've sworn I slept for hours, at any rate way longer than the time when we went to sleep and when my alarm went off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can manipulate time as easily as anything else, so I simply slowed the universe for everyone but us. You needed the time to recover--I couldn't help but pick up on your nightmares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an older sister, Ursula Catherine, after my mother and her mother, two years my elder. Like me, my parents gave her a place, but she chose one in a small town. That same group that came for me came for her and got her, after only three months. When my father paid the demanded ransom, well, are you familiar with <i>Titus Andronicus</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bloody play. How much did they cut off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost too much. She's not a pretty sight. She can communicate, but only by exhaling through her nose in Morse code. My father got experts in to install a machine that would translate that into some sort of speech. She was going to be a teacher-librarian, and was already volunteering at her town's elementary school. She loved kids.\" Cecilia Margaret reached into her small change purse and took out a photograph. \"This was her at my age, the day she moved out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears formed in Stella's eyes. \"She was beautiful.\" She returned the picture as the bus came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two took seats near the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me,\" began the human, \"what makes Mike--\" She was cut off by her phone buzzing. Taking it out of her pocket, she glanced at it, then put it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later. Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence reigned between the two for a short while as the bus trundled along the back roads leading away from the wood with Cecilia Margaret's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you want to meet some of my friends after school today? We're in a club and today's one of our meeting days. Thankfully there's a late bus. Of course, if you'd rather go back to my place I guess I couldn't stop you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hopefully Mike will be ready to talk with me\"--Stella couldn't help but catch a short flash of emotion across her friend's face--\"but if he's not, yeah, I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as anyone but the two knew, the rest of the bus ride passed uneventfully, but Stella and Cecilia Margaret, looking to all the world to be engaged in close, quiet conversation, laughed uproariously as Stella manipulated reality within the bus, not doing anything malicious and ensuring that nobody remembered matters as being anything but utterly normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella continued to project an image of normality as the two disembarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when you...\" Cecilia Margaret cut herself off laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then you just walked up...\" Stella joined her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never had that much fun before,\" admitted the universe when they were about to enter the school building. \"I've always taken my role seriously and had never thought about the fact that I can do anything I want and just reverse it all. Still, it's something that I don't think I'll do too often. Getting used to it would take some of the joy out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two parted ways to go to their lockers, and then Stella made her way to her first class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella had arranged her schedule to share every class with her love, and all through the morning she saw only an empty seat where he should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few times her teachers asked her to answer a question she gave a correct answer, revealing reasonable but not excessive knowledge of the subject in question, and otherwise sat quietly, her conscious thoughts flitting between Mike, Cecilia Margaret and her friends, Ursula Catherine Voclain, the events of the previous night, and she had to pause time on a few occasions when she couldn't resist laughing about the bus ride that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the cafeteria, she entered as she saw Cecilia Margaret pay for some food and head for a table in the corner, where Stella joined her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought cafeteria food generally sucked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually it does, yeah, so normally I just buy a bowl of soup. But they do make a good jambalaya, so I always get that when they've got it. You want to try some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella smiled and made her own appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway, about Mike--apart from the fact that you love him, what makes him so special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella took another bite before answering. \"In almost everyone, there is some sort of darkness, some weakness through which they can be tempted to do harm. When I told you that I want nothing for the best for everything in me, that is quite true. I have no darkness myself. That is why I would not kill that one girl, not even though we both knew I could eliminate the death from reality. Mike... Mike seemed impossible. But I watched him for a time and he is like me. He is pure good. He knew, I suppose, that Lauren would probably do something unpleasant to him, yet he stayed and tried to help, where most would flee or even try to fight. That is why I love him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are almost unblemished, but you are greedy. You were born to money and will do anything to remain rich. It can make you successful, and I can sense that you may become a great philanthropist, but if you are not careful it can overcome you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I will remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was in that message, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, later. Please, just trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella acquiesced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer afternoon classes passed much as her morning ones had. She stayed quiet, answered questions put to her and wondered why Mike wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret was waiting for her when she went to her locker to keep up appearances. \"So, ready to meet my friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just lead the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human walked toward a back area of the school, coming to an unremarkable door in a corner.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Cecilia Margaret's hand reached for the handle, she heard Stella's voice in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't mention who I am. If you want to talk about the sorts of things I can do, just think. I'll know which thoughts you want me to hear and which you don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" the human thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CM!\" exclaimed one of the people in the room as she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Owen,\" she replied. \"Stella, this is Owen, and that's Vincent, Robert and Alan. Everyone, this is Stella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" said Stella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervous looks passed among the others in the room. \"So, uh, CM, uh, do you wanna tell her or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you should tell her, Owen,\" said Cecilia Margaret, while at the same time thinking, \"Don't do anything rash, Stella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella stood quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, CM told us what happened with, uh, Mike. Lauren likes to pick on us, too, see, so we, uh, have our ways of keeping an eye on him. Anyway, uh, yesterday after school Lauren and his gang, uh, jumped Mike. He's in hospital now. He'll recover, but, uh, it'll take a while from what I heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know why he attacked Mike?\" Stella asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, apparently Lauren said something about sending a message to 'your bitch of a girlfriend.' You must've pissed him off--well, not that it takes much to get Lauren pissed off. He's pretty much always pissed off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do anything rash, Stella,\" Cecilia Margaret warned mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly everything froze except for the two women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella staggered over to her friend and sobbed on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiped her eyes after a few minutes and managed, \"Don't you see? I caused this, I've got to fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you didn't cause any of this. Look, Mike was pretty damn frightened of you. How do you think he'll feel now? Right now you've got to let him heal. Maybe he'll think about yesterday some more, come to terms with what he saw you do. But going there now might just scare him even more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you knew that a baby would become a mass murderer when it grew up, could you kill that baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forget--I've known that before, and no, I couldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, bad question. But here's the thing: Lauren's going to keep doing stuff like this. It's just who he is. If you want to help Mike in some way, help get Lauren out of the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't. I am sorry, but I cannot. And how would that help Mike? It wouldn't heal his wounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Lauren will just let this go at that? You're one of the prettiest girls in school, Stella, and he's pretty possessive when it comes to the pretty ones. He sees them like his personal turf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not doing that. Not with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you might have to be possessive yourself when it comes to Mike. Lauren's done worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella sniffled a bit, wiped her nose, then changed topics. \"So what is this club, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've seen my collection, you should know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Is this the regular kind or the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all legal here. It's all kinds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're going to be watching...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. We'd get kicked out pretty fast if we watched some of that stuff here. No, that's generally something we do at Robert's place. He lives in the city, only one of them to have his own place. That's not tonight, though, generally weekends. Owen comes by to pick me up--not all the way to my place, of course, I've got a number of routes out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. I'm not sure I'd enjoy those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think you would. Don't think I didn't see your reaction to me last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My reaction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that human body is already affecting you in ways you didn't anticipate. Sure, you might not need to eat, or drink, or sleep, or anything like that, but other things, I think there are some things about being human that you just can't avoid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that. Yeah, I noticed your reaction, too--but then, you were having those feelings well before then. Yeah, I switched that off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you turned it back on, you'd be having those feelings too now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella took her friend's hands. \"Cecilia Margaret, I will not say that it will happen, only that if it does, it will not be with anyone other than you--and yes, I sensed that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I take it those feelings I sense from them are why you dress that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Them and Lauren, yeah. Lauren doesn't know just how hot I am, thankfully, while these four are going to be turned on by just about any woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you love Owen, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yeah, I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella returned herself and Cecilia Margaret to their original positions, removing all evidence of what had transpired in the prolonged instant, then unfroze time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the next two hours watching various things, laughing, recoiling, gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the subtitles?\" Stella thought. \"Given your shared interest in these things, I would've thought you'd have no need for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they're not fluent. I am. Honestly I'd rather not have the subtitles, but they need them, so I just try to ignore them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe late bus was almost empty, and the only other people got off when it was still ten minutes away from where Cecilia Margaret disembarked. Stella did nothing remarkable the whole way back, rather staying silent. Cecilia Margaret read, even on the walk, her feet knowing the path perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she knew she was near her house, she put the book away and looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was greeted by a glorious vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella stood there in a glowing white robe, huge wings spreading from her back, hair done up intricately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Cecilia Margaret saw not only her friend, but herself from Stella's vantage, and gasped as she saw and felt a similar transformation overtake her. A glow shone from her face, concealing her identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" she asked in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a form I like to take from time to time. I believe you'd call it an angel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because there is someone I can help,\" and with that Stella soared into the sky, Cecilia Margaret finding it easy to follow, unsure whether she was moving by her own will or by Stella's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a time the human recognized the landscape. \"Hey, this is my parents' place! Won't they recognize me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they won't. And we're not here to visit your parents. There is someone here who needs help only I can give.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella soared into the house, Cecilia Margaret easily following through the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came to rest in front of what was once a beautiful young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula Catherine Voclain had been beautiful, once. But her captors had raped her, forced her into obscene acts, and before the ransom came, mutilated her. Only her torso and head remained, but her genitalia had been mutilated, her ability to have children destroyed. Her breasts had been cut off, as had her arms and ears. She had no eyelids, and her mouth was painfully sewn tightly shut--and even so, her larynx had been highly damaged, leaving her mute. Her hair had been burned from her head, while multiple piercings through her nose held it painfully open. Communication was difficult at best, especially since her eardrums had been destroyed, requiring speakers to type responses into the computer she used to communicate, which then tapped a pattern in Morse code on her left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret watched in wonder as Stella's power enfolded her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was done, a young, beautiful woman of twenty stood in front of her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella and her friend hovered well above the house, the human able to see inside courtesy of the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll call what you did a miracle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As they've called other such things I've done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much does she remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of it. She will need counselling, but I have ensured that it will not haunt her as it has been these past years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" and in midair, unseen by the rest of reality, the two angels embraced as the universe turned around them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stella held Cecilia Margaret in midair as the human sobbed tears of gratitude, eventually managing to say, \"Please, take me home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant the two were standing in the foyer of Cecilia Margaret's house, looking fully human once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret's eyes were red, and she winced as she rubbed at them. \"Give me a sec, will you?\" Stella nodded, and Cecilia Margaret ran upstairs. Stella heard a door open, a bag drop, and a tap begin to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caused a vision of Mike's hospital room to appear in front of her. Noting the extent of his injuries--including a tiny fracture in his pelvis that the doctors had missed--she caused the scene to switch to Lauren and his goons beating up Mike. She knew Cecilia Margaret wouldn't be long, so she watched it at a highly accelerated rate, repeatedly, from different angles and viewpoints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she heard feet padding down the upstairs hallway to the stairs, she caused the scene to vanish. Cecilia Margaret came down the stairs, looking radiant with her makeup washed off, but on seeing Stella said, \"If I didn't know better, right now I'd say you're furious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am furious,\" said Stella simply, \"but there's a huge difference between being furious and acting on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret looked where Stella was looking, and though there was nothing there, said, \"You were watching Lauren beat up Mike, weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How--?\" Stella didn't have to finish her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not hard to guess. You're in love, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret walked past her guest into her kitchen and opened her fridge, then closed it after a few seconds. She walked back into the foyer toward her TV room, saying, \"How about we watch something? I don't know Mike that well, but I do know that he and I share a few common interests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella replied, \"Aren't you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Which is strange, since I always eat dinner around this time, so I'm always hungry around this time.\" Cecilia Margaret shrugged. \"I'll have something later and get myself back on track tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella walked swiftly to catch up with her host. \"Actually, you won't. I didn't realize it until just now, but you'll never be hungry again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly that. You'll never need to eat or drink again. For that matter, if you do eat or drink, you'll metabolize all of it perfectly and almost instantly, you'll never need to sleep again, any injuries you suffer will heal almost instantly, and your aging is drastically slowed.\" Stella shook her head. \"I should have seen this coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Did you do something to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, but I didn't intend this. You know how I've been showing off all the things I can do, making food appear out of nothing, messing with time, isolating this house, moving you faster than light and turning you into an angel? That's why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella made a bed with a foam mattress appear in the foyer. \"See, there's two parts to me. There's my body, which is the universe, and there's me, which is my consciousness. The mattress is sort of like my body. I can press it\"--Stella placed a hand on the mattress, causing an indentation--\"but it springs back to a natural ground state, if you will. I can hold it out of that state, but that requires a constant--though minuscule--effort. For instance, I don't so much as enforce the rule that nothing can move faster than light as I just don't break it. Things work better, and need less conscious intervention from me, if nothing with mass can move faster than light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you made me move faster than light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, and I also altered time around you and let you pass through solid objects. I am sorry, but it was simply easier to change your physiology to the extent necessary than it was to make you an exception to the basic laws of the universe. If I had done the latter, I would have to constantly maintain the exception or the recoil--should I ever let my concentration slip--could erase you from existence. Changing you so that those laws apply differently to you meant that I would not risk that, but as with everything, there are side effects.\" Stella paused. \"The difference would be undetectable by your medical science, but you're not, technically, human any more, and changing you back would mean that any lingering effects of what I've done with you would hit and I would have to begin maintaining the exception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret looked at Stella as the bed vanished, then said, \"So just how slow will I age now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I be mad? I mean, I guess I can't have kids now--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you can have children, and they will be normal humans. Your ova are unaffected and your body will not see them as foreign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so, some people would say that that's enough to make me human--my kids will be--but meanwhile I get to enjoy eating anything I want, whenever I want, I basically can't get hurt and I'll live for a pretty long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just a 'pretty long time,' Cecilia Margaret. By your calendar you'll age at a rate of about a microsecond every googolplex years. You'll look just as you do now while your kids, and their kids, and your friends, and any other friends you make grow old and die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Mike? Or Ursula Catherine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister was simply the beneficiary of a temporary radical change to her body's natural healing ability. As for Mike, I did walk through a wall with him, but that was not enough to necessitate a permanent change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, anyway, I imagine. So I'll always have the two of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait, you said a googolplex years. Will you actually exist that long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember ever not existing, or coming into existence, and my memory goes back much, much farther than a mere googolplex years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what happens when the sun expands and swallows this planet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can exist in those conditions, but not much more than that. I promise that you will not be on this planet when it is ultimately destroyed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret hugged Stella, then changed the subject. \"So, as I was saying, want to watch something? Like I said, I know a bit about what Mike enjoys. We were partners on a project two years ago and while we mostly talked shop, I did find out a few things about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather watch those with him, actually. Let's watch something you enjoy.\" Stella walked past Cecilia Margaret into the TV room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret followed, then stopped in her tracks when she saw her shelves. \"What are these?\" she asked, indicating the small triangular objects stacked neatly on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gift,\" said Stella. \"Every TV show or movie ever made, in its entirety. The storage medium is far in advance of anything you've developed, so they're useless to anyone else. Just look at them--you can tell what's on each--then think about which one you want.

It's a little gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia Margaret found the system completely intuitive and half a minute later, she was relaxing in her favourite chair. \"If you don't like it,\" she said, \"just tell me and I'll switch to something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn greeted the two women still watching TV. \"Cecilia Margaret?\" said Stella. \"We've got school today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, yeah, well, thankfully that episode's over.\" She looked suspiciously at Stella. \"That was good timing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella smiled and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV turned off and Cecilia Margaret walked into her foyer, toward her garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" said Stella. \"Don't go out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? I'm just checking my mail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is,\" said Stella, handing over a few pieces of junk mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but why shouldn't I go out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't go out that way. You mentioned that the postal workers who delivered your mail had background checks done? Apparently those aren't good enough because someone found out where your mailbox was and left a little surprise.\" A land mine appeared in Stella's hands, clearly having been buried until a few seconds prior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" said Cecilia Margaret, jumping in shock. \"I thought--\" She couldn't finish the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did I, but it seems you--or your family, at least--have more enemies than you realized. You would've survived the blast, of course, but if it had gone off, it would have leveled everything else for a few miles around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell put that there? If I ever get my hands on that bastard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, which is why I'm not going to tell you. Suffice it to say that they will only get bolder. Don't worry, I've made sure they can't affect the school bus or the school, and your mail will appear in your bedroom each morning henceforth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thank you. Still puts a damper on my social life, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that. I'm monitoring you and your surroundings constantly now, so anyone you're with will be perfectly safe. I promise you that nothing like that can ever happen again, at least not by your family's enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So no world peace just by flying around to all the war zones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, on another note,\" said Cecilia Margaret, \"do you want to stay with me until Mike's out of the hospital or will you get a place of your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather stay here, if that's fine with you. I want to make sure there aren't any other side effects of what I've done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Cecilia Margaret walked toward the stairs. \"Back in a bit.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The year is 3512 AD, and Earth's once-chaotic society has developed into a peaceful utopia. It was all thanks to the help of two goddesses, Mayu and Yumi. They descended upon Earth in secret during the year 2012, and from the day they arrived they subtly guided society down the proper path. With there help and guidance, all the nations of Earth began to work together toward a mutual goal for the first time in human history. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long and bumpy road, but everyone on Earth agreed that the end result was nothing short of a perfect society. In honor of the twin goddesses who allowed this utopia to become reality, the people of Earth erected a massive statue in their likeness. This monument now stands at the core the new Central Hub City (CHC), where people from all nations are able to meet together at any time. This city and the statue at its core are the symbols that all humans have moved past their petty differences, and now live together as equals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayu and Yumi floated above CHC with smiles on their faces as they gazed down at the humans going about their daily business. They then looked over to the 50 foot tall golden statue in the middle of the city, depicting two young 13 year old girls standing atop a pedestal and holding hands. They each had a ponytail on one side of their head, and were clothed in robes that resembled ancient Greek togas. The duo of goddesses simply giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These humans sure have come a long way since we first came here, haven't they Yumi?\" Mayu, the one with red hair and a ponytail on the right side of her head, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mayu, they certainly have. It's hard to believe that we're looking at the same species that once waged pointless and self-destructive wars against itself in ages past.\" Yumi, the blue haired one with a ponytail on the left side of her head, replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, there are still those few fools who distrust us in spite of all we have done for their race... It's honestly quite depressing that some humans still think of us as 'demons who manipulated the minds of the masses into bending to our will', or something like that...\" Mayu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's only to be expected that not everyone will be willing to trust our intentions. After all, we are a pair of immortal beings that resemble human children, yet we have powers beyond their imaginations. We appeared on their planet out of nowhere and began advising their society's leaders in order to bring about this peaceful utopia. They simply don't understand us, and it is in their nature to fear that which they do not understand.\" Yumi answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Yeah, I suppose you have a point there... Still, you'd think that by now they'd realize that we're only interested in helping them. Oh well, at least the vast majority have accepted us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. And I think that we have done enough on this planet by now. It certainly took a while, but we have finally taught them how to work together and live in peace. I think that we can finally return home now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayu simply nodded to her sister, and the two began to descend toward the ground. As the duo landed, a passing human boy accidentally bumped into the twins and knocked them down. They both landed on the ground with a thud, and they bonked their heads together in the process. The boy also fell onto his rear, and was dazed for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owch, what was that?\" Mayu whined as she rubbed her head in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we might have decided to land right where this human boy was walking, and he didn't notice us in time.\" Yumi responded, also rubbing her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point the boy, who Mayu and Yumi assumed to be about 17 years old, had gotten back to his feet. Reaching down, he offered his hands to help the sisters stand back up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry, girls. I wasn't watching were I was going at all...\" The boy said in a flustered and embarrassed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's quite alright young man. We should have been more careful with where we landed as well.\" Yumi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well... Wait a minute, are you two who I think you are?!\" The boy said as he suddenly realized the identity of the two girls he had just collided with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! We're the lovely twin goddesses, Mayu and Yumi! And you are?\" Mayu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... My name is Marcus... It's, uh, very nice to meet you two in person...\" The boy said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a pleasure to meet you too, Marcus. Now if you don't mind, my sister and I have somewhere we need to be.\" Yumi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay... Well, see ya later then...\" Marcus said, sounding slightly disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayu and Yumi simply giggled and walked away, waving goodbye to Marcus as they went. However, as they parted ways, the goddess twins both started to feel a light and fluffy sensation in their chests. Looking at eachother, they saw that both of them were beginning to blush brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on, Yumi? What is this weird feeling?\" Mayu asked her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not quite sure... Could this be that thing that humans refer to as 'love'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Yeah, I think you're right... That guy Marcus was really nice to us, and he didn't really treat us any differently after finding out who we were. I think that I might like him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed... He certainly had many positive qualities, and he was also quite cute, if I do say so myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do, sis? Is okay that we've both fallen in love with the same person? How are we going to make this work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do have one idea... How about we...\"</span></div></div>",

Well, let's get started then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls nodded in agreement before teleporting back to the home that had been built for them. In the privacy of their own home, Mayu and Yumi began to put their plan into action. Standing next to eachother, the twins clasped their hands together and began to glow with a brilliant light. As the two sisters disappeared within the cocoon of cocoon of light, they began to concentrate on imagining what they wanted their new body to look like. After several minutes had passed, the light faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayu and Yumi had disappeared, and in their place stood a new figure of incomparable beauty. She had long purple hair that flowed all the way down to her waist, and her figure was a picture of perfection. She had large and perfectly round breasts that seemed to fit her chest flawlessly; they were big, but they weren't too big. Her plump rear was perfectly formed, and her long slender arms and legs would have made any supermodel in the world jealous. She had just the right balance of fat and muscle, with all of her fat being located in the ideal positions of her breasts and her butt. Everything about her body was flawless, with everything being in just the right proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mischievous smile forming on her beautiful face, this new being spoke out in a voice that was just as beautiful as the woman it belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright world, meet your new perfect goddess! You can call me Mayumi.\" She said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe personalities of both Mayu and Yumi shared equal control over the new body. As a result, Mayumi's personality was somewhere in between that of the energetic &amp; playful Mayu and the calm &amp; polite Yumi. Inside of her mind, the two goddesses talked about what they should do next for a moment before deciding to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quite simple really, two omnipotent goddesses could easily 'scan' (For lack of better word) someone to see what they were like. Marcus was perfect for them. Calm, kind, polite, yet also energetic and always looking for a good time. \"Marcus.\" Mayumi said softly as he turned around. Marcus's eyes would have shot out of his head if it were a cartoon. Followed by the whole cat call and all the hearts and the floating to the girl of his dreams. The purple hair, and a long blue dress that reached to her ankles with some fine heels. It reminded him of the two goddesses her just saw but...well grown up. He quickly realized he was staring and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry! Did you call my name Miss?\" He asked still unable to believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I did.\" Mayumi said.

Er I mean uh...\" He worried he was coming on too strong Marcus didn't want to mess this up. Mayumi however gracefully walked up to him and took his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes me so happy!!\" She grinned. With a mere thought the goddess filled his wallet with money. Mayumi also did a slight bit of warping Marcus's mind making the money known to him. He had gotten a MAJOR gift from his Grandmother recently, simple reality manipulation from the goddess. \"So...where shall we go Marcus?\" Mayumi decided to help him along, he was obviously nervous, fairly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could go to the park for a nice walk or perhaps...a decent restaurant maybe?\"</span></div></div>",
