Often called Spirit because of his tendency to \"appear\" out of thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: 5'11\" blue/grey eyes, slim yet toned. He usually wears a red t-shirt under a white trench coat with black trim, or vise versa with dark jeans and black nikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers: do to his digimon half, Spirit has more rightfully gained his nickname because he had complete control of shadows in all evolutions in one way or another. N his human form, he can appear and disappear, as well has shape shadows into solid objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Zack is an outcast that likes to work on his own. He will rarely work with a group, if he does, it's with a small group of at most three others. His parents were killed in a digimon related accident, a metalgreymon was rampaging through his town, the local Tamers were able to delete him, but not before he blow up the car that his parents were in trying to escape in. At least they died instantly. Ever since the incident, Spirit has been a bit of a wanderer and Mercenary of sorts for any Digi related problems. Three years later, he was kidnapped and experimented on, soon becoming a digimon/human hybrid. His other half was classified as the Dracovolf sequence. After years of pain and suffering, he went berserk and killed all the scientists and executives, making sure to stop and pluck the list of abroad executives and followers from the the hands of a dead lab manager. Nowadays, he is still going around  as a merc, but is starting to get lonly in his pursuits. Which of these lovely males (yes, it's going to be a gay story, fuck off if you don't like it) is going to help him out and, just maybe, get him to open up?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>((A bit of backstory on the world. In this version of the Digimon world, it is fairly common to see digimon out in the open in the human world. They have become widely accepted and common part of modern society, there are also known digimon/human relationships past tamer and partner, quite common in fact, even married couples as such, though same gender couples are still a bit....tenuous amount the common population. Anyway, the digital world is not open to the humans because of the massive danger, except for tamers or hybrids, the sons/daughters of digimon/human couples, or in spirit's case, experiments. Hybrids usually know they are such from birth and are taught how to control their power and evolutions, they also  are able to become tamers. Some hybrids prefer to stay in their digimon form, so you see more then you think you do, as well as become partners with either humans or digimon. Anyway, back to the story!))<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late, 11:00 at night in the middle of summer. Zack is in the woods next to a small town, sleeping up on a high tree branch. His sleep was plagued with whimpers and Cry's as tears streamed down his face as he called for help silently, repeating \"please no! Let me go!\" Over and over again as he twisted and nearly fell from the branch, only on instinct to shoot out a shadow tendril from his back and wraps around the tree branch, keeping him in place. In his dreams he was replaying the horrid events years before, all the way from his parents dieing all the way to his escape from Xeno Corp, the company that kidnapped him and turned him into a hybrid. In his stupor of nightmares, he did not notice the figure swiftly approaching....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~&lt;(POV Flame)&gt;~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamedramon, or Flame as his friends called him, was your ordinary digimon, come to the human world to explore and see the sights. He was unique for he had all three armor eggs in his possession, able to use them at any given time, but he always preferred his flamedramon form. His reasoning was, it was powerful, fast, and sexy as fuck wrapped up into one. He was a strong fighter, but not unstoppable, he has his fair share of battle scares, the most visible of which is a gash in his helmet over his left eyes, thankfully the blade that caused it missed his eyes, but he got a scar over his eyes from it. The Digi felt like a late night stroll through the woods when he heard something that made him stop in his tracks. In the distance, his keen hearing could hear someone crying, then he heard a voice say \"Please no! Let me go!\" He sprang I to action and ran toward that voice, bounding between trees and over obstacles with practiced ease. He finally stopped under a large oak tree, the wind ruffled the leaves, be he could here it, very faintly, but it was there, a whimper and sobs coming from high up in the tree. He frowned and kept up into the tree, nimbly making his way up the tree until he alighted on a branch next to a teen asleep. He was crying and making silent plees for help. The boy was wearing a red t-shirt, black jeans and a black trench coat with white trim, he was pale, but extremely white, his build was lean from what the lizard could see. Concerned for the boy, he reached out and gently shook his shoulder, only for his wrist to be grabbed. He yelped in surprise and looked to see the boy's hand tightly grasping his wrist, he then looked at his face and found his eyes on. The blue/grey eyes stared at the Digi for a few second before he makes his move. The boy....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What are you doing here?\" Spirit asked as he narrowed his eyes at the flamedramon. The started digimon could only stare right back into the eyes of the boy, the cold suspicion apparent in them chilling him to his fiery core, but under that, he could see deep down the hurried pain the pain the boy has hidden. Flame gulped and decomposed himself, trying to pull his wrist free from the kid's iron grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you say 'Please no! Let me go!' So naturally I came to see if you were ok, only to find you asleep up in this tree crying. When I shook your shoulder, well you know from there, and could you let go of my wrist please?\" Flame asked before Spirit let him go in shock. The 'mon took off his gauntlet to flex the blue five-fingered hand, though the underside was as white as his stomach. He flexed and twisted his wrist a bit, hearing a few pops and cracks before replacing his gauntlet. He looked back at the kid and cock an eye ridge at his surprised expression. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you heard that? N-n-no, tell me you didn't you didn't just say you heard that!\" The teen shoot up and started to freak out a bit. \"Fuck fuck fuck! If the wrong person hears about this, my plans are ruined! They'll go underground I won't be able to find them for years!\" All through he freak out, he was pacing along the branch with perfect balance. He spun around a stalked over to the dumbfounded digimon, grabbing him by the shirt and pulled his face close, glaring deep into those admittedly gorgeous red eyes. \"Don't you dare ever tell another living soul you saw me, and heard me say that of all things!\" He released the lizard like Digi and sighed, leaning against the tree trunk. Flame stood there for a moment, bewildered by the sudden outburst, he then turned to the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um ok, but I don't even know know you are, or who I would tell. But can I ask what you were dreaming about? It seems like your the type of guy that doesn't break easily. My name is Flamedramon by the way, but my friends call me Flame.\" He took off his gauntlet and help out a hand toward him. Spirit looked up and shook the 'mon's clawed hand, likening the feeling for his slightly rough hand for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack, but most people call me Spirit\" he yawned and checked his watch, seeing that it was midnight. \"Fuck, I got to go back to sleep.\" He squirmed around a bit in place and tried to get comfortable again, failing horribly. \"God damn it....\" Flame smiled and gave a chuckle at the kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human family I'm friends with was kind enough to give me a cabin to live in when ever I'm here in the human world. If you like, you can come and stay with me. There's one bed, but I'll sleep on the couch, I get the feeling that you haven't slept in a proper bed in a while\" he chuckled again as the kid shot up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd do that for me? You literally just met me, and I haven't exactly been nice.\" Zack said, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not? You might be surprised, but I believe in what you humans call Karma, plus, someone your age shouldn't be sleeping outside. How old are you anyway? 16? 17?\" Flame asked, cock his head light out of habit as he tail swished slowly behind him in contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"18, and I'm not exactly human. It'd be closer to call me one of the hybrids. Anyway, as for your offer, I'll....\"</span></div></div>",

Zack looked up at the lightly shocked mon and motioned for him to lead the way. \"Lead the way, lizard-boy\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm... Ok. Do you want me to carry you or something? You can't seriously keep up with me can you?\" Asked the still lightly bewildered Flamedramon. All he received was a cocked brow before the teen leap from the tree with amazing grace, flipped once and landed lightly on the top of a neighboring tree. He looked back at the Mon and grinned. If he wasn't blown away before, he was now. The mon was slack jawed as he saw the practiced grace the supposed hybrid showed, thinking he has to be half Renamon. Flame blushed as he caught himself staring at the silhouetted form of the teen against the moon, both intimidating and beautiful. \"W-well I guess that answers that question. Let's go\" He leapt into the air and flew past the teen, who followed easily, seeming not to be extering himself what so ever. They continue in silence for a few minutes until Zack spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Flame, so what are you doing in the human world?\" Zack asked as he flipped around a tree top, grabbing it to swing horizontally around it. He landed on the next tree and looked at Flame. He gave a smile and perched upon a tree himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I came over this time to visit a friend with a permanent residence here. And to see the sights! I mean your world is a beautiful place, full of activity too, can't go anywhere in this world as a digimon without seeing something extraordinary.\" He chuckled as he looked up to the sky, scarlet eyes gleaming in the moon light. \"Even the sky is breathe taking... All those stars and that incredable moon, all wonders of your world....\" He turned to the teen and gave him a solemn look. \"Even the human species is a wonder. One species, but so many variations of personality and looks. It is simply amazing. And that, my friend, is why I'm here in the human world.\" The teen went wide eyed and nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....guess your right. I never really noticed that beauty of world, being so used to it, I took it for granted.\" He said, looking at the moon for a few moments, recalecting his past life before IT happened. He sighed and looked back to the Mon. \"Come on, let's get going.\" He said before continuing in the general direction they had been traveling, followed close by Flame. After about a half hour of tree jumping. They landed in front of a moderately sized two-story wooden cadin. The classic loughs starched perfectly  with a modest porch and large bay window. They waked up the steps and Flame grabbed a key from under the door mat (yeah yeah yeah, I know, how original lol) and unlocked the door. Upon entrance, the removed his boots and set them aside, followed by Zack. The inside was every traditional and and lot of wood furniture. The ential walk in was to a living room with a large leather couch and an easy-chair along with a large fire place, which was lit by a flick of fire from Flame's claw. All along the walls were paintings and pictures of amazing landscapes and animals. The teen was surprised that there were no hunting trophies on the walls from any hunts. Shrugging it off, he looked up to see a sort of loft for the second story. 'most likely for the bedroom' he thought. \"Wow Flame, this place is amazing\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" He chuckled and grinned at me. Then, to his surprise, he took off his helmet and revealed the mostly blue face of the lizard. His entire lower jaw was white along with his nose. In the center of his head was a four pointed yellow star. The next most noticeable feature that he was surprised he didn't notice before was a long scar down his left eyes, the pale skin contrasting the royal blue and creamy white. He took off most of his armor excluding his shirt and went upstairs. The sound of the armor being set on something could be heard, most likely a rack of some sort, before vaulting over the railing and falling down before the lightly startled teen. \"You want something to drink? And you can hang your coat over there.\" He motioned over toward a coat rack. Zack shrugged and followed Flame over to the kitchen, which was surprisingly modern instead of the traditional wood look in the rest of the house. Flame opened the double door fridge and tossed him a water. Zack caught it with a \"Thank you\" and took a sip, still wearing his coat. \"Gonna keep your coat on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah um... It's very... Important, to me. I'd like to keep it on if you don't mind.\" Zack said, rubbing his left bicep and looked down in a show of unexpected nervousness. A bit concerned about this, Flame put a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is something the matter dude?\" He asked, concern could be heard under his usual silky smooth voice. The teen looked up at him and into those deep scarlet eyes. He blushed lightly and shook his head quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no I'm fine, thanks for asking.... I-I'm just r-really thankful that you're letting me stay the n-night.\" He said as he took up his water and tried to compose himself, only to give off a loud yawn. Flame tried to stifle a chuckle and pat the hybrids shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, time for bed.\" He smiled and led Zack upstairs to a good sized bedroom loft. The bed was a queen size, with a royal blue comforter and soft looking white sheets, not to mention the amazing looking pillows. There was a TV set up on the wall across from the bed, as a small dresser under it, on top of which was the satellite cable box and a DVD player. Said disks were no where to be seen. A rack which held Flame's removed armor was set up next to the dresser. The digimon smiled and rolled his eyes at his envious expression. \"I'll just grab an extra blanket and MY pillow so I can set up on the couch. Oh and you may want to either turn away or cover your eyes. I need to change I to my bed clothes.\" Zack blushed and turned away, hearing flame chuckle and remove his shirt armor. He couldn't help but sneak a peak at the Mon, seeing him opening a drawer in the dresser and pulling out a seemingly random shirt. The teen blushed as he watched the back muscles contract  and relax. He quickly looked away as he heard another draw being opened and closed. The sound of him slipping on the clothes could be heard and when he thought it was safe, he turned back around to see him wearing a black and red t-shirt and gym-shorts. The 'mon smiled and went to the side of the bed, pulling a pillow out from under the others, the best looking one, and picked up a rolled up blanket. \"Well I'm sure you know where to go from now. If you need me, don't be afraid to are me up, ok?\" Zack nodded as Flame walked by and ruffled his hair. \"G'night dude! Sweet dreams.\" Finally, he walked down stairs and started setting up the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack sighed to himself as he took off his coat carefully and decided to hang it on an extra hook on Flame's rack, a light clinking could be heard as it was hung. He then took off a some sort of compact device from the back of his belt, which he set on the dresser. He yawned and went over to the bed, pulling off the throw pillows and such before pulling back the sheets, climbed in and covered up and giving a content sigh as he quickly fell asleep. Down below, flame smiled and shook his head as he went back up, walked over to the bed and smiled at the sleeping teen. He ran a hand clawed hand down his sleeping head gently. 'I may have just met him, but I already want to care for him. He's a good kid at heart, I know, just a bit rough around the edges I suppose, as well as pain deep down in there.' He sighed lightly before he walked over and clicked off the light. 'Good night, Zack, I hope you sleep well.' He walked down stairs and flicked off the lights, getting comfortable before letting sleep take him away</span></div></div>",

After looking for a solid minute he looked over at the rack and sighed in relief as he saw his coat hanging there. He got out of the comfortable bed, but not after more then a bit of hesitation to leave the super comfortable bed. Zack walked over to his coat and reached in, instantly grabbing ahold of the hidden sword inside. He pulled out an elegant katana. The hilt was threaded with red cloth. The scabbard was expertly crafted with a golden eastern dragon inlaid into the wood. He carefully pulled the blade out, to reveal that it was 2 ft long, with a black blade, missing a \"blood well\" down the spine. In it's place as a matching golden dragon as on the scabbard. Zack smiled slightly at the familiar feel of the blade in his hand and the ripple of power that passed through him as he held it. Some hybrids, such as Zack, have a special item or object that triggers their digivoltuion. Like Veemon and the digieggs for example. The blond chuckled lightly as he replaced the blade and scabbard back into his coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, after gathering all his things and doing a quick once over of all his gear. He was walking down the stairs from the loft, not entirely paying attention as he turned the corner and rammed right into Flame. They both shouted as they fell on their asses. Flame looked at the embarrassed teen as he got up and offered a hand. Zack took it and got up. Rubbing the right side of his chest lightly, along with Flame, but on his left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck dude, what have you got in that damn thing?\" Flame asked as he reached over to prod at the area he had collided with, making Zack pull back a bit then relax as the Mon retreated. 'Must having something with physical contact. I wonder what this kid as gone through....' He thought silently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... A few... Essentials, for me anyway.\" Zack said as he opened up his coat to reveal not only his katana on his right side, but an intricate dagger and an array of about 10 different throwing knives on the right, all in custom straps designed for quick release. Flame went slacked jawed at all the blades and shook his head to regain his sense* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thata..... Explains why my chest hurt.\" Flame gulped slightly and shook his head again, returning to his usual cheerful and caring personality. \"So! What would like to eat for breakfast?\" He asked with a smile. Zack, seemingly very happy with the change of subject, promptly announced pancakes! \"Then pancakes it shall be! Onward, to the kitchen!\" They both burst out laughing and headed to the kitchen for their breakfast.</span></div></div>",

If anyone can tell me what happened to it via email I would love to know. I'm sorry I don't know how the original introduction went for the story, so I am going to have to think up one. Although, nothing that I can put down as an introduction for it would actually do it justice.</td>",
