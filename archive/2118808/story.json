You were very proud to be named the top of your class and honored to be given the right to teach at the academy someday. You walked through the front door with your two bags of luggage and stepped into the entryway of your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Cheerfully, you called. \"I'm home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom entered the room, smiling. She was a tall and slender woman with long forest brown hair and emerald green eyes. She wore her favorite long black dress to mark the occasion of you graduating. \"Welcome home, sweetie!\" Hugging you, she said. \"I am so proud of your accomplishments!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, mom.\" Blushing, you said. \"Where are Joe, Ina, and Tia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ina and Tia are still at ballet, I will be picking them up soon.\" Lightly, mom replied. \"Joe, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Sighing, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gave you a pained look. \"Your father stopped by.\" Almost whispering, she said. \"He told me that Joe has come of age and will soon discover his spark, his talent for chaotic energy and recruiters will soon be coming to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean those mad scientists?\" Ice in your voice, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father is one of them, young lady.\" Scolding, mom said. She sighed. \"The point is Joe is also close to discovering the magic within him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it is a race.\" Sighing, you said. \"Where is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom winced before replying....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eliete Scientiam was Latin for elite science. Dad had spoke highly of the school, stating it was not quite as good as Eligere Sententia, the school in his home world. Still, as much as you disapproved of dad rarely being around, you doubted he would stoop so low as to do such a thing to the family. \"That's a bit harsh, mom.\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps.\" Her face softening, mom admitted. \"Still, that fear was there so I took the safer path and gave <i>Joeanna</i> a magical experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she take it?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Well, 'she' was mad enough to chew nails but she agreed to play along in exchange for some answers after practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you plan to tell him, err her?\" Wincing at the end, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom smiled. \"It all depends upon the questions she asks.\" Bemused, mom replied. She sighed seeing your face harden. \"I will tell him enough to satisfy him and ease his bruised ego.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, worried for your brother. \"I just hope Ina and Tia have the sense not to tease their new sister too much.\" Softly, you said. \"Joe is very nice and has a lot of patience but even that has its limits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom glanced at her watch. \"Well, we are about to find out.\" Calmly, she said. \"It's time to pick the girls up from ballet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive to the ballet school was quiet and uncomfortable. You knew it was only a matter of time before Joe was transformed into a girl. Still, you also knew that Joe had a huge decision ahead of him and any good or bad experience could sway his final decision. Upon arriving at the ballet school, you found Ina and Tia but Joeanna was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is your sister?\" Serious, mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIna and Tia both shrugged then replied...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your attitude is completely unacceptable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIna and Tia both gasped as if they had been slapped. \"But mommy...!\" Whining, they protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huffed before hurrying into the ballet school to find Joeanna sitting in a corner on the far end of the dance floor. She sounded as if she were weeping. Coming closer, you saw that she was wearing a pink girls' ballet costume with white flats and her now long auburn hair in a neat bun on the top of her head. You winced, thinking Ina and Tia might have gone a bit too far in teasing their new sister. \"Joe...\" Gently, you called. \"Joe, you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to go home...\" Sniffing, Joe demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here to take you home, Joe.\" Slowly approaching, you said. \"I'm sure you have a lot of questions to ask about what happened today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe turned to you, a glint of anger in her hazel eyes. \"You think? It was bad enough what mom did to me this morning! Ina and Tia wanting me to dance at their recital didn't help much!\" She sniffed. \"I have until tomorrow to give the instructor Miss Franz my decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Joe.\" Whispering, you said. \"We'll talk about this when we get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe pouted then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You ushered her out of the ballet school and caught her giving Ina and Tia death glares. The two girls merely shrugged, throwing her an innocent smile. Those smiles vanished when you whispered, \"We'll talk later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride home was quiet and uncomfortable. You sat next to Joe more to keep an eye on her and to make certain Ina or Tia don't make anything worse. You knew that a little girl experience with one or two ballet lessons would not harm Joe in the least. Once turned back to normal, you were certain he would eventually get over it and laugh it off. It was dad you were worried about; he would take advantage of the rough first experience to show him the wonders of his mad science.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dad wants to pass on his knowledge, I get that.\"</i> Frowning, you thought. <i>\"Only he is so rarely around that mom almost literally had to raise us all by herself.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo you, dad did not deserve to teach Joe anything unless he did something grand to make up for all the years he was never around. Sure, he lived at the house but he would leave for weeks or even months at a time, only home long enough to explain his absence in private to mom then stay for maybe the weekend and then be gone again. Mom promised to explain dad's long 'business trips' to you when she felt you were ready but that time had not yet come. You turned to Joe to see her pouting in silence and sighed. You feared she would raise the roof with her screams the second the front door was closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, you noticed, was very quiet. You caught a glimpse of her eyes in the rear view mirror; they were filled with worry and concern. There was no doubt in your mind that she was thinking along the same lines as you were. Upon reaching the house, mom calmly escorted everyone inside then set up a privacy spell the second the door was closed. You turned to Joe and immediately sighed upon seeing....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Joe shivered then turned to you. \"That was creepy.\" Disturbed, she said. \"Can you change me back to normal, if there is a normal here anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can change you back to normal, Joe.\" Serious, mom said. \"However, there is the issue of the recital, thanks to your little sisters.\" She sighed, seeing Joe tearing up more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to tell her that changing her back and forth from boy to girl with so little time in between carried a certain risk but she knew Joe was not in the mood to listen. She turned to you, hoping for some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The twins did not give you a good girl experience.\" Eying Ina and Tia, you said. \"You are going to be stuck as you are at least until tomorrow, thanks to them. Why don't I show you some good points about being a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I show you some good points about being a boy?\" Irritated, Joe countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed at that only mom smiled and replied...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mom had taken you there before shipping you off to Cauldron Academy and now you had the pleasure of showing it to your temporary, perhaps permanent new sister, Joeanna. \"No magic mischief is permitted inside so you have nothing to worry about.\" Smiling, you said. \"It is strictly a place for those with magical talent to relax and just be themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Joe was still uncertain, she nodded and followed you inside where you were greeted by Rina Bewit, the daughter of the owner of the malt shop. She was near your age with long black hair and blue eyes. She smiled upon catching your eye. \"Welcome back, Gina.\" Cheerful, she said. \"How was your year of learning magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was incredible.\" Beaming, you said. \"I came here today to show my temporary little sister, Joeanna a better girl experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRina winced. \"A rough beginning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Ballet with mischievous seven year old witches.\" Ruefully, you replied. \"Plus dad gave her a creepy pep talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mad scientists are like that.\" Shaking her head, Rina said. She then smiled. \"Enough about your worries, here you get to relax and unwind. Find a seat and I'll bring you some menus to look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and lead Joe to a seat who looked out a window at the people walking about in the mall. \"It's hard to imagine this place being underground.\" Softly, she said. \"Is this an enchanted window?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. \"I asked that too.\" Bemused, you said. \"It's a normal window. What you are seeing are people walking about the witch run mall under the normal's mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe raised a single eyebrow as she always did when she was intrigued.  \"So, the door we walked through is just a surface access port?\" Curious, she asked. You nodded. \"Interesting... do we have time to explore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled. \"Maybe another time.\" Smiling, you said. \"We are just here to help you unwind and relax a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, Rina returned with two menus which she gave you and Joe. \"How is your sister coping so far?\" Curious, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's curious about the witch mall.\" Smiling, you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRina giggled as well. \"It's best to wait with exploring that until you gain a little resistance to magic.\" Calmly, she said. \"Magical mischief is forbidden here but not in too many other places, especially not in the witch mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe moaned at that, making you smile. \"Patience, sis.\" Bemused, you said. \"All in good time.\" She then turned to Rina. \"I'll have a calming tea and a root leaf salad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRina nodded then turned to Joe who seemed perplexed by the menu. \"I think you gave me a menu in Chinese.\" Wincing, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed at that. \"It's witch writing, Joe.\" Amused, you said. \"Here, I'll help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from your seat, you touched Joe's shoulder. A harmless flame ignited in her right hand, making her scream slightly. You quickly urged her to close her hand, the flame went out. \"You should be able to read it now.\" Softly, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaken, Joe looked at the menu and sighed. \"These are some strange names for what you offer.\" Softly, she said. \"I'm glad you posted pictures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a lot to get used to in the witching world, Joeanna.\" Smiling, Rina said. \"Take it in slowly, it will be easier that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to order for you, Joe?\" Kindly, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe nodded. \"A burger and fries with a tall glass of milk would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. \"The vegan burger with potato slices and milk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRina nodded. \"I'll put that in right away.\" Smiling, she said.

But we'd get all smelly!\" Grimacing, Ina protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joeanna thought she was smelly with your perfume.\" Raising an eyebrow, mom countered. \"It's all about what you are used to. Turning him into a little girl was hard on him as it was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe is not used to being a girl and you two seem to think that you can just force her into doing everything you two do on a daily basis.\" Frowning, you added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle this, Gina.\" Patiently, mom said. \"Please go check up on Joe. I am certain she could use some comforting right about now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you walked towards Joe's room while mom continued her rant on Ina and Tia. \"Did you seriously think I would not figure out that you two told her you were witches too?!\" Angrily, mom demanded. \"I sent Joeanna to ballet to give her an experience, show her being a girl is not so bad! It was not to give you two an excuse to manipulate her into doing whatever you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't say we would change him into a girl any time we wanted.\" Pouting, Tia countered. \"We just said that we could change him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head, fuming. \"Do you have any idea how hard it is going to be to pull Joeanna out of ballet now because of the stunt you two pulled?!\" Now screaming, she demanded. She took a breath as both Ina and Tia backed into the wall, quivering. \"I am about to pass down your punishments for your reckless actions and threats to use magic on your sister...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced, hearing both Ina and Tia screaming before two boys ran for their rooms in tears and slamming the doors behind them. You knew that mom would not keep them little boys for very long but you also knew that any such punishment on anyone so young was an eternity to them. With a sigh, you knocked on Joe's bedroom door. She answered a moment later by opening the door a crack, just enough to peer out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Grumpily, she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to talk.\" Calmly, you said. \"Only I would prefer to do it face to face rather through a door only open a crack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is mom or the twins with you?\" Her eyes narrowed, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alone.\" Serious, you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Joe opened the door and allowed you in before closing the door and locking it. \"Would you like something to drink? A snack?\" Irritable, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled slightly. Joe was always a gracious host, no matter what mood he, or rather, she was in. She had a miniature fridge in her room which she bought herself with saved allowances along with a small book shelf full of snacks. \"No, thank you.\" Politely, you replied. \"I just came here to tell you that mom punished Ina and Tia; they will be boys for a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe grunted. \"They got off lucky.\" Pouting, she said. \"I would have sent them to the gym for a good work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom considered that.\" Serious, you said. \"They had no right to threaten you with magic, especially not in a public place. There are laws surrounding the use of that power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did mom break any of these laws?\" Frowning, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did not.\" Honestly, you said. \"No physical harm came to you and the gender transformation is not permanent.\" You frowned. \"Ina and Tina telling you they can change you at any time they want crossed a line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can't change me then?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they have the power to do so.\" Serious, you explained. \"However, They are not allowed to because they are too young and inexperienced, accidents can happen all too easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you allowed to change me?\" Hopefully, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am allowed to do so under the right circumstances.\" Honestly, you said. \"However, 'Joeanna' still needs to tell Miss Franz that she is not interested in sticking with ballet. That she will be moving on but <i>might</i> return at a later time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much, much later.\" Pouting, Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thought, you asked, \"How about I show you how we girls relax?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly what do you mean by that?\" Wincing, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and offered to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She became irritated, seeing you grin and quickly added, \"The first time around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one is going to know its you, bro.\" Gently, you assured him. \"All they will see is a cute, pouting little girl who does not like shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha Ha.\" Frowning, Joe said. \"I'm guessing you really want me to go shopping with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will get you away from mom and the 'boys' for a while.\" Grinning, you said. \"That and I promise none of your friends will know about it unless you tell them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of further convincing, Joe agreed to go shopping and you took him to the mall by means of the bus. Ten minutes later, you were leading Joe through the girls clothing department, showing her the latest styles in girl's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom has a no tomboy rule, as you know.\" Firmly but kindly, you said. \"So you will have to limit your choices to skirts and or dresses for your small wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe turned pale. \"You're making me buy a wardrobe of girls clothing?!\" Stunned, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hushed her quiet. \"Just enough to give you something to wear of your choice in case this happens again in the near future.\" Whispering, you countered. \"That is unless you want Ina, Tia, or mom picking out your next outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe huffed, irritated then looked out of the store to another across the hall. \"What's with the Intriguing Look Clothing store, sis?\" Curious, Joe demanded. \"Mom is always telling me never to set foot in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That store is run by a witch named Nora Malign.\" Serious, you explained. \"She is reportedly the granddaughter of one of the rogue witches who had a part in opening the portal that had stranded hundreds of mad scientists in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with me?\" Shrugging, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Nora sees all mad scientists, including you, as invaders and works to change all young boys with 'chaotic blood' into girls and witches.\" Frowning, you said. \"That clothing store she runs is filled with enchanted outfits that will slowly and permanently  transform you into a girl and a witch so it will appear to be a <i>natural phenomenon.</i> She can change her appearance and age to lure mad scientists of all ages and walks of life to her store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she's a rogue witch?\" Guessing, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A quasi rogue.\" Calmly, you corrected. \"She is not yet considered a criminal as she barely stays within the law and occasionally helps the D.D.M.C., Department of Dark Magic Control catch some real criminal witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they like the police or something?\" Raising an eyebrow, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that.\" Bemused, you replied. \"Those who enforce magical law are called Soothsayers.\" You then frowned slightly, adding, \"The entity who enforces the laws of mad science is called the Failure Oversight Department. Their agents are called 'Correction Officers'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe seemed to sense that you were feeling uncomfortable and changed the subject. \"Um... What color do you think is, as you say, me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, relieved that Joe decided to move back to clothing and fashion. \"I'd stick with neutral colors, Joe.\" Honestly, you said. \"Why don't you pick out a nice dress and try it on.\" Joe pouted to which you said, \"You will be Joe again eventually. Just humor me for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Joe took the white dress with the pink sash and trimmings into the change room to try it on. \"I better not have to wear a slip with this.\" Irritated, she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled. \"No, that one doesn't need a slip.\" Calmly, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you waited patiently for Joe to change, you heard a strange voice coming from a store near Nora Malign's store. \"I see you are showing your brother the ways of feminine persuasion.\" Bemused, the dark male voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Whispering, you demanded. \"Show yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall, slender man in a black tuxedo appeared at the entrance of the clothing store. You were startled to suddenly find it completely empty of other shoppers but you, Joe, and him. \"I am known as Dante Delirium, mad scientist teacher and tutor.\" With a deep bow, he said. \"Here, I have a humble shop where I tutor young witches such as yourself so you may understand your bother's and or father's chaotic science. My teaching methods bring families closer together and I am offering you a free class to attend at anytime you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although I am certain you see your offer as very generous, I must decline.\" Politely, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom had warned you about this Dante Delirium. She told you that he was  obsessed with making mad science the dominate power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This self righteous madman works to recruit unsuspecting young witches to learn chaotic science so to better connect with their brothers and or fathers.\" Sternly, mom had warned you. \"Those who take his offer he slowly reels in and brainwashes into wanting to become boys and mad scientists. That is when he strikes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning your mind to the present, you remembered the teachers at Cauldron Academy calling Dante Delirium a 'gender offender' who was a mad scientist who permanently switches a witch's gender against her will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I offer you my card, in case you change your mind?\" Smiling, Dante asked. \"You never know when your curiosity will lead you to wanting to learn more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why do they put these things in the back?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" Politely, you said. \"I must attend to my temporary new sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Smiling, Dante said. \"Another time, perhaps...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps...\" Backing away, you said. \"Good day to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to walk backwards, keeping an eye on the mad scientist until someone pulled him out of view. As you turned to help Joe, you inwardly hoped it was a 'Correction Officer' who had pulled Dante aside. \"The zipper is in the back so it would not be visible.\" Calmly, you explained. \"May I come in to zip it up for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll help me get it off, right?\" Nervous, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled. \"Of course. Unless you want to keep it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not funny, sis.\" Sourly, Joe snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just kidding!\" Smiling, you said. \"Let me help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered the changing room and closed the zipper on the dress before leading Joe out to a full length mirror set up between the two booths. The white dress looked very flattering on her. With the right leggings and shoes, she would be breaking young hearts in grade school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing herself in the mirror, Joe blushed brightly. \"Okay...\" Reluctantly, she said. \"The dress does look good on the girl in the mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed at that as Joe was not about to admit she looks great in the dress. \"Do you think the girl in the mirror would like it added to her wardrobe?\" Kindly, you asked. \"You know; in case she might come back later on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe moaned at that. \"I dunno.\" Uncertain, she said. \"I suppose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled. \"Done. Now let's see if there are any nice skirts you... I mean the girl in the mirror would like to add.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, while Joe was reluctantly building a small wardrobe, Dante Delirium was having a chat with the quasi rogue, Nora Malign. \"I was moments away from scoring a new client!\" Irritated, Dante snapped. \"How dare you interfere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, I am relieved I caught you just in time.\" Grinning, Nora countered. \"You and your kind are invaders, an infestation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary, we are purity.\" Defiant, Dante replied. \"We intend to cleanse this world of its research of ancient sciences and bring it into the light of the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A futile effort, I assure you.\" Frowning, Nora said. \"No doubt you were targeting a new unsuspecting young witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I offered my services to a young witch foolishly showing her transformed brother feminine fashions.\" With disgust, Dante replied. \"Such a waste of talent...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she is showing her new sister the light.\" Showing pride, Nora said. \"She is to be greatly commended for her noble efforts.\" After a pause, she added, \"Perhaps I can offer my expert  assistance as I do specialize in, shall we say changing trends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you suggesting a wager, my dear spell weaving rival?\" Grinning, Dante inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you wish to lose badly.\" Grinning back, Nora replied. \"Shall we agree that the one who fails to win over their target must close shop for say a month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such petty stakes.\" Shaking his head, Dante scoffed. \"I say that the one who fails to win over their target must move shop to the opposite end of the mall where our desired crowd is less likely to mingle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief hesitation, Nora took Dante's hand and shook it; the wager had been made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the clothing store, Joe seemed pleased that her little shopping adventure was nearly over. Still, she was pouting at the selections; more due to the fact she had to admit they looked good on her as a girl. \"Cheer up, Joe.\" Smiling, you said. \"How about a little wager?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Sensing a trap, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will pick out a stunning outfit for you to wear home, one I know you will like as a girl.\" Serious, you explained. \"If you love the outfit, you be a girl for your birthday this coming weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe moaned deeply at that thought but asked, \"What if I don't love it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. \"Then I will be a boy for your birthday this coming weekend. We can do all of the things you love to do as a boy together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thought, Joe nodded. \"I know I'm going to regret this somehow.\" Bemused, she said. \"Still, you got yourself a wager.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Joe shook hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, in the main hall, Dante grinned. \"What a perfect set up for our wager.\" Amused, he said. \"I will have that little girl hating anything her sister picks out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if I have anything to say or rather cast about it.\" Grinning back, Nora countered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was worse was you knew how Nora operated. She wanted to make Joe a girl permanently and that would bring heavy consequences if you allowed her to get her way. You gave Nora a look of suspicion to which she merely shrugged. Joe looked at the rack of clothing Nora pointed to and frowned at the selections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already added a few of these to the cart.\" Disappointed, she said. \"While, yeah, the color is more my style, they are still skirts and blouses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and walked away from the rack without touching a single one.

Joe looked at the rack and smiled. \"These are better, sis.\" Taking one off the rack, she said. \"They are knee length, better than the short skorts over there.\" He turned to Nora who hid her frown. \"Thanks anyway, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora smiled. \"My store is always open if you would like to see a larger selection.\" Kindly, she said. \"I have clothes to fit all styles and tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she walked out.

She was an Amazon of a woman with long black hair and blue eyes. \"May I help you, young ladies?\" Politely, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Yes, we are here to give my little sister a new look.\" Smiling, you explained. \"She's a bit of a tomboy.\" You then frowned, adding, \"Also, there's creepy guy that keeps following us around; he's standing outside the store right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He keeps smiling at me for some reason.\" Wincing, Joe added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saleslady glanced out the door and spotted Dante standing in open in front of the store with a creepy smile on his face. \"That man runs a shady tutoring school in the mall.\" With disgust, she said. \"I've heard a number of complaints about him.\" She then smiled. \"Don't worry, I'll call security and alert them of the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, ma'am.\" Softly, Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem at all, miss.\" Kindly, the saleslady said. \"Also, call me Tessa.\" She giggled slightly. \"I hear you are a tomboy. There is nothing wrong with showing off your feminine side so long as the boys know its look but do not touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe blushed brighter, if that was possible. \"Some boys just don't get it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we girls stick together.\" Winking, Tessa said. \"Come, I'll show you some undergarments that will reflect the princess within you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe sighed, still blushing. You held back a giggle. \"It's all a part of being a girl.\" Whispering carefully, you said. \"Even the tomboys get called 'princess'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside the shop, two men in police uniforms approached Dante. They discretely showed him a glowing badge. \"Correction officers.\" Serious, the first said. \"You are interfering in a test on prince Joe Mage, heir to the throne of all mad scientists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary, I am preventing Nora Malign from interfering with this test by testing his sister, princess Gina Mage, heir to the throne of the witching world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have proof of this accusation?\" Raising an eyebrow, the second policeman demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante motioned to Nora, standing only a few yards away. \"Ask her yourself. I had to offer a wager to entice her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will look into this matter.\" Serious, the first policeman said. \"In the meantime, keep your distance; you are forbidden to interfere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two policemen walked away, vanishing into the crowd. \"Clever move, Miss Gina Mage.\" Whispering, Dante said. \"However, there is more than one way to change a girl's mind, or rather, gender...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled and walked off, intending to try a different approach. Later, you and Joe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Joanie.\" Grinning, mom said. \"To summon your test flame, you must first find your center then focus your energy into your womb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why boys can't work magic?\" Curious, Joe, or rather, Joanie asked. \"Because they don't have a womb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Partially.\" Smiling, you replied. \"Focus on your center then build your energy in your womb and imagine it igniting in your right hand as a harmless flame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough uncertain, Joanie closed her eyes and managed to summon a flame to her right hand. Both you and mom giggled as she jumped, letting out a yelp of fight seeing it.

There was a smile on his face when you and Joe emerged but it turned into a deep frown of concern upon seeing your pale and panicked expression and teary eyes. \"Explain what happened, Gina.\" Firmly, he commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to cry, worried and frightened before blurting out, \"Joe is a male familiar and grandma said I'm a chaotic familiar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad raised a single eyebrow before locking his jaw in decision. With a snap of his fingers, you and Joe found yourselves in a room overlooking a massive chamber somewhere that was buzzing with machines and robots. \"I will need to run a few tests to confirm these findings, Gina.\" Serious, dad said. \"If the head witch's theory is correct, you would be the very first of your kind in this world and a highly sought after prize.\" He then turned to Joe. \"If you are indeed a familiar, Joe as your mother theorizes, you too would be a highly sought after prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus the tests began with dad taking a sample of blood from both you and Joe and running it through a machine inside the room. While the machine did its work, dad threw what looked like ball lightning at you! A shriek escaped your lips but you relaxed seeing that it never came near you but merely circled you and then Joe before circling you again. Seeing this, dad raised a single eyebrow again before grinning. \"I was right, as usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, dad?\" Startled, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad canceled the ball lighting that was circling us then turned to the machine before returning to us, smiling. \"It is as I had suspected from the beginning.\" Smiling, he said. \"Neither of you have anything to fear. What we have here is not a case of two familiars but an extremely rare case of distant twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Distant twins?\" Confused, you asked. You frowned. \"I never heard of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is because it does not happen in the witching world but in our world, dear Gina.\" Serious, dad explained. \"You and Joe were born exactly one year apart; plus or minus a few seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with...\" Confused, you started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In chaotic families, extremely powerful males remain in the womb longer, incorporeal or ghost like up to a full year.\" Cutting you off, dad said. \"In extremely rare cases, you have twins with the, and I mean no disrespect when I say this, weaker twin being born last to take in more power to form a balance.\" He grinned. \"In Laments terms, you were supposed to be born on the same day only Joe held back a year, taking in more power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped being completely thunderstruck by the news. You and Joe were twins?! It did explain a lot as you and Joe were often mistaken as twins by your friends, Thomas Lore and Rachel Scott. A tiny smile appeared onto your face, seeing that they were more on target than they had realized. Dad nodded, smiling. \"I take it that your mother came to the conclusion that Joe was a familiar by examining his test flame.\" You nodded to which dad chuckled. \"She failed to take into account his chaotic energy which would have also been present.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flame reading is not my strong suit.\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I shall explain.\" Smiling, dad said. He turned to Joe. \"Use the same method your mother explained to summon your spark, dear boy while Gina, you summon your flame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as you were asked as did Joe. Both of you were surprised to find that they were moving in sync with each other. \"What does this mean?\" Worried, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is the rare but true testament of magic and chaotic twins.\" Kindly, dad said. \"One power augments the other despite their obvious differences.\" He chuckled. \"If you will notice, Gina, your flame is sparking with electricity while Joe's spark seems to be on fire on the inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you trying to tell us?\" Wincing, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad motioned to the flame and spark still burning in our hands. \"Although one part is a flame and the other is lightning, they are both a form of fire and are thus allies.\" Simply, he said. He smiled, urging you both to cancel your flame and spark. \"Regardless of what fate has in store for the two of you, know that you are twins; be there for each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe smiled giving you a one armed hug. \"We will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled then turned to dad, concerned. \"Grandma said we should both be permanently transformed; what should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"That won't do much good.\" Bemused, he said. \"So long as your powers are even, you would not stay transformed for long.\" He motioned to the window overlooking his laboratory. \"Are you two ready to tour my inner sanctum?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The robot nodded its head and hurried off to perform its task. Dad then turned to Gina, grinning. \"It is called binary speak.\" Calmly, he explained. \"It is similar to witch language. All chaotic scientists can speak this; I have taught Joe the language when he was very young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a strange way, it made sense.

This explains why you were able to fly the broom and repair the robot so quickly, though you did not realize it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of me?\" Wincing, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"To answer your earlier question, you did not change genders while flying the A.V.G. it does not possess that power.\" Bemused, he said. \"You merely found a way to make it obey your commands through magic, though I suspect it was more on a subconscious level like Joe's transformation into a girl while on the broomstick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" Worried, you asked. \"Two alike powers cannot mix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, two alike powers cannot be used at the same time.\" Turning serious, dad countered. \"You have chaotic energy within you so yo were able to control the A.V.G. to some point. It was only your year of experience that allowed you to do it without changing genders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it the same for chaotic scientists trying to fly a witch's broom?\" Curious, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad grinned. \"I flew your mother's broomstick, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Joe giggled at that and the tour continued with...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The various colors, although not really necessary, are so to more easily identify their purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much like magical potions.\" Thoughtful, you said. \"Only the ingredients for serums use different plants which are more agreeable to chaotic power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are partially correct, Gina.\" Smiling, dad said. \"For every potion, there is a serum counterpart. However, the ingredients are not as different as you might think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Curious, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"Serums use different plants but of the same genera used in the ingredients for making potions.\" Bemused, he replied. \"These plants are more agreeable to chaotic energy but are of the same plant family.\" He chuckled. \"By knowing and understanding the various species of plants, you can make any serum a potion or visa versa by simply swapping out key elements more agreeable to your root power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's incredible!\" Smiling, Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, only a witch can make a potion and only a chaotic scientist can make a serum.\" Serious, you said. \"the two powers are more different than alike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad turned to you, amused. \"Care to test that theory, my dear?\" Smiling, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes. \"Okay, dad.\" Albeit reluctantly, you said. \"I'll play your game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad grinned before summoning a notebook to his hand. \"Splendid!\" Bemused, he said. \"You will attempt to make a simple babbling serum while I attempt to make a simple babbling potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in agreement though you saw it as a waste of time. A babbling potion was used to cause the one it was splashed on to babble like a drunken idiot until a counter potion or spell was given. The ingredients listed on the notebook were nearly identical to the potion; using different plants but of the same genera. Following the directions exactly, you turned to dad for the final instructions only to have him holding up what appeared to be a finished potion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you raised your magical defenses to which dad smiled more. \"How did you manage to make a potion?!\" Startled, you demanded. \"You are not a woman or a witch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad threw his head back with a maniacal laugh before eying you with an almost sadistic grin making you feel uncomfortable. \"I didn't.\" Amused, he said. \"I only made the initial mixture. When you raised your defenses, it gave the mixture the final ingredient required to make it a potion.\" He grinned more before finishing, \"Your magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that possible?\" Taken back, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe winced. \"Dad, you are frightening me...\" Frowning, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled more kindly. \"I apologize for causing you two a fright.\" Calmly, he said. \"You see, for any given potion or serum to have power, it only requires magic or chaotic energy to be focused upon it. Many witches and mad scientists alike have made and stored various mixtures without adding their power to avoid accidents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as you caught on to dad's reasoning. \"So when I raised my defenses against the mixture you made, I inadvertently charged it with my magic, making it a potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"Had I thrown this at you instead, your own magic would have finished the potion upon raising your defenses.\" Softly, he explained. \"Had it hit, you would have taken its full effects and be unable to cast a single spell until another witch gave you the antidote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe shuddered at the thought. \"That can't be legal.\" Whispering, he protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not.\" Turning serious, dad replied. \"It's considered 'fighting dirty' by both laws. It is both reckless and dangerous especially if the one throwing the mixture has no clue what he or she had created.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a way to combat it?\" Curious, you asked. \"Or does this trick work an everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled as you held up the mixture you had made. \"Once you learn to detect the absence of magic or chaotic energy in any given mixture will you learn when to and not to raise your defenses.\" Bemused, he said. \"I learned that the hard way from your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at that. \"Well, she is an expert in combat magic.\" Calmly, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"If a boy were to try to charge a potion, it would harmlessly blow up in his face.\" Calmly, he said. \"The same would occur if a girl tried to charge a serum.\" He then raised a finger of warning. \"There is however, a 'back door' approach but it is highly frowned upon as it has often lead to disaster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, knowing what dad was talking about. \"The dormant magical power that lies within all witch boys and the dormant chaotic power that lies within all chaotic scientist girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite right.\" Serious, dad said. \"This back door approach can only be legally used by the Ironclads and Amazons as their dormant power had already taken root within them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The who?\" Confused, Joe asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip, shaking your head. \"Not off the top of my head, no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe sighed, looking around. \"The floor seems solid but watch your step anyway.\" Serious, he said. \"It would seem as if this maze doesn't want us to double back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which makes it all the more difficult.\" Wincing, you said. \"Do you have any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working on it.\" Rubbing one arm, Joe said. \"Reading mysteries is a lot easier than actually solving them. Just be careful, I have this nagging feeling we're being watched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me both.\" Nervous, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you both, inside a secret room of the house, mom and dad were nervously watching through several monitors. In front of them, a small team of witches and mad scientists worked a number of controls. \"Your son is remarkably resourceful.\" Calmly, one witch commented. \"If he keeps his wits about him, he may get further than most of those before him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you telling me that no one has made it out of that house?\" Startled, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they always get out.\" Calmly, one mad scientist replied. \"However, everyone who had been put to this test thus far had to be removed as their time to win the freedom of their own choice had expired.\" He paused, turning to mom and dad. \"I do hope you read the full contract before signing it, Mr and Mrs Mage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did indeed.\" Serious, dad said. \"If Joe succeeds in getting out of the house with his sister before time runs out, he wins his choice as to become a witch, a mad scientist, or a normal person with neither power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he fails, the choice is handed down to us.\" Softly, mom added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid you are mistaken.\" Calmly, another witch said. \"Read the last part of the contract again; if Joe fails, the decision is automatically made based upon which powers he leaned towards the most in his effort to get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we have no say now?\" Worried, mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did not have a say to begin with.\" Serious, another mad scientist replied. \"You can only guide them and hope they make the right decisions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and dad both sighed then continued to watch as you and Joe considered your next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the hall, you screamed as the floor gave way the moment you tried to open a door. Fortunately, Joe had quick reflexes and managed to catch your hand and pull you up. \"I told you to be careful!\" Scolding, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Startled, you said. \"I wonder where that leads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if I want to find out.\" Serious, Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you and Joe do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You nodded and Joe pointed to the stairs. \"If you look closely, the stairs are raised just slightly in random places. I'd say those are the triggers for that or some other mechanism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the stairs more closely. Sure enough, there were small patches on every other step in different spots that were slightly raised from the stairs. \"Cute...\" Irritated, you muttered. You then smiled. \"I believe you just used your witch sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My what...?\" Confused, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's sort of like a danger sense that witches have.\" Calmly, you explained. \"Magic has many uses including a second sight, so to speak.\" After a pause, you added, \"Come to think of it, that might be how you were able to catch me before I fell down that trap door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe blushed slightly at that. \"That was just quick reflexes.\" Lamely, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, thinking, <i>\"I wonder...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe lead the way while to followed right behind him, taking care not to step on the slightly raised patches in the light carpeting.

Had we hesitated...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would have been right back where we started with you changing more.\" Sighing, you finished. Wincing, you added, \"I'm sorry for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe shrugged it off. \"You are in the same boat as I am.\" Calmly, he said. \"For all we know, you are changing too, just not in a way either of us notice yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found that thought disturbing but pushed it aside for the moment as Joe looked around. You and he were on a narrow circular landing surrounding the main room of the house. There were three halls branching off in a 'Y' formation with three doors, one between each hall, and a stair case heading to the third floor. Joe moaned, scratching his head. \"To leave this house is the quest; to find the right way it the test.\" Muttering to himself, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced, hearing him. \"Joe, that almost sounded like a spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can blame mom for that.\" Serious, Joe replied. \"She would always talk in rhyme when she was stuck on something. I sort of picked it up from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, one of the doors on the narrow landing glowed slightly for a moment. You were not certain if it was Joe's chaotic power reacting to his comment or his dormant magic reacting, or if the house was messing with your minds. Joe saw the door glow for a moment as well and threw you an uncertain glance. \"You said boys can't work magic, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"Boys can't work magic but mad science is a magic that works for boys and you have that.\" Honestly, you said. \"However, a boy's dormant magic has been known to react to a boy's emotions and work on his behalf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or it could be a mind game from whoever is running this little 'fun house'.\" Annoyed, Joe commented. \"We need to chose a direction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some debate, you and Joe decide to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The dresser was the second strike against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to now?\" Changing the subject, you asked. \"The garden is obviously out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have the door and the hole in the floor.\" Tugging on his bra, Joe replied. \"However, I would appreciate some help getting this thing off of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking it off won't change the partial transformation.\" Serious, you said. \"It's best to leave it on so your 'girls' don't weigh you down too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny.\" Frowning, Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious.\" Firmly, you countered. \"Once we get out of here, assuming you are not fully changed into a girl, I'll do all I can to change you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe sighed, obviously not liking his situation in the least. \"Fine...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first girl was about your height with shoulder length forest brown hair and green eyes. The other was a few inches shorter with mid-back blond hair and blue eyes. \"Thank you for the rescue.\" Relieved, the first girl said. \"I am Mia Hank and this is my brother, well now sister Cire.

We found this room that had a science theme. Maybe it could fix things...\" Joe offered. You wasn't too impressed.

If mom and dad knew or suspected that such groups were eyeing Joe, they may find it necessary to force a choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It still does not give them any right.\" Annoyed, Joe insisted.

Show and explain yourself if you have the decency or audacity to do so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the secret room, both mom and dad winced.

For a moment, you thought he was going to explode as his patience had been pushed to its near limit. Fortunately, he sighed and his face softened slightly. \"You are right, sis.\" Calmly, he said. \"I can't think straight when I'm all worked up like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a number of breaths then looked around, as if searching for something then turned to Cire and Mia. \"You two have been in this house longer than us.\" Firmly but kindly, he said. \"Does it seem as if everything moves in a circle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mia and Cire nodded. \"Every time we follow a long hall, it leads us back here.\" Honestly, Mia replied. \"It's as if this house doesn't want us to find a way out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe thought for a moment them smiled. \"No... this house is a circle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it!\" Serious, Joe said. \"We never saw this house from the outside so we assumed it was just like any other house. Only this one is designed to confuse its visitors, literally leading them in circles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the way out is...\" Curious, Mia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The center of the house.\" Smiling, Joe replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\" Confused, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the perfect place to put the drive way.\" As if inspired, Joe explained. \"The circle continues on the second and third floor but a section on the first floor opens for the garage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first witch giggled inside the secret room. \"The boy's witch sight has surfaced once again.\" Showing pride, she commented. \"This house is indeed a circle with a path for a driveway to the center.\" She turned to mom. \"You should be proud, Mrs Mage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is showing the intelligence of a true mad scientist.\" Beaming, the first mad scientist countered. \"There is no other explanation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... he is a true detective.\" Smiling, mom said. \"Its a gift he has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must agree.\" Smiling as well, dad replied. \"However, his true power remains a mystery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps he will solve that for himself as well.\" thoughtful the second witch stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Agreed the second mad scientist said. \"Let us see if his revelation will lead them out in time or if a choice will be made for them.\"<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house, you followed as Joe lead the way towards the center of the house with unknown obstacles awaiting you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He tried to pull the door shut, but to his horror, he was pulled into the gym. Biting you lip even more, you wondered if you should follow, but after a few seconds of hesitation, you followed him.

They cannot use this power but they can give it to a witch or mad scientist, depending upon their affiliation.\" She pause then added, \"This would have made Joe heavily sought after. The gauntlet was necessary to avoid that scenario.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand...\" Tears falling, you said. \"It still doesn't make it right or fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, there is very little about life that is right or fair, Gina.\" Calmly, Raven replied. \"I know this from experience.\" She then smiled. \"It is up to us to make what goes wrong right and what is unfairly done fairly corrected.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a rare look of kindness on his face as he raised a single finger to his lips, indicating silence. In the next breath, you found yourself inside a vast room the size of an aircraft hangar. It was filled with various computers and machines of complexity beyond your comprehension. \"Welcome to my laboratory, Gina.\" Kindly, dad said. \"Please do not touch anything without my supervision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you bring me here?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to understand the event that has been put into motion by your mother and grandmother and how you play a pivotal role.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that Jenna's decision was magically swayed.\" Worried, you said. \"I thought no one is allowed to sway her decision one way or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct.\" Serious, dad said. \"That is the test both you and your sibling now face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why tell me?\" Wincing, you demanded. \"Would that not corrupt the test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The test is already corrupted because you have stumbled upon part of it.\" Serious, dad said. \"We can not give the throne to just anyone and the one who takes it must be willing to accept all the power and responsibility that goes with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why make Jenna heir to the throne of the witching world?\" Confused, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I had very little to do with his upbringing.\" Frowning, dad replied. \"I was following the same path as my father whom allowed my mother to raise me; she was an Amazon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you trained to be a witch?\" Surprised, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"I was trained to be an Amazon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded though you were a bit surprised. Amazons were girls born of chaotic blood whose power had taken root but were too physically strong to break the barrier keeping them female. These girls possessed incredible attributes as well as limited power over one or more of the four elements as the power of a chaotic scientist was believed to be elemental in nature. \"What is Jenna's test?\" Morbidly curious, you demanded. \"What is my test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed. \"There are several people being tested but it is not my place to state who.\" Softly, he replied. \"Jenna must decide if her heart truly is in taking the throne of the witching world or if it is the throne of chaotic science his heart longs for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will studying at Cauldron Academy show her this?\" Worried, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna decision was magically swayed but the effect of the spell will wear off by this time tomorrow morning.\" Darkly, dad said. \"I calculate that she will be furious due to the deception and demand to be released. However, merely demanding to be released is not enough to sway the powers that be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could demand the witch court.\" Serious, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"She could but she could also take the training and deny the throne upon graduation as her decision was magically swayed, making you the heir by default and him the heir to the chaotic throne and a student at Elite Sententia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Henry Mage?\" Wincing, you asked. \"Would he not challenge this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"Another part of the test, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you are revealing all of this, what is my test?\" Worried, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad face turned grim. \"Knowing what you know, will you intervene for the best of the witching world or allow the chips to fall where they may and accept the fate of those involved?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you found yourself back in the house just as mom and Elle turned your way...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By simply giving Joe a tour of both schools, he could have made a decision on his own. Instead, you force a decision through a highly stressful test right into another one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom opened her mouth to speak but you were not finished ranting. \"Another thing, what gives any of you the right to force a choice when Joe won't be taking the throne until he reaches adulthood?! For that matter, why did you not force the same choice on me?! I could have just as easily become the next heir to the chaotic throne as Joe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Elle turned to each other then, to your surprise, smiled. \"Congratulations, Gina.\" Bemused, Elle said. \"You have passed your test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step back, stunned. \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The passing of the torch test takes years to play out, dear.\" Turning serious, mom said. \"The gauntlet as the opening of the test and this is merely the second phase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your bother, or rather sister must be able to make decisions under highly stressful situations as the head witch or head mad scientist will face these sort of situations.\" Smiling, Elle explained. \"The same goes for you, my dear.\" She gave a light chuckle. \"You passed by facing us despite the fact we are your superiors and laid down the law. Courage is another important factor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't give the throne to just anyone.\" Muttering, you said. \"That's what dad told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is quite correct.\" Calmly, Elle said. \"It is a position of great power and heavy responsibility to which we must be certain is held by the one most qualified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so, Henry Mage will not be the next head mad scientist?\" Wincing, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"He doesn't want it.\" Bemused, mom said. \"We simply used him for the test; I can assure you, though, he is freaking out over this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, shaking your head. \"You two are kicking the hornets nest.\" Serious, you said. \"I can only hope none of you get stung.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly the next morning...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Either demand the witch court or deny the throne on grounds the decision was magically influenced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get me out of here, Gina?\" Panicked, Jenna demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the witch courts can do that through an official order on grounds of abuse of power.\" Firmly, you replied. \"Only that carries consequences.

I will support you either way. Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon saying that, the line suddenly went dead telling you the call had been interrupted by someone at the school.

Not only have laws been broken across the board, we have a very angry and frightened student with incredible power at the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am open to suggestions, Miss Mage.\" Still nervous, Miss Dust said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although it is within Jenna's rights to demand the witch court, we cannot risk the repercussions of that action.\" After a thought, you said. \"By doing so, she will most likely be crowned head witch, something she has made clear she does not desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you propose to convince her not to take legal action?\" Curious, Miss Dust asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By showing her that knowledge is power.\" Serious, you replied. \"By knowing the power and laws of magic, <i>he</i> can better negotiate a lasting peace between the two powers as head mad scientist... if that is what he truly desires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do my best to convince him, Miss Mage.\" Serious, Miss Dust said. \"I doubt it will be easy, though with the anger and mistrust he is likely holding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is why I will be the one to convince him.\" Firmly but kindly, you said. \"We are both heirs to the throne on opposite sides of the coin. Expect my arrival within the hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish it, Miss mage.\" Courtly, Miss Dust said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you ended the call and prepared for your trip to Cauldron Academy. \"No doubt, there will be obstacles in this test.\" Frowning, you said. \"I need to prepare myself for anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving a note for mom to find, you teleported to Cauldron Academy where you were allowed entry to find Jenna...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A babbling potion was used to cause the one it was splashed on to babble like a drunken idiot until a counter potion or spell was given.

Many witches and mad scientists alike have made and stored various mixtures without adding their power to avoid accidents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as you caught on to dad's reasoning. \"So when I raised my defenses against the mixture you made, I inadvertently charged it with my magic, making it a potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"Had I thrown this at you instead, your own magic would have finished the potion upon raising your defenses.\" Softly, he explained. \"Had it hit, you would have taken its full effects and be unable to cast a single spell until another witch gave you the antidote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered at the thought. \"That can't be legal.\" Whispering, you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not.\" Turning serious, dad replied. \"It's considered 'fighting dirty' by both laws.

Did we pass this test or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Joe and sighed. \"I don't know if you passed or not but it does seem as if you had made a choice through your actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Grumpy, Joe demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou produced a mirror for Joe to see himself. \"It looks like you have chosen to be...\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

With a heavy sigh, you led Joe away from the silo to the main road where you were both surprised to find aunt Abra Mage waiting for you. \"I had no part in this, kids.\" Serious, she said. \"I am only to drive you both home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe did not speak, he just stepped into the car with you following. The ride home was quiet and uncomfortable with no one daring to start any kind of conversation. It was not until we reached home when we found mom and dad waiting for us in the sitting room. \"I have brought them home.\" Sternly, Abra said. \"Beyond that, I will have no part of this. You know the rules of the Gauntlet, no further tests will be tolerated without council approval.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she left and you turned to find Joe staring down his parents. \"Why...?!\" Furious, he demanded. \"Why did you two send us through that house of horrors?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We deemed it necessary to force a choice.\" Serious, dad replied. \"There are four powers at play here and you could go either way, tipping the balance in anyone's favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Gauntlet is not ordered on a whim, Joe.\" Serious, mom added. \"We had to prove to the witch council and the chaotic collective that the test was necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My destiny is not yours or anyone else's to decide for me!\" Hysterical, Joe screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gauntlet does not choose anyone's destiny, Joe.\" Calmly, a feminine voice said. We turned to see a girl no older than twelve approaching us. \"It's purpose is to test which power is the strongest within you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange girl who had entered the conversation was petite with long blond hair, blue eyes and doll like features wearing a simple white dress and flats. \"What did you insane test reveal?\" Still angry, Joe demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It revealed that your powers are equal across the board.\" simply, the girl replied. \"I am Raven Falcon, your test councilor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When a cruel test is ordered upon a witch or mad scientist, a councilor is required to be present afterwords to help the one tested through the aftermath.\" Softly, you explained. \"She's here to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe grunted. \"I'm not in the mood to talk.\" Darkly, he said. \"I'm more in the mood to hit the gym so to calm my anger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven nodded. \"That is a good start.\" Smiling, she said. \"You know what is needed to calm the storm within you and have an urge to do so rather than to simply lash out in anger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe sighed. \"I'm going to the gym.\" annoyed, he said. \"Don't wait up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a full equip gym waiting for you in the basement.\" To your surprise, Raven said. \"We can both work out together as we talk over your post test issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe turned to Raven surprised then gave a short laugh. \"No offense but you hardly look like one who can keep up with my regiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven smiled kindly. \"I may surprise you.\" Teasing, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe shook his head. \"Alright... councilor.\" Softly, he said. \"Let's work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven turned to you. \"You must join us as you are required a councilor as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Working out is really not my cup of tea.\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please try.\" Calmly, Raven said. \"This is for both your benefits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you followed Joe and Raven to the basement where you did find a fully equip gym. Before Raven closed the door to the basement, she turned to mom and dad. \"I suggest you two seek council as well. such cruel tests have been known to create a rift within a family.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, witch born boys have magic too only it is physical in nature... this is why you are the strongest boy in the state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those who become too strong are called Ironclads.\" Softly, you said. \"Their magic power takes root but they are too physically powerful to shatter the forces keeping them male.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven nodded. \"This gives them inhuman attributes and makes them insanely magic resistant.\" Calmly, she said. \"They have the ability to throw spells back and shake the ground with a single stomp... a witch's worst nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there are mad scientists.\" Serious, you said. \"They have the power of chaotic energy which is why they are also called chaotic scientists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The power of a mad scientist is elemental but it comes from every Earth like planet in the known universe.\" Calmly, Raven said. \"Only boys have this power but chaotic born girls have power over the elements which, in effect, gives them the same powers as witch born boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those girls who become too strong are called Amazons.\" Keeping a soft tone, you said. \"They have the same powers as witch boys only it is elementally based rather than magic based.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... that's four powers...\" Wincing, Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fifth power is the normals.\" Serious, Raven said. \"They may not have magic or chaotic science but they are highly adaptable and have a power of their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What power is that?\" Surprised, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven was silent for a moment. \"The general science of a normal is nothing a witch or mad scientist to take lightly.\" Darkly, she replied. \"That and they out number us millions to one.

A short thin woman in a guard uniform smiled at you upon seeing you and Joe appear. \"Hello again, Gina.\" Kindly, she said. \"What brings you back here so soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again, Ms Harp.\" Kindly, you replied. \"My brother Joe had recently received brochures from this school.\" You then frowned and softly added, \"As well as one other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Harp nodded, pushing back her long black hair and Placed her green eyes onto Joe with a friendly smile. \"We are pleased that you have chosen to visit our school first, young man.\" Remaining kind, she said. \"Our school is far older and carries a long history of excellence.\" She then giggled and added, \"Though you will be required to wear the visitor's bracelet at all times during your visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled slightly, trying to hide your blush. \"I nearly forgot...\" You summoned a very curious  bracelet embroidered with tiny images of flowers, ballerinas, high heels, and other feminine symbols and forced it onto Joe's left wrist. \"Don't take that off until we are back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this supposed to do other than embarrass me?\" Blushing, Joe demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a magical device that protects you from the spells and enchantments that in turn protect those who come here to learn magic.\" Firmly but kindly, Ms Harp explained. \"If you take it off before the end of your visit, you will become a girl, a witch, and a student at this academy for the full school year.\" She then smiled.\"Fell free to remove the bracelet at any time you feel this school is for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms Harp!...\" Gasping, you scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Harp shrugged, giving an innocent smile. \"You can't blame a girl for trying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only shake your head at that as the gates were opened and you lead Joe towards the visitor's building to sign him in for a tour. On the way there, you noticed that Joe was looking everywhere, taking in the sights. \"One thing at a time, bro.\" Smiling, you said. \"We need to sign in first before we can go wandering around.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Joe noticed this as well and was becoming visibly nervous. You took Joe's hand and silently urged him to walk faster. While he followed with a quicker pace, you could hear some of the comments the new students were making behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Joe Mage, the heir to the throne of mad scientists!\" Whispering, one student remarked. \"What is he doing here at Cauldron Academy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be his sister, Gina Mage.\" Also whispering, another student said. \"I heard she was last year's top student, breaking all records.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third student giggled. \"She must have talked him into considering this school.\" Bemused, she whispered. \"We may get another student before classes begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say nothing, Joe.\" Carefully whispering, you warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctantly, Joe remained silent despite comments from the young witch students they passed and followed you into the administrations building where you found the head witch, Ella Mist  talking with the head of administrations. Ella Mist, your grandmother, was a  tall, slender woman with long black hair and fiery hazel eyes. She wore a flattering black dress and high heels that seemed to make no noise when she walked. The head of administrations, Miss Dust was a short, slightly plump woman with shoulder length brown hair and green eyes. She wore a suit dress that flattered her figure. The two stopped talking upon seeing you enter. Miss Dust seemed surprised where Ella merely smiled kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, Gina, Joe.\" Smiling, Ella said. \"This is a pleasant surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The recruiters started on Joe early.\" Wincing, you explained. You then smiled, adding, \"He had questions the brochures could not answer and decided to visit here first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A very wise choice, if I may say so.\" Grinning, Miss Dust said. \"Our school, although only for girls, offers an education and benefits that will greatly outweigh anything you may lose through a change in gender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all due respect, I am here for a tour, Miss Dust.\" Firmly but kindly, Joe said. \"I am looking for the facts, not a sales pitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am pleased to see that you are as cautious but not as blunt as your father.\" Smiling, Ella said. \"I do believe a tour can be easily arranged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be honored to personally lead your tour.\" Offering, Miss Dust said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You offer is appreciated.\" Calmly, Ella said. \"However, I believe it is in everyone's best interest if I conduct the tour myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I respectfully request the honor, madam head witch.\" Bowing slightly, Miss dust said. \"I vow not to fail you of this school...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... what's going on?\" Confused, Joe asked in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held back a giggle. \"They're arguing over who is going to give you the tour.\" Bemused, you whispered back. \"It's not often the 'prince' of all mad scientists requests a tour of witch school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So its political...\" Rolling his eyes, Joe whispered. \"Great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, having thinking the same thing less than an hour before and watched as Ella and Miss Dust politely argued who would give you the tour...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, I now see that it would be best if Gina lead the tour so it would be seen as a sister showing off her Alma Matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps one of us should accompany them then.\" Offering a compromise, Miss Dust said. \"At least this way we can guarantee our visitor has a pleasant tour of our fine school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Smiling, Ella replied. \"However, I believe this falls under the jurisdiction of the school prefects; I will summon them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick phone call, four teenage girls in security uniforms entered the office with serious expressions on their faces.

As Joe told me, he wants the facts, not a sales pitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four girls nodded, a bright smile forming upon their faces. \"Joe and Gina Mage are in good hands, madam head witch.\" Saluting, Val said. \"We will ensure a pleasant and informative tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the four teenagers lead you and Joe out of the office to begin the tour.

She was quite muscular for her age, clearly a tomboy. She motioned to an empty classroom where a lone female teacher was preparing her desk for up coming lessons. \"Pardon the intrusion, Ms Walker.\" Politely, Grace said. \"We are giving a extra special guest a tour of the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace was an inch taller than Val with short brown hair and hazel eyes. She was not muscular but you could sense that her magic was very strong. Joe, as you noticed, blushed slightly at her comment but remained silent. Ms Walker was a very short, elderly woman with white hair tied into a small bun near the top of her head and deep green eyes. She was professionally dressed and carried a willow wood cane with a small crystal ball on the top. She turned to the prefects with a single eyebrow raised, carrying a curious look on her face. \"Every student who comes here is special in their own way.\" Firmly but kindly, she said. \"How do you see this one individual as extra special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow us to introduce the heir to the throne of all mad scientists, Joe Mage.\" Politely, Sue said. \"He is considering this school but fears a sales pitch rather than the facts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue was the shortest of the group, standing at only five foot. She had mid-back black hair and green eyes. She was not strong in appearance but you sensed her magic was almost as strong as your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I just learned about all of this today.\" Blushing, Joe said. \"I was told I needed to make a choice but I need more facts before I can make such a life changing decision.\" He scuffed his feet, nervous. \"I'm not more special than anyone else. Honestly, I'd rather be an athlete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Walker smiled kindly. \"It is very rare to meet a humble mad scientist.\" Bemused, she said. \"Many boys of chaotic blood almost immediately go into a mental power trip when they discover the powers they have at their command.\" She giggled slightly. \"To be fair, I have also met young girls of witch blood who fell down the same path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you teach in your class?\" Curious, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I teach witching world history, Mr Mage.\" Firmly but kindly, Ms Walker explained. \"The history of the world at large is equally important; we must know the mistakes of our past so not to repeat them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you give an example?\" Showing interest, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look behind you.\" Smiling, Ms Walker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whipped your head around just as Joe did to find the prefects holding their wands at the ready, making Joe visibly panicked and you very annoyed. \"What is the meaning of this?!\" Alarmed, you demanded. \"What are you trying to do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Standard procedure when a mad scientist visits this school, Miss Mage.\" Flatly, Sal said. \"It's not personal, I assure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSal was the tallest of the group and nearly six foot with short auburn hair and brown eyes. She was visibly strong with strong magic as well. You knew you could take any one of them one but you were not sure about a four against one fight, if it came to that. \"We're just taking a tour.\" Annoyed, you said. \"Put those away, you are frightening my little brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not personal.\" Frowning, Sal repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Walker stepped in between you, Joe, and the prefects. \"No, its political.\" Sternly, she said. \"The standard procedure you are referring to only applies to a boy of chaotic blood who requests a tour alone.\" She then frowned holding up her cane. \"The laws governing this school clearly indicates that an armed escort is not required when the boy of chaotic blood is given in the company of a witch blood relative, regardless of the political status of the boy. As Soothsayer cadets, you are all required to know all the laws by memory. Put those wands away... now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four cadets, clearly embarrassed slowly sheathed their wands only Ms Walker was not through with them. \"I am deeply disappointed in you four as this could have easily become a public relations nightmare for this school.\" Scolding she said. \"What do you have to say in your defense, young ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four girls fumbled for an explanation only Joe spoke out. \"I believe they were working in my defense, Ms Walker.\" Softly, he said. \"As the heir to the throne of all mad scientists, anything that happens to me could generate a backlash. Also, grandma, err, Ella, the head witch made it clear that nothing unfortunate was to happen to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you believe that their wands being drawn was an act of defense?\" Raising an eyebrow, Ms Walked asked. \"Interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Confused, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Walker shook her head, bemused. \"You truly are a humble person.\" Smiling, she said. \"I am honored to have met you, young man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The honor is mine.\" Bowing slightly, Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Walker giggled. \"I must return to my duties but I urge you to visit the other classes and see all that we offer for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you recommend, Ms Walker?\" Politely, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Walker thought for a moment then replied, \"I would visit the...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had long honey blonde hair and piecing green eyes. \"Does this curious young lad have a name?\" Smiling, she asked. \"Also, who will be facing him in the unofficial entrance exam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to introduce my little brother, Joe Mage, Miss Flora.\" Smiling, you said. \"He came here looking for more information about this school. I offered to face him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Flora smiled, eying Joe. \"I am honored that the heir to all mad scientists has an interest in our school for magic.\" Kindly, she said. \"The rules of the exam are simple, young man.\" She pointed out two circles in the room. \"You and Gina will stand in their own circle. If you choose to resist, she will be firing energy blasts and spells at you in an attempt to push you out of the ring. The longer you resist, the higher you score. The test ends when you are either pushed out of the ring or you fall from exhaustion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you choose to test your power, the roles are reversed.\" Kindly, Gina explained. \"Only, you will have to use events and energy blasts you really have no training in using so Miss Flora will be running that test, if you choose that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I think I'll stick to resistance for now.\" Wincing, you said. \"I don't want to hurt anyone using something I don't really know how to properly use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Flora smiled. \"I am pleased to see you are cautious as well as wise.\" Calmly, she said. \"Let us begin, then. The record is two minutes and fifty seconds, set by Gina Mage. Take your places and begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Joe walked to the circle Miss Flora pointed out and faced each other. As you prepared to test your little brother, you noticed a large group of young witches and teachers were watching from the observational windows in the halls that surrounded the classroom. Joe noticed this as well and gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Calmly, you said. \"No one is allowed to interfere with the test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe nodded but he did not seem very convinced. The test began in earnest; you fired energy blasts at Joe who, although frightened and uncertain, managed to deflect each one as they came at him. As the one minute mark passed, you intensified your attack. Although none of those that managed to hit Joe caused no damage, they pushed him back a step. Still, he managed to keep up and take the steps he lost back. As the two minute mark passed, Joe began panting from his efforts to defend his spot. You were not sure if it was your pride or the fact you had an audience but you increased the power of your hits again, not wanting your brother, a boy to beat your time, the highest in recent school history. You gave one heavy push with a large energy blast, hoping to push Joe out of the ring or, at the very least, tire him out enough to quit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sue, Sal, and Grace stood behind the two of you while Val escorted four young girls into the room. Val ordered them to sit down across from you and Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this all about?\" Irritated, the first girl demanded. \"School has not even started yet and the prefects already want a meeting with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adey Marble, this is Joe Mage, heir to the throne of all mad scientists.\" Patiently, Val said. \"He is considering this school and wished to meet the students he would be working with if he chose to come here to learn magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdey looked at you and Joe. She was tall and slender but rather muscular for her age, around thirteen. She huffed. \"Picky are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned at that but smiled as Joe countered, \"Cautious. I like to know what I'm jumping into before I make a leap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please excuse my friend.\" Smiling, the second girl said. \"She's a bit protective. I'm Lena Verse; are you really thinking about becoming a girl to learn magic? I mean, it would be great if you do because we would have more girls in the class which means more fun in learning spells...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena was petite but not overly so with shoulder length brown hair and green eyes. She seemed to have energy to spare with the way she was smiling and carrying on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one of the options open to me.\" Politely, Joe interrupted. \"I like to explore all options before making a move. Especially since dad wanted a rush decision; its not my style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't that make your dad, well, angry?\" Wincing, the third girl asked. \"You are the heir to the throne so... he wouldn't want you to become a witch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad is not crazy about the idea, no.\" Kindly, you said. \"However, he knows that the choice is Joe's and Joe's alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third girl sighed, looking down rather than at you. She was very short with doll like features. She had mid back sun blond hair and blue eyes. Adey placed a hand onto her shoulder, causing her to jump. \"Sorry! I'm Lila Dove, it's a pleasure to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdey sighed, shaking her head. \" Lila is irrationally shy.\" Softly, she said. \"We are trying to get her to toughen up but she's got a long way to go to come out of her shell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's cut to the chase.\" Serious, the fourth girl said. \"I'm Zeva Quest; why did you want to meet with us? What would seeing us do to sway your decision one way or the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeva was an Amazon of a girl, tall and very muscular with long black hair and green eyes. She stood with her hands on her hips, waiting for a response. She was surprised though when Joe smiled kindly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to make certain you would not treat me differently just because of my 'royal' title.\" Politely, he replied. He moved his fingers up and down when he said 'royal' indicating sarcasm. \"I'm pleased to see you and the other girls treat me no better and no worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeva blinked then smiled slightly. \"So this meeting was a test.\" Bemused, she said. \"Interesting approach to test the waters, I must say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe blushed. \"It was also to test my nerve.\" Softly, he said. \"I'm a bit out of my element here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeva laughed. \"I never thought I'd see a humble mad scientist.\" Amused, she said. \"If you decide to study here, we'll help make a real woman out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe blushed even more at that, causing the other girls to giggle. You could not help giggle a little too; your brother was not the typical mad scientist as he was mostly raised by mom. Upon leaving the meeting on good terms with the young students, you took Joe to see the extra curricular activities the school offered. Upon reaching the athletic field, a number of girls ran up to you and Joe. You recognized them as the three gossipers who saw you escorting Joe in earlier.

Tasha had a pink ribbon in her hair while Nina had a light blue ribbon, and Tessa had a white ribbon. \"We are the 'TNT' triplets!\" Still smiling, Tasha said. \"Please allow us to be the first to welcome you as a new student to our great school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have made no commitments as of yet.\" Firmly but politely, Joe said. \"I still want to tour the other school before I make any decisions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasha pouted slightly but Nina spoke up quickly. \"That 'other school' as you so put it is a waste of time, in my opinion.\" Softly, she said. \"They abandon those who are not the best.\" There was a sad look in her eye.

My eldest daughter is with him as an observer to ensure there are no conflicts forcing his decision one way or the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Thorn grinned madly, his eerie yellow eyes glowing through his longish auburn hair. \"What fine specimens you have brought forth into this world!\" Eying you and Joe, he said. \"You should be proud, head mad scientist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pride is a dangerous emotion, Mr Thorn.\" Frowning deeply, dad scolded. \"It can blind you to any mistakes that stand right in front of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced at that, wondering what dad meant by that. Only dad was not done. \"That is what brought you down from head master to a lowly gate guard.\" He scowled at the guard, adding, \"Make no mistake; you must earn your way back to your former position; flattery is no shortcut to redemption.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard bowed his head, silent as dad then lead you and Joe through onto the grounds. \"What was that all about?\" Worried, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We mad scientists are responsible for every mistake we make, regardless of how insignificant it may seem.\" Darkly, dad replied. \"It was because of a miscalculation on the part of both witches and mad scientists that forever stranded hundreds of our kind in this world.\" He sighed. \"It was unanimously agreed by the new mad science think tank that any mistake uncorrected can and will cascade into disaster. We will not be a part of any repeat of the tragedies past mistakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Gulping, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"It is nothing for you to concern yourself too much with.\" Reaching the main doors, he said. \"Let us begin this tour on an uplifting note.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two heavy doors were opened by a pair of heavily armed guards and you entered with Joe and dad at your side. Just beyond the doors, you found yourself in an immense grand hall. Large elaborate gold chandeliers lit the scene as you looked down to the end to find a wide staircase that branched off into two directions to the floor above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We march straight ahead to administrations to log in as visitors.\" Smiling, dad said. \"Stay close and try not to be distracted by the sights; we will take them all in soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Joe shuddered hearing screams and moans echoing from the many halls followed by the mad laughter of hundreds of people from all directions. Seeing your reaction, dad placed a gentle hand onto your shoulder. \"The screams and moans you hear are actually the sirens that mark the end of a school day.\" Smiling, he said. \"You only hear screams and moans because you are not a student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought classes don't begin for a few days.\" Taken back, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first semester for first year students do not begin for a few days.\" Grinning, he said. \"Students have been known to train here well into adulthood depending upon their goals in life.\" He chuckled. \"The screams and moans are to scare away the curious should they sneak passed the gate guards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, dad opened a door marked 'administrations'. \"Shall we...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you walked into the administrations office with Joe and dad following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were twins; both of average height and weight with longish red hair, tied into a single braid, and green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Sir Geo.\" Smiling, the first man said. \"I see your son had come of age.\" He took notice of the bracelet on both yours and Joe's wrist. \"Who shall be bestowed the honor of giving your curious offspring the grand tour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is obvious that the head mad scientist wishes to give the tour himself, Mr Tom Yin.\" Calmly the second man said. \"Otherwise, he would have sent an escort from our fine establishment to accompany the lad and his sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your logic is flawed, Mr. Tim Yang.\" Patiently, Yin countered. \"For the head mad scientist to offer the tour, regardless of the fact he is the children's father, would create a PR nightmare on the political stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"Administrators, please.\" Calmly, he said. \"This tour shall be run by...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was tall and slender with a bald head and green eyes. He wore jeans and a T-shirt with a long white lab coat over it. \"Welcome, noble visitors to my humble class of magical balance.\" Bowing, he said. \"I am professor Bull Shields; you have sadly just missed my students comically failing to produce a magical test flame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't producing a magical flame trap you as a girl and a witch?\" Wincing, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only in cases where the flame ignites on its own.\" Patiently, Bull replied. \"When you summon it forth under your own free will, you are merely showing your magical potential compared to your levels chaotic energy.\" He then eyed you. \"I am certain your brother has already discovered his magical potential through a test flame...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, no.\" Wincing, Joe said. \"I am merely looking for the facts, not a sales pitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very wise and diplomatic.\" Grinning, Bull said. \"However, if you wish, I can walk you both through the steps of discovering your potential on both sides of the scale. The choice is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Joe who shrugged. \"Willingly producing a flame will not trap either you or I.\" Softly, he said. \"I'll try if you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced at that then turned to the students who had all become somewhat fascinated by their visitors and were waiting for your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It did not take long to find the power sleeping within you but you felt a twinge of fear when you tried to summon a test spark. \"Are you certain summoning a test spark will not change me?\" Wincing, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBull grinned. \"That was precisely the same fear my students had regarding summoning their magical test flames.\" Bemused, he said. \"The risks are minimal however, nothing ventured equals nothing gained. The choice is still yours, Miss Mage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing.\" Gulping, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou summoned a test spark into your hand only a boom shook the room causing both you, Joe, and the students to let out a surprised scream.

You saw this as a warning and quickly took a few steps back just before a loud boom nearly threw you off your feet. Joe's spark suddenly grew to become twice his size, literally surrounding his body!

Bull removed the goggles before shaking his head. \"Well, this is certainly a complex complication.\" Softly, he said. \"You and your sister are in for a rough transition, dear boy, I do not envy either of you at this time.\" He then turned to the students. \"Class dismissed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by a rough transition, professor?\" Wincing, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you possess the necessary power and lineage to claim the throne within your family.\" Serious, Bull explained. \"The fact your dormant power is equal to your magical power suggests that you are the proverbial coin that lands upon its side. Mr Mage's power is the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have already had my training as a witch.\" Taken back, you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is sadly irrelevant.\" Shaking his head, Bull said. \"You can still change genders without anyone's help as can your bother.\" He smiled. \"You are both destined for greatness but the question remains... who will claim which throne.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Refresh yourselves while you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then approached your group. \"Greetings, Coach Rock.\" Courtly, Thomas said. \"I have been given the honor to give prince Joe Mage a tour of our fine institution of elite learning with his sister, princess Gina Mage or the witching world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my humble gymnastics dueling class.\" Firmly but kindly, Rock said. \"Here we teach those who had passed normal gymnastics to use their skills in combating psychotic science and rogue magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am formally trained in gymnastics.\" Serious, Joe said. \"However, I am not trained in chaotic science as i have not yet decided which to train for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you are the proverbial coin that lands on its side.\" Smiling, Rock said. \"I now understand why your sister is accompanying you on this tour.\" He then turned to you. \"I have heard that you were the top student of your class, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"I was.\" Courtly, you replied. \"However, I am not interested in dueling anyone; it will distract me as an observer of my brother's tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock grinned, making you nervous. \"Actually, I was hoping you would be interested in allowing Joe to demonstrate his gymnastic abilities.\" Calmly, he said. \"Of course, with you firing harmless spells at him to show the importance of speed and balance in such duels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to try to dodge her spells using gymnastic moves?1\" Surprised, Joe demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock nodded. \"Does that sound appealing, prince Joe Mage?\" Smiling, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe turned from you to the gymnastics equipment then back to you.

You became worried when he added, \"I would love to show you my gymnastic skills, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock smiled. \"I would be honored to see you demonstrate your skills.\" Motioning to the equipment, he said. \"The floor is yours, good prince.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe blushed slightly but remained silent as he approached the equipment. Seeing how everything was set up, he smiled. You watched nervously as he started with the uneven bars and began to swing on them like an expert, moving from one bar to the other with incredible ease. Just when you thought he was about to dismount, he launched himself from the top bar and grabbed a hold of the two rings and began to work on them with just as much ease! From one station to another, Joe worked every piece without once touching the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew he was good but I never dreamed he was this good.\" Awestruck, you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your brother is a natural.\" Beaming, Rock said. \"My students pale by comparison.\" He chuckled before adding. \"Still, I would not expect much less from the mad science prince.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other students were beginning to gather around the equipment, watching Joe with their mouths half open in shock. One student in particular had a deep frown upon his face. \"Who does this upstart think he is, showing us up like this?!\" Angrily, he demanded. \"Get him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand down, Rick!\" Forcefully, Rock warned. \"That goes for all of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, Rick, frowned deeper as the other boys watched Joe with a certain annoyance.

She frowned upon noticing you but forced a smile as Joe waved you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you are back from Cauldron Academy.\" Evenly, Lydia said. \"I trust the experience made you more disciplined, not to mention more self controlled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it did more for me than your self teaching approach, Rune.\" Coldly, you countered. \"Not only do you not have a degree, you have already forgotten the law regarding transition choices of a male or female sibling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia gasped, feigning shock. \"Are you suggesting that I am purposely attempting to sway your little brother's life changing decisions?\" Whispering, she demanded. \"Have you heard even a whisper of our conversation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down, handing Joe his cinnamon roll and hot chocolate. \"You also forget that I am the granddaughter of the head witch, Rune.\" Serious, you said. \"I was not raised to be a fool; the timing of your presence here is too convenient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I wanted to be caught in the middle of a petty argument, I would have stayed home.\" Irritated, Joe snapped. \"Both of you change the subject or take your conversation elsewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia sighed before forcing a smile. \"I apologize, Joe.\" Softly, she said. \"As president of the student council, it is my duty to reach out to students in need.\" She shrugged. \"You face a difficult choice, given the status of your parents...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of which you have no training or authority to council him in as you are a self taught witch.\" Whispering, you interrupted. You then cleared your throat and turned to Joe. \"The advertisements in the food court were to play along with the theme all around the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe chuckled at that. \"That's a relief.\" Smiling, he said. He took a sip of his hot chocolate then abruptly spit it out. \"Too hot?\" Wincing, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe grunted then turned, annoyed before saying...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She turned to Kin Kai; she was a tall, slender woman with perfectly tanned skin, red hair and green eyes. She had a soft face and a figure most models would kill for; with the way she wore her long black sleeveless dress,Lydia guessed she knew this and took full advantage of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gina, darling!\" Grinning, Kin Kai gushed. \"Has it already been a year?!\" She eyed Joe and briefly looked at Lydia. \"I see you are discussing Joe's enrollment into witch school; very good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are discussing Joe's options, including witch school, aunt Kin.\" Politely, you countered. \"Lydia merely stopped by our table to chat at bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKin Kai blinked, a sense of disappointment showing but she quickly covered it up with a smile. \"But of course, dear.\" Sweetly, she said. \"The choice must be hers, err his after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are in the middle of a conversation, ma'am.\" Bluntly, Lydia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That we are, young lady.\" maintaining her smile, Kin Kai said. \"I must say it was rude of you to interrupt it.\" She waved her hand, as if to dismiss her. \"Why don't you run along like a good little girl and allow the adults to have a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia opened her mouth, insulted and was about to speak only there was a certain madness in Kin Kai's eyes that moved her to walk away. As she left, you sighed, shaking your head. \"Please, aunt Kin; Joe is having a rough day.\" Softly, you said. \"I'm trying to help him calm down so he can make a clear decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKin Kai smiled at Joe. \"There is no need to worry, dear nephew.\" Cooing, she said. \"I have the perfect solution to your problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe raised an eyebrow but did not speak. Mom had warned him and you about Kin Kai's love for twisting people's words and using those words against them. Kin Kai giggled, seeing Joe was not taking the bait. \"Here is the solution I offer, Joe.\" Sweetly, she said. \"Use it as you see fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her hand, causing a box to appear onto the table and walked away.

For the Ironclads, their powers come to bear naturally but there is a balance.\" She smiled. \"Ironclads must build and maintain their strength through training where Amazons can summon their full strength almost instantly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Amazons can strike faster and harder, if needed.\" Thoughtful, Lena said. \"That's interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are partially correct, Lena.\" Serious, Grace said. \"Although an Amazon can summon their full strength and beyond quickly, they tire out more easily.

A proper little girl asks for what she wants politely if she wants the response she desires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held back a giggle, knowing mom expected Joe to behave as a proper young lady when she asks to be changed back. Joe moaned at that then reluctantly nodded in agreement. Mom then kindly smiled before turning to you. \"It's time to pick up Ina and Tia from ballet.\" Calmly, she said. \"Do you think we should take Joelle with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned at that then replied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was tall and slender with long red hair in a neat bun and green eyes, wearing a similar dance costume. They were nothing more than one-piece swimsuits with a short skirt attached with leggings and ballet flats. You and Joe watched as the girls danced gracefully across the floor, practicing a number for an up coming recital. Seeing mom enter with you and Joe, she smiled and clapped her hands, motioning the girls to stop dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is all for today, my little angels.\" Kindly, she said. \"You have come a long way; I am proud of you all. Please remember to return here tomorrow for final rehearsals for the recital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were dismissed and they hurried off to the changing rooms while Miss Franz walked up to mom, Joe, and you. \"It's always a pleasure to see you again, Mona.\" Smiling, she said. She motioned to you. \"Who is this little angel you brought with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe blushed, causing you to giggle slightly as mom smiled. \"This is my niece, Joelle.\" Bemused, mom replied. \"She's the biggest tomboy you will ever meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Franz giggled before sighing. \"The recital will go on as planned but the girls will not be able to compete in the international ballet competitions this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear.\" Wincing, mom said. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Franz sighed. \"One of the girls pulled out due to illness.\" Sadly, she said. \"She will not be well enough in time.\" Again, she sighed. \"The girls were so looking forward to it as they would be the youngest ballerinas to ever enter the competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been set up.\" Frowning, Joe whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her, you knelt down. \"We did not know this until just now.\" Whispering, you explained. \"Magic can't be used for this, no matter how much we want it to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, dear.\" Seeing Joe frowning, Miss Franz said. \"Did you wish to say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe moaned before sighing. \"I know ballet.\" Softly, she said. \"I like gymnastics better though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Franz looked at Joe with hope in her eyes. \"You know ballet?\" Slowly smiling, she asked. \"Would you be willing to help our ballerinas enter the competition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe turned to mom, a sour look on her face. You knew that she was not liking any of this and felt as if she had been set up to join ballet. Still, Joe knew how hard Ina, Tia, and their ballet class worked to earn the chance to compete against older ballerinas. Sure it was only an exhibition match but it was still considered an honor for a young ballerina just to be there. You smiled, proud of your temporary new cousin as she muttered, \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid!\" Obviously pleased, Miss Franz chirped. \"I will get the paperwork ready straight away and let the girls know that their trip has not been canceled!\" She gave Joe a light kiss on the forehead. \"Thank you, my little angel; you made a lot of little girls happy today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Miss Franz had run off, mom giggled. \"You did not have to do that.\" Bemused, she said. \"Still, I am proud of you for agreeing to help Ina and Tia's class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did the right thing... Joelle.\" Kindly, you added. \"You have a good heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well just make sure I don't get stuck this way.\" Near tears, Joe said. \"I want to be an Olympian gymnast, not a ballerina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be your male self again once this is over, Joe.\" Smiling, mom said. \"So long as nothing happens to cause a permanent change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Taken back, Joe demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom never got to answer as a chorus of happy screams were heard as a group of little girls, still in their ballet costumes, rushed out towards Joe with Ina and Tia leading the way. You noticed Joe wince as you both saw Ina carrying a ballet costume in Joe's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Joelle.\" Smiling, Tia said. \"We were going to have a sleepover after class today why don't you join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe blushed at that and turned to mom and you with pleading eyes. In a way, you felt sorry for your transformed brother but you also knew that no harm would come to 'her' going to sleepover other than some embarrassment. \"Try to remember that Joelle as a tomboy, Tia.\" Smiling, you said. \"She's really not into such things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be right if she didn't go.\" Speaking up, another girl said. \"Besides, other than Ina and Tia, we're all tomboys here.\" She smiled at Joe. \"I'm Ron or Rina Dove and this is Chris or Christina Verse, Jessie or Jessica Marble and Frank or Frankie Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all nodded as they were introduced. Ron or Rina was about Ina's height with blond hair, blue eyes. Chris or Christina was a few inches shorter with brown hair, brown eyes. Jessie or Jessica was about Joe's height with black hair and blue eyes. Frank or Frankie had blond hair and green eyes. All of them had doll like features and their hair done up in a bun on the top of their heads. Joe turned from one to the other, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a boy and a girl's name?\" Taken back, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know that's you, Joe.\" Smiling, Ina said. \"Tia and I had to get special permission to join this ballet team.\" She giggled, handing Joe the ballerina costume. \"Tell her, mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what?\" Nervous, Joe asked. \"Do I have to change into this now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused as well and turned to mom who giggled. \"Gina, Joe, this is a ballet school exclusively for transformed boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe's eyes widened. \"It's what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of us are forced to join.\" Smiling, Rina said. \"Only, until the semester ends, we have to take on our girl names and live as little girls at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its better than going through magic resistance training.\" Wincing, Christina added. \"Here, we are treated just like any other little girl and it is forbidden to push our resistance at home while in this program, learning ballet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of these... girls are of witch blood.\" Serious, mom explained. \"Learning ballet will give them added strength, balance, and dexterity so to dodge spells when they graduate this school and are changed back to their male selves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want to join us at the slumber party?\" Smiling, Frankie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Miss Franz stepped in, smiling with the necessary paperwork for mom to sign, which she did, then turned to Joe. \"Welcome to Tomboy ballet school, Joelle.\" Smiling, she said. \"We are very happy to have you with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to put this on?\" Wincing, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Franz giggled. \"Only if you want to do some late practicing with me tonight.\" Bemused, she replied. \"We still have a few more days so we can get you caught up starting tomorrow.\" She then clapped her hands. \"Okay, my little angels; get back into your regular clothing. Your parents are waiting to take you all to the slumber party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls cheered as they ran for the changing rooms, leaving Joe and you blushing slightly. \"Maybe I should go with her as a chaperone; you know, to keep an eye on her.\" Whispering, you said. \"Ina and Tia might have some mischief in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"That's a fine idea, Gina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you felt something changing.

I'll call your father...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad and I got disconnected, mom.\" Wincing, you said. \"He might be a tad grumpy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom frowned at that. \"He hasn't seen grumpy yet.\" Flatly, she said. \"When I get through with him for not informing me he had found Joe...\" She sighed, seeing Joe shaking his head. \"I'll be civil with him, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe released a sigh then turned to you. \"I guess we should head home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at mom who giggled slightly before ending the call and causing the crystal ball to vanish. \"You might want to prepare yourself, bro.\" Bemused, you said. \"Teleportation can be a bit disorienting the first few times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teleportation?\" Surprised, Joe asked. \"You can do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled then teleported Joe and yourself back to the house. Joe stumbled slightly but managed to keep his balance as he shook his head. \"What a rush...\" Taken back, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and mom giggled. \"Not bad for your first time, Joe.\" Smiling, mom said. \"Most boys pass out the first time around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because we raised him to be strong.\" Appearing in the room, dad said. \"He is, after all my son, my legacy, my apprentice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is also my son, Geo.\" Coldly, mom said. \"You failed in your duty as my husband to be true to me; care to explain your actions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your take of the situation is flawed only by your heightened emotional state.\" Flatly, dad argued. \"I was completely truthful; I merely chose my own time to tell the entire truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omission of the truth is still a falsehood.\" Unimpressed, mom countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something you are both guilty of when involving me!\" Annoyed, Joe blurted out. \"Stop arguing with each other and give me some answers, if you don't mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and dad looked at each other, surprised. \"He has a point.\" Wincing, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"Indeed.\" Sighing, he said. \"We do owe him at least an explanation.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Plenty of tomboys I know all wear dresses like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, you zipped the dress up in the back and tied the sash, sealing Joe in the dress she had picked out, even though wearing a dress was not her true intention. \"Cheer up, honey.\" Seeing Joe pout, mom said. \"We can take you shopping for some other clothes later on today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shopping?\" Uncertain, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be a week on and a week off, Joe.\" Serious, you said. \"You are going to need a small wardrobe for the weeks you are a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe moaned at that as you handed her a pair of flats, which she reluctantly put on. \"Now that you are dressed, we can move on to the next step.\" Smiling, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the next step?\" Nervous, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled, looking at you. This caused you to smile as well, making Joe visibly uncomfortable. \"The next step is to make you feel comfortable in your new form.\" Smiling, you said. \"Magic is easier to learn when the girl, that's you, is relaxed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you reached for...<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

It was easy enough to get them to see Joe as always being Joeanna but going any further a week on and a week off carried risks of something going wrong.

Joe gasped seeing this and began to panic only mom spoke out before she could utter a word. \"We are not here to turn you into our little princess, Joe.\" Serious, she said. \"We are here to show you one of the ways we girls like to unwind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is getting your hair done relaxing?\" Wincing, Joe demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom winked. \"Only one way to find out, isn't there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled at that. \"Come along, Joe.\" Smiling, you said. \"This is not going to hurt a bit and I promise you will be more relaxed when its done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctant, Joe followed you out of the car and mom lead you both in where you were greeted by one of the hairstylists. She was of average height and build with long strawberry blond hair and blue eyes. \"Welcome back, Gina.\" Kindly, she said. \"It's good to see you again, Mrs Mage; I take it you want the usual treatments?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you, Miss Eve.\" Smiling, you said. \"We would also like to introduce you to our new sister, Joeanna.\" You giggled. \"She's a bit of a tomboy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Eve giggled, making Joe blush slightly. \"Would she like the same treatment?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Define treatment.\" Pouting, Joe demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, mom, and Miss Eve giggled. \"She is a tomboy.\" Amused, Miss Eve said. She turned to Joe. \"I'll walk you through the steps as we take your worries away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... I guess.\" Hesitant, Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Eve beamed. \"Wonderful! Let's get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Joe was lead to one of the chairs where Miss Eve began to wash her hair. You giggled, seeing her expression melt into a slight grin, while you and mom took chairs of your own and allowed your own treatments to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing.\" Calmly, mom said. \"Nothing overly girlish for Joeanna; it was part of the agreement to get her here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Eve nodded. \"Beautiful but not overly girlish; got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the treatments continued, you kept a weary eye on Joe, hoping that mom's plan to get her to relax before shopping does not backfire on her. After the shampoo treatment came hair styling, nail filing and painting, then a light makeover. At first, Joe protested but Miss Eve assured him that everything easily washes off. Still hesitant, Joe reluctantly agreed. When the treatments were done, Miss Eve turned Joe's chair to a wall mirror. \"Well, what do you think?\" Smiling, she asked. \"Are you cute or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe stared at himself in the mirror, a stunned look on her face.  \u201cWhat have they done to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delicate layers of make-up gave her face an angel like glow. The light shade of soft pink on her lips and the small shimmering diamonds Miss Eve slipped onto her earlobes enhanced the effect greatly. The bright ivory color painted onto her fingernails went well with the ivory sash on the simple dress she was wearing.  The simple long, flowing southern belle hairstyle Miss Eve had given her finished the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to you and mom, uncertain. Both you and mom had similar looks, making her and you look very attractive. \"You look very pretty, honey.\" Gushing, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to hide your worry as you asked Joe, \"What do you think of your new look, over all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe's lips quivered slightly before she stated, \"I don't know whether to thank you or strangle you.\" With a pout, she said. \"I have to admit, the girl in the mirror looks cute but now that girl is going to be chased by practically every boy in the mall.\" She sighed then whispered. \"This 'training' better be worth all the trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou released a breath, relieved that Joe did not demand to be sent home. \"It's worth it, sis.\" Smiling, you said. \"Also, don't worry, we'll keep the boys at bay.\" You giggled. \"Still, I think I'm way prettier than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe looked at you as if she had been insulted. \"Hey!\" He paused. \"Wait a minute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, mom and Miss Eve laughed, causing Joe to blush brightly, making her look even more cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The walls at the cavern's far ends seemed to have been lined with an endless number of books from the floor to the high ceiling. There was also a vast circular garden with a wide variety of plants growing and several table stations which were used for any number of reasons.

Seeing your startled look, mom added, \"I'm kidding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, shaking your head. There were videos made by witches which were used to brainwash witch boys into perfectly behaved little girls in times of heavy stress. Only a key phrase was needed to snap the boy out of it. However, it was deemed as 'extreme parenting' due to the infinite ways it could lead to disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are my choices?\" Curious, Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Well, you can watch me tutor a class in magical self defense or make a simple potion.\" Calmly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could also take you on a ride on a broomstick or show you how to control your test flame.\" Jumping in, you added. \"The choice is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe turned from you to mom then back to you again, trying to decide.

She jumped and blurted out, \"Sorry! I'm Lila Dove, it's a pleasure to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighed. \"My daughter, Lila is a siren witch.\" Somewhat sadly, she explained. \"She can swoon most boys with her singing voice which has lead her to become irrationally shy.

She stood with her hands on her hips, waiting for a response. She was surprised though when Joe smiled kindly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic is a science as it is a study and chaotic science is a magic as only certain bloodlines can control it or even understand it.\" Calmly, she replied. \"I want to know where the similarities end and the differences begin so to better make a decision which power is best for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeva blinked, taken off guard by Joe's response though her mother, Natasha gave a bemused smile. \"That is a very diplomatic answer, young lady.\" Smiling, she said. \"Well done; your mother raised you well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom blushed slightly at Natasha's compliment. \"I invited <i>Joeanna</i> to watch a magical self defense class to get a better idea of how magic works and perhaps entice her to join in on one or two lessons.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anyone care to try their hand at beating that score?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all eagerly rose their hands and mom chose Adey to go first who stepped forward into a ring painted onto the stone floor. \"Will I be firing or resisting?\" Curious, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be resisting.\" Calmly, mom replied. \" She discretely motioned to Joe. \"This will be a lesson in overzealous magic... Remember, one on one only.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parents smiled, bemused while you rolled your eyes. You knew what mom had in mind and you did not like it. The test was to see if Joe's protective nature would move him to protect you should your opponent start firing instead of resisting or worse the others gang up on you. The students, you noticed, were also uncertain of mom's instructions. Of course, you were trained to take on four witches at once though your record score there was significantly lower than a one on one with a teacher of greater power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may begin when ready.\" Calmly, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe test began in earnest with Adey blocking a deflecting energy blasts you were firing at her but, as you guessed, she began firing back. You were ready for it and easily blocked them. This was necessary for a teacher to know as sometimes the one being tested takes the resistance test personally and begins to go one the offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are supposed to be resisting, not firing, Adey.\" In mock anger, mom scolded. \"Stand down or be disqualified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdey winced, knowing what the test was and ignored mom as Zeva joined in and began to fire at you as well. This made it more difficult for you but not impossible as you were only blocking and deflecting energy blasts rather than spells. You took a look at Joe out of the corner of your eye and saw that he was concerned. <i>\"Knowing him, he'll jump in at any moment to protect me, not knowing its just a test.\"</i> Wincing, you thought. <i>\"I just hope mom knows what she is doing, he could get hurt.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Lena and, reluctantly, Lila joined in. You had no time to look to see what Joe was doing as it was four against one but you could hear him protest to mom about fairness. Only you did not hear mom respond which you knew from experience drove Joe crazy. You did not have long to wait as Joe did jump in and, to your great surprise, literally punched each and every energy blast back at the student witches!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave my sister alone!\" Angrily, he shouted. \"Try ganging up on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students each let out a scream of surprise as their own blast waves were thrown at them, placing them all on both the offensive and defensive at once! Within seconds, he was knocking them all clear out of the ring. Once the last student, Zeva was knocked down, mom raised her hand. \"That is enough!\" Firmly but kindly, she ordered. \"Thank you for participation in this lesson, Joe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe turned to mom, confused. \"What...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do apologize for baiting you, dear.\" Smiling, mom said. \"Only I needed you to teach these young ladies that a transformed boy is not to be taken lightly just because he has no training in magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But dad is a mad scientist.\" Taken back, Joe protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all witches fall in love with a mad scientist, Joe.\" Serious, mom countered. \"Only even witch boys born of a normal man has power.\" She smiled at the confused looks of the students. \"They are blessed physically as their dormant magical power enhances their bodies to an extreme degree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of boys born to mad scientists?\" Gulping, Lila asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"They merely have power either way.\" Calmly, mom explained. \"However, that power must first surface and then they must be trained in how to use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only Joe has no training in either power.\" Catching her breath, Adey said. \"How was he able to beat us so quickly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, once magic is used against a witch boy, regardless of who his father is, he or 'she' gains the ability to see magic.\" Smiling, mom said. \"The second reason...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe smiled. \"I am the reigning champion at the extreme whack-a-mole game in the local mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes before giggling. \"What was his time in the defense test, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled, again, showing pride. \"Well, you narrowly beat your old score of four against one before Joe jumped in to 'rescue' you.\" Bemused, she said. \"As for Joe, she...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One girl in particular was Lydia Rune. She was tall and slender with shoulder length brown hair and blue eyes. She had a reputation of misleading people without breaking any rules of conduct. You and Lydia were rivals even before you went to Cauldron Academy as you ran against her for student body president. You had won but going to witch school allowed her to win due to your 'temporary transfer'. Lydia's student body council was literally all made up of witches but that did not last under father's scrutiny. Now there was a balance of witches and mad scientists, another reason you and Lydia were rivals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch, you and Joe sat at an isolated table to talk only Lydia invited herself and one other student council member to sit with you, a mad scientist named Josh Gary. He was of average height with crew cut black hair and brown eyes. He was always professionally dressed, making him stand out like a soar thumb at school. You were about to urge Joe to move to another table when Lydia spoke. \"If I wanted to cause you trouble, I would have come alone, Mage.\" Ice in her voice, she said. \"This is official council business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I highly doubt it.\" Frowning, you said. \"This is a family affair of which you both know well the council is forbidden to interfere in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wish to determine the nature of this family affair.\" Bluntly, Josh said. \"Is this magic resistance training or a love tiff between your mother and father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both.\" Frowning, Joe said. \"I am learning magic for a week as Joeanna then I will learn mad science for a week shortly after a rest to determine which is more to my liking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. Joe was always a little too honest for her own good. Upon hearing this, Lydia grinned while Josh frowned. \"So you are the proverbial coin that lands upon its side.\" Softly, he said. \"That complicates things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so dramatic, Josh.\" Grinning, Lydia said. \"It's simple, really. If you remain a girl, you will become the next head witch ahead of your sister.\" She frowned. \"If you stay a boy, you will  become the next head mad scientist after your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite.\" Serious, Josh said. \"If you are permanently changed into the female state against your will, then you become the next heir ahead of your sister. If you choose to be female, you do not jump up in line.\" He smiled. \"As a boy and heir to the chaotic throne, you will gain great power and respect as opposed to just being a silly little witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sparked an argument between the two prompting Joe to leave the table. You quickly followed him out of the cafeteria to a small bench outside where he sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so confused...\" Tearfully, he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced, not knowing what to say. It was true that you left out the forced and not forced aspects of becoming a witch but you feared that would frighten Joe away from even trying magic at all. \"Do you want to talk about this?\" Softly, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe shook her head. \"I just need time to think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not surprisingly, the hall was completely empty of normal people.

Before, dad merely dismissed it as a little girl trying to bond with her father. Only he sensed something different about Tia's power levels this time. \"Hold perfectly still for me.\" Firmly but kindly, he said. \"I want to see for myself what you had experienced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia held as still as a seven year old could and dad looked directly into her eyes. With his power, he accessed her mind and was able to see what she she had seen within the past several hours. To his surprise and somewhat delight, he confirmed that Tia did indeed saw what she had claimed. Billions of blue and green strands of data streaming across the sky in all directions. As dad released Tia's mind, he moved his hand from the top of her head to her cheek in a loving manner. \"You are experiencing what we chaotic scientists refer to as the supreme cerebrum awakening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia's eyes danced with excitement and anticipation. \"Does that mean I can work your chaotic science, Daddy?\" Whispering, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"Let us first see if you transform on your own.\" Kindly, he said. \"You have made your father very pleased and very proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia grabbed a hold of dad's hands, joyful tears running down her face. \"Dad knelt down, smiling and pulled her into a gentle hug. \"If you become a boy either you or Joe will become my heir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia's celebration faltered slightly. \"You mean if Joe doesn't want magic, he gets to be taught by you?\" Looking hurt, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has the same right to choose as you do, my dear.\" Patiently, dad said. \"Only he was born first so the choice is his to make first.\" Seeing Tia's frustration, he added, \"If he chooses magic and you become a boy, you will be my soul heir to the throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Tia reappeared back inside her bedroom. \"If Joe chooses magic, dad will spend more time with me, teaching me his science.\" Thoughtful, she muttered. \"So all I have to do is get Joeanna to want to stay a girl.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had to announce yourself as the heir to the throne, being mom's daughter. Upon doing so, the other witch families reluctantly withdrew their bids for the throne,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should all be in one booth together.\" Softly, Joe said. \"To show that we are united rather than divided despite our different powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well said, Joeanna.\" Appearing beside you, dad said. \"The separate booths are merely a formality but I see no harm in sharing one booth to show unity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you given your report to the collective council?\" Curious, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"I have informed the collective council that there are two viable candidates who would make fine heirs to the throne.\" Eying you and Tia, dad replied. \"We are still weighing the options as both potential heirs are still rather young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom grinned at that but nodded then turned her attention to the gymnasium as the exercises began with a short speech about Ironclads and Amazons.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A number of young witches, including Ina and Tia screamed in fright. He then sent forth a powerful energy blast at the audience then lifted a number of heavy weights with his mind and threw them at the audience as well, causing even more frightened screams from the young witches. Fortunately, the blast wave and weights were stopped cold by the Soothsayers or witch police and Correction officers or mad science police. This left many young witches pale with fear as they turned to their brothers, uncertain. A few mothers had gulped with the same look of uncertainty on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a witch boy, all of his attributes and senses are off the scale by normal standards from the day they are born.\" Calmly, he explained. \"As such, a witch boy must be trained at a very early age to control that raw physical power.\" He then frowned. \"However, at such a young age, they cannot know of magic until they are much older and learn more restraint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then waved his mother forward who stood beside him. Mrs Trina Lore was a petite, doll like  woman with long rosewood hair and green eyes. She stood a few inches shorter than her son. \"Witch born boys learn to control their strength naturally.\" Serious, she said. \"However, when pushed into a rage, their dormant magic sends those attributes into overdrive.\" She sighed. \"There has been a growing number of cases where a witch boy has broken the limbs of their sister or mother after a magical prank or test that fell out of hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is also a growing number of cases where a witch boy's dormant magical power has taken root but is too physically powerful for the magic to shatter the fores that keep him male.\"  Smiling, Thomas added. \"That is where we come in! We teach witch boys to harness their natural skills to become the guardians of their witch family, the protectors of their secrets against the normal world!\" He held his head up high with pride. \"We are the Ironclads!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large number of witch boys stood up in applause with a few of their sisters and mothers joining them. You turned to Joe to see her applauding with the boys though not near as enthusiastically. She caught you looking and sighed. \"I don't see myself as a body guard for mom or dad or even you or the twins.\" Shrugging, she said. Mom is an expert in combat magic, dad is the head mad scientist, you graduated at the top of your class and the twins have teleportation on their side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you see yourself as?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe sighed, looking between mom and dad and you nodded in understanding. She was still felt trapped between wanting to make them both proud.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She and Thomas work together as strong advocates for the rights of all witch boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Thomas walked back to the sidelines with his mother, Rachael Scott walked to the middle of the gymnasium while a number of girls quickly set up a number of props. You raised an eyebrow at the candles and clear containers, some empty and others filled with water. \"Mad scientists, also known as chaotic scientists, are males with the elemental power of magic.\" Serious, she began. \"Like witches, many prefer to have their daughters and sister believe that they have no real power unless they are transformed into the male state.\" She then grinned. \"This is also a myth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany young witches and mad scientists alike braced themselves for a violent demonstration but were instead met with Rachael firing streams of fire from her fists and feet, elegantly lighting candles that were set up around her. She then fired water in the same manner, filling the empty containers before freezing them. She then produced wind in the same fashion, blowing out the candles before lifting it all and moving them aside with her mind. Finally, she tapped the floor, shaking the room slightly. This brought on a few startled yelps from the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like witch boys, chaotic girls possess off the scale attributes as well as certain powers.\" Smiling, Rachael explained. \"Many chaotic families have learned through painful experience that strong emotions augment these once thought dormant powers resulting in injury due to tests or pranks that have fallen out of control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then waved her father to her who complied with a grin. Mr. Grey T. Scott was a tall and thin with longish white hair and deep blue eyes. He politely cleared his throat before approaching the microphone. \"Yes, well... chaotic girls possess the ability to manipulate one or two of the five elements of Earth to a limited degree.\" Calmly, he explained. \"That said, they have the ability to not only hold their own but to level the playing field so to speak. Obviously, this requires training so to maintain the shroud of secrecy mad scientists work within.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like witch boys, chaotic girls have been known to find that their magical power had taken root but remained female due to their physical strength protecting the barrier that separates the genders.\" Smiling, Rachael added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When this occurs, these girls obtain the power to control all five elements of Earth.\" Cracking a grin, Grey said. \"They become protectors of our secrets, guardians of our research, and so much more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We train young chaotic girls to control their powers so to have a say in their family, to have a place in the chaotic world.\" Proudly, Rachael said. \"We are the Amazons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, a number of girls rose and cheered with a few boys and men joining them. You turned to Joe to again see her applauding but with the same lack of enthusiasm. Seeing your worried expression, dad smiled kindly. It was rare to see as he is usually always serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe has many years to decide his path in life.\" Whispering carefully, he said. \"Both leadership roles require the ability to deal well with great pressure and hard decisions, this is but a taste of what he or she as well as you will face later in life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, it became more clear why mom and dad were acting the way they were. Joe was being tested before he was even really being trained. <i>\"Experience is the harshest of teachers.\"</i> Sighing, you thought. <i>\"It tests first and teaches after.\"</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sighing, you complied and joined Thomas on the gymnasium floor. \"What exactly do you require of me, Prince Thomas?\" Politely, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be trying to change me into the female state while I try to advance.\" Serious, Thomas said. \"My task is to tag you. The purpose of this is to show that the odds are more even than some witches and Ironclads like to think. the time limit is one minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and took a defensive position while Thomas stood several feet away, taking the same stance before beginning his advance. He began by shaking the floor in an attempt to throw you off balance. Only you trained for that and managed to remain steady. You fired spells, fully intending to win as losing, in your mind, would certainly cause a loss of face with your fellow witches. Only, despite your efforts, Thomas was able to dodge or deflect every spell and even threw a few right back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Okay, I need to limit my spells to those he can't throw back.\"</i> Calmly, you thought. <i>\"Otherwise, he can distract me to get closer.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your efforts, you were unable to hit Thomas but he was unable to get close enough to to tag you. A buzzer sounded marking the end of the minute and you both stopped before bowing to each other. \"As you can see, unless one catches the other off guard, the odds are fairly even.\" Firmly, Thomas said. \"Once a witch boy is effected by magic, he can see it coming and dodge it with his natural physical skills.\" He then smiled. \"However, a witch has the power to easily dodge any blow a witch boy can muster with their magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and there is a safeguard in all witch households.\" Calmly, you added. \"Any combination of witch, witch boy or Ironclad who gets into a magical fight will find themselves three year olds with no power to change back until another witch restores them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas nodded. \"The same safeguard exists in all chaotic households.\" Serious, he said. \"Any combination of chaotic scientist, chaotic girl, or Amazon who gets into a magical fight will find themselves in the same situation.\" He then turned to you. \"Thank you, Princess Gina for helping me with this demonstration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my pleasure, Prince Thomas.\" Politely, you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you returned to your seat where mom waited with a bemused smile on her face. \"Well done, Gina.\" Softly, she said. \"You did not hold back. Had you did, it would have raised suspicions of favoritism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at that knowing everyone suspected you and Thomas had a crush on each other. \"We're just friends.\" Lamely, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled while dad expertly hid a smile of his own. \"We can discuss this later.\" Calmly, he said. \"The next demonstration is about to begin.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A yep reached your ears and you confronted a teenage girl you had seen around school. Her name was Abby Cane. She was about a year younger than you with shoulder length red hair and deep green eyes. She wore the Cauldron Academy uniform with a cloak too big for her covering it. You guessed she had borrowed it from her mother. Abby was a well known trouble witch, she enjoyed playing pranks on normal teenage boys, seducing them into doing all sorts of crazy things for nothing more than her own twisted amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have less than a minute before my mother, or worse, father detects your presence and takes proper action, Cane.\" Darkly, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother and father are busy dealing with my two new little friends who are right now visiting your temporary sister, Joeanna and your little sisters, Ina and Tia.\" Grinning, Abby countered. \"Normal boys are annoying but they are at least useful as a few minute distraction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Cane?\" Ice in your voice, you demanded. \"It's one in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know if you are really willing to step down as heir to the throne.\" Grinning, Abby said. \"You know there are many witches who frown upon a transformed boy becoming head witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is only if her transformation is forced.\" Unimpressed, you said. \"The choice must be hers or his as it was mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are many mad scientists who would see that transformation forced to gain a foot hold in their campaign to take your father's throne.\" Frowning, Abby said. \"You need to think about what is right for your own kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My own kind...\" Annoyed, you asked. \"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are Joe's older sister.\" Grinning, Abby said. \"He listens to you. That said, if he takes the chaotic throne, the witching world can take back what is rightfully theirs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know where this is going.\" Becoming angered, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm running out of time.\" Stepping back to the window, Abby said. \"Think about this, you know I am right. Your brother is the key to making us rulers of this world again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she was gone just as mom rushed into the room with a look of concern. \"We caught two love sick normal boys climbing into Joeanna and Ina's bedrooms.\" Worried, she said. \"We dispatched them through use of the local authorities. Have you received any such visit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"Those boys were pawns.\" Frowning, you replied. \"Abby Cane used them to distract you and dad so she could talk to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relay your conversation so we may take appropriate action.\" Firmly, dad demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told mom and dad what Abby had said to which both frowned. \"Such outdated, obsolete thinking.\" Shaking his head, dad muttered. \"I will post a report of her rhetoric to the Failure Oversight Department.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for telling us, Gina.\" Softly, mom said. \"The Cane family is well known for stirring up trouble.

If Abby did indeed break witch and chaotic law to come visit me, it could tarnish that reputation.\" Before your parents would respond, you quickly added. \"However, if we were to graciously allow the incident to slide without it reaching the ears of either council...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She would owe us a debt of honor.\" Smiling, dad finished. \"Deviously clever, my dear spell weaving daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She would want to pay that debt as quickly as possible to avoid any uncomfortable questions as the debt will partially be owed to a mad scientist.\" Thoughtful mom said. \"Do you have any ideas regarding that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Joe is nearly halfway through the process of making a decision.\" Calmly, you said. \"He has no interest in being an Ironclad or an Amazon and her ability to work magic has eliminated the possibility of him or her wishing to be normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granted.\" Nodding, dad said. \"Only how will this knowledge allow Ms Cane to pay her debt to this family?\" Curious, dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced. \"Well, you recall I tried to say there was one other thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Joe entered the room with a grumpy expression. \"Those paradoxical, obstinate, irksome, tempestuous, preadolescent nincompoops of my little sisters are hogging both bathrooms again!\" Irritable, he said. \"I need a hot, relaxing cup of herbal tea to steady my nerves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's jaw dropped as dad gave a goofy overjoyed grin. \"Joe has an equally strong talent for mad science.\" Softly, you said. You summoned a glowing, sparking sphere to your right hand that hovered and sparkled. \"The same talent I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain dad nodded. \"I knew of this but it still does not answer the question.\" Patiently, he said. \"How will Gretchen Cane pay her debt of honor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be obvious, dad.\" Irritable, you snapped. \"It's a coin toss. Joe and I will take the thrones. The only question is, which throne will we take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could spread the word, easing tensions from those yearning to seize the thrones on both sides.\" Serious, mom said. She sighed. \"Only it raises another issue...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad frowned, a sigh escaping his own lips. \"Neither Joe or Gina are bonded with a boyfriend and girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis stunned you. \"You don't mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Expect love letters to arrive soon, dear.\" Serious, she said. \"Those who marry into the royal family on either side will gain great influence.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mom had the ability but you did not see any motive that would lead her to do this to your brother. That left either dad or another witch outside of the family.

I can assure you that I have ordered a full internal investigation into the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate that, ma'am.\" Politely, Joe said. \"We have reason to believe that Lydia Rune and her coven are being framed for this as it was made all too obvious they were involved.\" He paused then added, \"A witch such as Lydia Rune would have been far more careful to cover her tracks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must agree.\" Calmly, Rose replied. \"My concern is if you suspect me for the deed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no evidence to prove that theory one way or another.\" Shaking his head, Joe said. \"Still, dad told us that this has been happening a lot in the passed few moths in all witch and mad science households.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a feeling we are dealing with a new witch and or mad scientist trying to build their own coven or collective.\" Serious, Rose said. \"If that is the case then these pranks are tests for find potential talent to recruit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a strong possibility.\" Frowning, mom said. \"Keep us posted. We will do the same if we learn anything more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, mom ended the call then turned to Joe and you. \"If we are dealing with a new coven or collective forming, they will soon go after Ina and Tia.\" She sighed, adding, \"If they haven't yet already so I need one of you to stay with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Joe took a step back. \"Didn't dad order tighter security?\" Worried, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled, bemused. \"I would still feel more comfortable if someone were with them to watch out for them just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does mom pick to go to school with the twins?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, his concern for you, his missing sister grew and grew. Finally, he had built his first mechanical broomstick and was determined to find you. With a hint dropped by dad, Joe discovered you were at Cauldron Academy and flew over the school a mere hour after you had left in a school van for home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school looked fairly normal from the air, just a complex of dark low buildings surrounded by a high vine covered wall. Joe circled the complex from above, becoming more and more worried. \"I am sensing a lot of power down there.\" Wincing, he muttered. \"How am I going to find Gina's bio signal with all that interference?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an alarm sounded on the broomstick controls and Joe looked up to see a number of teenage girls quickly approaching him on broomsticks he could only guessed were versions of his own! \"Uh-oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe dived, taking evasive action while still searching for your bio signature, not knowing you had already left.

I suggest you do the same, young man.\" There was a pause before the woman then yelled, \"Look out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe turned just in time to run flat into the parameter wall. The broomstick was destroyed and Joe was thrown over the wall outside of school property. Joe laid, stunned on the grassy ground, his ears ringing and his head spinning, as the four teenage girls stepped up to him. As they looked upon his face, a bemused look formed upon their faces. \"Joe Mage.\" Shaking her head, one said. \"His mother is going to be furious...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What they did instead was to strand hundreds of boys and girls from a parallel world. At the same time, stranding hundreds of witch girls and boys in the world these strangers came from. The stranded boys called themselves mad scientists and had a power equal to magic, tipping the balance of power as before, only witch born girls had such supernatural power. In present day, these mad scientists are striving to grow in power; attempting to recruiting all boys born from a mad scientist father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou play a fourteen year old witch named Gina Mage who recently graduated at the top of her class at Cauldron Academy all girls boarding school where she learned witchcraft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a fair relationship with your mother, Mona Mage (35) who is an expert in combat magic and offers tutoring services to young witches with mad scientist brothers and or fathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a good relationship with your younger brother, Joe Mage (13) who is a very strong and talented athlete with high hopes to enter the Olympics someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a decent relationship with your twin youngest sisters, Tia and Ina Mage (7) who have magic at a young age and seem to specialize in teleportation which they use to lightheartedly play jokes on Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a neutral relationship with your father, Geo Mage (35) who is a mad scientist.

He sees it as protecting the family, you see it in another way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom would rather see your brother, Joe become a girl and a witch as the power is within him. However, many mad scientists would wish of recruit your brother, claiming that it is his birthright, his destiny to follow in his father's footsteps. Can you protect your brother Joe from being pulled into the world of mad science or will you allow him to embrace the power he has as a boy? The choice is yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have two neighbors whom you had been friends with since childhood. Rachel Scott (13) who has a crush on Joe and you suspect he has a crush on her.
