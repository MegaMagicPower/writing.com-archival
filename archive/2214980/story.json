The reason being today they had puberty education with the math social study\u2019s teacher. She pulled her self out of bed and rubbed her eyes. Olivia was a Canadian superstar. She had perfect grades, was everyone\u2019s friend, and was a awesome athlete due to her height. Olivia\u2019s parents told her the due to her brain being different she grew at a faster rate then other people. At the time she was 4\u201910.<br>\r\n She Was not excited that the teacher was going to go over things she already knew. Nonetheless she didn\u2019t want to miss school, so she got her clothes on. She normally wore a T-shirt with the words \u201cthis is my absolute happy place\u201d and Black shorts With white stripes.<br>\r\nShe went to the kitchen where her mom was cooking breakfast, \u201cgood morning Olivia! Are you ready for school?\u201d Olivia nodded and let out a yawn, \u201cyeah I\u2019m ready. What\u2019s for breakfast?\u201d Her mom put a plate of eggs on the table in front of Olivia, \u201cthat is.\u201d Olivia was thrilled, \u201cthanks mom!\u201d <br>\r\nAfter eating she went to the bathroom to rush her teeth and brush her hair. she brushed her teeth using her teeth whitener and brushed her hair. She then proceeded to leave. <br>\r\nAfter a minute of walking she heard a voice for behind her, \u201cOlivia, wait for me!\u201d <br>\r\nOlivia immediately knew who it was, \u201chey Jeremy! Ready for school?\u201d Jeremy replied by nodding and abruptly stopping at the school gate, \u201cwe\u2019re here\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4 hours later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia sat down for the one part of the day that she wasn\u2019t excited about, puberty education. Mr. Bruner stood at the head of the class, \u201cwelcome students. Today we will be talking about human growth and development.\u201d <br>\r\nOlivia tried to stay Focused but soon enough her mind wandered. She thought about Jeremy and her dating. She knew that was close to impossible. The a voice broke her thoughts, \u201cand besides chest growth girls will also grow taller.\u201d Olivia looked up in growing concern, \u201cnot only that but girls grow at a faster rate then boys!\u201d Olivia now sat with a look of worry and confusion on her face. At the same time her mind was racing, \u201cI\u2019m gonna grow even faster?\u201d <br>\r\nThe teacher explained that, \u201cDue the a small gland called The Pituitary Gland activating you will grow faster. Olivia was worried that she would grow so big that she would not be able to fit in her house. But this thought was dismissed and Olivia went about her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4 hours later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia stepped out of the school with a tired look and Jeremy was close behind wearing the same expression, \u201cbye Olivia\u201d Jeremy was waving at her while he ran the other detection, \u201cbye Jeremy!\u201d <br>\r\nA minute later her mom\u2019s car pulled up. Olivia quickly ran up to the car and got in, \u201chi mom! How are you?\u201d Her mom looked at her with a smile and replied, \u201cyes.\u201d She then continued with, \u201cwould you like to sleepover at Jeremy\u2019s house?\u201d <br>\r\nOlivia was excited for the chance to sleepover with the love of her life, but for this to happen she would need to remain calm. So in the flattest voice possibly she said, \u201csure mom. That would be fun.\u201d Her mom whipped out her phone and texted Jeremy mom to say that they were coming in an hour. <br>\r\nAs soon as they got home Olivia bolted to her her room to change. <br>\r\nShe pulled out her comfy pj shirt which had a picture of a corgi in a bed. She slid in to it and noticed it seemed to be small on her, \u201cthat\u2019s strange.\u201d She just thought she was wearing it wrong and hoped things would turn out okay.

Her mom was already at the door waiting, \u201care you ready Olivia?\u201d Olivia responded by walking out to the car. <br>\r\nOn the ride to Jeremy\u2019s house Olivia daydreamed about what she and Jeremy would do. She hoped that they could watch a movie or  maybe the would go out for dinner. Her thought process was interrupted by her mom, \u201choney looks like Jeremy is waiting for you better go meet him.\u201d <br>\r\nOlivia opened the door and got out. Jeremy walked up to greet her, \u201chey Olivia how are you?\u201d Olivia nodded, \u201cgood! What are we doing tonight?\u201d  Jeremy led her inside to her room and explained the plan, \u201ctonight my mom is going out for a business meeting. Dad is still at work so we get to be home alone.\u201d Olivia\u2019s face lit up in excitement, \u201creally?!? We get to be home alone?!\u201d Jeremy continued, \u201cl\u2019ve set up Avengers Endgame on the tv, made popcorn, and set up the pullout couch. We are set for the night.\u201d Olivia was ecstatic that she and her crush were going to watch a movie without any adults. <br>\r\nJeremy led Olivia to the lounge where There was true to his word the pullout couch, at least 10 bowls of popcorn, and Avengers Endgame was ready and waiting. Jeremy walked over to the couch and invited Olivia to take a seat. Olivia walked over and for the first time actually had a good look a Jeremy, \u201cdid you get shorter?\u201d Jeremy looked back at her in confusion, \u201cnot that I know of. Maybe you grew.\u201d <br>\r\nOlivia just brushed it off and got comfortable next to Jeremy and they started the movie. After a minute Jeremy\u2019s mom came into the room, \u201cJeremy I\u2019m going now. Do you think you can hold down the fort?\u201d Jeremy rolled his eyes at this, \u201cmom I\u2019ve explained me plans to you over and over. You can relax.\u201d Jeremy\u2019s mom sighed a little then left.<br>\r\nJeremy snuggled up with Olivia who was at a height of 7\u20192. Of course no one noticed. Jeremy grabbed the remote to start the movie. After a minute Jeremy ended up sitting in Olivia\u2019s lap and they were both satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn case you couldn\u2019t tell I have a pretty good life,\u201d Tony and Steve were arguing as the movie continued. Olivia stood up to go get some more water. When she did this her head bumped on the ceiling, \u201c ouch\u201d Olivia looked down and saw her shirt in tatters and her pants looking much to small for her, \u201cJeremy I think something is wrong.\u201d <br>\r\nJeremy turned his head to see a 9\u20196 Olivia standing in front of her, \u201cwhat in lords name?!? How did you get so tall?!?\u201d Olivia shock her head in confusion, \u201cI have no idea. Maybe I had a growth spurt, but I\u2019m okay\u201d Olivia sat back down on the couch. Jeremy still seemed concerned, \u201care you sure? You look twice as tall as before. If that keeps up...\u201d Olivia looked a bit scared but tried to remain calm., \u201c look let\u2019s finish the movie then we can worry about how tall I am.\u201d Jeremy reluctantly started the movie again. Olivia was thankful that they could relax instead of freaking out.<br>\r\nSo to thank Jeremy she picked him up and put him in her lap, \u201cI am a bit worried that if I keep growing I would be stuck in the house. But at least I\u2019d have a friend.\u201d She smiles and they returned to watching the movie.<br>\r\nAs the night progressed Olivia slowly grew. By the end of the hour she was 19\u20193 inches tall. Olivia and Jeremy began to hear creaking. Jeremy looked around to find the source, \u201cis that the couch? Olivia do yo...\u201d he trailed off now looking at a 19\u20194 Olivia, \u201cum Olivia? We have a problem.\u201d <br>\r\nOlivia looked down as Jeremy and all the blood drained from her face, \u201coh no\u201d Jeremy stood up and pointed at the door, we should go outside before...\u201d he was stoped by a loud crack. It was the couch, \u201cthat happens. We need to get you outside. Olivia try to crawl out the door.\u201d <br>\r\nOlivia complied and crawled over to the door. As she did this she saw her pants and underwear had given out and she was naked, \u201cack, Jeremy cover your eyes.\u201d Jeremy just left the room and a minute later came back down with a bedsheet, \u201chere wrap this around your waist.\u201d <br>\r\nOlivia was relived that she was covered and she then tried to fit out the door, \u201cI can\u2019t fit. Ohh I should have listened to you I\u2019m sorry Jeremy.\u201d Jeremy was sweating from fear, \u201cokay, we have a large room towards the back you could go to. We also have a tv out there so we could finish Endgame.\u201d Olivia loved this idea. As luck would have it she could fit in to the larger room, \u201cwow this place is big.\u201d Jeremy looked relieved, \u201cthanks, it\u2019s big enough to fit 4 school buses.\u201d <br>\r\nOlivia was at a height of 29\u20193. <br>\r\nSuddenly Olivia\u2019s growth sped up by...</span></div></div>",
