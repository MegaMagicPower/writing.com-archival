Your fur is white as snow and thick.  Like your thick fur would be any use in the desert.  Your stomach growls.  You haven't eaten in...well, you forgot the last time you ate.  Life as a anthromorphic wolf wasn't easy while Kagen rules.  You do remember you stayed with a human family not long ago and you used to play with the Kids, Alexander and Jeremy.  Maybe your memory is hazy because you passed out in the desert.<br>\r\n      \"Hi there\" said a voice behind you.  You turn around and see....</span></div></div>",

Alone?\" You say looking right in his eyes. \"Hmmf, well it will be a melee fight, so you won't have to worry about being shot at... your secondary weapon will be a dagger, the primary weapon will be your choice...\" Draco said while again murmuring something.<br>\r\n\"So... can I prepare first?\" You say looking at your fur all dirty and covered in vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you have until tonight, at 9... if you can find the time around here\" Draco said looking around the bar. As you are about to argue, you look at Draco's face, he was angry alright. You decide to move back a few steps as Draco turns around and walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people in the bar started to talk, and suddenly the noise was a bit too loud for you to handle, as they were saying things as 'He's done for' and 'Poor guy doesn't have a chance!'. Max turned around and looked at you with a sad expression on his face. \"D-did I... did I just cause that?\" He said stuttering. Sonic walked up behind you placing a hand on your shoulder. \"It's going to be O.K.\" Sonic whispered into your ear. Darknite was sobbing at the bar with another beer in his hand. \"Not much support from your father heuh?\" Knuckles said, half drunk, not totally aware of what just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, truly angry. \"Do, NEVER speak about my father like that again\" You say, a bit loud as everyone suddenly stopped talking, as you walk up to Knuckles grabbing his fur at the chest and pulling him up a bit with the spear in the other hand. Suddenly you feel a hand on your shoulder putting you down. \"Listen, save that aggression for tonight will you?\" Sonic said as he was holding you down. \"We might need knux later on... he's a tough fighter...\" Sonic said looking at the still-drunk-partly-shocked Knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and look into Sonic's eyes. \"You realize I am going to die, right?\" You say, slowly but aware of what you just said. \"No, nightstreak, you won't, trust me.\" Sonic says grinning. \"Knowing Draco, he probably won't make it a two versus... especially not against a new guy. He will play with you first, to see what you really can do... he will probably get the Wolf as he survived his last fight against the Vixen...\" <br>\r\nYou think for a second and remember what had happened yesterday. You look around the bar, everyone was talking again, not about the fight. Someone is missing. \"Where is Max?\" You ask Sonic. \"Beats me, probably preparing for the fight against you...\" Sonic says. \"A-a... against me?\" You stutter. \"Yeah, he caused it, so he's going to pay for it! Friends or no friends...\" Sonic says turning his head a bit to the right to look if Darknite was still OK, and not too drunk. Knuckles was at the pool table with the fox... Tails...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do now?\" You ask Sonic. Sonic looked at Knuckles at the pool table. \"You should probably take a bath first, then prepare for the fight, practice a bit...\" Sonic said. \"Maybe later I can introduce you to the people here, but now is certainly not the time...\" \"Hmmf, can't you help me train? Beating a wall isn't my idea of a training...\" You say. \"I'll see what I can do, first take a bath, you smell. There's a stairs leading up back there, it goes to my 'Living quarters'.\" You turn around after you thanked Sonic and walk to the end of the bar. \"That guy is soooOOooo toast!\" Someone says as you pass by. You ignore him and walk up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour in Sonic's room. For some reason this reminds you of home... sort of, since you never really were home, but at your uncles place... most of the time you would be in the park... anyway.

You get up again and laugh at yourself. You walk a bit further, and suddenly a light switches on.<br>\r\n'So, the city IS pretty modern' You think, as you look up and see a sensor light hanging above your head, further up you see a small well with water.<br>\r\nIt appears to be pretty warm, figures, middle in the desert... should be pretty warm, maybe they warm it up with the sun? Maybe there's like a small fire under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head and slowly get in the water.<br>\r\nIt's nice and warm... you try to rub the vomit out of your black fur. It was until now that you noticed you hadn't been wearing any clothes, except for the boots.<br>\r\nThen again, you never wore anything different, almost no hedgehog type did, unless they wanted too.<br>\r\nYou let yourself sink to the bottom of the well, it wasn't too deep. You start thinking about things you haven't thought of before. When was the last time you took a real bath?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized some others down in the bar, but who were they? The black and red hedgehog, Shadow. The fox with the two tails... called Tails, the name Miles rings in your ears. The loud mouthed, drunk Echidna, Knuckles who was also 'The previous guardian of the what-now Emerald?' The female hedgehog also seemed a bit familiar, you can't remember the bat though. So many faces, so little time! Why exactly did he notice them instead of others...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddendly you notice your still underwater, and swim up. You catch your breath. You notice the light had been switched on above the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue thinking. What about the fight tonight? If you really have to fight Max... you don't think you can. Will it be the same arena? Probably, they can't change the decor that fast... unless there is more than one arena...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seem clean enough, and refreshed. You get out of the water and look at the dirty water. Vomit, vomit and some more vomit. Your boots are gone. You walk outside, up the stairs, you almost tripped over them again. You hear a click as the lights turn off behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in Sonic's room again, for the first time you notice a bed, a look-a-like television, a couch, a table and a small closet. Your boots are next to the closet, they look cleaned. There is also a towel on the table. You reach it and dry yourself.<br>\r\nYour black fur feels as good as new. You take the boots and notice these are new, same size as your old ones. Sonic bought you a present, you smile and go down stairs. You walk up to the bar, some people appear to have left. Sonic greets you. \"How do you like 'em?\" He asks as he looks at your shoes. \"They are perfect, thank you Sonic!\" Sonic shakes his head. \"Don't thank me, thank Knux, he felt sorry after he knew what he did.\" You look down at the floor. \"I almost hurt him... I'm just a-\" \"- a nervous chap, protecting his father?\" Sonic interrupts. You nod. \"You're right Sonic...\" You look around. \"Where did the rest go? I'm missing half the bar.\" Sonic looks around, \"It isn't as busy as before huh? Knuckles is  at the pool table, if you hadn't noticed...\" Sonic whispers \"... he is sad about what he said, maybe you can go cheer him up.\" You look behind you and see Knuckles turning his head away quickly. \"Man, I don't know half of these people but they all seem so familiar.\" \"Well, I can tell you who is who, introduce them for you if you want to.\" You shake your head. \"Just point them out, I'll introduce myself.\" \"Just like your father huh?\" \"Did you mean something with that?\"  \"No, no, just that you're both ...stubborn.\" You laugh. \"Yeah, I did get that from my father... didn't I. Where is he by the way?\" \"He went out to walk, he'll probably be back soon...\" You hear your stomach rumble. \"Hungry ain't we?\" He says, \"I can fix you up something, free of charge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black hedgehog, Shadow if you're memory serves, walks up behind you. \"I don't remember you giving us any free food around here...\" He says, with a low pitch in his voice. \"That's because you didn't deserve it yet!\" Sonic grins. \"Oh come on... still angry about that time huh...\" \"What time?\" You interfere. \"Oh, well, there was a time he... kinda tried to uhm... kill me... sorta...\" Sonic says, Shadow looks up and whistles. \"Well, what happened?\" You ask, curious. \"Listen kid, now is not the time...\"  Shadow says looking in your face. Man he looks angry... sorta, as always you suddenly think. \"Listen uh, Nightstreak, this is Shadow. Now, sort off a friend of mine.\" \"Sorta? Anyway, nice to meet you Nightstreak.\" \"Have we... ever met before?\" You say as you look at his fur, the stripe sort off makes you remember something. \"You could say that... \" He says as he turns around and walks away to the pool table, where Knuckles is standing. \"Uhm anyway, would you like something to eat then?\" Sonic says, as your stomach rumbles again. \"I don't know, I feel like eating fruit.\" \"Perfectly normal, if you ask me.\" He says as he turns around and walks out a door, which you hadn't seen before. Some seconds later he comes out with a small dish and a fork. \"Don't ask how we got this all, we had to steal it from transports...\" Sonic says as he puts it on the bar in-front of you. You start to eat. Apple, some pineapple and a fruit you haven't tasted before. \"What is this?\" You ask. \"The Chinese once called it lychees, or something, it's like a grape but then without the skin, if you know what I mean, it's extremely nutritious and tastes sweet.\" He says while cleaning a glass and filling it with lemonade. \"Don't think your old enough for beer!\" He says, laughing softly while pointing his thumb at a sign which says: No beer for the dears. \"Thanks for everything Sonic.\" You eat the last bit of food and drink the lemonade, it tastes sweet. \"What time is it anyway?\" You ask, looking around to find a clock. \"2 pm, you probably expected it to be later huh?\" You nod. \"Yeah, I thought it was somewhere around 5 o clock!\" He turns around. \"Shouldn't you thank Knuckles by now?\" You get up, building the courage to face Knuckles after what you almost did. You walk toward him, trying to put a smile on your face. Knuckles turns around and hangs on the pool table, he doesn't appear to be drunk. \"Uhm, hi... Knuckles wasn't it?\" You stand next to him, leaning against the pool table. He doesn't look at you. \"Yeah... what do you want?\" You look down. \"I'm sorry about what I did... I just... well... you know... I-\" \"You tried to protect your father, and you were probably stressed about the fight tonight...\" He turns around and looks at you. \"... right?\" He says, cocking his head a bit. You smile, then pull a serious face again. \"I'm glad you sort of understand... uhm... thanks for the boots, anyway.\" He looks away again. \"No problem...\" You don't know how to act now... \"I am, sorry ok? It's just that, about what happend...\" \"Is there an echo in here? Forget it, I did already.\" He said as he swung one of his hands a bit. \"Well bye, nice meeting you anyway...\" \"Goodbye... Night.\" You walk back  to the bar, sit down and lay your head on the bar. \"Didn't work as you expected huh? He's always like that, trying to be the cool guy, sorta...\" Sonic says while he cleans a part of the bar. \"Anyway, I think it's time to do some training.\" You get up and he walks around the bar counter. \"Watch the bar while I'm gone, Knuckles! And don't drink the beer...\" Sonic says as he gives Knuckles the keys to the bar. \"Roger wilco\" Knuckles says as he salutes. You laugh a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside Sonic looks at you. \"So, what you want to do?\" He says looking around... the time is 2.42<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*/ whoa!

No way I'm going to rewrite it over and over!/*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around. \"I think I need to do something about my speed and agility first. Sonic grins. \"I bet you do!\" He says as he laughs. \"See those pillars over there?\" He points to a pair of eleven (11) pillars, 22 in total, perfectly placed next to each other. \"Those there? 4 up, 3 same, 4 down?\" You say looking into his eyes. \"Yup, time to fall for you huh?\" He says grinning as he runs over to the pillars. \"If I fall I'll break all my bones! the highest ones are at least 9 feet tall if not 10!\" You say, converting meters to feet. He looks over his shoulder and grins. It doesn't look that high, the first pillars are about 2 feet... not that you are tall, being a hedgehog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome seconds later your both in front of a row of pillars. \"Ready to go?\" Sonic asks. \"You love racing don't you...\" You grin as you take a few steps back, Sonic does the same. \"Ready... steady... GO!\" You sprint forward, up the first low pillar, then make a nice double jump up to the next one, which you land with your knee on. You quickly get up and jump up the next ledge and the next. Not so hard, just jump and you should be half way there. You look to your left, you see sonic already made it to the bow. You quickly sprint over the first bow, jump the gap and make a dive down, completing it with a somersault, landing straight on the second of down, you jump down another one and just as you want to jump down the last one... \"I won.\" ... You slip and fall with your head first into the sand. Sonic laughs.<br>\r\nAs you roll over you mumble something about knife and stab. \"You did this before didn't you.\" You ask Sonic. \"No no nephew, I didn't...\" He smirks. You get up. \"REMATCH!\" You demand. \"Not yet, you ARE pretty agile, not as agile as me... but how is it for speed...\" You look around you for landmarks. \"How about all the way to the river?\" Sonic says. You look around you but don't see a river anywhere, you do know there is a delta nearby, but that's all the way past the city. \"You got to be joking me right...\" You say as you search for Sonic's mirage. \"I meant past the city, you can't see it here...\" \"I can't run THAT far!\" You say about to argue. \"You'll have to if you want to survive...\" Sonic says. \"What's wrong with you, you act way different.\" Sonic acted a bit, strange. \"Oh? Sorry about that, it happens when I want to race...\" Sonic says as he 'removes his smirk from his face'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scratch the one on one race, try to keep up with me.\" sonic says, looking at the sun. \"It's somewhere around 3 O clock, 6 hours to go...\" He says as he braces himself. \"Follow me, ready... s-\" \"Don't I get a say in this?\" you interrupt. \"No... GO\" Sonic sprints off, you sigh and run after him, as fast as you can. Damn he's fast... the sand forms a fog around you while you try to follow him. You can't see where he is going, so you follow the fog's path. You make a curve left and right. The dust is spreading so that means he is further away than first, he's sprinting, you are still running. You run faster and finally break into a sprint, trying to follow the blue hedgehog. The dust suddenly lifts, as Sonic is way further then you are, you see the dust far in front of you, you are tired. You look over your shoulder to see where the pillars are. They are almost a quarter of a mile away, 400 meters, you calculate in your head. You run that distance really fast, maybe faster than you thought you could. You look in front of you just to see that the dust cloud containing Sonic is even further away then first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to sprint faster, you succeed. You're running on the same tempo as Sonic, but for how long can you hold it? Your feet are moving faster than your eyes can follow! All you see is a forming of a black ball, for your eyes, but you know it are your feet. You decide to sway your arms back and lean a bit forward to speed up. It works, your gaining on Sonic, bit by bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 seconds later you are tired of running, but you still hold the tempo. Sonic looks next to him, just to see you running next to him. His eyes open wide, he probably didn't expect anyone to run as fast as he could. You try to say something, but realize that would cost energy. You run next to him as he tries to shake you off, running in curves. Not so smart, since he just keeps running forward, only making himself slow down. You aren't that stupid... he looks in front of him then his eyes are truly wide open. He stops running trying to stop himself from going too much further. You stop instantly... half instantly, you're still skidding along the sand, making a large dust cloud. You look in front of you, as the dust drifts away, you see why he stopped. You almost ran into...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, he releases you and steps aside, you tumble over and almost fall past the ledge and into the water. \"Room for improvement there Night...\" \"About my name...\" You say as you get up, dusting off your fur. \"It's NightSTREAK!\" You charge at him, your fist flies into his direction. He simply blocks it and holds it.

You jump up and kick him with both your feet, he rolls away as you make a perfect somersault and land on your feet. \"Improvement?\" You say, with his voice. Sonic, recovering from a roll again stares at you, again amazed. \"Where in the world did you learn that?\" You grin, a devilish grin. \"World?\" you say. \"I didn't see you fight in the arena like this...\"  You help him up. \"That's because that was just luck.\" \"Thanks for helping me up... Maybe Shadow can train you... he's the 'expert' in those things.\" You agree. You see something floating your way. \"What's that up there?\" Sonic turns around. \"That? That's Tails... what's he doing out here...\" You both sprint toward him, just as your under him he drops from the air. You quickly dive forward and catch him.

He turns around and walks away. \"What happened?...\" You hear the other say as he walks back. You look around you. The streets are filled with people. Well, anthromorphs and dragons, but you refer to them as people. You look up, you see a shadow move away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk around the clay building next to you into an alley way, you brace yourself as you jump from the right wall to the left. The alleyway wasn't too narrow, no-one noticed you. You can climb up the clay wall. As you are on top you look around you, you can see a large tower, probably the palace. You see something fly around, something like a huge bird. You suddenly feel a tingle in your spine... or a bat... the bat from the bar, the female, dammit what was her name again... she doesn't notice you, as she glides over rooftops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buildings not being very high, you 'drag' yourself down again, past the alleyway, until your on the floor, sand to be precise. You run further, bumping against some people, yelling watch out as you run over the streets. You see the large neon sign again, the one of the hedgehog hall. You run there just to see a bat land on the roof. You kick the door in 'Not literally' and run to the bar. Everyone you knew, and some you didn't were standing around the bar. Around a hedgehog actually, around your dad. You rush up to him just to see him crying. Knuckles was behind the bar, apparently he didn't drink while Sonic was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou 'hug' your dad and ask what is going on. \"I... I saw her...\" You pull up an eyebrow \"Saw who?\" You ask. \"I think I saw her, Violetta...\" \"M-mom?!\" You stutter. \"A-a t-transport vehicle, I saw her face t-through the back window, she saw me... then it suddenly lost control, it... it-it... it crashed, I couldn't save her... I-I tried to...\" You have to sit down as everything started to turn, your mom, assumed to be dead, or stuck in camp for life, apparently just died in a crash? You shake your head. \"Are you sure it was her, it can't be she was sent to camp!\" He shrugs. \"When did this happen?\" You ask shaking him. \"I was... was walking in the desert, I passed the palace, at the north side. I walked... further and-and I saw it hover above me. It tried to land, I saw her and suddenly it just lost control and-and it-it... it just crashed and exploded!\" You shake him. \"Calm down, WHEN did this happen?\" He looks at you, tears in his eyes. \"God I don't know, I sprinted back here, then it took some time for you to get here! I think 6 minutes ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic and Tails burst in the door. You pass them and briefly say hi as you walk into the town, some streets away, here and there you find your way too the palace. You quickly pass the side of the palace, sprinting at your top speed. You run and run, until finally you see smoke. You run further... dad spoke the truth... a whole plane like vehicle, burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear something, you quickly run forward to the vehicle. You hear muffled voices \"Help!\" A high pitched voice says, followed by a low one. You run up the vehicles side. The fire is holding you back but you sprint right through it, diving and rolling as your fur is burning, just a small burn, it went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a handle, you touch the handle, there is a lever in the handle. You press it and move it to the side. A door opens and fire comes out. You roll down the side to check for windows, anything to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see her... the salmon colored hair, red-ish fur... You snap out of just admiring her and dive through the apparently not broken window. Glass shards everywhere. She looks at you... suddenly she passes out, you drag her body out of there. The smoke is filling your lungs. You lay her next to the vehicle, away from the fire. \"Hello?! Is anyone there? The plane is going to explode! Help us out!\" The 'plane' is half filled with sand. You crawl your way to a locked door which is seriously dented. The door is made of soft material, and is easily pushed apart, some sort of metal, as tin or something close. You burst in to hear a loud of coughing and smoke fly past you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly pull out the 'captain' and the co-pilot of the vehicle. \"Is there anyone else in here?\" You ask the captain, which is conscious. \"No, get out, the plane is going to blow up soon, save yourself!\" You  drag both the pilot's out of the cockpit and with all your strength you try to pull them out, crawling under the wreck. You help the pilot through the window, you wave him to watch out for the sharp shards of glass. As he and the you try to pull out the co-pilot, you smell a gas... \"This place is going to blow! Hurry!\" You tell the large man. He looks weird, not a furry or a 'mutant' more like a human... wait... he is a human... the 'almost extinct' human? \"You take the woman, she shouldn't be too heavy.\" He commands you. You carry her, as soon as you take a few steps you hear a large woof like sound behind you, as you want to turn around...</span></div></div>",

An annoying white vision plus a nasty noise in your ear that deafens you. You think you died when suddenly your eyes focus. At first you see a blue rock, the rock gets a mouth that moves, then eyes, then asks if you are ok with the same pitch as Sonic's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around you, as your head is on the side you see your mother laying some steps away from you. Tails is trying to wake her up. You see shoes, and black fur. You instantly think it's your dad. He kneels next to you. \"Are you ok nightstreak?\" He helps you up. Some of your fur was singed and you felt a stinging pain in your side. \"You are quite the hero aren't you?\" Sonic says. \"Dad, I am ok, better check on mom first... I have no idea why I suddenly am the lucky guy to rescue everyone.\" Shadow is standing some steps away guarding the human. \"Look at him... is he really human?\" You ask. \"I thought most of them were banished to the caves, or at least burned with lava...\" Sonic shrugs. \"Maybe he cooperated with the dragons?\" You shake your head. \"I don't think he would betray his own species, maybe the king knows him...\" You say. An a bit high pitched voice talks behind you. \"Wrong, he was the captain of the ship, he needed to transport people to be allowed, or his brains would probably have been breakfast.\" Tails, the know-it-all fox, was standing behind you. \"The female hedgehog is ok, just passed out from the smoke I suppose. The co-pilot however, which is a wolf, is burned, good thing he had a coat on or his fur would have been a hairy death trap, scorching his skin off as it burned.\" You look at Sonic, then at Tails. \"You know, Tails, don't get me wrong  but... your knowledge scares me.\" You say as you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a pretty big wound, you sure you don't need anything for it? There IS a hospital in the city you know...\" Tails says. You raise your eyebrow. \"A hospital... ok... guys... can you explain me: How you get electricity, water, food, medicines and all that stuff?\" Sonic shrugs. \"All I heard was, that we use nature for electricity, we get water pumped, by the electricity, from the delta close to the city, the food we either get from rebels that bring us food or by stealing it from transports and medicines the same way. Same as all the equipment, weapons and such, but also electrical equipment, such as the light bulbs, television, which are infact pretty rare in the city. If you are lucky you can see a car drive through the town, one of the really old ones, ferraris and such, not the flying cars. The king has connections...\" Tails says. For one second your brain hurts but then you get what he said. \"Ok, flying cars? Have I been living in the woods all my life?\" Sonic laughs. \"Actually you did, your, village, wasn't really modern.\" Sonic says. It's getting dark. \"We'd better continue training...\" Shadow says as he walks up to you, cracking his knuckles. \"Maybe the king will let you alone if you tell what you did!\" Tails suddenly says. You think for a second. \"Good idea Tails!\" Sonic says as he looks at him...</span></div></div>",

First you have to go past some buildings, to the palace, that's the way you came here. \"Sonic, lead the way.\" You say, as he runs faster, takes the lead and you follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(4/5 minutes later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the entrance of the palace. A guard is in front of the door. \"I'll do the talking...\" Sonic says. \"What is your business with king Draco?\" The guard asks Sonic. \"I have great news of the fellow exile, Nightstreak.\" He leads on to a large door. You had never seen the entrance doors, never seen it locked either. He knocks on the door, then opens the door slowly, then closes it behind him. \"What?\" You say as you tried to slip in. \"He must first get approval. You hear some muffled noises, but can't really make up what they are. Suddenly the door opens and you step back. \"You are allowed to enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Sonic inside. Sonic begins to explain... \"Wait, let him explain...\" Draco says, waving you forward. He leans on the arm of his throne. He looks with the same angry look on his face as before... \"King Draco...\" \"Please, just call me Draco...\" You shrug, you would have thought he was still angry. \"Ok... Draco... I was training for the match tonight...\" \"Oh, is this about trying to cancel the match tonight, if so I-\" You try to interrupt but Sonic shushes you. \"-will call the guard to let you out.\" \"No no, Draco, I was training when suddenly someone ran up to me and told me that my father, Darknite came back from his walk and appeared shocked.\" \"Your father, yes...\" Draco was again writing something down. \"Draco, king, with all do respect... can I ask you what you are writing down?\" You ask. He drops his hand, seemingly insulted. \"Well if you really want to know, I'm writing down what you are saying, and what you look like, right now, with those burns... speaking of which, how did you get them?\" \"Draco, I was getting to that part, sir.\" \"Would you please stop with the formalities?\" You shrug again, so does Sonic when you look at him. \"As I was saying, I ran all the way to the bar. Dad told me he had seen my mother, Violetta, in a plane just before it crashed! Before you ask, it happened somewhere north of the palace. So I ran all the way there. I risked my life, diving into the plane looking for survivors, my mom was in the side hold, it wasn't a big plane. I dragged her out, then I heard screams for help. I went in further to find a [i]human[/i] pilot and a wolf co-pilot. I saved them all just when the plane exploded. The co-pilot was hurt pretty bad, my mother was ok, the human was also ok and me? Well I just had some burn wounds from the fire I dove through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco thinks for a second. \"Was the fire diving part really necessary.\" You shake your head. \"No, I didn't know there was a side window by then. And I almost got fried when flames came out of a compartment which I opened.\" Draco nods. \"So, you are a hero. But what about the human? He can't live here... unless we have to put him under special protection.\" Draco says, thinking out loud. \"Draco, do I get anything special for my efforts?\" You say... the time ticks by, as it is almost time for the match to start, you were out cold pretty long, as you look at the clock which points at 5.13<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I could get the match of you... but maybe not, you trained hard, and the people want entertainment...\" He says as he grins. 'Bastard' You think. He must of seen the anger in your eyes. \"But I could give you a new amulet so you are truly a civilian of our town, instead of just fresh meat... I mean, new and... not allowed yet.\" Draco smiles, as he laughs sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about [i]both[/i]\" Sonic buds in. \"Excuse me, uhm... Sonic, right? Did I ask you to speak?\" He says. \"It only seems fair to me...\" \"Ok that's it, I'm calling my guard...\" You raise your fist. \"No you aren't.\" You say. Draco sees the anger in your expression. He relaxes again. \"Fine, you won't have to participate in the match, and I increase your level of access...\" Sonic cheers. \"... But if you ever want to fight in the arena...\" He continues but you shake your head. \"Thank you so much King.\" You bow and walk out the room, tapping on the large door which opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run out of the hallway and jump up, hitting the air with your fist. \"YES!\" You yell. Everyone turns around and some laugh. \"Uh, in case you didn't hear it ye-\" A large crackle stops you from talking as the intercom is on. \"The fight for 9 pm has been canceled. The new fighter, Nightstreak, is a hero, as he saved a female hedgehog and an antromorph wolf from destruction. That was all.\" Suddenly everyone started to cheer at you. You see the bat fly above you again. You prod Sonic with your elbow. \"Who is that?\" As you point up. \"That? That is Rogue, ex-treasure hunter. She flies around, looking for someone to spy on. She loves doing that...\" Sonic chuckles. \"My my, Sonic I never heard you laugh like that! The name Rogue does sound familiar... have I ever met her?\" \"Probably, when she thought there was something to steal at your house.\" You don't get it. Still you laugh...</span></div></div>",

Helped you a bit with saving people didn't it?\" He pats you on the shoulder, looking proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails walks with something that looks like an old ghettoblaster. \"How did you get that?\" You ask Tails. \"Uh, well, theres a dump somewhere near. Loads of electrical stuff is dumped there, I rebuild it in my free time. The good thing about this one is, that I programmed some music into it... just in my spare time...\" \"You said spare time twice.\" Knuckles says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic comes out with a large platter. All sorts of fruit and some types are meat on there. You don't really know if you like meat, you never really tried it. So you pick up the fork and dig in. Tails and Knuckles do look a bit hungry. \"Uhm, can't you get them something for free?\" You say as Tails is somewhat IN your plate. \"How do you get money here, anyway...\" You ask. \"You could work for me if you want to.\" You nod. \"Just give them something, whatever they want... they could use it.\" You take a bite from the pineapple, tastes nice. Pine apple has always been your favorite fruit. Well, now that you are eating, you might as well take a bite from the hotdog. It tastes nice, actually you kind of like it. You look up and see Sonic snoop a chili dog. \"Still eating them?\" You say, teasing him. You heard he ate lots of chili dogs. Knuckles, Shadow, Tails... wait... where's... \"Where are dad and mum?\" Sonic points at the stairs. \"They have a private moment together, leave em alone, whatever they are doing up there.\" Sonic winks. You shiver only of the thought of that. \"Anyway, where is Max? I haven't seen him all day...\" Sonic shrugs for the zillionth time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was gonna go over to his place... if I remembered where to go...\" Sonic remembers the joke, which wasn't funny at all.

You eat the last part of apple and peaches and whatnot, plus the sausages, hotdogs actually. \"So I'm not the only one who likes hotdogs anymore huh?\" Sonic chuckles. You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails! Did you fix that darn thing yet?\" Some guy at the pool table yells, the green hedgehog you bumped into earlier, when you first came in, Sonic saying you're a lap dog, you taking it as a threat a- \"I fixed it! Ok guys, I got tha music!\" You shake your head. 'When something good happens, they are all happy... hmmf.' You think. You don't really remember being happy about anything, maybe satisfied but not really happy. suddenly the music bursts out next to you, you almost fall off the chair. \"Not bad Miles, not bad...\" Sonic says as he pats his buddy on the back. &lt;Insert some random Dance music here&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door storms open as a bat comes walking in. Rogue. She sits one seat away from you. Duh, Tails and Knuckles already surrounded you. She is sitting next to Knuckles. Tails starts to stare at you. You turn around and he continues working at the ghetto blaster. \"What is it Tails?\" You ask. \"I always thought those two had something together, suddenly they sit next to each other... and... well you were staring at Rogue...\" You laugh. \"Nah, Tails, I ain't thinking about that...\" Tails grins. \"You wouldn't be the weirdest couple...\" You raise your eyebrow. \"Didn't you hear me?...\" \"Oh, I heard you perfectly but... uhm...\" You turn around and see four eyes gazing at you. \"Uh... what?\" Knuckles laughs, Rogue only smiles and then looks away. You raise your eyebrow. \"Did I say something weird?\" You ask Sonic. \"Nah, nevermind... we heard someone saying you were following her...\" You think for a second, Sonic notices that. \"Down the street? Up the walls?\" \"Oh really? Maybe I was just saw something fly and I wanted to make sure it wasn't going to attack me...\" You think for a second, then you wave Sonic to lean closer. \"I think she saved me...\" You whisper. \"What do you mean?\" \"I was in an alleyway with two guards, one looked like he wanted to fight... well he watched something, then turned around and left...\" Sonic thinks for a second. Amazing how you can still talk to each other with this music on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party goes on all night, people dancing... Darknite and Violetta are already back. They look normal, they probably just talked. Sometimes I wonder what Sonic has in that mind of his. You sigh. \"Boring... isn't it? Without a date...\" Sonic says. Amy (You had learned her name), also at the bar, suddenly stands up. \"So uh, Sonic... want to dance.\" Sonic shrugs. \"You know, usually I'm a bit nervous but, just for once? Sure...\" He gets up, leaving the bar counter behind him, steps on to an empty floor and starts to dance. \"I can't remember ever seeing him dance, he's pretty good...\" Tails says still sitting next to you. You wonder why no-one asked the hero to dance yet. You see Sonic and Amy matching to the tune, and each others dance. All you can hear is the cheesy music going pwap-pwaw-pwow-pwop with some drums on the background, over and over... Tails gets up right. \"I got it!\" He suddenly says. He pushes some buttons, connects a wire here and there and suddenly the music was mixed with another music, making it sound even better. Everyone cheered as the new music came out. You grin \"Hip-hoppers...\" Miles looks at you... something tells you he was thinking something as... Riiiiiight...</span></div></div>",

You suddenly hear a group talk right of you, behind a building. You stand with your back against the wall and look around the corner. You wonder why you do that but there doesn't seem to be any guards around. You see a guy with his hands chained and a group walking him to a place. They are going to the arena. It's Max! Of course it is, you might not be fighting against someone, but Max definitely is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up behind the group. One of the larger dragons turns his head. His yellow eyes widen. \"Well well well, look who we have there.\" Max turns around his head to see you. He is gagged so he can't talk. \"If it isn't our lil spoiler.\" Another one says. A smaller green one turns to laugh at you. \"This is no place for you. If you wish to save your friend, too bad.\" You hear a form of clapping noise above you. You look up just to see the sky, turn darker every second. It looks like it's going to rain. Weird, you read about rain in the desert, plants will grow and then fall apart again. The group already turned around the corner. You pursue them. Not showing yourself. \"I know you're following us you stupid hedgehog, there's no way you can save your friend.\" You aren't planning into getting yourself in trouble again. Suddenly you hear a low thud and something like a pot breaking open. \"Dresco, are you ok?\" The blue dragon, holding Max into place was hit by a falling jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax takes a break for it as everyone is standing around the blue dragon. \"Hey! STOP HIM!\" You see the large dragon say. You run from behind the corner and after Max, running faster than he does. The guards were out at night time, enough room to shoot and ask questions later. Why didn't they put weights on the chain anyway? You think for some odd reason. Suddenly you see a guard take out something that looks like a laser pistol, aiming it at Max and shooting. You run up to him as fast as you can, diving into him, pushing him around the corner of a building while you roll away.</span></div></div>",

Maybe it's special clay. As you think on you trip over something and land right into your bed. You turn around, take out your boots and lay in the bed. The cover is nice and smooth, something silky. Maybe it IS silk. At this point you wonder why you suddenly think about stuff so much... maybe it's because you lost people, found them, lost some again and maybe because you got thrown in a place.

Why would I take a bath, I ain't that dirty... besides, it ain't Sunday yet... right?\" You have no idea what the current date is... for a second you think. Who did I forget... who did I forget... who... \"DAMNIT!\" You suddenly yell. Everyone looks at you, even your mom and dad, coming down the stairs. You hear some movement upstairs, probably Sonic that woke up. \"What happened to the human?!\" You ask, thinking of the man you had saved. Tails looks down, thinking. \"I believe we let the hospital take care of him, they are probably looking after him, it's safer than with the guards, I ensure you...\" He says. Sonic comes down the stairs. \"Mornin everyone... Amy's still upstairs... doing what she has to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, no-one seems to have walls under his or her eyes. No-one is stressed or tired... not even your mom, probably because the desert sun is so damned hot. Good thing it was nice and cool yesterday evening, or you would've died in bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Rogue, Tails, mom and dad and eventually Amy all sit around the bar. Sonic is in the 'kitchen' again. Now that there isn't much noise you can hear a fridge open and close. Something being poured into glasses, then something else was poured and eventually you hear some rustling. Then Sonic comes out with all sorts of stuff. You are still wondering how he got it. Some of Tail's favorite on a plate, some of Rogue's favorite, fruit you notice. Figures... bats... there you almost go again. Some more fruits for Amy. Some... sandwiches for Tails, dad and mums favorite, and apparently the same as yours, fruit, fruit and some more fruit. There's more fruit than there is meat. There is a Giant loaf on the middle of the bar. Some jam and some other pots filled with weird labeled goods. Coffee for the grown ups and lemonade for you and Tails, you feel like you are being seen as a 6 year old. Furthermore Amy and Rogue get fruit juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really have the feeling as if you were sleeping under a rock for some time as you see the labels on the pots. \"Are you going to eat or just stare?\" Sonic suddenly says. \"Huh what? Oh sorry... I just, sorta started thinking again...\" Sonic nods and leans back on his chair behind the counter, with his own sandwich he made. \"Thanks anyway for making this...\" You say. The rest thanks Sonic too. While they are eating. \"I do this daily so uh, don't thank me, thank the supplies being dropped here...\" He says. You eat whatever is on your plate. Finishing as last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar only opens at 10. You wonder why it was called Hedgehog hall, if it was just a bar, not really a hall... it was a big bar though but...<br>\r\n\"You should stop thinking all the time.\" A light voice appears behind you. You turn around to see Amy. \"Hi Amy... sorry about the way I acted yesterday...\" She smiles, then looks serious. \"You do say sorry allot, don't you... you changed so much since the first time you got here.\" You frown. \"What do you mean with that?\" You actually didn't really notice it before, but she was right. \"Just the way you act...\" She walks away, not finishing her lines again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Night...\" Finally someone calling your name for a change... \"check this out!\" Sonic held a guitar. You stare in awe as Sonic gives it to you. \"Give it a try.\" You take it. \"I don't know, I never really tried anything before...\" You say. \"It's only going to be for amusement, you must be bored...\" He says. Indeed, you were a tad bored. You sit on a normal chair. You pull a string as you turn a button. Doing it to all until you have a perfect match, actually you don't even know what you are doing. You strike 3 snares after each other. It having 5. That didn't sound bad, more like one of those strikes you hear in the beginning of a tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold a part and then pull another string. A long sharp tune comes out. Reminding you of a song, you try to reenact. Higher and lower and higher, keep it there, pull two strings and... that didn't sound bad at all, maybe good as a start... you strike all the strings in the end. Tails, sitting in front of you, which you hadn't noticed, smiles. \"Not bad, did you practice?\" He asks. \"No, actually this is my first time I ever played... weird isn't it... &lt;Damnit do I wish I could post a link!&gt;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails shrugs. You continue to practice as Sonic comes out with a smaller guitar, a bass-guitar to be precise... a red one... you and your damn, to be precise, constantly... You definitely notice you changed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic starts to play a tune. &lt;And I still wish I could post a link.&gt; Soon after that you both try to match to each other's play. Soon Tails and mom 'n dad had joined around the table as you played. To bad there wasn't an amplifier. It sounded low enough on it's own though. Tails sprints out the door. \"Where's he going to?\" You ask while you play. \"He's probably got an idea again.\" You start wondering off again, slowing your pace as you think. Why were all things happening at the same time, you learn how to play things, you become a hero, your friend dies, it's all becoming to much... Sonic sees something is wrong. He stops playing and lays his guitar against table's leg.<br>\r\n\"Are you ok... Night?\" \"Son?\" \"Streak?\" \"Night?\" All of them were asking if you were ok. You knew something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad stands up. \"I know what's wrong... everything changes so fast... friends come and go, he gets thrown in here and is lonely, I saw his face when he heard about his friend's death, and when he was looking at a couple. He doesn't have a girlfriend to stick around with and...\" You hear Rogue cough, and Sonic get's up. \"Not to interfere, I might be his uncle but I'm also his friend, so is Tails.\" Sonic says. \"I... sorta am his friend too\" Rogue says. You look at her, so do Amy and Sonic. \"What?\" Rogue asks. \"It's not like we have anything close...\" Amy shakes her head and continues doing... nothing important... \"I think he needs something to do...\" Mom says. \"He can work at the bar if he wants to, maybe help Tails with some experiments...\" You like the sound of the last part... You get off the chair with the guitar hanging around your neck. \"Please, guys, this isn't necessary, maybe I'm just a bit stressed, about the sudden happenings... but there's no need to worry. Some days here and I'll be fine...\" You hear that echo in your mind. You know it won't be fine... as long as your in this dump of a city...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails comes back in with a keyboard/piano.

They are scattered over an underground arena with small obstacles. Above the ground you will have to fight someone, selected by the audience.\" Sonic says, catching his breath for a second. Tanja and Litespeed... awkward name for a echidna, more something for a hedgehog, are both startled. \"Let's just keep moving...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome streets further you reach a large dome, a other arena than where you fought in. Weird you didn't see it when you were on the roof of the building. \"We are here... you two go in that way, get the best weapon you can get, my bet is a sabre or something with a red tip, don't touch that tip...\"  They both walk off, still startled, into an entryway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(10 minutes later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... The contestants successfully managed to get the objects...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are in a large arena, best described as a Colosseum, as it's from stone with some statues in the walls. There is a large stone pillar in the mid, surrounded by 4 walls, 2 with gaps. There are metal like pillars in the outside of the arena, behind those are larger walls, and up those walls is the tribune, where you are sitting. Two walkways, entries, are on both sides. On two sides of the circle are large tribunes. Draco and a group is sitting on one of them.

The fight will start, contestants, good luck.\" Draco says over yet another intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run over to the railing, almost falling over it. Tails' eyes are fixated on Tanja. She carries a sword, a small sword with a curve, something close to a katana. Litespeed had a trident, or a pitchfork or at least a smaller version of one. The 'wolves' are dressed in small leather shirts. Body armor, not really thick but thick enough to hold a knife. Both of them have a spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those guys twins?\" Tails asks focusing his eyes on the wolves. \"They look like it don't they?\" You say as the wolves seem to be exactly the same.<br>\r\nTanja walks around the pillar, jumps over some wrecks and turns her sword behind her back. Waving her hand to the wolf, taunting him. You can't see Litespeed, she's behind the pillar. You do see the dragon audience raising there fists and yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fix on Tanja as she easily dodges some swings from the spear. You wonder what she is thinking right now. As the wolf thrusts the spear toward her, she simply dodges and slices away with her katana. Cutting him in the leg. He leans on his other leg for a second. The cheers of the audience are to loud behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! Up there!\" Tails says, pointing to the large pillar in the middle. A red echidna is standing there. \"How did she get up there?!\" You say, staring in awe. \"I suppose that's why she's called Litespeed... I mean, she ran up there from the side! I saw it!\" Tails says, also staring in awe, but with his jaw hanging again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a scream from down you. Tanja has a cut on her arm, the wolf's spear sliced a bit in front of her, hitting her arm. You can somewhat see her eyes starting to glow red. Not literally, but she got up and almost chipped off the wolf's leg! You can see the blood pouring over his white fur. He's laying with one knee up looking up. As Tanja holds him down with her katana. \"We want to see blood, but not ours! We want to see blood, but not ours!\" Everyone yells in the audience. You laugh at the thought of that line. \"What are you laughing about, he's going to die...\" Tails says staring. Tanja sticks her sword in the sand, kicking the wolf's spear away, helping him up. You can see her mouth move, and the wolf's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLitespeed was still on the pillar, now sitting on the edge. You could see a group of 'medics' attending the corpse of the other wolf. Suddenly the name Litespeed strikes you. You heard that name before, but can't remember it. \"Are you ok?\" Tails asks, looking at your 'pale' face. \"I... I'm fine...\" You manage to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a honorable defeat, Tanja and Litespeed are the duo. Vector's life was spared by Tanja Redfield. Good show... that was all. You may now leave the arena.\"</span></div></div>",

You look surprised, as if you didn't know that 'cats' had claws. You run up behind the tiger. \"Let's go Kai\" You say. As he slowly sneaks up behind you looking around nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Suddenly you hear a long battle cry and suddenly you smack to the ground. You roll over to see what you got hit by. You see a large bear like creature struggling with Kansama. You quickly get up and brace yourself. \"HEY!\" You hear a deep voice say behind you. You look around and put your hands up just in time to hold a club from hitting your hand. You pull the club and swing the thin side to the head of... a small dragon... reminding you of max. But not the same scale color. You flip the bat around and swing again with the larger side, hitting him against the head again, making him tumble back and fall down unconcious. \"Nggh, GRAAA!\" You hear and you're on the floor again. \"Sorry about that...\" You hear Kansama whisper. He is laying next to you. He coughs. The bear threw him against you. \"Stay laying for a while...\" You say as you get up. First  you need to kneel. You look forward to see a big-ass bear with a amphora in his hands standing in front of you. You throw your bat at the amphora so the lower half breaks off.

You hear cut noises as they penetrate the clay walls. One is stuck in your hand. You slowly pull it out, screaming of pain. The bear is stunned at the act you just delivered. You throw the sharp piece up and catch it on the tip, throwing it at the bear. Hitting him directly in the eye. He screams as he falls on his knees, his hands over the piece in his eye. */ I watch too much movies... -_- /*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull some shrapnell pieces out of the walls and throw them spinning at the bear. One hits his wrists, making it spread blood and another one flies past his ear, scratching it deep. Some other pieces miss, you shouldn't have thrown them spread style. He cries some more as the blood covers up his fur... Kansama walks up behind you, rubbing some sharves off his fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just do that?\" He says as he looks at the agonizing sight. The 'Red glow' in your eyes wears off. You are stunned because of what you just did, you wonder how. You look down at the boots you got from Knuckles. He said they were special... but did they cause that? \"KAI!\" You suddenly hear Kansama yell as he runs up to the downed Wolf. He's bleeding from his mouth, looking in directions. He wasn't fit for battling the large bear. Atleast not without a weapon. He tries to talk but he can't. You can see his chest raise and lower on the rithm of his breathing. \"God, Kai, come on. Stay with me...\" Kansama says. \"This isn't going to work!\" He says hanging Kai over his shoulder. \"What about the arena? Draco's men will hunt you down!\" You say facing him. \"Screw that, I'll take them on, one on one!\" \"YOU HEAR ME? ONE ON ONE!\" He yells in to an unexisting space. You walk up to the direction of the bar. Passing everyone that was going to the arena. \"Gosh, what happened.\" \"What the...\" \"Is he ok?\" \"What happened?!\" You hear from all sides while you pass the civilians on the way to the hedgehog hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKansama burst in the door.

I don't know if the blood is coming from the lungs.\" Tails says. You scratch your head wondering how he sees that. Sonic crouches and comes back up with a first aid kit in his hand.

There seem to be many breeds of them, but they all have a common trait...They have no skin in most places, their bare muscles show, their skeleton covers some parts on the outside and also supports some on the inside, a mix of a human and an insect's skeleton. They also have large sheets of a strong metal covering their body like armor. Some parts are not covered, usually the underbelly, which usually only has part of the skeleton on it. And...the only way to kill them quickly is to destroy a transparent, gem-like, yellow rock that exists on or in them, called the nucleus.

You remembered how you ate an annoying head of the football team at your school, Bill, as well as all his minions. You began to deal with each person who threatened you by eating them. You weren't a bully, but nobody had the guts to fight you in school anymore. You came here to find your 18-year old brother, Xaru(pronounced Zar-oo) It turned out he dealt with bullies that way too. When you were captured, you were asked for any last rquests. You said to be exiled to this desert. They laughed, unaware that you wanted to come here to see your brother. <br>\r\n     \"What is your name?\" Draco asked.<br>\r\n     \"Karu.\" you say.<br>\r\n     \"Age?\" Draco said.<br>\r\n     \"Sixteen.\"<br>\r\n     \"Any relatives?\" <br>\r\n     \"My parents were sent to another camp and my brother was sent here.

Consider your debt repaid.\" Draco said tossing you a very shiny gold and silver amulet. He also tossed a gold coin. \"Pay the rat on the wheel in the elevator and he'll take you down. Tell your brother I said hi. Also, if you wish to find others of your kind, go to a place called the Draconic Den.\" <br>\r\n      You proceeded to the rickety-looking elevator, payed the rat, and it began to spin a wheel it was on, sending the elevator down. Soon, you arrived at the bottom. You looked into a hall that had a large door at the end. You could also go left and right into other halls. You headed outside of this palace. You saw a huge contrast in the area outside. The streets had pebbles scattered across them as pavement. The buildings were only up to three floors high. You looked up and saw the palace was a few hundred feet up, with a large lighthouse like structure on top about 40 feet high. The buildings also looked like they were made from clay and sticks put together.</span></div></div>",

You knocked on the door three times, a letter box sized gap appeared in the door, bright yellow eyes staring out of it at you.  \"Who are you, what is your buissiness?\" a voice asked in Draconic (language of dragons, used for secrecy) on the other side of the door.  \"I am Karu, I'm looking for my brother Xaru\" you answer in the same language.  \"You may come in,\" the dragon says opening the door,\"but i'm afaid Xaru is not here, but i can point you towards someone who knows him\"  \"thank you\" you reply<br>\r\nHe takes you to the bar, true enough there are only dragons in this building.
