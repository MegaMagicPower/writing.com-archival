            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a very hot spring day when the entire Smith family was at home; each doing their own thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby was slaving away in the large kitchen, preparing the barbecue dinner for that afternoon, while Frank was in the garage to free the large grill from its winter hide-out. He cursed as a large dumbbell rolled from a shelf above the grill, hitting the concrete floor leaving a crack. He accidentally hit the shelf as he was trying to move the heavy barbecue. It was hidden behind a new weight bench his oldest son had managed to score cheap at work; it was a shame that he hardly used it though. Frank tried to pick up the 30lbs dumbbell, but it was a lot heavier than he thought. \u201cMaybe I should start using the weight bench\u201d he joked as he managed to put the dumbbell back on the shelf with two hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Debby was cutting some onions when her eyes went all watery. She tried to rub the water out of her eyes with her sleeve, but it didn\u2019t help much. The onions were too strong. She looked up at the window and through her tears she could see a faint silhouette of her neighbor from across the street: Joe Daniels. He was in his late twenties, single and had recently moved in. Debby dried her eyes once more, and blinked to adjust focus. Across the street, her hunky neighbor was mowing his front lawn\u2026shirtless! She could hardly believe what she saw; Joe obviously took good care of his body. As she was reminding herself to bake a nice apple pie and go over to introduce herself, Joe spotted her gaze. He waved at her as he wiped his sweat off of his face and torso. Debby, broken out of her day dream, waved back with red cheeks and continued mincing her onions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the backyard the twins Dylan and Davy were enjoying the sun, each in their own way: Dylan was practicing cartwheels, while Davy read his favorite comic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house, on the first floor, oldest son Justin was changing out of his work costume. He just came back from Wal-Mart, where he works at the sports section. He was about to put on something more casual for dinner. His best buddy and co-worker Jerome was also in the room, wearing a wife beater. He was playing with Justin\u2019s football on the edge of the bed, when Justin unbuttoned his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! You have GOT to start working out if you want to have ANY success with the ladies\u2026\u201d Jerome said as he saw Justin\u2019s shirtless body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Justin responded a bit agitated \u201cYou start to sound like Coach Graham!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sorry\u2026but I\u2019m just saying\u2026\u201d Jerome approached Justin \u201c\u2026this is just more what the ladies like!\u201d He flexed his sleeveless arm next to Justin\u2019s; the contrast in both size as well as skin color was amusing. Jerome, being Afro-American, had the darkest skin tone you could imagine; while Justin\u2019s milky white skin was the exact opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin placed his free hand on Jerome\u2019s flexed biceps, squeezed slightly and then pushed him away. From any other person with arms like Jerome\u2019s, he would be jealous as hell, but he couldn\u2019t be jealous of his best buddy. He smirked. \u201cI see! And tell me again how much luck those arms have given you with the ladies\u2026?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome started laughing. Both boys told each other everything, even the juicy bits concerning girl, and Justin knew Jerome hadn\u2019t had much luck with the girl he had a crush on. \u201cTouch\u00e9 buddy! You\u2019ve got me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin quickly threw on a shirt and both boys went downstairs. As they passed the front door, Amber, Justin\u2019s little sister, came home from a long day at school. Just as she opened the door, Jerome passed by it. He looked Amber straight in the eyes and smiled. \u201cHi!\u201d he said softly as he followed Justin to the kitchen. Amber blushed; her brother\u2019s hot friend just said hi to her. She put aside her bag and followed everyone else into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby welcomed her only daughter with a kiss on her forehead, much to Amber\u2019s embarrassment as Jerome was in the same room. She quickly looked if Jerome had spotted the kiss, but he was pre-occupied with talking to Justin. They were discussing girl friend material, and Amber couldn\u2019t help but overhear Jerome talking about Priscilla from down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber knew Priscilla as the tall, bitchy former-captain of the cheerleading squad at her school. Now that she is at college, she has similar classes as Justin and Jerome. She was gorgeous, yet a bit terrifying, with her full 6 feet ripped physique. Her arms rivaled most college boys; in fact Amber thinks her biceps might be bigger than Justin\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPriscilla Newton? From down the road? The girl with the freaky arms; you dig her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s hot! I like my girl to have a bit of muscle\u2026means they\u2019re great in bed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! You\u2019re sick! She looks like a man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, it\u2019s not that bad. Her body is hot! I can\u2019t help it she\u2019s got bigger arms than you!\u201d Jerome said as he squeezed Justin\u2019s upper arm. He wasn\u2019t expecting that at all, causing him to almost drop the glass of coke on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, watch out!\u201d he laughed \u201cOh mom, that reminds me, is it OK if Jerome stays for dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine by me, if his mom is OK with it\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I just phoned her up, it was no problem\u201d Jerome intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, be my guest!\u201d Debby said. \u201cCould you boys go check on your dad; he should be firing up the grill by now, but I haven\u2019t seen him leave the garage at all\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing mom!\u201d Justin said as he signed his buddy to follow him outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd could you give me a hand with these peppers, Amber?\u201d Debby asked Amber who was gazing at Jerome\u2019s body. \u201cAmber? Hello, earth to Amber!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were fixated on the dark brown arms that escaped the black wife beater as Jerome walked out the kitchen. She imagined how those strong arms could hold her close to his body; how she would be safe and protected. And then his ass; round and protruding, she would be more than happy to pinch it\u2026if only once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmber?!\u201d her mother yelled one final time. She snapped out of her daydream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh sorry mom! What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby smiled. She knew exactly what her little girl was doing. \u201cCould you please help me cut these peppers in small bits?\u201d she said as she turned around and directed her stare outside at Joe, who was still mowing the lawn shirtless. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the garage, Frank was sweating like a pig. He had just managed to move the weight bench over to the side, making room for the grill to go through, but he had not calculated in its weight. As he did the best he could pushing the grill towards the door leading to the backyard, he didn\u2019t hear his son and Jerome enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah dad, take it easy, you\u2019re turning red!\u201d Justin said as he padded his dad on the back. \u201cDo you need a hand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hi boys! Man, this thing is heavier than I remembered! I could sure use two strapping young boys like yourselves; especially you Jerome!\u201d Frank said as he took a good look at Jerome\u2019s sleeveless arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome laughed. \u201cThanks Mr Smith!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Justin yelled \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me\u2026dad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome laughed even harder. Justin threw him a nasty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026nevermind, just help me out, will you!\u201d Frank directed the boys each to a side of the grill. \u201cOn three; one...two...THREE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the help of the two boys, the grill was easily lifted several inches off the ground. It was still extremely heavy, even when the weight was supported by three grown men, but they managed to carry it outside and install it on the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much later the grill was heating up and as the entire family, plus Jerome, was enjoying a nice meal, the doorbell suddenly rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho could that be?\u201d Frank asked Debby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not expecting anyone\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go!\u201d Justin said as he left the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a minute later he came back with a large box in his hands. It had a large red bow and an envelope attached to it, which he had opened and started reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is Vanessa, dad?\u201d Justin asked as he approached the entire family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank\u2019s head turned red. \u201cOh, just a colleague of mine\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby looked at her husband suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she obviously likes you a lot. This is what she wrote: Dear Frank, when I saw this little device, I had to think of you instantly. It will fix your problems and make you irresistible! Use it wisely! Love, Vanessa\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Debby looked at her husband furiously. \u201c\u2019Love, Vanessa\u2019?!? Frank\u2026Is there something you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo honey, there is nothing!\u201d, he lied, \u201cshe\u2019s just a good colleague. I bet she just send me over a bottle of perfume or something like that\u2026she\u2019s like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s no perfume!\u201d Justin said as he had opened the box and looked inside. With one hand he reached into the box and pulled out a toy gun; or at least it looked like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that? A toy gun?\u201d Amber remarked as everyone else around the table was surprised by the little gift. \u201cWhat is she, like 6?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin started laughing. \u201cDad, this is ridiculous. Is she playing a prank on you or something?\u201d He held the gun in his hand like you would hold a normal gun and started pointing it at different members of the family. He even imitated space-age noises as he shot his family and friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when pointing at one specific member of the family, he accidentally pulled the trigger and a blue beam shot out of the barrel of the gun, engulfing the person in a blue haze. It was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Justin pretended to shoot all his family members with the strange looking gun his father had just received, he couldn\u2019t help but think if something would happen if he did pull the trigger. This thought kept creeping through his mind as he fake-blasted every family member that was at the table. He couldn\u2019t just try and shoot his brothers or sister, or even worse one of his parents, and see what would happen. What if the thing could kill someone? That would be irresponsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished playing with the device and noticed everyone around the table losing interest. After they finished laughing, they turned to their plates and continued eating. But Justin, still the only one standing, couldn\u2019t put the gun down without finding out what it could do. His curiosity won over. Perhaps there was a clue somewhere on the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started inspecting the gun a little closer; he turned it around, look at every nook and cranny, but couldn\u2019t find anything besides the trigger and the barrel. Until he looked at the underside of the handle; there was a small inscription. He couldn\u2019t quite make out what it was, so he held the gun closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know that while he was rotating the gun to get a better look, he accidentally pulled the trigger, letting the gun shoot out a blue ray at his own chest, engulfing him in it completely for several seconds. Everybody at the table looked up in shock at what happened to the 19-year-old.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There he was, frozen solid, the only one standing at the end of the table. He held the gun in his right hand as he saw flashes of blue light taking over his vision. As a blur he saw his family and friend turn their heads towards him; their expressions shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let the gun drop to the ground as a tingling sensation took over his body, starting at his chest. Every known body in his body started to tingle; it was an odd sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he vision came back; the blue flashes had stopped. In front of him were his family and his best buddy, all looking at him with their mouths open. The tingling sensation slowly subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell was that?!?\u201d Dylan yelled the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness, you\u2019ve shot yourself?!\u201d his mother added quite upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you feel, son? Are you alright?\u201d his dad questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know what it was, but I feel fi\u2026\u201d Justin started, when another type of sensation took over his body. This time it hurt more; it was a burning sensation. It started in his chest and soon took over every other muscle in his body. As an automatic reaction, Justin grabbed his stomach and hunched forward. He screamed and grunted from the pain. He even cried. As the burning sensation reached his legs, he let himself fall to the concrete floor. The entire family shot up from their seats and gathered around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he lay, on the ground, in a fetal position, kicking, crying and screaming in pain. \u201cMake it stop! Please make it stop!\u201d he managed to cry. His dad positioned himself next to his son\u2019s head and grabbed him closer. He tried to calm his son on his lap. Justin grabbed his dad\u2019s arm and clenched on to it. The sensation in his body did not stop; it was killing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook!\u201d, Dylan yelled, \u201cHis Shoulder!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire group focused their attention on Justin\u2019s shoulder, which seemed to\u2026inflate?!? It rapidly grew larger and wider, pushing further away from his neck. His other shoulder did the exact same thing. The fabric of his t-shirt began to cling tighter to his body. Justin turned on his back, screaming in pain, as he exposed his growing chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, he\u2019s building muscles by the second!\u201d Amber said as she looked on as Justin\u2019s chest expanded. Two slabs of meat were growing beneath his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like the Hulk!\u201d Davy screamed excited. He couldn\u2019t believe his own brother was hulking out of his clothes right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe garden was suddenly filled with stretching and bone cracking noises, paired with screams and primal grunts. Whatever Justin was going through, it hurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back on his stomach, exposing his growing back. It grew wider and wider, leaving little room for his shirt. That\u2019s when the seams started to give way; his expanding body was ripping through his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, look at his back\u2026those muscles!\u201d Dylan yelled from excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tears in his t-shirt grew larger as more of his back was exposed. All the muscles in his back tightened and relaxed after one another. The remainder of the ripped shirt was riding up his torso, indicating that he did not only grow wider, but taller as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin held his arms close to his body as he was still clinging onto his father\u2019s arm. Frank looked down at the hands grabbing his wrist as he felt the grip tighten. He saw Justin\u2019s biceps and triceps inflate and lengthen, getting more defined and sculpting his upper arms. The sleeves of his shirt could no longer contain the growing biceps; causing them to rip apart like the rest of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin\u2019s growing torso was still resting on Frank\u2019s lap. His son\u2019s transformation made him much heavier, weighing down considerably on his thighs. It hurt. With his free hand, he grabbed Justin\u2019s bull-like neck and asked \u201cJustin, I know you\u2019re in there\u2026can you hear me? You are hurting me! Please, if you can\u2026let go of my arm!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank did not think it would work, but to his surprise the grip in Justin\u2019s hands started to loosen. Fighting the transformation that took place in his body, the boy managed to do what his father had asked. He let go of his father\u2019s arm and placed his hands flat on the ground. Then he pushed up his upper body with his newly grown arms; he was now resting on his stretched arms and knees. But his legs hadn\u2019t fully grown yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if they got an electric shock, his legs stretched out completely, making his pelvis collapse to the ground. He almost hit his sister Amber, who could jump out of the way in time, with his growing limb. His legs first grew larger, growing out of his trousers, making them look like board shorts. Then they started expanding with muscle, filling up every available space in the jeans, just until they started ripping. First the seams, then the actual fabric. Unlike the Hulk, Justin\u2019s entire jeans ripped off, leaving him exposed only in his white CK boxer briefs. His waist and glutes were just growing too big to remain contained in a ripped off version of his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost 5 minutes the burning sensation in Justin\u2019s muscles began to fade away. He was still resting on all fours, his head facing down. His family and best friend were circled around him, taking in every rippling muscle on his back as it rose up and down when he breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank noticed his son\u2019s transformation came to an end when the stretching sounds disappeared. \u201cSon\u2026.how, how are you feeling?\u201d he said as he placed his hand on his back. His skin was hot; it radiated heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026\u201d a dark voice boomed from under the person. He started lifting his head, uncontrollably flexing his traps. Frank felt the muscle tissue under his hand harden. \u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you grew\u2026\u201d Frank replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin faced his head towards his father. He smiled. Then he rotated and looked at the rest of his family and his best friend. They all looked at him with their mouths open and their eyes wide. He looked back at his dad again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I grew?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes son, look at yourself! Look at your body\u2026\u201d his dad proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin pushed his upper body back, shifting his weight so that he could sit on his knees. Then he looked down. All he saw were two enormous slabs of meat blocking his view. He moved his right arm, when his right pec twitched up, becoming rock hard. As he looked at his arm, his own eyes grew wide as well. He was looking at the biggest, must fully developed, hardly any body fat containing arm he had ever seen. This couldn\u2019t be his. He bent his lower arm, his biceps popped into action. He reached out with his other arm, touching his biceps. He made a fist, flexing the biceps rock solid. He felt it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026my\u2026fucking\u2026god!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly hunched forward, looking over his chest down at his stomach. A chiseled eight-pack, usually only seen on male fitness models on those awful home shopping channels, was diving down into his stretched-out boxer briefs. His thighs were enormous, almost as big as his waist used to be he reckoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire family looked on as Justin was exploring his new body for the very first time. Some of them were just as excited as Justin, while others were worried. Mostly his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin felt he had enough energy to take on the world. He leaned forward, placing one hand flat on the floor, as he pushed his ass up. He was getting ready to stand up, though it proved more difficult in this new body. As he slowly started to rise in the air, he passed every one of his family members in height; Amber, his mom, the twins, Jerome\u2026even his dad. They all tilted their heads up to continue following Justin\u2019s face. Finally Justin reached his new full height; he looked over everyone present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus, you\u2019re a giant!\u201d Amber yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin looked down and grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re not scared of me, are you?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Yet she wasn\u2019t scared; somehow she knew her brother wouldn\u2019t harm her, even if he easily could with his new frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not scared of me, are you?\u201d Justin replied to Amber\u2019s conclusion. He tried to look as scary as possible, flexing his entire torso in a most muscular pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked at him, not frightened at all, and started laughing. She placed her hand on one of Justin\u2019s broad shoulders and said: \u201cFor you? Why should I? You\u2019re my big bro\u2026you\u2019ll never scare me?\u201d Then she walked passed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin\u2019s angry expression melted from his face as he had no effect on his sister. How could that be? He turned around and grabbed his sister from behind, lifting her off of her feet, several inches into the air. He hollowed his back, lifting Amber even higher, as he started tickling her. Amber, very ticklish, started laughing and kicking her feet all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no! Stop! Stop it!\u201d she said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026still not scared of me now?!\u201d Justin said laughing as well as he continued tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins saw how Justin just opened the famous Smith family tickle-attack, and initiated their own attack. \u201cCharge!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys jumped onto Justin\u2019s towering body and started tickling him. Justin was now carrying his three siblings, who were all kicking, screaming and laughing, without too much trouble. Unaware to the twins, his new thick skin made him immune for tickling, yet he decided to play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, they\u2019re killing me!\u201d he yelled as he let himself slowly fall on his knees. Dad, mom and Jerome looked on laughing as the three siblings were trying to get down the beast. They had so much fun, laughing out loud, ultimately ending on the ground, tickling each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening went by quickly. No-one was scared of the hulking teen and Justin himself started to get used to his new height and weight. The twins were impressed with his body and inspected every muscle, which Justin happily flexed. After a while, Jerome went home and Justin was getting tired. He had to get to college the next morning, so he said goodnight and went up to his room. His bed squeaked under the new weight, but it managed to not fall apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the alarm went off quite early. At 6am, Justin launched his arm on his alarm clock, completely smashing it to bits. He immediately sat up straight in his bed, awake, looking down at his body, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes he blinked again and looked down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t a dream\u2026I just forgot how strong I was\u2026\u201d he said as he looked at the smashed alarm clock. He flexed his arm and felt his biceps. \u201cDamn, I think I\u2019ll never get enough of that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he felt his own flexed arm he felt something else twitch under his bed sheets. He opened them and looked down at his crotch. \u201cOh holy mother of god\u2026it\u2019s massive!\u201d There, through his maximally stretched boxer briefs, was the biggest boner he had experienced in his life. Everything had grown on his body to match the proportions, even that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he was too afraid to touch it, but he figured it was part of him now, so why not. He put his big hand into his boxer briefs and tried to push his morning wood down. As he let go of it, it jumped straight back up. \u201cWell, that was useless\u201d he said to himself. He figured it might just go away if he stopped thinking about it, as it usually did. He headed for the shower, but as he entered the bathroom and saw his own full reflection in the mirror, his boner sprang to full mast again, almost tearing through the stretch cotton of his underwear. It was the first time he saw his own new body at full-size, and even he was blown away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn!\u201d He flexed every available muscle, inspecting every body part is his physique, before finally getting into the shower. He jacked off to his reflection while in the shower, leading to the best masturbation of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a hard time finding clothing that fit; the only thing that was somewhat suitable was his sweatpants and sweatshirt. They were usually about a size too big, hanging loosely over his body, but now they were stretched skin tight over his physique. It was a funny sight to behold, yet it was the only thing he could find on this short notice. \u201cMental note: have to get out and buy some new clothes, soon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an extensive breakfast, he ate more than usual, his buddy Jerome rang the door to pick him up for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! I forgot how big you were!\u201d Jerome said as Justin opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, so did I when I woke up this morning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys headed towards Jerome\u2019s car. It was a tight fit, but Justin managed to squeeze himself in on the passenger\u2019s seat. The entire car\u2019s suspension shifted towards the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, here we go!\u201d, Jerome said as he started his car, \u201cI\u2019m so curious how everybody is going to react on your new physique\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, so am I\u2026\u201d, Justin said as he was thinking about Kim, the hottest girl at college, \u201cDo you think Kim will like me now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim!?\u201d, Jerome said a bit surprised, \u201cTHE Kim? You fancy her? Damn, so do I\u2026but I hardly stand a chance against you\u2026look at you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin laughed. \u201cAh, sorry buddy! Life\u2019s unfair, isn\u2019t it\u2026?\u201d He laughed harder, softly punching Jerome on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch, watch out where you punch, Hercules\u201d, Jerome said as he rubbed his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry buddy, I did it as soft as I could. Still need to get used to these!\u201d Justin said as he raised his arms in the air and flexed both of them. It was a tight fit in the car, but his biceps popped to full size, further stretching out the sleeves of his sweat shirt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When the haze disappeared, everyone around the table was staring at Justin with eyes and mouths open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJustin, honey, are you feeling alright?\u201d his mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah, I guess so\u2026what was that?\u201d Justin asked a bit dozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA strange blue ray came out of the gun, and it hit you!\u201d Davy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, strange. I feel nothing! I feel fine actually\u2026\u201d, Justin concluded, \u201cI guess it was nothing. Let\u2019s continue our dinner\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin picked up the gun from the floor and put it back in the box. Then he put the box aside on the ground and went back to his seat. \u201cMan I\u2019m starving! Is there any meat left?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a minute\u201d, Justin\u2019s dad said, \u201cI\u2019ve almost got a rib eye ready for you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole family continued eating, some more than others. To Debby\u2019s surprise, Justin ate more than usual. He was beginning on his fourth steak; usually he\u2019s full after his second. She figured he must just be hungry from work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, while Debby and Amber were cleaning off the table, all the boys were still at the table. Dylan, the athletic twin, had been eyeing Jerome\u2019s upper arm up and down all throughout dinner and finally dared to ask him a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJerome?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah buddy, what is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big are your arms?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome laughed. He was flattered that his best friend\u2019s little brother noticed the hard work he had put in his arms. \u201cThese babies, the last time I\u2019ve checked they were close to 15 inches, flexed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how much time do you work out to get those arms?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI workout about four times a week\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d Jerome sneered at Justin \u201cIf you finally get your lazy ass off the ground and start to work out with me like I proposed over a dozen times, maybe then you can have arms like these!\u201d He lifted both his arms in the air and flexed his biceps to nice 15 inch peaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan\u2019s eyes grew wide. \u201cWow! Can I touch them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing!\u201d Jerome said as Dylan approached him. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see that at least someone in this family appreciates hard work and dedication!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin did not respond. Davy, the silent twin, adjusted his glasses as he looked at his big brother. Was he seeing things or did his shirt look tighter on his body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you give me some tips on building bigger arms?\u201d, Dylan asked Jerome, \u201cCoach said I need to grow more muscles if I want to perform the exercises properly\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing!\u201d, Jerome replied, \u201cbut first let me see what you\u2019ve got!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan obliged and flexed his arms as hard as he could. A nice, separated, biceps popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, impressive! We need to get those measured!\u201d Jerome suggested.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAlready on it!\u201d Dylan yelled as he ran inside to find a tape measure. After a minute he returned. He flexed his arms again and Jerome put the tape around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, impressive kid! 13.5 inch! For a 15-year-old that\u2019s impressive! They might even be bigger than Justin\u2019s!\u201d Jerome joked, knowing how much trouble his best buddy had with developing his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so? Justin, flex yours!\u201d Dylan asked excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to get humiliated in front of your little brother\u2026\u201d Jerome added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavy, now mesmerized by the body of his bigger brother, clearly noticed something was up. Given his comic book knowledge, he easily figured out the gun must have been part of it. He intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys arm-wrestle\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, Jerome and Dylan all looked at the geeky kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat way, you can easily decide who\u2019s the strongest of you all\u201d he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not such a crazy idea!\u201d Dylan said as he lined up his arm towards his bigger brother. \u201cUs first; the winner against Jerome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Jerome\u2019s clearly gonna win from me\u2026\u201d Justin decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut who said you can beat me; maybe I\u2019m stronger than you\u2026\u201d his little brother responded full of confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin reluctantly agreed. As he placed his non-flexed arm on the table, both Jerome and Dylan\u2019s eyes grew wide. \u201cDude, what\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, unaware of his physical changes, looked down at his arm and saw veins crawling all over his arm, which in general looked way bigger than before. His mouth fell open, but he decided to play along. He refrained himself from flexing as he said \u201cWhat? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re scared all of a sudden\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan, not scared for the challenge, positioned his arm opposite his brother\u2019s and the two locked hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn three\u201d, Jerome, the referee, decided, \u201cone\u2026two\u2026three!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan started pushing his brother\u2019s hand down, but to both his and Jerome\u2019s surprise, the arm didn\u2019t budge. He pressed harder, but the counter force was too strong. He looked up at Justin\u2019s face, who looked relax. \u201cSo when are you gonna apply some force?\u201d Justin asked jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan could not understand; he was sure his bigger brother was as thin as a twig. He had muscles from gymnastics, his brother had none. All the times before they arm-wrestled, he had won. How come Justin suddenly contains these huge arms? He started applying more pressure by throwing his entire weight into the game. The arm of Justin budged a little bit. It was working. He noticed Justin\u2019s face change as Dylan was winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Justin\u2019s arm was halfway down, Justin\u2019s free hand rolled up his sleeve, exposing his full upper arm for all the boys to see. The muscle in his arm didn\u2019t look flexed at all. Justin looked his little brother straight in the eye and whispered: \u201cmy turn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if out of nowhere, his arm grew into a clear cut biceps peak. The force Dylan was fighting against had ten folded; he couldn\u2019t stand a chance. Within a second, Justin has overtaken the match and pinned his little brother\u2019s 13.5 inch arm to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! Your arm! It\u2019s massive!\u201d Jerome exclaimed in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin could only laugh. He didn\u2019t know, until the match, what was happening to him, but now he had an explanation. After he shot himself with the gun, he felt funny inside. A tingling sensation all over his body. He discarded it as nothing, as it wasn\u2019t bothering him, but he knew something was up. Perhaps he was getting a cold; nothing to worry about. But then he felt his clothes getting tighter and this massive arm appeared out of his sleeve. He knew he could beat his brother. His self-confidence grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks! Now don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re afraid to go against me\u2026?\u201d he asked Jerome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, of course not, bring it on! I bet I\u2019m still stronger than you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan, rubbing his arm from the pain, went to sit next to his twin brother, who looked in awe at Justin\u2019s ripped upper arm. Davy knew something was up, and it turned out right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two best friends positioned themselves opposite each other; with their right arms on the table they interlocked hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan someone count us off?\u201d Jerome asked the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing!\u201d, Dylan agreed, \u201cone\u2026two\u2026three!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys started off their match; it was obvious to Justin Jerome was a better match than his little brother. It would be difficult to beat him, based on the force he had to apply. In both boys\u2019 arms the biceps popped up like balloons getting inflated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, not moving an inch, Justin was certain he met his equal. He tried one last time to push everything he got out of his arm and\u2026</span></div></div>",

Then he fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, unaware of what his little brother was doing, looked into Jerome\u2019s eyes. He saw the brute strength in his expression; he never knew he would be able to match that. Next he looked down at his arm; the arm that felt like it didn\u2019t belong to him. He was starting to become curious what the rest of his body must look like now, as he figured his arm wasn\u2019t the only thing that got more muscular. His bulging biceps, exposed as he had rolled up his sleeve, was throbbing with power. Veins grew larger, encapsulating it, feeding it with blood and oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the blue haze returned. For a second he was blinded with blue light. As his vision returned he looked around to see his little brother standing there with the gun pointed at his body. He knew what has happened, and he couldn\u2019t be more happy with it. \u201cThis will show Jerome!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Justin, however, felt more energetic than before. He had a good reason, as he was just zapped for a second time by the strange gun his dad received just moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, it must take some time, but Justin felt extra strength building up in his body. He looked at Jerome, who was looking down at his own arm, inspecting its bulging biceps. Apparently his best buddy had not noticed what Davy, his youngest brother, had done to him. Then he looked at Dylan, who was the referee of the match. He was so pre-occupied with comparing his arms with those of Jerome and Justin, that he hadn\u2019t noticed a thing either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin looked back at Davy again; who winked. He couldn\u2019t be more proud of his little brother as this match otherwise had no end. And this ending fancied him; he couldn\u2019t wait to finally beat his friend who had always been the strongest of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother minute had passed and Justin started to feel the effects of the ray. The tingling sensation returned all over his body. This weakened him ever so slightly, opening up an opportunity for Jerome to attack. Jerome, now grinning from ear to ear, saw Justin\u2019s arm move closer and closer to the table. But after he passed the 45 degree angle, the force in Justin\u2019s arm suddenly increased. The grin disappeared from his face as he looked at his buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Justin was grinning from ear to ear. \u201cYou almost had me there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome looked at Justin\u2019s biceps which was once again crawling with pulsating veins. He blinked as he couldn\u2019t believe what he saw; did he really see the biceps grow ever so slightly?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome started to get tired, but he wasn\u2019t ready to give up. He adjusted his seating and started to put some body weight into the game. Without success. Justin pushed Jerome\u2019s arm to the starting position ever so slowly. No matter how much force Jerome applied, he couldn\u2019t get it to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two arms reached the starting position again, Justin looked Jerome straight in the eyes. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis!\u201d Justin yelled as he slammed the arm of his buddy to the table. The biceps in his arm exploded in size, ripping his rolled up sleeve apart. \u201cGOT YA!\u201d he yelled from excitement as Jerome quickly pulled away his arm from the table. The last, unexpected, blow had hurt and he tried to shake it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan, still sitting at the side, couldn\u2019t believe what his eyes saw. His mouth fell open as he heard Justin\u2019s arm rip open part of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Bro! What has happened to you!? You\u2019re ripped!\u201d he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavy could only smile as he witnessed the hulking power of his big brother. And he knew what unleashed it; he was holding it in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got myself some well-deserved growth spurts, guys!\u201d Justin tried to explain as both Dylan as well as Jerome were mesmerized by his right arm. \u201cStill not afraid of me?\u201d he asked Jerome as he flexed his right arm into an even more impressive peak than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, this is just unbelievable! You can never be bigger than me\u2026that\u2019s impossible\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanne measure it?\u201d Justin said filled with self-confident as he positioned his flexed arm in front of Jerome\u2019s face. \u201cOr better yet, why don\u2019t we compare?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome didn\u2019t want to, but Justin didn\u2019t let him off the hook that easily. With his left hand he grabbed Jerome\u2019s arm and bent it as if he was flexing. \u201cCome on, work with me, or are you afraid to be humiliated?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome knew it was the exact same phrase he had used on Justin before the arm-wrestling match, so he couldn\u2019t bail. He flexed his still impressive 15 inch arm next to Justin\u2019s, but as soon as he did, he knew it was no match for the now 16.5 inch pythons of Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin could only laugh out loud at the size difference between the two arms. With his free hand he squeezed Jerome\u2019s biceps and asked \u201cIs this all you\u2019ve got?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumiliated, Jerome punched Justin in the stomach. It was an old habit they used to do to each other when they had a disagreement. However before when Jerome punched Justin, he felt nothing more than an untrained, flat belly. Now he was punching something hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! What are you hiding under there?!\u201d Jerome said as he lifted up the lower half of Justin\u2019s now extremely tight shirt. \u201cJesus Christ! That\u2019s what I call an eight-pack!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden underneath the fabric of the size M t-shirt was a row of abdominals only seen on those fitness commercials. Jerome could clearly count 8 individual abs, which were visible due to his extremely low body fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, take off your shirt!\u201d Jerome insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, now as curious about his body as any other person in the backyard, removed his shirt in a second. What he revealed was the most perfectly chiseled torso in the entire neighborhood; rivaling those of professional male fitness models. His shoulders had widened and his pecs had grown into an impressive set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me try something\u2026\u201d Justin said as he concentrated. Within seconds, he mastered the famous pec dance; alternating his left and right pec to flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, that\u2019s awesome!\u201d, Jerome said as he inspected his buddy\u2019s body, \u201cWhat\u2019s your secret?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Both Justin &amp; Jerome noticed as he put his hand on Brett's shoulder, Brett lost some muscle &amp; a little bit of height but he didn't notice. Justin's shorts inched up a slight bit &amp; his shirt filled up as he got a little taller &amp; more muscular. Brett turned &amp; said, \"What do you want pipsqueak?\" Justin replied, \"I bet I can beat you in an arm wrestling match. If I beat you, You have to quit the football team, leave my friends &amp; I alone.\" Brett laughed so hard &amp; replied, \"theres no way you can beat me. When I beat you, you will have to serve me the rest of the school year.\" Justin &amp; Brett sat down at a table &amp; locked thier hands in the starting position. They both felt that tingling sensation again but Brett ignored it. Justin underestimated how much stronger Brett was still because Brett continued to push Justin's arm almost flat on the table. Brett was smilling from ear to ear. Suddenly Justin could feel more &amp; more strength pouring into his muscles. He could even feel his muscles growing. He stopped Brett from lowering him arm &amp; started raising it back to the starting position. Brett's smile disapeared. As he was watching the match, Jerome could actually see Justins muscles get bigger &amp; his shirt get tighter. Jerome thought to himself, \"Brett's muscles look smaller &amp; his clothes look loose.\" Justin started adding more strength pushing Brett's arm towards the table. Brett then tried using his weight to stop Justin but couldn't. As Justin slammed Brett's arm down, his sleeves &amp; shirt ripped open from his added muscle. Brett said, \"I cant believe you beat me!\" Both Justin &amp; Brett stood up. All three of them gasped. Brett was no longer the big, tall &amp; muscular quarterback. Instead he was now shorter than Jerome standing 5 ft 6, 130 lbs &amp; as skinny as a rail. Justin is now 6 ft 6, 250 lbs sold muscle &amp; ripped. As soon as Brett stood up his shorts fell down. Brett pulled them up, ran to his truck &amp; drove off. Jerome said, you should try out for the quarterback position. even if Brett doesnt keep his part of the bet, he cant be quarterback. He's to weak &amp; he would be crushed.\" Justin replied, \"i will but first I got to get some clothes that fit first.\" Jerome replied, \"way ahead of you. I've got a few boxes of some of Jeremy's clothes &amp; shoes he outgrew in the truck. I was going to take them to good will later. He just had a growth spurt &amp; stands 7 ft even &amp; weighs 300 lbs.\" Jeremy is Jerome's giant, muscular 16 year old brother.

Justin said, \"How did you get so big so fast?\" Jerome replied, \"I noticed one our friends being beat up by The Titan so i was able to sneak up behind him. I then tackled him to the ground &amp; got him into a wrestling hold &amp; kept him in it while he lost all of his extra height, muscle &amp; strength. to say the least he's no titan any more.

Are you OK?\u201d Justin panicked as he had just shot his own dad with an unknown ray gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, how are you feeling?\u201d his concerned wife asked sitting at the opposite end of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I feel fine\u2026I think\u2026.\u201d Frank said as he shifted his weight in the chair. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was an accident, I swear!\u201d Justin said, still a bit in shock. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, son, take it easy! It\u2019s OK, I feel fine!\u201d Frank lied as he did feel a strange sensation in his stomach. \u201cJust tell me what you did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I shot you\u2026with this?\u201d Justin said as he handed over the gun to his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank inspected the device with great attention. It did look like a gun a toy shop would sell, a bit like a 1950s space zapper. \u201cAnd what happened next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA blue beam shot out the front and hit you in the chest. You were radiating blue as well for a second!\u201d Davy yelled a little bit too excited. He could see this entire thing form into one of his comic book stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank laughed. \u201cWell, there is no need to worry guys, I feel absolutely fine! I\u2019m sure this is only a prank a colleague likes to play on me, and the thing is absolutely harmless\u2026\u201d Frank stood up. \u201cLet me, just to be safe, put this at a safe place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Frank disappeared into the house, the rumors started spreading. \u201cWhat do you think it did?\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t kill him, so I think he\u2019s right, it might just be a prank\u201d \u201cBut why did he glow blue?\u201d \u201cAnd who is Vanessa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, Frank returned. He was wearing a dark and light grey striped polo with a pair of jeans. Due to his length, he always had to wear size M shirts, even though they were too wide for his upper body. Also his skinny arms would not at all fill the wide sleeves of his shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange sensation in his stomach had not gone away, in fact it had increased. Yet he was not alarmed by it. As he stepped outside to join his family again, he lifted his arm to scratch an itch at the back of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow mr. Smith, nice pipes if I may say so!\u201d Jerome said as he was the first one to notice the increased size of Frank\u2019s upper arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What?\u201d Franks responded, not entirely sure what Jerome meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour arms! They are quite impressive! I never knew they were this big. Have you been working out?\u201d Jerome explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank looked down at his upper arm and could not believe what he saw. His arm was a lot thicker than he could remember. Also the veins in his arms were clearly visible, pumping heavily with every heartbeat. Out of curiosity he flexed one of his arms a little, and to his surprise the biceps responded by growing into a decent peak. \u201cOh my god!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started breathing more rapidly, both from excitement as well as from the increased tingling in his stomach. The feel spread to his chest; a nasty sting in his heart area caused Frank to collapse to the ground. He landed on all fours, screaming from pain. The entire family went into shock and disbelieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, his oldest son, immediately ran to his father and asked if he needed any help, if he was feeling alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank couldn\u2019t answer. He started hyperventilating as the feeling in his chest increased. He started having trouble breathing as the collar of his polo was getting tighter around his neck. It wasn\u2019t his polo which shrank; however, it was his neck which expanded. Still on all fours he took one hand and yanked the collar open. He let out a loud sigh of relieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, now positioned on his knees next to his dad, was terrified. It was almost as if his dad was having a seizure; he was unresponsive to their questions and he had a vague look in his eyes. The biceps in Frank\u2019s upper arm grew even larger as he applied pressure to yank the collar open. Justin had a front row seat and was both scared as well as impressed with his dad\u2019s muscles. He put one hand on his dad\u2019s back, which oscillated up and down rapidly from every breathe he took, and felt a strange movement under the fabric of his dad\u2019s polo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad! Speak to me! Are you OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t reply. The rest of the family looked on in awe. Debby stopped the twins from getting closer and comforted Amber as she thought her dad was dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin\u2019s arm felt his dad\u2019s back expand, it grew. The fabric of his polo was getting tighter and tighter, just until it couldn\u2019t hold the pressure anymore. Then it ripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clear rip down the entire length of his polo opened up Frank\u2019s back for his family to see. Justin\u2019s hand now touched his dad\u2019s naked skin; it felt rock-hard. All the muscles underneath his skin were pulsating and expanding. He tried to calm his dad, who was still in a lot of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank\u2019s head hang downwards, facing the ground. He grunted and screamed; the transformation wasn\u2019t painless. His expanding upper torso was supported by his arms, which he held in a 90 degree angle on the ground. In a clear moment he opened his eyes and saw his own biceps blow up to unfamiliar size, his forearms reaching Popeye-esque proportions and veins crawling all over his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only his upper body was growing, also his legs were expanding in size. The jeans he was wearing were soon too tight and starting ripping at the seams much like his polo. Tree trunks of thighs and blown-up calves could now fully support the grown upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two, the tingling sensation went away and the growing stopped. The grunts and screams also stopped. Justin once again padded his dad\u2019s now enormous back and asked if his dad was feeling alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Justin was now the biggest man he had ever seen; completely ripped out of his clothes. All he was wearing was a pair of torn down jeans and pieces of fabric that used to be his polo. His head was still facing down. Justin felt his dad\u2019s back rise and lower as he slowly got back his breathing rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrank\u2026Honey?!\u201d his wife asked a bit nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his head started to move up. \u201cYes dear\u2026?\u201d a dark baritone voice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! You\u2019re OK!\u201d Debby yelled from excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you feeling, dad?\u201d Justin asked as he helped his father get up. He hooked his arms under his dad\u2019s armpit and pulled him up. He couldn\u2019t believe how large his upper arms and shoulders were now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026I\u2019m feeling alright, I think\u2026\u201d Frank said as he stretched his arms out and pushed his upper body backwards. He was now sitting on his knees, facing his son for the first time. His torso was still covered in rags of his polo, but with one simple tear he ripped them off completely exposing his chest and eight-pack for everyone to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOohs and aahs of awe and admiration filled the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god dad; you\u2019re as ripped as Superman!\u201d Davy yelled excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I have the strongest dad in the world!\u201d Dylan added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh honey\u2026\u201d his wife remarked with lust in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang mr. Smith, looking good!\u201d Jerome commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these comments made Frank cheer up. He was still sitting on the ground as he wasn\u2019t completely used to his new physique. It felt heavy, yet light at the same time. He felt so strong that his body must be able to support his new size easily, but he had difficulties adjusting to his new strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis twins decided to approach their new muscular father. He had ripped off every piece of fabric and was now sitting shirtless on his knees. His chest was filled with a lightly grey patch of chest hair. Dylan decided to take the gamble and reached out his hand to touch his father\u2019s pectoral. He pushed down on the soft, fleshy muscle. Frank looked down and grinned. He moved his arm, unknowingly flexing his chest as a result, causing his pec to turn rock hard. Dylan\u2019s impressed finger bounced back. He could not dent it anymore. His mouth fell open as he touched the now flexed chest muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Dylan exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing, here, look at this!\u201d He lifted both his arms in the air, parallel to the ground, with his lower arms at a 90 degree angle. They looked impressive, even not flexed. He asked his boys to put their hands on his biceps. They were both impressed with the size of his arms, until he decided to flex them. His biceps suddenly jumped up, higher than before, making them peak at an impressive size. The split heads of the biceps were clearly visible through the low percentage body fat skin he was now sporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody in the garden, including Frank, was impressed. They all let out a cheer. Frank grew a smile on his face from ear to ear. He was now feeling strong enough, and confident enough of his new size, to stand up completely. He put down his hands as supports and pushed his entire body up. He shifted his legs and placed his feet flat on the ground, followed by stretching them completely. Slowly, but steadily, he rose higher and higher, until he towered over his twins by almost a foot. They looked up in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank was always a pretty tall man, yet very skinny for his length. The man that stood before the twins right now was nothing short of amazing. He had the body of a giant Greek god and looked like he possessed Herculean strength. Yet it was the same old dad they grew up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby approached her husband. With her height she only reached his chest. \u201cOh honey, you look amazing!\u201d Then she hugged him.</span></div></div>",

As he blinked, his vision slowly returned; first blurry, then it refocused. All the while he heard his family panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! Dad! What did I do? I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d he heard the voice of his oldest son yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrank! Honey! Please say something\u2026?\u201d his wife yelled and then turning towards her son \u201cWhat was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d Justin almost cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad! Dad! Wake up!\u201d the twins yelled in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr Smith, are you OK?\u201d Jerome asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh look, he\u2019s regaining consciousness\u2026\u201d Amber, his daughter, explained to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Frank\u2019s vision returned, he couldn\u2019t help but notice a strange, tickling sensation on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, are you OK? Did I hurt you?\u201d Justin asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank let out a sigh as he adjusted his seating. \u201cNo son, it didn\u2019t hurt a bit\u2026and I\u2019m feeling fine. It\u2019s a bit ticklish, that\u2019s all\u2026\u201d Frank opened the top two buttons of his shirt, exposing the patch of grey chest hair, and rubbed his hand over it. His skin had turned red where the beam had hit his body. \u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing, I feel fine\u2026just a little itch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, still not entirely overcome by the shock of shooting his own dad with an unknown device, grabbed the gun from the floor and put it back in the box. \u201cLet\u2019s just keep this away from anyone until we find out if it\u2019s dangerous or not\u2026\u201d He went into the garage to store it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family, calmed down from the shock as they\u2019ve noticed Frank is alright, finishes dinner. As Debby is in the kitchen making coffee, the rest of the family sits outside, enjoying the nice evening. The sun is setting and it is starting to get dark. Frank turns on the porch lights and Amber lights some garden candles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d best be heading home\u201d Jerome said as he noticed what time it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to stay for a cup of coffee?\u201d Frank offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNa, sorry. It\u2019s already getting dark and I don\u2019t want my mom to worry too much\u201d, he confessed, \u201cshe hates it when I\u2019m out and about in the dark!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome got up from his seat and went over to Frank to shake his hand. Frank got up as well. He was about the same size as his son\u2019s friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you very much for the nice dinner though\u201d, he said as he grabbed Frank\u2019s hand and squeezed it gently, \u201c I\u2019ve really enjoyed it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries, you\u2019re always welcome here\u2026\u201d Frank said as he squeezed back. To Jerome\u2019s surprise, Justin\u2019s dad had a pretty firm grip himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoaw, pretty nice handshake you\u2019ve got there, mr. Smith!\u201d Jerome replied as he put his left hand on Frank\u2019s upper arm to compliment him. However he also did it to cup a feel. Through the fabric of Frank\u2019s long sleeved shirt Jerome could feel something hard and bigger than he suspected. \u201cYour workouts must be paying off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, who stood next to his dad, replied laughing \u201cWhat workouts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Jerome, I haven\u2019t been working out. In fact, I haven\u2019t touched a single weight in my life!\u201d Frank said as he rubbed his own upper arm with his left hand through his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, than I guess you\u2019re stronger than I always imagined\u201d, Jerome laughed. He continued thanking Debby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease say hi to your mother for us\u2026\u201d Debby asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026and your dad! Tell them to come over one day; we\u2019d love to catch up!\u201d Justin\u2019s dad added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will! See you boys!\u201d Jerome said as he waved at the twins \u201cAnd Amber, always nice to see you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber blushed. \u201cBye Jerome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin let Jerome out; as he returned he walked to his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that all about? Working out? You?\u201d he asked his dad as he put his arm around his dad\u2019s neck. His hand lay on his dad\u2019s shoulder so he quickly squeezed. Somehow it felt tighter than he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d, Frank laughed, \u201cI can hardly believe it myself...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no secret that Frank hated physical exercise. He wasn\u2019t blessed with the most perfect body, but at least he had a high metabolism, which let him stay skinny. He wanted nothing to do with exerting exercises or lifting heavy weights. He did however wanted, as all men, a more muscular body, but the only way to reach that is to exercise. Which is why he gave up on that dream a long time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the family had cleaned up the table, Amber went up stairs to her room to read some teen magazine, as did Davy with one of his comics. Dylan and Justin stayed outside, helping out their dad with the grill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you need a hand putting back the grill in the garage?\u201d Justin asked his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah boys, thanks, I could use the help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three Smith men each positioned themselves on one side of the grill. They grabbed it as good as they could and promised to lift it on three. \u201cOne\u2026two\u2026three!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan, even though the grill was heavy, managed to lift up his side of the grill some inches. Justin however had more trouble. He was weaker than his little brother, even though he didn\u2019t want to admit it. However the strangest thing happened on Frank\u2019s side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe, remembering the grill was extremely heavy, got ready to give it all the strength he got. When he yelled the number three, he pulled and to both his as well as his sons\u2019 surprise, he lifted it up almost a foot. It seemed much lighter than he remembered. The grill, now hanging in the air somewhat slanted, almost pushed over Justin who let it drop to the ground out of shock. Frank and Dylan let it drop as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad! Watch out, will you!?\u201d Justin yelled as he couldn\u2019t understand how his father could lift this heavy object so high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry son, let\u2019s try again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men tried again, this time Frank applied less force, and they managed to put the grill back into the garage. As they were walking with the heavy furniture in their hands, Justin couldn\u2019t help but stare at his father. His shirt looked somewhat different on him, as if his body underneath was somehow bigger. Maybe Jerome was telling the truth; maybe his dad was secretly working out to become bigger.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He landed on all fours, screaming from pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin immediately ran to his father and asked if he needed any help, if he was feeling alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank couldn\u2019t answer. He started hyperventilating as the feeling in his chest increased. He started having trouble breathing as the collar of his polo was getting tighter around his neck. It wasn\u2019t his polo which shrank; however, it was his neck which expanded. Still on all fours he took one hand and yanked the collar open. He let out a loud sigh of relief, but the pain kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad! Speak to me! Are you OK?\u201d Justin called. He didn\u2019t reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the transformation went on, Frank hardly noticed his skin turning green, or his hair becoming as white as snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin\u2019s arm felt his dad\u2019s back expand, it grew. The fabric of his polo was getting tighter and tighter, just until it couldn\u2019t hold the pressure anymore. Then it ripped right off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank\u2019s head hang downwards, facing the ground. He grunted and screamed; the transformation wasn\u2019t painless. His expanding upper torso was supported by his arms, which he held in a 90 degree angle on the ground. In a clear moment he opened his eyes and saw his own biceps blow up to unfamiliar size, his forearms reaching Popeye-esque proportions and veins crawling all over his green skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only his upper body was growing, also his legs were expanding in size. The jeans he was wearing were soon too tight and starting ripping at the seams much like his polo. Tree trunks of thighs and blown-up calves could now fully support the grown upper body. His feet grew till they burst from his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two, the tingling sensation went away and the growing stopped. The grunts and screams also stopped. Justin once again padded his dad\u2019s now enormous back and asked if his dad was feeling alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn place of Frank Smith was a bright green muscular man with white hair, wearing only torn down jeans, and his feet were bare and had a mild coat of mud on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Debbie then stood up and asked her husband if she could be excused.  As she stood up and turned to walk away, she felt an intense pain in her stomach. She cried out and grabbed her belly tightly and hunching over as the rest of the family stood up and went to her to see if they could offer any aid. \u201cWhat is it, honey?\u201d Frank asked in a concerned tone. \u201cMy\u2026My stomach\u2026It hurts\u201d was all Debbie could say. Going down to her knees she used one hand to brace herself up and one hand to grab her belly. She wore a long black skirt with a matching belt and a white blouse to prepare for her volunteer shift at the library she was going to after she had tidied up from the barbeque. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin and Amber came to their mother\u2019s side. \u2018What can we do, mom?\u2019 Justin blurted out. Amber put her hand to Debbie\u2019s shoulder surprised at the hardness of it but snapped back to reality quickly to help her beleaguered parent. \u2018Yeah mom, tell us what you need.\u2019 The twins, Dylan and Davy, just stood in shock until their mother\u2019s calming voice soothed them enough to get them into the game.  \u2018How about you and Justin get me some moist towels from the bathroom upstairs while Davey and Dylan can run into the downstairs bathroom to get me some antacids. The children did as they were told while Frank leaned down to try to help his wife to at least a sitting position. He got almost down to her level before he noticed that her back had widened considerably as well as she shoulders. \u2018Honey\u2026are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u2019 Frank pulled back a bit and realized that his wife\u2019s changes were not only in her back and shoulders. Her hips had widened and her waist had thinned. He had not seen his wife with a waistline like that since before they were married. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of clothes ripping brought Frank out of his trance. A tear had begun in the middle of Debbie\u2019s blouse in the back and had quickly opened up to reveal her new muscles all the way down to her back. \u2018Aaahhhh Debbie sighed in relief as her shoulders and sleeves made identical sounds as they tore free from their silky prisons. An odd sound overcame the tearing as her belt began to stretch and tear in several places. Small holes began to form in her pantyhose as her calves and thighs began to fill them to capacity and beyond. Frank could not believe his eyes. His wife of 20 years knelt before him, changing before his very eyes. The tearing sound returned as Debbie\u2019s skirt failed to make room in time for her widening hips. After her feet broke free from the constricting shoes and she stood up. The once 5 ft. 7 Debbie now towered over her 6 ft. 1 husband. Frank now got a good look at her front and his jaw nearly hit the ground. Debbie\u2019s breasts, a modest full b cup had ballooned into a healthy double D and showed no signs of stopping. Her screams of pain and changed along with her body to those of pleasure as she brought her hands up and began rubbing her now full 8 pack abs.  Frank\u2019s attention was now placed in Debbie\u2019s arms whose biceps could easily measure 19 inches and still bulging. Debbie\u2019s height continued to rise as her bra exploded off of her body and her shirt had finally shredded in two pieces. The still shy Debbie, who had lost her skirt and whose panties and become a makeshift thong decided to keep her blouse on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Debbie reached her full height of 7 ft., her weight gain headed into overdrive as her muscles completely filled out all over and her transformation had completed. She looked down to Frank who was still in total disbelief and was about to say something when she was cut off by Jerome. \u2018Holy crap, Mrs. Debbie\u2026you\u2019re huge!\u2019 was all he could say. Debbie simple stood there, trying to collect her thoughts when she noticed Joe, the studly neighbor she had watched mow his lawn earlier in the day stare in disbelief. As her vision panned back she noticed her children had returned with the items she had requested earlier. Seeing her family sharing in the conclusion she was in the midst of, Debbie decided she had to act fast. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Debbie rip the front of his jeans down Joe's huge penis popped out for all to see it was a huge 12 inch black rod of flesh covered with thick veins and at least 10 inches wide with baseball sized hairless testicles hanging under it. As his black penis sprang free of the tight jeans he let out a moan of relief. <br>\r\nDebbie looked at the black monster and licked her lips she had seen Joe's penis in a pair of speedo swim briefs but never saw the black monster free and bare now she was glad she was going to do what she always wanted to do.<br>\r\nLooking at Joe's Monster Debbie said \" Well Joe you are at least 7 inches longer than my weak husband and 6 inches wide then him as well and those testicles will fill me and my daughter nicely don't you tell so Amber\".<br>\r\nAmber looked at Joe;s black monster and licked her lips she had seen a few penises but none the size of Joe he was way bigger and she know he was going to stretch her and her mothers pussies wide and fill them full with gallons of cum<br>\r\nSmiling at her mother Amber said \" Oh yes mother he'll fill us nicely\".<br>\r\nTurning back to Joe Debbie said \" Go make that worthless husband of mine suck your dick and get it ready for my hot pussy while I grow my daughter \".

You are really keeping the figure eh??\"Said Frank, oblivious about Debbie's changes.<br>\r\n\"Thanks honey, but I can't say the same thing to you\" said Debbie chuckling, referring to Frank's belly. \"but still, you will always be my charming gentleman\" and then kissed gently on the lips. Frank remained a bit still: should he tell her about the cheating with Vanessa? It was already over, but for him it was a really heavy burden. Maybe tomorrow morning. Let's not ruin the mood. After a good sex-session, both started sleeping peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the night was only the beginning for Debbie, because the gun started its true and drastic effect, when they were both sleeping deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing was her body elongating, stretching to 7'1, a full foot taller than Frank.<br>\r\nThen her muscle in general started growing, A LOT.Her shoulders widened, becoming as big as volleyballs, her back and lats grew, becoming a mass of muscle fighting for space, pushing also her arms to a wider angle, were biceps, triceps and forearms were growing, to match the size of the shoulders, her pecs pushed out her boobs by half a foot making them even perkier. Her abs grew to a rock hard 8-pack with equally big obliques muscles. Her legs, already out of the bed, started to grow in a similar way of the upper torso, with thighs becoming as big as Frank torso, and calves growing to big bulging hearts.<br>\r\nNow Debbie looke like a roided-up bodybuilder, 320 pounds of muscles. But Vanessa wanted to enlarge another part of Frank body: his attributes. So the gun started the final phase, augmenting Debbie's attributes; making her boobs enormous, so big that they seemed fake, jutting up like to mountains, with 2inch hard nipples; giving her butt a bit of curves,widening her hips a bit and slimming her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end, Debbie became the tallest,sexiest female bodybuilder in the world. 7'1 of height, 320 pounds of muscles, 25inch biceps, no body fat, except in her big and perky boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody noticed anything, being both heavy sleepers. So at the morning, when Debbie woke up, she had the biggest shock of her life. She went to sleep as a 5'7 normal house-wife and woke up as a mountain of muscle and femininity. Looking down she could only see her big boobs, with rock had nipples; at her side wide shoulders attached at big beefy arms, pushed aside thanks to her lats. After the initial shock, she started looking at new new body. Going (and ducking) to the bathroom, she could  see quite everything of herself (she was too tall for the mirror), but she could see her abs, and her big legs. Ducking a bit she could looking at her while doing some upper flex, making her biceps inflate to 30 inch of pure power. And her boobs were really sensitive; only touching them made her shiver with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that my husband now has a job to do\" Said Debbie while walking to her bedroom. This time she forgot to duck, and hit the doorframe, and resulted in the destruction of the upper part of the doorframe. \"Ops, I should remember that now I'm a bit bigger\" She was also amazed that she didn't fell pain or anything, just something that was blocking and then there wasn't anymore. She was really unstoppable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the husband side of the bed and shook gently her husband \"Honey... There is quick job you have to do\".<br>\r\nHer husband opened his eyes a bit, Not recording what she said, but after a look at her hulking wife he jumped up to the bed, scared to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen!?!?! What happened?\"<br>\r\n\"I grew a bit, don't you see?\" Replied while flexing her biceps and tensing her pecs a bit, to make her boobs jump up a bit \" but now you have to do something to me\" taking him into her beefy arms and marveling at how light he feel to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Frank will do??</span></div></div>",

He was planning to divorce? He was a little unlucky talking about that now; her new muscle could be dangerous, and the damaged doorframe was a witness of her power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna be honest about that Vanessa, so please let me finish: Yes, I've cheated on you, only once, with that girl. She had something about personality that made me like her. It's more than a month that you are always cold, because of your job, we didn't have more intimacy, I was really sad about that, and Vanessa came and helped feeling better, we went together to see baseball, museum. She wanted to have sex, but after the first night I was feeling the worst son of a bitch ever. Cheating on you, the cute geek who was always there to help everybody, it wasn't fair. She gave me everything after our marriage, including four children and I betrayed her only because she had some problems. After that night, I started avoiding Vanessa. And I was feeling better, till today with that package.\" He continued:\"I know you are angry, if you want to divorce it's ok, I understand, but please, let me just say that I'm sorry, and I still love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at Debbie, who had some tears in her eyes, but she was also angry, really angry. Her muscles were inflating to an alarming rate, casting an enormous shadow upon Frank.<br>\r\n\"You.....\" She said before raising her arm to slap him.<br>\r\n\"It's over, goodbye world\" Thought Frank, closing his eyes, waiting for the slap to come<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut It never come, because Debbie lowered herself to lift and hug him, crying freely<br>\r\nFrank, surprised by her reaction, started saying\"why\" before being shut up by the huge index of his wife. After a while, she released him on the bed again.<br>\r\nShe explained:\"I've been cheating on you too, with our young neightbor, he is so handsome. But I stopped because It wouldn't be fair to you and to our family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, Frank chuckled\"Well, It's fair. I've cheated on you and you cheated on me. I'd say that now anything has changes, apart from you being a mountain of muscle, and I'm not saying it's a negative thing\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry.\" Replied Debbie smiling while hugging him and sandwiching him between her enormous boobs.<br>\r\n\"Ouch, they are quite big, never saw boobs this huge\" Frank was already excited and happy about how the confession turned on.<br>\r\n\"And they are really strong, like the rest of my body\" Replied his wife, tensing her pecs and lifting him with only her boobs. \"And about my body, it still need your help\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sex (where Debbie orgasmed and orgasmed, she was really sensitive), the laid on their bed, hugging themselves, smiling.<br>\r\n\"It's incredible Frank, even If you cheated with Vanessa I still have to thank her about this body\"<br>\r\n\"Right!!! the gun!!!

There is someone who wants to apologize to you\u2026\u201d Debby asked her daughter.

She almost fell over, but could gain her balance. \u201cOhh, sugar rush!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber saw her mother leave her room. As Debby closed the door behind her, Amber rushed to her full length mirror and looked at her face. She felt the same tingling sensation in her cheek as her mother touched her as she had felt when her mother grabbed her hand. Was she seeing things, or did her face look slimmer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she inspected the rest of her body. Something was different, she knew, but she couldn\u2019t exactly tell what. She lifted up the bottom of her shirt to look at her stomach, and to her surprise it was most definitely slimmer than before. The chubby tummy, which she had inherited from her mother, was reduced into a tight tummy. That was odd; was something up with her? Could the strange gun have done something to her? She felt more energetic as well, what\u2019s up with that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided not to read too much into it and headed downstairs.</span></div></div>",

As she was doing that, she couldn\u2019t help but stare at Jerome\u2019s arms from time to time. His biceps looked massive, at least to her definition of massive. It was obvious Jerome worked out as his biceps and triceps were clearly defined. His chocolate brown biceps popped up into an impressive peak; Dylan didn\u2019t stand a chance. His arms were way smaller than Jerome\u2019s, yet he managed to keep his arm up quite long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo bro!\u201d Davy yelled to support his twin brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan\u2019s expression clearly showed the force he was applying to try to push Jerome\u2019s arm down. He looked straight into Jerome\u2019s eyes to try to bend his mind, but Jerome could only smile. It looked as if Jerome wasn\u2019t applying any force at all; he was so relaxed and cool. Yet he managed to prevent Dylan from pushing his arm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if he had played long enough, Jerome\u2019s expression suddenly got serious. An evil grin appeared on his face as he slowly increased the pressure in his arm. His biceps popped up even further as he started pushing down Dylan\u2019s arm. Dylan\u2019s expression changed as well; surprise appeared on his face. He could not believe Jerome had not used his full strength yet; he was certainly much stronger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a second after Dylan\u2019s arm began to inch closer to his side of the table, Jerome applied such an explosion of force that he rammed Dylan\u2019s arm on the tabletop. He had won, Dylan had lost!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber had positioned herself on a chair close to her father; she had a perfect view of the boys and their masculine rituals. Her eyes grew wide as she saw Jerome\u2019s biceps get even slightly bigger from the last power surge. She so wanted him. Yet she managed to control herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan, rubbing his arm in defeat, got up from the chair opposite Jerome and looked at Justin. \u201cYour turn now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin looked at Jerome\u2019s pumped upper arm and scratched the back of his head. Jerome saw this as he reclined and enjoyed his victory. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, afraid I\u2019m going to beat you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, inhaling deeply to gather courage, grabbed the chair opposite his buddy and put his elbow on the table. \u201cNot at all, bring it on bi-atch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome smiled as he put his elbow on the table and hooked his hand in with Justin\u2019s. Davy, the referee, counted down. \u201cThree\u2026two\u2026one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike with Dylan, where Jerome liked to play around for a bit, he this time applied his maximum power in the first second. His upper arm grew into an impressive peak once again as he pushed against Justin\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, who had smaller arms than his little brother, gave it everything he had, but it wasn\u2019t enough. He couldn\u2019t keep his arm up against the force Jerome was applying. Within 2 seconds after the countdown, Justin\u2019s hand smashed the tabletop. Jerome pushed away his buddy\u2019s hand as he kissed his biceps. \u201cWow, that was easy! You\u2019re even weaker than I thought! I bet you wouldn\u2019t even win from your little sister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked up as she noticed Jerome pointing at her. Justin stared at her as well, then at her arms. She was wearing a long sleeved shirt, as it was getting colder, so he couldn\u2019t see much. Justin, also rubbing his arm after his last match, started laughing in Jerome\u2019s face. \u201cHer?! My little sister? Now you\u2019re really judging me too low! I can beat her with one arm on my back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that!\u201d Jerome said as he turned his head towards Amber again. \u201cSo, what do you think? Up for a little match?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber, looking at her brother and his skinny arms, normally wouldn\u2019t be up for it. She hated arm wrestling, at least if doing it herself, as she was always the weakest of the family. And even though Justin\u2019s arms looked small compared to Jerome\u2019s, she knew he was a lot stronger than her. He was a boy, for that matter. Yet, this time, she felt really confident and energetic. She looked back at Jerome and replied: \u201cSure, why not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, not expecting this reply, straightened up and laughed at his little sister as she approached. \u201cAre you sure, sis? I don\u2019t want to hurt you! I\u2019m using all I\u2019ve got, not saving any strength just because you\u2019re a girl\u2026OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked at her brother with an unimpressed look. \u201cSure, whatever\u2026\u201d She positioned herself in Jerome\u2019s chair and put her elbow on the table. She didn\u2019t bother to roll up her sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is gonna be good!\u201d Davy said to his twin brother, who was looking forward to the match as well. \u201cThe next match is me against Amber!\u201d Dylan yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked up at her little brother and grinned. Justin had replaced his elbow on the table as well and hooked his arm in with Amber\u2019s. His hand was much larger than Amber\u2019s delicate, soft, hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jerome started counting down, Amber couldn\u2019t help but notice the same strange tingling feeling in her hand the moment she touched her brother. She looked up surprised as she scanned her brother\u2019s face. He was too much into the game as not to notice a thing. The moment she heard Jerome yell \u201cOne!\u201d she felt a force trying to push her arm down. It was Justin\u2019s, however it was less powerful than she\u2019d imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arm was pushed down an inch or so, when she started applying pressure of her own. To both her, as well as the boys\u2019 surprise she managed to push back Justin\u2019s arm in the starting position. Her mouth fell open as she noticed how easy it was; she felt the opposite force of Justin slowly decreasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin in the mean time couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. He looked on as he saw his own arm being pushed back. A strange sensation ran through his hand and arm, something he hadn\u2019t felt before. He was becoming lightheaded as he felt the power in his body slowly disappear. He was almost starting to get sleepy; all he wanted to do was go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber, feeling more confident and powerful by the second, reached the point where she felt her own strength was stronger than Justin\u2019s. She decided to go for it; giving it all her strength she pushed and pushed harder against Justin\u2019s arm. To her surprise, it worked! Justin\u2019s arm was slowly getting closer to his side of the table. After reaching 45 degrees; she applied one final power surge, smashing her brother\u2019s arm onto the table top!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let go of her brother\u2019s hand and yelled in victory. \u201cOh my fricking god! I so totally owned you! I did it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, who was slowly starting to understand what had happened, felt his own arm. The strange sensation had disappeared, but he felt weaker than before. How was that possible? He heard his brother\u2019s and best buddy laugh at him as they cheered on with Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Dylan\u2026\u201d, Amber said with much more confidence, \u201care you still up for the challenge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan, even though he witnessed firsthand what happened to his bigger brother, was still certain he was much stronger than his sister, so he accepted the challenge. He helped Justin get out from the chair, as he was suddenly very sleepy. Jerome took care of him and helped him in a nearby chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Dylan positioned his elbow on the table, as did Amber. Their hands got closer and the moment they locked, the same tingling sensation was back in Amber\u2019s arm. Dylan, feeling something was up, adjusted his seating as Jerome was counting down. He couldn\u2019t tell what was up, but he felt something go through his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jerome yelled \u201cOne!\u201d Amber was more confident than the first time around; she immediately applied pressure against Dylan\u2019s arm. Dylan, on the other hand, did the same thing and couldn\u2019t believe the force his sister was applying. Was she really much stronger than him? He added more strength as he pushed all he got out of his arm. His biceps popped faintly into an impressive upper arm, but it didn\u2019t help much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked on at her brother\u2019s arm as she felt his power increase. Yet, her own strength increased as well; it wasn\u2019t difficult for her to keep her hand in the same vertical position. She waited several seconds as she saw her brother struggle to get a better grip, right until the point where his strength decreased considerably and her strength was strong enough to attack. At that point, she gave it all she had in one powerful explosion of strength, much like she had done before with Justin. Dylan didn\u2019t know what happened to him; it was as if every ounce of strength he had was sucked out of his body as he witnessed his own arm getting slammed onto the table. He was defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber couldn\u2019t believe she had won twice in a row, from her much stronger brother\u2019s. She let go of Dylan\u2019s hand and started cheering in disbelief. Jerome and Davy cheered along with her as Dylan collapsed on the table in front of him, completely out of breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! I have won twice in a row!\u201d Amber yelled as she still couldn\u2019t believe what she had just done. She felt different, much stronger and much more confident. After she had high-fived both Jerome as well as Davy, who both went to check up on Dylan, she discreetly checked her arm. She felt her biceps through the sleeve of her shirt; but was surprised by its size. That couldn\u2019t be hers!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amber continued to caress her own right bicep in a state of dazed wonder.  It was so <u>big</u> now, at least the size of a baseball!  And hard as a rock!  How was that even possible?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, are you all right?\" Davy asked his twin.  Shifting her attention to her beaten opponent Amber saw that Dylan was still lying sprawled across the top of the picnic table, panting.  The knowledge that she had somehow grown even stronger than her gymnast jock of a brother positively thrilled Amber.  For once in her life she felt proud and powerful, instead of insignificant and overlooked-and she loved it!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising from her chair she circled around the table and literally forced her way between Jerome and Davy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, big guy,\" she said.  \"Let me help you up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber did want to assist her obviously exhausted brother, but she wanted even more to show off her impressive new strength, to be seen literally physically supporting Dylan when the latter looked as though he could barely walk.  What a picture that would make, Dylan having to lean on his three inch shorter sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hands on Dylan's lats she lifted him up from his chair with ease.  He certainly wasn't as heavy as she'd expected; she felt like she could have carried him in her arms, bridal style, if she had wanted to.  The thought made her giggle in delight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis masculine pride painfully stung by his defeat, Dylan angrily broke free from his victorious sister's tight grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" he insisted forcefully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately his first step put the lie to those words, as he stumbled against Jerome and almost fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so stubborn!\" Amber scolded.  She slipped her head under Dylan's left arm, grabbing his dangling wrist with her left hand and wrapping her right arm firmly around his torso.  The funny tingling sensation immediately returned, centered in her left hand and across her neck where Dylan's bare arm was resting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan opened his mouth to to protest again, but instead yawned hugely. The fifteen year-old kept trying to pull away from his sister, but his efforts were so weak that Amber was able to hold onto him without even straining.  In fact she was able to shoulder virtually his entire body weight as they crossed the backyard with no problem whatsoever.  If anything it actually felt like he was getting <i>lighter</i>!  Either that, or she was getting even stronger than she already was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me take him,\" Justin offered, stepping forward as they reached the patio door.  Amber was a bit disappointed to hand over her burden;she had happily envisioned \"girlhandling\" Dylan all the way up the stairs to his room.  As she gave her younger brother to her older one, the tingling sensation abruptly ceased.  Amber was beginning to get an idea about what that feeling meant, but she needed to test her hypothesis further before she would be willing to believe it.  And the best test of all was standing right there in her own backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Jerome!\" Amber called out assertively as she sauntered back to the table with a new, feline grace.  \"Now it's my turn to challenge the champ!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping back into her chair she confidently exteneded her arm across the table, beckoning him forward with a teasing wave of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome frowned, not moving.  He didn't understand how Amber could possibly have beaten Justin in arm wrestling, much less Dylan!  Neither of them were anywhere close to him in terms of brawn, of course, but they still should have been able to slam Amber's hand down in less than a second.  And they hadn't let her win; he'd seen the stunned, disbelieving expressions on their faces as Amber had defeated them.  Now she wanted to arm wrestle him.  Intellectually he knew there was no way she could possibly win, yet what he'd seen tonight had shaken him.  There was definitely something weird going on here and he didn't like it one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jerome stood there, indescisive, Davy hurried toward the house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Amber asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to go make sure Dylan's okay,\" Davy explained, turning toward her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh,\" Amber shook her head, her long, dark hair flying from side to side.  \"You can do that later.  We need a referee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavy halted, glancing uncertainly between Amber and the house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit!\" she snapped, pointing to the chair on her left.  Jerome started at the unexpected authority in the girl's suddenly commanding voice. Davy did more than that; he practically leapt to obey, scrambling into the seat Amber had indicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was new!  He had never seen shy little Amber order even her younger brothers around before, nor would he have expected that she could ever sound so masterful.  It was as if she knew she was in charge now, and wanted everyone else to know it too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Jerome?\" the seventeen year-old asked him challengingly.  \"What are you waiting for?  You're not afraid of losing, are you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now she was crossing the line.  He worked hard for years to get the body he had; he wasn't about to let some fat little girl think he was afraid of her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping down into the chair across from Amber Jerome seized her right hand with his own.  Immediately a weak, watery feeling washed over Jerome.  Ignoring it, he squeezed his opponent's hand hard.  Amber flinched a little, but not nearly as much as he'd thought she would.  Then she had the nerve to smirk at him and he abruptly realized that he'd been wrong.  Amber wasn't fat or little, not anymore.  The extra pounds she'd always carried around had vanished; she looked sleek and lean, with curves he never remembered noticing on her before.  Her face was a lot prettier without all the fat, and even her breasts looked considerably larger than he rememberd.  Hard as he found it to believe, Amber was really <i>hot</i> now!    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he wished Davy would hurry up with the countdown; he was really starting to feel tired and, whether his opponent was hot or not,  he wanted to get this match over with.  Finally Davy said \"One!\" and Jerome threw his all into overwhelming Amber.  He began forcing her arm downward, enjoying the look of desperation on her face as she bit her lip with the effort.  Yeah, there was no way she was going to win against him, even if he was tired!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet as the seconds passed it was becoming progressively harder for him to continued moving Amber's arm down.  Her sizeable bicep was actually bulging against the fabric of her shirt and somehow she seemed to be putting forth greater and greater resistance.  It didn't help that his energy was abruptly deserting him.  Sure, he'd already had two matchs, but so had she, and he had to have a lot more endurance than she did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wrestled her arm past the forty-five degree mark, and his advantage in leverage should have started making things easier for him, but he found himself having to work more than ever and gaining even less ground for it.  Then their linked hands came to a stop, about three-quarters of the way down.  Jerome redoubled his efforts, only to find he couldn't budge Amber's arm by so much as one more millimeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to comprehend what was happening Jerome looked across into Amber's face, searching for signs that she was on the verge of giving in, her unbelievable strength nearing its end.  What he saw was exactly the opposite.  All signs of strain had left her exquisite features; she looked calm and at ease with the situation, like she could do this for another five hours without breaking a sweat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome was afraid he wouldn't be able to handle another five minutes!  It felt like he was straining against the immovable stone arm of a statue!  And he was just so <i>tired</i>, moreso than after any workout he'd had in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ripping sound made him glance down.  To his amazement, he saw that Amber's bulging bicep had torn through her shirt sleeve!  It was every bit as big as Priscilla Newton's-no, it was bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the impossible happened: his straining, trembling arm started to shift back toward the center of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo!  It couldn't be!  Jerome dug down into his final reserves, but it changed nothing.  Amber kept forcing his arm back, her own very muscular limb steady as a freaking rock.  Almost sobbing now he tried to stop her, but he was nearly spent and she was just so <b>STRONG</b>!  Stronger than him, stronger than anyone he'd ever met before.  He didn't know how that could be, but there was no denying the painful reality of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went past the halfway point and her great bicep wasn't even flexing anymore.  This was easy for her now!  He could tell by the sexy, superior smile she was shooting him!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed his hand to the pine table so hard that he was genuinely afraid she might have broken it.  He wanted to examine it to see, but humiliatingly she hadn't released him, and he knew better now than to think he could break the grip of this raven-haired Amazon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winner and supreme champion, Amber Smith!\" Davy declared excitedly.  Stranding up Amber let him go and hit a magnificent, breathtaking double biceps pose, shredding her remaining sleeve in the process.  Jerome stared helplessly up at the most built and beautiful girl he'd ever had the privilege of laying eyes on.                                                         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                    <br>\r\n          <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amber luxuriated in the astonished gaze of her little brother and the lustful gaze of Jerome.  As she relaxed from her imposing flex Jerome stuttered out a request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so, Amber, what are you doing tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it!  Jerome, the boy she'd mooned over for years, was finally asking her on a date!  To her own shock she found that the prospect of going out with him had ceased to interest her.  Yes, he was still handsome and charming, but the muscles which had practically made her drool were no longer as impressive as they once were; in fact they weren't nearly as impressive as her's!  Her arms were visibly thicker than his and obviously far stronger.  Through her amazing new siphoning ability she had taken for herself much of the raw physical power which had attracted her to Jerome in the first place.  In fact if she had wanted to, she could probably literally crush her old crush now!  This realization excited Amber in a way she had never been before and suddenly the elusive draw of sports became clear to her.  It was all about demonstrating your physical prowess, proving your superiority over the other participants.  It was about showing you were a winner-which the new Amber Douglas was through and through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she didn't need a loser like Jerome dragging her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Jerome,\" she said sweetly.  \"I'm washing my hair.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely restraining a laugh at his expression of hurt rejection Amber turned her back on him and went back into the house, running up the stairs three at a time to reach her room.  There she stripped and began examining her radically changed form.  All of the fat she'd so hated was gone, but she wasn't too skinny.  No, her sculpted, very large muscles made her positively voluptous.  For a second she frowned, wondering if perhaps some boys might find her <u>too</u> buff.  She shrugged her broad shoulders resignedly.  If so, it was their loss.  Besides, she wouldn't give this up if she could.  It felt wonderful to be so strong!  Turning she put one hand underneath her bed and effortlessly lifted it up almost to the ceiling!  Grinning Amber lowered her bed back to the ground and moved over to her closet.  Her old clothes were no longer suited to her, but she put on her shortest skirt and cutest top before slipping on a pair of sandals.  No, she would never surrender what she had gained.  If anything, she wanted more!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she knew exactly where to get it.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe Daniels was just finishing dinner when the doorbell rang.  He went into his foyer and swung the door open, expecting maybe a Girl Scout selling cookies or a lawn service rep.  He was unprepared for the vision waiting on his porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was six inches shorter than him, with long, lusterous black hair.  She had the face of a super-model, and the body of a female Olympic athlete. Through her stance and body language she radiated an aura of utter confidence and self-assurance.  Clearly this was a woman who knew what she wanted and how to get it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" Joe asked, thrown a bit off his stride.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she purred.  \"You can.\"  She wrapped an arm around his neck, pulled his head down and kissed him!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShock prevented Joe from resisting intiallly.  It wasn't that he objected to making out with beautiful women, quite the contrary.  This was too forward even for him though!  He didn't know this woman from Eve, and she sure wasn't acting very stable.  Joe had an active enough social life without having to date kooks.  Lots of women wanted him, from high shcool girls to women his own age to dowdy middle-aged wives like Mrs. Douglas from across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she wrapped her arms around his shoulders Joe was finally able to regain control of  himself.  The tired feeling which had suddenly come over him and the heat of the kiss tempted him to simply go with the flow, but that would be dangerous.  She could have a disease, and if they went all the way he was sure to drop off to sleep afterwards given the way he felt at the moment.  The last thing he wanted was to give this crazy chick free reign in his house while he was unconscious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Joe gently pushed at her shoulders, noting how wide and thick they were for a woman.  There was no effect, other than to make her break the kiss and began a new one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" he tried to say, but she ignored him.  She was a good kisser, he'd give her that, but this had gone far enough.  He tried to break out of her embrace-and couldn't!  He tried again, throwing chivalry to the wind and using all of his brawn.  Nothing!  Geez, her ams were like freaking<b> steel</b>!  How strong was she anyway? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike in a nightmare Joe's increasingly frantic struggles met with no success.  In fact her hold was tightening painfully. I'm going to have bruises tomorrow, Joe thought in wondering disbelief.  From a WOMAN!  It was impossible!     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a last restort Joe shut his mouth and turned his head, hoping that if he refued to give her what she wanted she would let him go. Instead she continued to hold him and the exhaustion he'd been fighting became even more prounounced.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to make this fun for both of us,\" she whispered seductively to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" he insisted, still hardly able to believe that a female could restrain him so easily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a minute,\" she promised.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head swimming he sagged in her arms, but she supported his two hundred and ten pounds without even seeming to notice.  Looking down at himself Joe saw the fantastic body he'd worked so hard to build disappearing before his horrified eyes.  His pecs, biceps, triceps-everything was getting smaller, less developed and less defined.  At the same time the mysterous woman's muscles seemed to be swelling up right along with her strength!  Her bear-hug would have a real bear howling for mercy, but all Jim could do was whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're hurting me!\"  he pleaded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, shhh,\" she said soothingly.  \"It's almost over.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last she released him and Jim slumped to his foyer floor.  His last thought before the darkness enfolded him was to hope that this was indeed a nightmare and that he'  would  awaken safe and sound in his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber sighed in pleasure and stretched, throughly enjoying the weight and size of her massive new muscles.  Though her height hadn't changed, she felt like a titaness!  She knew she had grown more than strong enough to pulverize anyone who got in her way.  Leaving Joe lying on his foyer floor the gorgeous, muscle-bound goddess walked back across the street to her house.  It was time she made a few changes to the family hierarchy. . .                               <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amber strolled in the back door as dusk slowly turning to night. She glanced into the family room and saw Justin and Jerome. She knew her parents would be in their room. Slinking upstairs quietly, Amber walked into the sewing room. She smiled finding one of her mother\u2019s old bikini tops. It would have been much too big for Amber just this morning, but now it was likely too small! Fashioning some thick stretchable string to the top, Amber changed into the bikini top. She pulled off her skirt and finding the matching bikini bottom, quickly pulled it on. It was time to make her presence known! Kicking off her sandals, Amber smiled wickedly as she sauntered toward the twin\u2019s room. Dylan and Davy Smith were in the room playing a football video game. Davy looked over at Dylan in between plays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe what happened outside today. Amber totally kicked ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan grunted, still unhappy about the events. \u201cShe just got lucky, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber pushed the door open roughly and it hit the stop with a thud. The boys both turned to see Amber standing there with a nasty grin on her unbelievably beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really? Do these look like the arms of someone who got lucky?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber placed her dainty right foot forward and flexed her leg, bulging out a massive calf and a ferocious set of monster deeply separated quads thicker than any the boys had ever seen. Each slab of her mighty quad appeared bigger than Davy\u2019s entire leg! The lower thigh tear-dropped over her small knee to the point of nearly covering it!  The giant thigh swept up into a narrow midsection peppered with incredible pebble obliques and tectonic plates of steel abdominals broken into ten bricks of she-muscle. The muscle laden mid-section swept up into a nearly four foot wide set of killer lats and a massive set of pectorals that built up a six inch shelf of angry beef that presented her well proportioned breasts forward like twin missiles, stressing the bikini top as the tit flesh was exposed on either side and the bottom. But as the boys bug eyes wandered up to her dominating expression, deep blue eyes and long thick dark hair, they ventured over toward those biceps that had crushed the competition in the arm wrestling arena. Davy had seen her flex her biceps after defeating Jerome and was surprised then. But now he was nearly in shock! Dylan\u2019s jaw dropped open as they saw Amber flex forth the biggest, hardest, most detailed set of arms they had ever seen on anyone, let alone a girl! Her small fists pushed out into wide, thick forearms with rope like muscles and back toward her small elbow joints. Her triceps dipped low and looked like footballs with etched muscle fibers running around the edges. But it was her biceps that caused the boys to sweat, to drool with envy and to feel a pit of fear build in their stomach. Her bicep blasted up over her crazy thick muscle laden shoulders and rode half way up her forearms and were so thick that they pushed her forearms back! The ball of muscle pulled her skin taught, showcasing scary detail, deep bicep splits and crystal peaks. Her biceps had to be at least 22 inches around! She released her flex and stalked forward toward her stunned siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you two had better realize who\u2019s in charge around here now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber reached down and grabbed a fist full of shirt of each brother and with barely contained force pulled them up onto their feet and in a scary display of strength, up into the air! Each boy may have been 3 inches taller, but Amber pulled them higher until their feel danged inches above the ground. Dylan grabbed her thick forearm, hoping to get away.  But within moments his grip weakened as his strength leached into his big sister and his muscles started to reduce! Davy was gripped with fear at both his helplessness and the fact that his stronger brother was just as helpless and now shrinking before his eyes. Even as Dylan\u2019s head began to loll and his he let go of Amber\u2019s arm, his hands were still touching and his muscles reduced down until they were the same size as Davy\u2019s! Amber looked at Dylan and then Davy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two wimps had better get it through your thick skulls that my word is law from now on.  If you want to stay healthy you\u2019d better do what I say. Is that clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavy nodded vigorously, about ready to pee his pants.  Dylan barely got out a weak nod, knowing he had better toe the line. Sniffing, Amber pulled them close and then launched them toward opposite walls where they crashed harshly and fell onto their beds. Amber smiled menacingly. \u201cGood then.  Now go to sleep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and hit the lights as she moved out of the room and toward her parents. Debby looked up from her book when she heard the loud crash coming from the twin\u2019s room and then over at Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrank, perhaps you should go tell the twins to calm down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank grumbled when their bedroom door flew open. There stood Amber in all her muscle glory, proud and belligerent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, I need you to sew me an outfit for tomorrow.  As you can see, I\u2019ve outgrown my clothes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby\u2019s eyes widened with shock and fear. Amber had never sounded so commanding. But worse than that, she was covered front head to toe with intimidating, pounding muscles!  Frank, taken aback by his daughter\u2019s physique, was still not prepared to settle for her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmber, I\u2019ll not have you talk to mother like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber smiled cruelly. \u201cOh really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly stalked over to her father as he pulled his legs forward to get out of bed. Amber bulled next to him, pushing him back down with her thunderous chest. He grunted as his face turned red with anger and got back up quickly, pushing against her football sized shoulders. Amber didn\u2019t move an inch as her father pushed uselessly against her vastly superior strength. And worse yet, Frank\u2019s anger induced strength quickly waned as Amber pulled his strength and muscles into her body. She smirked as her mother looked on with horror. Amber pulled her arm back and with a loud whoosh, punched her father in the stomach so hard that she lifted him off the ground. Pulling her small fist back, Frank immediately collapsed in front of her and fell onto the ground gagging and gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t be taking any more advice from you old man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked back at her mother whose face was turning white.  \u201cAnd as for you, I gave you an order.  I expect them to be followed without question from now on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby\u2019s eyes filled with tears and she quickly got up, looked down at her injured husband, whimpered, and headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning out of the room, Amber headed downstairs to complete her trifecta of domination. And what better way to finish up than the two college boys that she humiliated hours before. Walking into the family room Amber snuck up on Justine and Jerome. They were both on the sectional with the recliners out. Amber reached under the couch and began to lift the sectional and both boys up into the air with ridiculous ease. Amber\u2019s body tingled with excitement as her incredible strength turned her on. The boys yelped out from surprise as they moved high in the air. Amber let out a small girlish grunt as she pushed the couch and boys over her head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello boys. Miss me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys went cold and silent. Amber was back and she was demonstrating strength that far exceeded either of theirs. Hell, she was likely stronger than both of them together! With a firm grip now on the frame, Amber tilted the sectional forward harshly, sending both boys to the ground with twin thuds. Amber smiled dominantly at the surprised boys who looked up at her mega muscle form with fear. Thoroughly enjoying their scared expressions, Amber dumped the couch behind her with a crash. She placed her fists on her hips in a classic superhero pose and flexed the most intimidating mound of muscles and curves either boy had ever imagined. Amber chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone want to arm wrestle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys, stunned beyond belief, stammered. Amber sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think so.  You could use both of your arms against one of mine and still wouldn\u2019t have a chance.  I own you two.  I could destroy both of you right now if I wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys cowered, unable to even think straight. Amber brought her right arm up and scratched the side of her head, pretending to think things through. Her bicep bunched into a massive ball that only caused the boys more dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, perhaps you need a demonstration of my overwhelming strength and power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys both shook their heads as Justine coughed out a terrified response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no Amber. We know who\u2019s stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked down unconvinced. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure you\u2019re just saying that. However, I\u2019ll let you go tonight. But cross me once and it\u2019s go time! Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys nodded vigorously, happy that Amber was letting them off the hook. Jerome scrambled up and ran for the front door, escaping into the night.  Justine crawled toward the stairs as Amber stood in the same spot and watched him like a supervisor in a sweat shop. Once he reached the bottom of the stairs he ran to the top and into his room.  Amber nodded her head with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to a chair, Amber picked up the remote and smiled as she heard the sewing machine hum upstairs and smiled.  Yeah, she thought.  Tomorrow is going to be a good day!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> And for her, it was indeed a good day!  Amber caused an sensation when she showed up at school; no one could believe that this sculpted, muscle-bound beauty was the same plain, chubby girl they'd all known.  She was the absolute center of attention wherever she went and she reveled in it!  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThere were some nasty comments, a few right to her face, but the newly proud and aggressive Amber didn't hesitate to answer such insults with her fists.  More than one student found themselves slumped over and vomiting that day, terrified they would die from the tremendous blow to their midsection.  Amber took care not to do this in front of any of the adults and none of the other kids ratted on her, including her victims; those not entranced by her loveliness were too frightened by her displays of strength to risk crossing her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAt home Amber continued to assert her absolute supremacy as the head of the household.  Figuratively speaking, the rest of the family were now no more than slaves to Empress Amber.  Even Frank and Debby were forced to obey their mighty middle child without question; the slightest defiance of Amber's will was met with swift and painful punishment.  On the second day she had snapped her father's right arm in two like a twig when he'd dared to question her, an event which had led the already cowed rest of the family to wholly submit to Amber's authority.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd so the previously overlooked Amber got the best of everything: tons of CD's, a closetful of expensive clothes to flaunt the splendor and glory of her amazing, power-packed physique, and even a brand-new Ferrari!  As Amber herself had observed, a muscle girl deserves a muscle car.                     <br>\r\n <br>\r\nOver the next couple of months Amber solidfied her hold on the school, becoming by far the most feared and admired person ever to attend the educational institution.  This actually frustrated her somewhat, as she missed being able to violently demonstrate her vast physical superiority.  The growth spurt which shot her up to almost six feet tall was welcome, but insufficient compensation for the loss of opportunities to exhibit her physical prowess.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe answer came one day when she saw Justin reading a Sports Ilustrated magazine with some football player on the cover.  She snatched it away from him and he meekly made no protest.  Football!  Why not?  She was much stronger and better built than any boy on the team; why shouldn't she join?  It would be a lot of fun to show those big oafs just what an alpha girl could do.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe ordered Justin to teach her eveything she knew about football and also brought in Jerome and Brett Michaels to help.  Though she no longer bothered to give her former friend Bittney even the time of day, Brittney's big brother remained utterly smitten with the Amazonian Aphrodite Amber had become.  He jumped at the chance to spend time with her, a decision he found cause to regret when they began practicing football for real.  Amber's ripped, enormous muscles were like solid steel!  When she slammed into him it was like getting hit by a freight train and he had great difficulty bringing her down when it was his turn to tackle.  And she never seemed to get tired, just stronger and more energetic!  Though he didn't want to admit it, she soon became an even better football player than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he could no longer deny reality when he suffered a spained shoulder from a particularly brutal tackle of Amber's.  That's when she knew she was ready to join the team.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Coach Thompson tried to dissuade Amber, but the gorgeous muscle-goddess wasn't about to take \"no\" for an answer.  A practice skirmish with the team saw Amber annihilate the opposition and by the next week she was the Varsity team's starting quarterback.  Two victorious games later Amber was elected team captain and soon enthusiastic fans bestowed upon her the nickname, \"Iron Maiden\".    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Amber reached ever greater heights of glory, her family tried to go on existing in her vast shadow.  Frank actually seemed to have shrunk.  He had been essentially unmanned by his dominant daughter and scurried about doing whatever she imperiously commanded.  Debbie was equally obedient, seemingly resigned to serving her physically perfect paragon of a child.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin was eaten up with envy, seeing his younger sister so easily achieve his own dreams of football glory.  It didn't help that his best friend was so obviously attracted to Amber, in spite of the contemptous way she continued to treat Jerome.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavy had apapted to the situation perhaps best of all.  He stayed in his room whenever he could, unless Amber had assigned him a task, in which case he completed it quickly and competently.  He not only quite logically feared Amber, but also understood that his twin brother could no longer protect him at school; he was entirely dependent on his super-stud sister's massive muscles to keep him safe from bullies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Davy was handling the situation best of all, Dylan was doing the worst.  He'd been cut from the gymnastics team and was no longer friends with Vlad; he'd taken a swing at the other boy when Vlad wanted Dylan to arrange a date with Amber.  Each day as was an agony for Dylan, because he'd lost of what had made him special, the athletic ability he'd taken pride in his whole life.  He couldn't stand being as scrawny as Davy, especially since he didn't have his brother's intellectual acumen to fall back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breaking point for the fifteen year-old came three months after Amber's transformation.  He'd neglected to do her laundry because he'd been working out.  Ever since his diminishment Dylan had been working like a maniac trying to build himself up; it was the only thing which gave him hope and he was finally starting to see some progress.  He wasn't back to his old self yet, but he was getting there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amber found he hadn't done his job, though, she'd utterly thrashed him and as an encore had ordered him to kiss her dainty right foot.  As his lips touched Amber's fair skin he <i>felt</i> the gains he had made leave him, all of his hours of hard work only serving to further strengthen his already already immensely muscular and spectacularly strong sister!  He had actually broken down crying and she had left him there with a musical laugh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following Wedneday he ditched school two hours early and headed for home.  Mom would be out shopping and he'd have the house to himself.  He was determined to rip Amber's room apart until he found the gun which had made her into such a titaness.  He knew what she'd do to him if she caught him, but the terror wasn't enough to hold him back; he couldn't live like this anymore!                                </span></div></div>",

However he had a hard time locating it. Amber must have hidden it too well. He searched every drawer in her room, under her bed, and in her closest. But it was pointless so he started trashing her room. He wanted to make it look like a burglary . But Dylan did not notice that a freshman geek Karen was trailing him home with mistrust. Karen was stunned and ran back to the school to find Amber and tell her. She hoped that Amber would believe her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Amber was finished up practicing with the football team. She was learning new plays in the offense In fact, her intuition was improving so well that she was in sync with every wide receiver on the team. She was confident that she was 10X as good as Drew Brees in the best years of his quarterback career. Slowly her team was less fearful of her still had so much respect. Still most of the team was a little worried about the <b>next week opponent, Northeast Dragons. They had 5 seniors on defense who was slated to be All State and recruited by many top college football teams. Even the rest of the defense were good..</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber actually smiled and said ' Don't worry, We are going to win. Just practice hard.' The offense line was just average that year but was sincerely trying to do well. But they were not all that strong but was getting better. But Amber reassured them that she would be OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter practice, a running back approached Amber nervously and said ' K-Karen wants to speak to you'<br>\r\nAmber went to Karen and Karen told her what Dylan was doing. Karen was out of breath since she was no athlete. Karen panted ' Do what you think is best...just make sure Dylan do not hurt me'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber actually winked at Karen and said 'He won't. I will make sure' Amber told the team goodbye for now and lifted Karen and carried her as she ran home. She placed Karen by the front door and told her to wait. Amber ran up the stairs as Dylan was searching the ceiling tiles in her room. She grabbed him by his shirt collar and flexed her biceps...and said 'I know what you are trying to do. BUT I hid it too well' and slapped him unconscious. He would be out like a light for maybe a hour. Amber motioned Karen to come indoors. Karen came in nervously.Karen wanted a friend who can protect her or at least help train her get stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she thanked Amber again and turned to go, the Amazon Atlas told her, \"You can sit at my table at lunch tomorrow.  I like having people I can trust around me.\"  Thrilled once again Karen hurried home, planning to call all her friends and tell them about what an amazing day she'd had!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dylan finally came around he found his angry, six foot tall, gorgeous muscle goddess older sister standing towering over him!  She'd waited until he was conscious again to deliver his punishment, so he could better appreciate the consequences of defying her.  Unlike with her father, she broke <u>both</u> of Dylan's arms, snapping her younger brother's bones in two like twigs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby called an ambulance for Dylan, but only after her totally in-control, dominant daughter gave her permission to do so.  No one questioned the new head of the family's right to discipline Dylan however she saw fit, even if that meant putting him in the hospital.  Since Amber's muscles were so unbelievably large, she was completely in charge of the Douglas clan!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her role as essentially the parent now, Amber had also cut off Dylan's allowance, grounded him for the rest of the year once he got home from the hospital, and took all of the money in his bank account for herself.  THAT ought to teach him, Amber reflected with sadistic satisfaction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Amber had assured her teammates, they won the game the Northeast Dragons with ease.  Amber was completely unstoppable on offense, the Dragons' famed defense unable to even slow the rampaging girl juggernaut.  By the end of the game half of the opposing team's defense had suffered season-ending injuries from foolishly trying to stand in the way of the most muscular Iron Maiden!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren also became a fixture at Amber's table.  Few of the other school kids knew what Karen had done for Amber, but the latter's favor toward her was obvious and led to Karen quickly becoming the most popular freshman in school.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t know what happened to her when she suddenly felt dizzy, but everything was back to normal now. As she noticed her daughter running passed her, she couldn\u2019t help but yell to her to finish her dessert before leaving the table. It was of no use, Debby was already upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby went into the bathroom and locked the door. She was excited, yet scared, after she felt her arm through the fabric of her shirt. She slowly rolled up her sleeve, which was more difficult than she remembered, and couldn\u2019t believe what she saw; a nicely defined upper arm with little to no body fat. As she held it in front of her, stretched, she felt the hardness of her flexed triceps. Then she bent her arm, causing her biceps to spring into action. It grew bigger than she remembered it being; almost as if she had started lifting weights. It was a clearly defined biceps, almost looking bigger than Justin\u2019s arms from what she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her flexed biceps with her other hand and felt it all over. The feeling was incredible; she felt like she had doubled her strength and could take on the world now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she lifted her shirt, exposing her stomach in the reflection. As she now expected, her stomach was perfectly flat with a faint hint of trained abs visible through her skin. She made a fist with her hand, flexed her stomach and pounded it several times. She like the sound of her fist hitting her hard stomach as she couldn\u2019t believe how happy she was with her recent changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber took off her shirt completely. Her upper body was much more fit than before; she could even swear her shoulders were slightly wider. Amber looked at her breasts in her reflection. They had always been nice B-cup size breasts, looking perfectly in proportion to the rest of her body. She cupped one of her breasts with her hand as she could swear they looked slightly bigger, filling her bra a little bit more. As she moved her right arm, she noticed her right breast move ever so gently. It perked up. She moved her arm back; her breast lowered back. She continued repeating this motion until she finally figured out that her chest muscles underneath her breasts were beginning to get developed; causing her breast to jump up. It was only the slightest movement, but it felt incredible to Amber. She practiced a little more, until she figured out how to breast dance them; alternating each breast to perk up after one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt great. She looked around the bathroom for something heavy as she had the sudden urge to lift something. She couldn\u2019t find anything heavy, so she left the bathroom and went into her own room. She locked the door and scanned her room for heavy objects. There, in one corner, she saw her make-up chair. It was worth a shot. She walked towards it, grabbed one of its legs with one hand and pulled. To her surprise, the chair moved; she was lifting it up. And it felt lighter than she had imagined. She curled the furniture several times while looking at her biceps inflate; it was getting a nice pump. Small veins started crawling over her arm, feeding the muscles with blood and oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished curling her chair with both arms, she felt incredible. The blood rushed into her arms made them look even bigger and let the biceps stand out more. She flexed her arm, looked in a mirror in her room, and liked what she saw. She liked it so much, that she wanted more! More of this great feeling, but also more muscles!</span></div></div>",

She was trying to recall the events of the day and what had happened to allow her to rapidly improve her body in such a short amount of time. She quickly ruled out evolution or a miracle from the heavens. It had to be something else. She closed her eyes and recalled the events of the last few hours. First she was hit by that weird ray from the gun her dad had received. Then she had decided to arm wrestle. After each arm wrestling match she head felt better. With that it hit her. The way to feel better was to touch more people. She jumped up at this realization and went to her closet and quickly located some bland sports wear and quickly changed in to a grey sports bra, and white running shorts and a blue t-shirt. Nothing great but she figured she had a far better workout plan than any pro athlete or fitness freak. Just touch some people in better shape for a few seconds and be done. With that she quickly headed down stairs and said \"I need to clear my head so I am going for a walk.\" With that she left the Smith House and headed somewhere to test her theory. </span></div></div>",

At first, she decided to play it safe. She adjusted the weight back to 10 pounds and slid underneath the weight. She was surprised that she could lift that weight easily...too easily.

He had thought she looked more slender when she answered the door, but now she looked totally foxy. \u00a0Her annoyance with him only made her even more attractive. \u00a0No, not attractive, sexy. \u00a0For the first time in a long time, he didn't know what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan's in the back,\" she said disinterestedly, although it came out in a musical trill. \u00a0She turned around and walked to the kitchen, leaving Vlad alone at the door, speechlessly watching her butt twist from side to side as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Vlad!\", Dylan called out. \u00a0\"You're late! \u00a0I thought you forgot!\" \u00a0He clapped his friend on the back. \u00a0\"What are you looking at?\" he continued, wondering why Vlad was staring at the door through which Amber had disappeared moments earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errrr, nothing. \u00a0Nothing really,\" Vlad replied. \u00a0\"Your sister, um, Amber. \u00a0How old is she?\" he asked, as they walked around the other way to the back yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan laughed. \u00a0\"17 chronologically, 25 mentally, and 12 sexually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVlad shook his head. \u00a0\"I dunno about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the kitchen Debby was looking carefully at her daughter, who was protesting vigorously. \u00a0\"I didn't put on ANY make-up! \u00a0Why would put on ANYTHING for him?! \u00a0He's just a kid, a stuck-up kid?! \u00a0And I didn't even know he was coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, OK! I'm sorry I said anything. \u00a0You just look ... never mind,\" she said, pretending to brush off a piece of dirt from Amber's face and satisfying herself that there was nothing on that shouldn't be. \u00a0But her daughter's coloring was amazing. It was as if she had grown up all of a sudden. \"Oh, Amber, you remember Arnold Korman, from your father's office?\" \u00a0A thin, bespectacled man crossed the kitchen, holding a glass of iced tea and stretched out his right hand, which Amber took. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Mr. Korman. \u00a0Daddy always says your the smartest man in the company, and he wishes you were running it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha. \u00a0That's very nice of him to say it, but it takes more than brains to get to the top!\" he said, only just noticing how attractive Amber was. \u00a0\"Well, you've certainly grown up since the last time I was here!\" he remarked a bit uncomfortably, looking over at his wife in the back yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was more than a year ago. \u00a0You were explaining to us why the President's economic program wouldn't work, weren't you? \u00a0About why increased debt wouldn't help because the financial system has a solvency problem, not a liquidity problem, right?\" \u00a0She recalled struggling with the concept then, but it seemed quite simple to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, yes, that's right!\" he said, flattered. \u00a0\"I suppose you were really listening. \u00a0I thought I was just boring everyone with my theories! \u00a0You see ....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Arnold, we should join the others and bring them their drinks too,\" Debby said, noticing that Joe Daniels had just arrived. \u00a0\"I'm sure Amber has other things to do than discuss your economic theories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold took another long look at Amber, who was absentmindedly twisting her body in a number of extraordinary ways while looking at her reflection in the kitchen's picture window. \u00a0For the first time in years, Arnold wished he were a teenager again. But then he swallowed it down and followed Debby outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Amber was not being absentminded at all. \u00a0She noticed everything. \u00a0She saw the effect she had on Arnold Korman and recalled Vlad's sudden speechlessness. \u00a0Her body felt sexy, supple and strong, and immediately after she shook Mr. Korman's hand and felt that odd tingle again her mind seemed to expand in several directions, making connections and grasping concepts she had never understood. \u00a0She was somehow getting from anyone she touched the best they had to offer: athleticism, sexiness, brains. \u00a0That ray from the \"toy gun\" had done something to her, something wonderful, and she was going to get everything she could from it before it wore off!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Debby and Arnold went outside, Amber looked out the window and saw her mother talking to her Dad and Arnold.  Amber smiled knowingly as she saw Debby wave the new neighbor over for a drink.  Her mother wasn\u2019t just being neighborly; she wanted a better look at this young hunk.  And like a tigress staring at a potential meal, Amber wanted something from him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe had put a shirt on, but it was a tight one and his hard, muscular physique was clearly on display.  Amber looked him over from his athletic, muscular legs to his 8 pack abs to his thick chest to his broad shoulders to his bulging biceps.  Smiling, Amber considered that if she were to obtain what Joe had to offer, that her clothes would not be able to handle the stress, that she should go upstairs and find some appropriate clothes to \u201cgrow\u201d into.  On the other hand, the idea that she could overwhelm her clothes gave her added level of excitement.  A shock value if you will.  Letting out an excited breath, Amber decided on the latter, already planning her next move.  Reaching into her pocket, she texted her friend Brittney Michaels about heading over.  Amber was not just interested in Brittney\u2019s looks and assets, but the strength of her big brother Brett.  He was a lineman on the college team her brother went to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few texts later confirmed that both Brittney and Brett were home and that Brittney would be expecting Amber in a little while.  So with her moves in place, Amber walked outside with more confidence than she had ever had.  The eyes of everyone but her mother\u2019s gravitated over to her 5 foot 6 inch tight body.  Even a bit hidden in her baggy t-shirt and long shorts her slender, toned muscles were quite evident.  Her improved looks completed the distraction.  But even as the other men gave her a surprised once over, her mother was doing her best to talk to Joe and hold his interest.  Once Amber came up to them however, Joe\u2019s attention to the conversation waned.  Amber gave her best flirtatious move, cocking her hip to one side and flipping her long, full dark hair unnecessarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m Amber.  You must be the new neighbor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe swallowed momentarily while Debby frowned.  Amber kept her eyes on Joe, knowing that it was upsetting her mother, but not really caring.  She smiled at Joe as she gave Debby a lame excuse that she knew would annoy her mother even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMother, I believe that Dad needs you for something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby looked over at Frank who was talking to Arnold.  She wasn\u2019t convinced that Frank really wanted her, but knew that if she challenged Amber it wouldn\u2019t look good in front of Joe.  Sighing, she nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you honey.  Let me know if any of your high school friends want to come over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber nodded her head with a wry smile.  Debby had made sure Joe knew she was underage.  \u201cGood one, Mom,\u201d she thought.  But Amber really didn\u2019t care about moving in on her mother\u2019s crush.  She had other plans.  Putting her hand out, she widened her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, my name is Amber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe, oblivious to the mother/daughter competition, wiped his hand on his shorts and reached out to shake Amber\u2019s outstretched hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, my name is Joe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber watched their hands as they met and as soon as the handshake started Amber could feel her clothes tighten as Joe\u2019s muscular athletic physique became hers.  As the quick handshake ended, Amber\u2019s body began to bulge forward across her frame.  Her gymnast legs pushed out thick quads that would be the envy of any female bodybuilder and diamond shaped calves bigger than softballs.  Her tight stomach pushed out slightly as her abs quickly morphed into a solid 8-pack of rippling muscles, even as her waist line remained narrow and hidden behind her t-shirt.  However, as Amber\u2019s back and shoulders widened, immediately stressing her top to the point of rupture, the shirt pulled up high enough to expose those cleanly separated abs.  Amber\u2019s pectorals surged forward as well, putting further stress on not just her shirt, but her bra as well.  With the combined expansion of her back and chest, the bra was pushed to the limit and dug uncomfortable into Amber\u2019s sides.  One quick inhale gave her relief as the bra snapped in the back even as the front remained plastered to her chest, stuck between her surging chest and her tightening t-shirt.  More rips and pops occurred as shirt was now looking nearly painted on, showcasing her large, lightweight male bodybuilder upper body.  Her breasts didn\u2019t diminish, but were now looking a bit small against her wide, thick, striated pectorals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her hand back from the shake she brought both arms up and with a sly wink at the confused Joe, pushed out a quick double bicep pose with destructive results.  The sleeves tore up to her football sized shoulders as her arms now sported more muscle than Joe!  Thick forearms curved down to a narrow, feminine elbow joint and back out into a killer tricep and bicep combo that most men would kill for.  The bicep ballooned up over her shoulders and up her forearms, forming twin peaks of female power easily 20 inches around, peppered with feathered muscle fibers, clean bicep splits and bulging, throbbing peaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing her flex if for nothing more than to keep her top from blowing off her body, Amber giggled at the confused Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you Joe.  I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be seeing more of each other in the future.  Unfortunately, I\u2019m heading over to a friend\u2019s house today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber turned on her heels and headed back toward the house.  She shot a glance over toward her mother with a matter of fact attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s all yours mom.  I\u2019m heading over to Brittney\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby blushed as Frank gave a confused look.  Both of their eyes widened as they got a quick look at Amber.  What had happened to her?  She looked like an Olympic athlete.  A seriously buffed out Olympic athlete at that.  Amber moved quickly however, and Debby pulled herself together in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCall me when you get there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber waved her hand dismissively, ripping the shirt further up her side, exposing more of her muscular back.  Not slowing down she headed into her room to change.  She looked at the mirror and smiled, which was something she had not done in years.  Most of her time in front of the mirror was to obsess over her flaws and wish that her body was different.  Amber pulled her arms back up into a massive double bicep and with a harsh inhale completed the destruction of her top with several loud rips.  Reaching over to her shoulder with her left hand she casually pulled off the ruined top and bra and unceremoniously dropped them to the floor, leaving her topless.  She gasped at the size and musculature of her upper body.  She was more muscular than all but one or two boys in school.  She was sure of it.  And when she peeled off her shorts, she giggled at the large, sweeping quads that jiggled as she moved, but powered into four distinct angry slabs of beef with a single tense.  She rotated her small bare right foot and pushed down on her toes to pump her heart shaped, bulging calf up and down.  Placing both feet on the ground she took a look at herself in the mirror again.  Nude save for her panties, she looked fantastic.  Curvy and muscular, she was confident that she had exceeded Pricilla\u2019s physique even if she was 6 inches shorter.  She gave a quick thought toward Jerome and her crush on him.  He had said that he fancied the muscular girls like Pricilla.  She smiled at that thought, wondering if she could figure out how to get those two together so she could show Pricilla up.  And then steel away their best assets!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not right now.  Letting out a determined breath Amber fished around her clothes for something that would fit.  She found a short blue skirt that would work well, happy enough that even though she was sporting serious muscle, her waist had actually gotten slimmer.  Finding a top was a different matter.  Fortunately, she liked to wear baggy shirts as night gowns and found an old Disney princess shirt.  Wrinkling her nose she pulled the thick shirt over her head and struggled a bit to pull the shirt over her chest as even the extra large shirt was no match for her muscle packed upper torso.  Although it was tight, it fit.  Fortunately the sleeves were large too and fit her arms nicely.  She bent her arm in front of her and marveled as her flexed bicep filled the sleeve.  Tying the bottom into a knot to expose her blistering abs of steel, Amber slipped on a set of sparkly thongs and flipped her long dark hair over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaltzing out of her room, Amber bounced down the stairs and out the front door.  With a brisk walk that felt effortless, Amber reached Brittney\u2019s house in record time.  With her mind plotting, she hit the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when the door opened she saw.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber smiled.  \u201cOh, I\u2019ve been working out a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany stared at Amber, looking her muscular body up and down as Amber stood there relaxed and confident.  Amber looked at Brittany\u2019s long blonde hair, ample bosom and Nordic features while holding a warm smile.  As Brittany continued to look at Amber with wide eyes, Amber chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany shook her head and her initial frown returned.  \u201cHeh.  Of course.  Only instead of watching the movie we wanted, Brett and his friends have taken over the TV to watch a football game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber nodded and stepped into the room, kicking off her footwear.  There were a total of five large college football players sitting around the room on a couch and couple of chairs.  Her thoughts about Brittany momentarily disappeared as the thought of enhancing herself with the five large boys caused her nipples to harden with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell perhaps I can convince them to change the channel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany shrugged her shoulders as Amber walked over to the boys.  She carefully walked behind the large chair where Brett was sitting and touched the back of his neck.  Immediately she could feel enhanced strength and power surge into her body.  Brett reached up and brushed her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo away Brittany.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber chuckled.  \u201cIt\u2019s Amber.  We\u2019d like to watch a movie\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett shook his head, keeping his eye on the game.  \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit, we\u2019re busy here, why don\u2019t you two head somewhere else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber paused as she felt her muscles surge across her body, causing the large shirt to shift as new muscles stacked on already large muscles.  Giggling, Amber said nothing, but moved toward the next chair and the couch and three large men.  Staying behind them she did the same to each, touching the back of their necks just long enough to pull in their strength, speed and other attributes.  The boys jerked or reached up to brush her away.  One of them looked at her with annoyance, but paused for a moment as he realized how pretty she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step back behind the couch Amber let out a sigh as her entire body processed so much strength being pulled in a short amount of time.  She had walked into the room already as strong and as nearly as muscular as any of them, now her body was adding the strength of five of the strongest men in the state along with the muscle to back it up.  Waves of muscle bristled across her legs and as she stood on her toes her calves pressed outward into twin balls of distended steel, each flexed well over two incredible feet around!  Her thighs pulsed and expanded recklessly, pushing outward and growing denser, thicker and impossibly strong.  Her quads separated and pushed against each other, bulging down to nearly engulf her knees and forward 18 inches thick.  The skirt rose up against her magnificent muscled glutes as big as bowling balls!  Her abs remained narrow, but pulsed thicker, denser and detailed to a mind numbing degree.  As her lats grew wider and her back expanded thicker the shirt rose higher.  The quick knot she had tied popped apart and the sides of the XX large shirt started to split.  Her pectorals stacked striated muscles on top of each other, pushing her breasts hard against the material to the point of rupture.  Her sleeves filled up with jagged, super strong muscles and pulling up right arm, Amber casually flexed her bicep and the sleeve tore horribly against a raging volcano of muscle as her 20 inch guns expanded frighteningly up over her thickening shoulder to peak up to the top of her fist.  Her bicep split was a canyon of power and her peak throbbed with a wicked vein across the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute of touching Brett, Amber had become at least seven times stronger than the strongest man on earth with muscles to outclass any two men!  Her five foot seven inch body was now a symphony of strength, muscle and power!  Brittany gasped at the site of Amber\u2019s expanded body.  Amber turned toward Brittany and winked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down, Amber put her arms under the coach and with ridiculous ease pulled the three boys and the couch up over her head!  This act finished off her shirt as the material ripped up the sides and her other sleeve split in half.  The remains of the shirt hung onto her body like rags.  The three men yelped with surprise and hung onto the cushions instinctively.  But Amber tilted the couch forward and the boys fell forward onto the floor with loud thuds.  Amber pulled the couch down and brought her arms together with horrible cracks as the frame and metal buckled and broke against Amber\u2019s unyielding strength.  With a satisfying growl, Amber then tore the couch in half and tossed the two ends behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said.  Brittany and I would like to watch a move.  You boys had better head somewhere else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys got up quickly, not used to being embarrassed by anyone, much less a high school girl.  Their eyes widened as they looked at the beautiful beast standing before them however and they paused to try and process.  Amber narrowed her eyes and smiled.  Not only did she have all of their strength, but their fighting abilities as well.  She knew how to throw a punch and not waiting for the guys to decide what to do Amber moved forward and pulled her arm back quickly to expose her massive biceps.  She then unleashed a punch into the first football player\u2019s chest with a crunch that sent him hurtling across the room and smash into the far wall, shaking the house!  Considering he was a 6 foot 2 inch 290 pound lineman her super strenth feat shocked everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Amber didn\u2019t blink an eye and quickly toward a second large 250 pound linebacker and shot a punch into his midsection with such force that her small fist ripped through his thick abs as though they were marshmallows and sunk into his gut, nearly cutting him in half and propelling him off her fist into the opposite wall with another terrible crash.  Amber reached out to the third large college player and gripped his shirt quickly and pulling him off the ground with ease, spun him around toward the front door and shot a punch across his head that left her with a fist full of shirt as the 274 pound lineman shot off her fist and blasted into the wall next to the door, cracking the wall as he crumpled to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany was screaming with fear and as Amber turned to glower at her the fourth football player reached out to Amber and tried to press down on her shoulders to push her away.  The move was ineffective and Amber reached out, grabbed his forearm, squeezed down with a dull crack that indicated her steel grip and broken his arm and tossed him up and over her shoulder toward the same far wall as the first victim.  She tossed him with such force that he crashed through the wall and plowed into the adjoining room with another room shaking explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time Brett had gotten up and charged Amber but she spun around, stepped to the side quickly and with her mega muscled, super strong arm outstretched, clothes lined Brett with such force the she cracked his ribs and sent him hard to the floor with the final room shaking rumble.  He hit the ground, cracking his head and bounced up half a foot before crashing back to floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber turned and looked at the horrified Brittany, who was now the only uninjured and conscious person besides Amber in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany was shaking, unable to move.  Amber walked over toward her, absently ripping the rags off her shirt to expose her massive upper torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to scare you like that, but I had to wonder just how strong I was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber reached out and touched Brittany\u2019s trembling hand.  Amber\u2019s breasts expanded a bit, looking magnificent on her gigantic pectoral shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you ought to call 911.  And then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carefully considering the options before her, Amber soon settled on her first conscious choice of a \u201cdonor\u201d: Vlad!  Growing up in a family with three brothers, Amber was unfortunately used to being pushed around, even by her younger siblings!  Not that any of them ever had really hurt her; no, it was more along the lines of elbowing her aside when rushing for the television remote, making snide comments when she couldn\u2019t open a jar, showing off when there was something heavy to lift and constantly bragging about their sports victories, all of this combining to make her feel small and weak.  Aside from muttering about the excess of testosterone in the house, there\u2019d simply been nothing she could do to compete or fight back.  Thus, the prospect of now actually possessing Vlad\u2019s iron-muscled strength and exceptional athleticism delighted her!  See how her brothers liked it when she was the one boasting the big muscles and raw physical power!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, a little voice in the back of her head reminded her, Jerome had said he was attracted to girls with muscle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTingling with excited anticipation, Amber swiftly made her way down the stairs.  While passing through the kitchen she was pleased to note she attracted several interested glances from men responding to her alluring new attractiveness.  Still, she ignored them as she passed by and opened the door to the basement.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo months ago, the Smith family had finally given in to Dylan\u2019s constant pleas: they\u2019d cleaned out their basement and turned it into his gymnastics practice area.  The floor was covered with red mats and the subterranean chamber contained a set of uneven parallel bars, a pommel horse and a set of rings hanging down from a specially secured ceiling beam, as well as a washing machine and dryer.  Although the new lack of storage space had led the family to pack both the garage and attic with stuff, Frank did appreciate not needing to constantly drive his son to and from the gym to practice.  If Dylan and Vlad weren\u2019t down there already, Amber figured, they would be soon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was right!  She could hear the boys talking as she shut the door behind her.  Once she stepped off the stairs, she spotted both her brother and Vlad, each stripped down to only beam shoes and their team\u2019s red and white unitard.  Her younger brother was leaning against the concrete wall as Vlad finished up a warm-up ring routine.  He released them, did a double somersault, and stuck the landing, panting and smugly triumphant.  Dylan actually looked good in his outfit, if Amber was being honest, but he was like a little boy compared to his buff best friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVlad\u2019s uniform was skin-tight, showing off razor-cut muscles of his phenomenal young physique!  His barrel chest strained the fabric, protruding above his visible six pack abs.  Even unflexed, the biceps of his brawny, heavily-muscled arms were the size of softballs, while his legs were like freaking oak tree-trunks!  For an instant Amber could only stare at the great-looking, serious jock of a fifteen year-old.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmber, what are you doing down here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer younger brother\u2019s irritated question broke Amber out of her trance and she flushed with embarrassment.  Vlad didn\u2019t seem at all put out, however, instead flashing a cocky grin at the flustered older girl.            <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nearly broke and fled the basement then, but rather than yielding to her natural instincts, Amber instead steeled herself to go through with it, to DO IT!  Seven quick steps brought her to Vlad and, standing up on her tip-toes, she unhesitatingly kissed him!  <br>\r\nStunned, Vlad stood rooted to spot as Amber embraced him and even slipped him the tongue!  Never in his life had any girl ever been this aggressive with him, and he simply didn\u2019t know how to react!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmber, what the Hell?!!?\u201d Dylan shouted, equally shocked.  How could she do this to him?!?  Throwing herself at his best friend like that, it was insane!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVlad finally mastered himself and tried to gently disentangle himself from Amber, to no avail.  Her initially desperate embrace had somehow tightened by the second, to the point where it was now decidedly uncomfortable, securely pinning his arms to his sides.  Exerting more effort, he tried again to break free and again he failed.  By now her once-soft arms were squeezing him like a crushing, lethally powerful python!  Her breasts felt bigger and harder than ever as they pressed relentlessly into his pecs and he was actually getting short of breath when Amber broke off the kiss.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-faced, confused, and quite upset, Vlad went all out to get free and STILL couldn\u2019t!  In his confusion he looked down, only to get a still bigger shock!  Amber\u2019s arms were thick with sizeable, rippling muscles, easily dwarfing Dylan\u2019s limbs, while his own arms seemed to have lost all their own hard-won, impressive definition and solidity, having dwindled down to little more than twigs!  His chest, too, was shallow and shapeless, being compressed by the rock-solid, DD breasts which jutted from beautiful Amber\u2019s deep chest.  Even her shoulders were noticeably broader and thicker than his now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly released, Vlad stumbled back and fell on his butt, all of his majestic, jungle cat grace having somehow utterly deserted him.  He stared down in disbelieving horror at the slender, even scrawny frame he now possessed.  The effects of thousands of hours of hard work, of his lifelong dedication to gymnastics, gone!  He looked . . . he looked as shrimpy as Davy now!    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking away tears, he gazed up from his prone position, to where Amber loomed threateningly above him!  She\u2019d outgrown her top, shredding the garment and fully revealing her flawlessly sculpted, statuesque upper body!  The large, bulging muscles which used to be Vlad\u2019s looked more impressive and intimidating gracing Amber\u2019s now-awesomely Amazonian form!  The lovely, raven-haired muscle girl flexed her magnificent biceps victoriously, in a primal show of dominance, even as Justin gaped at his stud alpha female older sister!      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Justin couldn\u2019t help it; he accidentally touched the trigger, pulled it too far, causing the gun to fire. As he stood there, with the gun still in his hands looking down at it, in front of the table, he noticed a blue hew illuminating the garden from the opposite side of the table. He looked up, trying to see who he had hit, when the blue radiation was already gone. Two pairs of wide opened eyes were staring straight at him, all four filled with disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one of his brothers had he hit? He wasn\u2019t sure, it wasn\u2019t obvious. They both reacted the same, not one reacted differently\u2026unusual. Did he hit Dylan, the athletic gymnast of the family, or his twin-brother Davy, the comic-geek?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin looked at other members around the table; they all looked at him with emptiness in their eyes. No-one had seen what has happened; it all happened too fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDylan\u2026Davy\u2026are you alright? Did I accidentally hit one of you?!?\u201d he ultimately asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys looked at Justin with doubt, and then they looked at each other. Not even they knew what happened; neither one of them had felt strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure as hell not hit\u2026\u201d Dylan replied as he looked his twin brother straight in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe neither\u2026!\u201d Davy added, turning his head to face Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank god! So I missed!\u201d, Justin sighed relieved, \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I had hurt one of you guys\u2026thank god you\u2019re OK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, lucky us\u2026\u201d, Davy yelled somewhat shocked, \u201c\u2026could you also explain to us WHAT you shot us with?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother joined in. \u201cYeah! And WHY you shot at us with an unknown device in the first place\u2026? A bit trigger-happy, now are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, there\u2019s no reason to get angry all of a sudden\u2026\u201d Frank, the dad, joined in to calm the twins\u2019 senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin didn\u2019t know how to respond as he looked back down at the gun in his hands. \u201cI\u2026I really didn\u2019t mean to hurt you\u2026I just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just WHAT?!?\u201d Dylan yelled somewhat furious as it dawned on him what his big brother had just done. He stood up from his chair and walked over to his big brother. They were both the same height, so they saw eye to eye. \u201cCare to explain yourself a bit more\u2026\u201d Dylan said as he gave his big brother a push. Justin fell backwards, quickly adjusting his stance as not to fall completely. Even though he was the older brother, he lacked the size. His little brother was bigger due to his gymnastics; he could easily push his big brother down. This was why Justin always tried to avoid conflicts with his little brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Justin wanted to shove Dylan back, Frank stood up and separated the boys. Davy quickly gathered behind his twin brother, which he always did as they were in a fight. His saw his brother as his protector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoys, BOYS!\u201d Frank yelled to calm down the boys of his family. \u201cNow there is absolutely no reason to fight each other. Dylan\u2026it was just an accident, and Justin\u2026please nicely apologize to your brother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Dylan and Justin looked at their father. Even though he was skinny in size, he made up for it in height and authority. He still towered over his sons and he knew how to take advantage out of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all can be lucky he missed and nothing serious happened\u2026\u201d Frank added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026he didn\u2019t necessarily\u2026miss!\u201d Davy finished.</span></div></div>",

Jerome had added himself behind Justin, while Davy stood behind Dylan. All eyes were now focused on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what it literally says; he didn\u2019t miss\u2026\u201d Davy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me\u2026.I really did hit one of you?!?\u201d Justin filled in.

In fact, it hurt like hell! It still does!\u201d His expression changed to an angrier look. He was not at all happy with what his brother had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit\u2026\u201d, Frank intervened, \u201c\u2026what are you feeling? Where does it hurt? Do you want me to call a doctor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No doctor! It feels\u2026strange. It\u2019s burning, all over my body. I don\u2019t know what it is\u2026in a way I kind of like it\u2026I guess\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, he grabbed his stomach with both hands as he hunched forward. He let out a scream as a sharp pain in his stomach took over his body. He lowered himself to his knees. His twin brother lowered himself next to him, in fear of what was happening to his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavy!!!\u201d Dylan screamed \u201cAre you OK? Speak to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed his hands on Dylan\u2019s back, which was now the only thing facing the family. As he touched his brother\u2019s back, he could feel something moving underneath the fabric. Davy let out a cry of pain, as Dylan saw his brother\u2019s back widen. It grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god\u2026is he\u2026is he\u2026?\u201d Justin yelled in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fabric of Davy\u2019s t-shirt began to get tighter and tighter, until suddenly, a large tear ripped open the entire back of his shirt, exposing his growing back muscles underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan looked up at Justin. \u201cYep\u2026it seems like he is growing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavy\u2019s back and shoulders widened as he lats and traps grew larger. The little m-sized shirt could not contain the growing muscles anymore, ripping open at every seam and more. Not only his back was growing, also his arms were filling up with well-deserved muscle. His triceps formed a perfect horse-shoe, while his biceps balled up into extremely large peaks. His growing bull-neck stretched the collar of his shirt to its extremes. It almost suffocated him, which is why he managed to pull it off in one simple tear. The strength in his arms was doubling, tripling, quadrupling in mere seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only his upper body was slowly growing, also his legs were ballooning up to epic proportions. His board shorts started ripping at the seams from his growing thighs and glutes. Powerful tree trunk legs replaced the milky white sticks that used to support his full body weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavy was screaming, crying and grunting from pain, but somehow in his screams there was also a sign of pleasure and satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his transformation came to the same sudden halt as it had begun, the 15-year-old muscle behemoth was sitting on all fours on the concrete floor. His twin brother was sitting beside him, getting him through the painful transformation. He was in just as much awe as the rest of the family. Not only that, there was also a very strong sense of sibling jealousy; but for now Dylan decided to support his brother through this painful thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey bro\u2026how are you feeling? Is the strange burning sensation gone? It looks like your transformation has stopped\u2026\u201d Dylan asked slowly as he placed his hand once again on his twin brother\u2019s back. Only this time it felt rock-hard, packed with rippling muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark laughter came from Davy\u2019s head. He slowly but steadily pushed himself back up. As he sat straight up on the floor, his upper body completely shredded through his t-shirt, next to his brother he couldn\u2019t do more than smile. A grin from ear to ear appeared on his face as he slowly began to inspect his own, newfound, physique. \u201cOh My Fricking God!\u201d his dark voice boomed as he felt and flexed every muscle in his torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his arm, flexed it, felt his biceps, straightened his arm, felt his triceps\u2026then he continued down to his chest, he flexed it, he held his fingers in between the crevices of his pecs, he ran them over his abs, his obliques, he flared out his lats, he ran his hands over his rippling thighs and finally he looked up at his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude!\u201d, his booming voice said, \u201cI feel super!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everyone in the family looked at the muscular teen sitting on his knees on the ground. His massive torso was draped with some last shreds of t-shirt. The big smile on his face revealed his blinking white teeth, as he showed his twin brother with his upper body could do now. His larger than baseball-sized upper arms, his square chest muscles, his rippling eight-pack; he had become an impressive specimen. If you would have been told he was a Mister Olympia, you would have believed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan, his twin brother, looked on in amazement. He was a little bit scared at first, but he knew his brother wouldn\u2019t hurt him. As Davy proposed to Dylan to touch his biceps, the twin happily obliged. Feeling the huge, rock-hard muscle in his upper arms made Dylan send a shiver down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow bro! It\u2019s rock hard!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavy\u2019s smile grew only bigger. He extended his arm towards his twin brother and asked him to help get up. Dylan, not sure if he would be able to give any help, grabbed the enormous hand of his brother by the wrist. He added his other hand as well. Then he started to pull. He couldn\u2019t really get any motion in his brother\u2019s body, but luckily Davy helped himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time for Davy to use his newly grown legs; his upper body weighed a ton and he wasn\u2019t sure how his legs would react. As he placed his feet on the ground and he pulled himself up on his brother, he felt blood rushing to his thighs. They sprang into action as they had to push up the entire upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Davy, leaning on Dylan, almost crushing him, extended higher and higher in height, he surpassed every single person in the garden. Finally, as he reached his full height, he was almost 10 inches taller than the biggest person: his dad. He looked like one of the superheroes from his comics; tall, ripped and powerful. Everyone in the garden let out \u201coohs\u201d and \u201caahs\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of a sudden, his expression changed. He felt strong, confident and invulnerable. He was no longer the smallest person of the family; he didn\u2019t have to listen to anyone of them anymore; he was finally grown up and strong enough to be the one with the power. This made him realize that he didn\u2019t have to hide behind his twin brother anymore when they got in a fight, like just before. He was now able to pick his own fights! And he already had the first victim in mind: Justin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, impressed with what happened to his little brother, was happy the entire fight from before did not go through. He looked on in awe as his little brother outgrew him in both height and strength. He was positioned behind the massive Davy as he inspected his own body. Justin had the perfect view of his rippling back. Little did he know that Davy\u2019s expression suddenly changed from the broad smile into something darker; he was out for revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin saw the muscles in Davy\u2019s back ripple and flex as he slowly twisted his torso. The behemoth was looking across the garden, almost as if he was finding someone. When his stare crossed Justin\u2019s, Justin knew from the mean look on Davy\u2019s face that he was in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d Davy\u2019s dark voice boomed as he grabbed his big brother by his collar and hoisted him into the air, only with one hand. Justin gulped. \u201cYou did this to me?! You made me this FREAK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome and Frank both sprang into action as they wanted to save Justin; they knew Davy could kill him in an instant if he wanted to. However when both men came close, Davy\u2019s free hand swung round, sending the guys through the air to land several feet away. It would be difficult to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, still hanging in the air face-to-face with his big little brother, didn\u2019t know how to respond. \u201cWhy did you shoot me? You didn\u2019t know what the gun could do! It could have killed me!\u201d Davy yelled in his face, getting angrier by the minute. He let Justin back on the ground, only to twist his entire body around to grab him in a headlock. \u201cYou know, it only takes a slight flex to crack your neck\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that\u2026!\u201d Justin cried as he felt the rock hard warm muscle of his brother\u2019s arm around his neck. \u201cI\u2019m your brother\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou tried to kill me as well!\u201d, Davy replied, \u201cSo why do you think I wouldn\u2019t do the same to you\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t! It was an accident\u2026I swear!\u201d Justin cried harder as he was frightened to death. He really didn\u2019t know if his brother was serious or playing a game with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mean time, the rest of the family knew they couldn\u2019t do much, but they had to stop Davy. He was too big and too strong, Justin didn\u2019t stand a chance. That\u2019s when Amber came up with an idea; why don\u2019t we give him an equal opponent?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked for the box the gun came in and found it on the floor under the table. Luckily, the gun was still inside. She grabbed it, aimed it at Justin and shot!</span></div></div>",

He let go of his brother\u2019s neck as he followed the source of the beam back towards Amber. Justin fell on the ground, unconscious and out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!!!\u201d, Davy yelled at his sister, \u201cWhy did you do that?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber, somewhat scared at her hulking brother who came at her, dropped the gun and looked up into her little brother\u2019s eyes. \u201cBe-because you were hurting him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was only joking!\u201d Davy yelled as he looked at the frightened faces of his family. \u201cYou didn\u2019t really think I would have killed him, now did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody said a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! I can\u2019t believe you guys! I wouldn\u2019t hurt my own brother! I love what he has done to me! I mean; I was always the weakest of the family and for once in my life that was about to change. I was just messing around, getting back at Justin for all the times he messed me around because of my size; I wasn\u2019t seriously going to kill him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavy looked once more at the frightened faces of his family; still no-one said a single word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe nobody believes me\u2026\u201d he said as he stared back at his big brother lying motionless on the ground. Then he felt a small hand touching his shoulder. He turned his head to see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe you\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavy twisted his torso around completely to find his twin brother facing him. He looked so tiny now in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure bro! I\u2019m one hundred percent sure you wouldn\u2019t want to kill any of us\u2026I highly doubt it if you want to kill anyone else for that matter\u2026! You\u2019re a good guy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing these words from his twin brother made his heart warm. A smile resurfaced on his face. He draped his arms around his twin\u2019s back and lifted him up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan felt his brother\u2019s hard muscles from up close as Davy almost squeezed the life out of him. \u201cBro\u2026easy on the hugs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavy, not knowing his own strength, loosened his grip and apologized. He looked at the rest of his family, who started smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry for giving you the impression we were scared of you!\u201d his mother said as she broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we didn\u2019t mean it like that\u2026we\u2019re sure you wouldn\u2019t kill anyone. It\u2019s just; we were a bit startled from your transformation!\u201d Amber added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come here you guys!\u201d Davy said as he spread his arms out for the entire family to give him a hug \u201cYou\u2019re the best!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were all laughing and smiling from the hug Davy was giving his family; nobody noticed Justin\u2019s transformation had started. His once motionless body was now shaking and trembling, filling his shirt and shorts with more muscles than they could contain. His body kept adding muscles by the second; stretching his clothes to their limits; until they couldn\u2019t be contained anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud ripping sounds filled the silent air of the Smith backyard. Jerome was the first one to notice his best buddy\u2019s transformation. \u201cUhm\u2026you guys!\u201d he said as he saw Justin\u2019s rippling back muscles through the tears of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else turned their heads to face the growing teenager. Even though mere moments ago they had witnessed the same transformation on the now hulking Davy; it was still an impressive sight to behold. Even Davy, now seeing his own transformation occur right before his eyes, was in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Amber asked Davy as she heard Justin\u2019s groans and screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it does! It feels like a thousand needles punch your skin, followed by all the bones in your body breaking all at once; yet the reward feels so great, so powerful! It\u2019s worth it!\u201d Davy explained as even he looked on with his eyes wide open as Justin\u2019s neck widened to break off his collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin was slowly regaining consciousness as the transformation was coming to an end. His wide torso had ripped through his shirt completely, leaving mere bits of fabric hanging round his waist. Similarly his thighs had ripped open his shorts; exposing the most powerful tree trunk legs a bodybuilder would be jealous of. The motion in his muscles faded away, leaving the hulked teenager on his hands and knees in front of his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavy was the first, and only, of the family who dared to approach his big brother. He kneeled down next to his brother\u2019s head as he took in his back; it was unbelievably ripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJustin..bro! Are you OK?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Look at him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes immediately shifted to the blond fifteen year-old.  At first no one else saw what Davy, who knew his twin best, had.  Standing motionless in his sneakers, work-out shorts and black muscle shirt Dylan appeared completely unchanged; he was the same fit, athletic teeanger he'd been before.  His blue eyes had closed and his fists were tightly clenched, making his well-developed biceps and triceps tense and bulge.  Her \"little\" brother's arms looked pretty good, Amber had to admit.  In fact . . . they looked even bigger and more defined than Jerome's arms!       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Justin whispered in awe, staring at the unbelievable sight before him.  It was obvious to everyone now that Dylan was <i>changing</i>.  His shirt was already skin-tight, outlining a pair of proud, cannonball-sized pecs, and it was beginning to rip across the boy's broadening shoulders.  His legs were two tree-trunks of solid muscle and his awesome arms were almost as impressive.  Second by second Dylan's burgeoning physique grew steadily more muscular and more powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the ripping sound of overstressed seams giving way the shirt split in half and fell away, the child's garment no longer appropriate for the He-Man Dylan had become.   The entire family and Jerome gaped at the teen's fully revealed, incredible upper body.  His tanned chest was very deep and perfectly sculpted, overlooking a carved set of armor-like, eight-pack abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the transformation seemed to cease.  Opening his eyes Dylan smiled and with a roar flexed his magnificent new biceps, causing everyone to instinctively fall back a step.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan?  Are you all right?\" Davy asked timidly.  His mega-ripped, muscle-bound brother turned toward him with a fluid, flowing grace that even the lithe and agile adolescent had never displayed before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right?\" Dylan asked, his alto voice having deepened into a commanding adult baritone.  \"I'm better than all right!  I've got the body of a GOD now!\" he boasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of those assembled could deny Dylan's arrogant claim.  He had always been a jock, but now he was built like a gold medal-winning Olympic gymnast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank was completely at a loss as to what say or do.  His lover's invention had turned his boy into a true teenage Hercules!  He felt utterly overwhelmed just by Dylan's sheer physical presence now.  The parental authority he had asserted only a moment ago had withered away in the wake of his son's ascension.  Dylan was unquestionably the new man of the house and Frank couldn't even imagine daring to try to tell this dominant alpha male what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby, awash though she was in worry and confusion, couldn't help thinking briefly that Dylan was already more than twice the handsome hunk Joe was-and he was only <i>fifteen</i>!     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber, too, had to fight her instinctive, primal attraction to her golden-haired Adonis of a kid brother.  She quickly looked back over at Jerome, but her longtime crush seemed small and scrawny compared to the mass of pure bronzed muscle which was Dylan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome was making the same comparison.  Dylan was the embodiment of all of his muscle dreams come true.  He would kill to be  half as built as the immensely muscular teen titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin was terrified!  His athlete of a baby bro had been about to kick his butt before, but Dylan looked strong enough to crush him under one foot now!       <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavy was trying desperately to process what had happened and get a handle on how he felt.  On the one hand, none of the bullies weould ever mess with him again, not with mighty Dylan as his protector.  On the other hand, the twins had always been equals in a stange way, Dylan's brawn balanced out by Davy's brains.  With the new size and definition of his muscles, though, Davy estimated that Dylan had grown at least five times stronger than he'd been before!  Now Davy's intelligence could no longer hope to compare to his twin's near-superhuman physical power.  The realization made Davy feel lost and inferior in a way he never had before.               <br>\r\n                 </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The grin on Dylan's face sent a shiver down Justin's spine. A minute ago, he had only barely escaped getting beat up by his already-stronger kid brother because of his father's intervention. Now, however, he feared his little brother couldn't be stopped, even if the entire family teamed up against him. Justin gulped, praying that something, anything, would distract Dylan long enough to allow him to escape. But he had no such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Dylan stepped closer to Justin, flexing his arms and chest muscles as he did so, \"you think it's cool to just fire strange weapons at your kid brothers without knowing or caring what they'd do. Is that your idea of a good time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Kid' brother?\" Amber chuckled lightly. \"I don't think you can really use that term anymore, Dylan! You sure don't look like any kid I've seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan spun his head around to look at his sister. \"Shut the hell up, Amber, or I'll deal with you next.\" The fire, anger, and dominance in his eyes shocked Amber, causing her to cower at her brother's intimidating presence. Whatever had caused Dylan's sudden and unexplainable transformation, one thing was for sure: he seemed to be getting way too aggressive and out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavy watched his newly-huge twin try to intimidate the rest of the family, knowing something was wrong. Dylan might normally be a little intense sometimes, yes, but to snap at his sister like that, to become so belligerent... well, that was way out of his character. Something had happened inside of him as his body had grown and changed, causing him to become more domineering and frightening than any in the family could have possibly feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneering at Justin, Dylan took another step closer, the stomping of his large foot causing the windows to rattle slightly. \"Well, Justin,\" he finally said, \"I think it's time someone decided to give you what you've been deserving for years. I guess that someone's me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out a large hand and grabbed Justin by the neck, lifting him up in the air. Justin's feet dangled freely, several inches off of the ground. His eyes bulged as he gasped for air, clawing wildly but uselessly at Dylan's thick hand, which was wrapped almost completely around his throat. \"P-please, Dylan,\" he begged, his voice wheezing as he struggled to breathe, \"I-I'm sorry!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as sorry as you're gonna be.\" Dylan narrowed his eyes and squeezed tighter. Lifting his nineteen-year-old weakling brother into the air like this didn't even make the young teen break a sweat. He even was able to strut around as he held Justin up, his older brother's body swinging and his arms flailing helplessly way as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan Timothy Smith!\" Frank did his best to make his voice boom, though he heard the slight cracking in it, and he tried to conceal the trembling in his hands as he pointed towards his monster of a son. \"Young man, you put your brother down right this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan only sneered, ignoring his father and thrusting Justin up even higher, his thick arm extended nearly as far as it would go. Jerome would later swear that he heard a dark, menacing laugh coming from somewhere deep inside Dylan at this point, almost as if another being was possessing him, but no one else could confirm this. Whatever the case, there was no denying that Dylan truly was enjoying getting his revenge on his older brother, not just for hitting him with the gun, but for an entire childhood of bullying, teasing, and just being a dick in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the seconds passed, Justin's face began to turn purple, and his eyes started to roll back in their sockets. Sweating profusely, Davy knew that he had to do something to help his older brother survive against this brutal muscle beast, but he didn't know what he could do. His brother needed to be stopped, before someone got seriously hurt... or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of his eye, he spotted the gun, the thing that started this whole mess, lying near Dylan's feet. Justin must have dropped it in all the commotion that occurred since they had gotten hit, while they were trying to figure out what had happened. It almost seemed like something out of one of his comic books, Davy thought. Except that instead of his brother becoming a superhero that would help others with his strength, he had turned into an evil, almost-maniacal villain. If only there was a way to balance out Dylan's strength... Wait! Of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hulk of a brother took Justin's weakening body and slammed it against the wall, forming a large dent in it. The gun now lay behind him, and Davy knew that he only had one chance. Making sure that Dylan was focused on their older brother, Davy quickly ran up, bent over in one smooth motion, and grabbed the gun, dashing back away as quickly as possible. Dylan didn't even notice the movement behind him, too busy strangling the life out of Justin, who seemed to now be unconscious. Davy swallowed hard; it was now or never. He clasped the gun with both hands, attempting to aim it as best as possible. Closing his eyes, he whispered, \"Please,\" and then squeezed the trigger. But who did he aim it at?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Davy had always been a very bright boy, with an I.Q just shy of the genius range.  He got straight A's in school without much trouble and tended to slaughter even his buddy Benny at strategy board games.  When it came to problem-solving and logical reasoning there was no one better in the entire Douglas family.  Given Davy's admittedly impressive intellect, there are those who would condemn him vociferously for what he did next, but that isn't really fair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember the situation: Davy had just witnessed a stunning transformation which all of his education told him was impossible.  His twin brother, the person he was closest to and loved most in the world, had been turned into an immensely muscular super-boy and had immediately started thrashing their oldest brother, acting like a megalomaniac in a roid rage.  It was clear no one in the family had even a prayer of stopping the fantastic physical powerhouse Dylan had become and Davy was terrified that Dylan really would kill Justin.  Shocked, confused and frightened, the frantic fifteen year-old had thought only of balancing the equation, of introducing an equal and opposite variable which would cancel out his rampaging sibling.  He wanted to turn into a real-life superhero and save everyone.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't for one nanosecond occur to Davy to question what psychological effects the ray would have on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavy heard Amber scream his name, but he couldn't answer her. The change was far from painless; every part of his body ached abominably and he felt the sharp prickling of pins and needles all over.  The gun slipped out of his nerveless grasp, dropping to the carpeting.  His eyes were tightly clenched as he strove silently against the agony.  Still the unmistakable sound and feel of his shirt ripping apart and fluttering away from his expanding form pleased and comforted Davy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the pain and falling asleep sensation stopped he opened his eyes, only to find everything was blurry.  His racing heart sped up even further as he wondered whether a side-effect of the device had further impaired his eye-sight.  Then he realized what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching up with his left hand he removed his black-framed glasses and the world snapped into focus.  He could see so clearly now; he estimated he had at least twenty-twenty vision.  He would never need these nerdy \"extra eyes\" again.  With considerable pleasure and only one hand David effortlessly crush his glasses into a twisted lump of metal and shattered lenses.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up he found himself the new center of attention.  The only one not looking at him was Justin, who had gone entirely limp in Dylan's grasp.  His throat was still encircled by his younger brother's hand, but Dylan had dropped his right arm down and Justin's lower body was now sprawled bonelessly across the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the rest of the family and Jerome stared wide-eyed at David, he and Dylan locked gazes.  Not since babyhood had the twins looked so identical: two flaxen-haired, physically perfect paragons of teenage might and muscle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Davy!\" their father stuttered, trying to take control of this insane situation.  \"Make Dylan let your brother go!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only response was a look of utter contempt from both twins.  David started toward his father and Amber, Jerome and Debby scrambled to get out of his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow dare this pathetic excuse for a man try to tell him what to do, David raged inside!  Didn't the idiot understand how much things had changed?  He wasn't puny little Davy anymore; he was an iron-muscled Adonis who was undoubtedly one of the strongest men on Earth!  He was so physically superior to his stick-figure father that Frank giving him orders was like an ant trying to command a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, old man!  I could snap you in two like a twig!\" David boasted, noting with pride that even his voice had gotten much deeper and more manly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank qualied before the menacing muscle-boy, only increasing David's contempt for him.  With one lightning-quick movement David seized the man, jerked him overhead and flung him into the nearest wall.  Amber and Debby screamed and rushed to the crumpled, moaning, former head of the family.  Jerome, by contrast, turned and sprinted for the front door.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring all of the insignifcant insects David turned to the only other important person in the room: Dylan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You undersand now, don't you, bro?\" Dylan asked with a brotherly grin.  \"You finally get what it means to be strong, to be muscular.  We're the ultimate apha males, David!  We can do whatever we want, and no one can stop us!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t want to really pull the trigger, but he accidentally did. It didn\u2019t take much either; only touched slightly made the gun shoot the strange blue light out of its barrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the shock, Justin dropped the gun on the ground. He looked at his now empty hands and slowly started to tilt up his head. Did he hit someone? Maybe he didn\u2019t\u2026? But what if he did, would he have killed that person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin\u2019s eyes stared up in the same direction as he only just saw the blue beam travel. There, right in front of his gaze, was his best buddy Jerome. His entire body was radiating a faint blue color, only for a fraction of a second. He didn\u2019t have a clue what hit him as he was still enjoying his steak and had not paid attention to his buddy shooting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther members of the family, who had seen a strange blue beam shoot right in front of their eyes, had started to look up and join Justin\u2019s gaze at Jerome on the far side of the table. Especially Amber, who had been eyeing up Jerome\u2019s arms when he suddenly started radiating blue, looked at Jerome with her mouth open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome, putting a piece of steak in his mouth and chewing it, noticed everybody looking at him with surprise in their eyes. He looked around the table and asked very dry: \u201cWhat?!?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Great steak, mr. Smith!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank, having also noticed what had just happened, shook his head to get back to reality. \u201cOh\u2026uhm\u2026thanks! Glad you like it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026you don\u2019t feel anything? Any different?\u201d Justin continued to query.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, why should I?\u201d Jerome replied still unknown to what hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you didn\u2019t notice it?\u201d Dylan asked, who had been staring at Jerome\u2019s chest, the point of impact of the blue beam, for the last minute or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome looked down at his chest. He scratched it with his right hand as he felt an itch, causing his slightly developed pec to twitch as he moved his arm. Then he looked back up at Dylan, as there was nothing on his chest to see. \u201cNoticed what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I shot you\u2026\u201d, Justin added as he picked up the gun from the floor, \u201c\u2026with this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, you shot me?\u201d Jerome asked slightly offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2026I just\u2026I accidentally pulled the trigger\u2026\u201d Justin defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what is it? Did you hit me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it hit you straight in the chest\u2026\u201d Dylan added, who was still staring at Jerome\u2019s chest. He could swear he saw something move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome scratched it again. \u201cWell\u2026since it didn\u2019t kill me, and I don\u2019t feel anything, it must have been something innocent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right\u2026\u201d Justin said as he inspected the gun for any inscriptions or clues that could lead him to an answer. He found nothing, so he decided to put the gun back in the box and place the box on the ground under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the entire ordeal seemed to be about nothing, the family calmed down from the shock and continued with the dinner. Jerome, having already downed two steaks, took a third\u2026and a fourth. He was extra hungry. Every now and then, however, he had to scratch the strange itch on his chest. He dismissed it as a mosquito bite or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jerome was cleaning his mouth with a napkin after he had finished his fourth steak, and the rest of the family had already finished eating for the last 10 minutes, Justin padded his buddy on the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you keeping all those steaks? You must be bloated!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Justin\u2019s surprise, however, Jerome\u2019s stomach didn\u2019t feel bloated at all. Through the fabric of his wife beater he could clearly feel hard ridges of muscle. Out of shock he removed his hand as he looked as his buddy\u2019s stomach. Faintly through the tight fabric, he could definitely see abs forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! Stop flexing your stomach\u2026I know you work out\u2026\u201d Justin said as he knuckle-punched his buddy on the shoulder. It too felt harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome looked at his buddy in surprise. \u201cWhat do you mean? I\u2019m not flexing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, surprised by the hardness of his buddy\u2019s skin, looked at him with disbelief. \u201cOh really, you don\u2019t call this flexing?\u201d he said as he grabbed the bottom of his buddy\u2019s wife beater and pulled it up slightly to reveal his stomach. A perfectly defined six-pack appeared from under his buddy\u2019s wife beater, just as dark brown as the rest of his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber, who was still seated opposite Jerome, couldn\u2019t believe her eyes as her brother had exposed Jerome\u2019s abs. She had always wanted to see Jerome shirtless; this was a good start. She let out a soft \u201cwow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, just feel it. As sorry as I am to break it to you, but this is my stomach not flexed\u2026\u201d Jerome said as he grabbed Justin\u2019s hand and placed it on his stomach. Justin, amazed by the hardness, felt that he was telling the truth. He could dent the abs if he pressed and he felt they weren\u2019t as hard as they could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how\u2026you were never this ripped\u2026\u201d he started asking, when his buddy intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHIS is what they feel like flexed!\u201d Jerome explained as he started tightening his stomach. Justin\u2019s hand felt the muscles underneath the skin react instantly, growing bigger and harder within a mere second. The crevices between his individual abs grew deeper as his abs became more defined, more visual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut..but\u2026how\u2026\u201d Justin\u2019s reaction began as he started feeling up his buddy\u2019s stomach all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber, not able to contain herself any longer, let out a loud \u201cWOW! OH MY GOD!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the family, who were doing their own thing, looked up at Amber and followed her stare towards Jerome\u2019s hard, clearly defined six-pack. They all looked at it with amazement and jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome visually enjoyed all the attention as a large smile appeared on his face, exposing his shiny white teeth. \u201cYou see, Justin, what did I tell you? You need to start working out to get the attention you deserve\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026but\u2026Jerome, have you looked at yourself already?!\u201d Justin stammered as he took in the rest of his buddy\u2019s body. Somehow, it seemed larger; he seemed to fill his wife beater with more muscle than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome looked down at his buddy\u2019s face, who was inspecting his body with care, as he continued to look down at his own physique. He knew he had a more defined physique than Justin, but what he saw even blew HIS mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis six-pack, still exposed for everyone to see, looked extremely cut and dry. Every individual ridge of muscle was clearly visible with zero body fat. On either side of his abs, he could see obliques he didn\u2019t even know he had before. He tilted the upper part of his torso to tighten them, not believing his own eyes. With his free left hand, he felt this ridges of his obliques and abs over and over again. \u201cBut\u2026but\u2026\u201d he stammered as he couldn\u2019t quite understand where this definition came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jerome felt his own stomach up and down, Justin looked on at the arm attached to his friend\u2019s hand. Jerome always had bigger arms than Justin; and he was constantly reminded of this by him. But the arms he saw now were even larger than Justin could remember. Without thinking he grabbed Jerome\u00b4s upper left arm with his right hand and squeezed it to check its hardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDUDE!! Look at these!\u201d he yelled still holding on to the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome, shifting his focus from his obliques to his upper arm, screamed from joy, surprise and satisfaction. \u201cWHAT THE FUCK!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a fist of his left hand and flexed the arm as hard as he could. Justin was still holding on to his upper arm, but as Jerome\u2019s biceps grew his hand was pushed open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re huge and rock-hard!!\u201d Justin concluded. He let go of his buddy\u2019s arm, who in return started to feel up his upper arm with his own hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to me?!\u201d he questioned as he felt the hardness of his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire family had been looking on in awe, as Jerome discovered his newly grown physique. The girls looked on in admiration, while the boys all looked on in jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould this be the gun I shot you with?!?\u201d Justin remarked as he suddenly remembered what had happened to his buddy right before the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think?!?\u201d Jerome queried as he moved his hand over other parts of his body to inspect if they had become bigger. His chest, his shoulders, his thighs\u2026every single part of his physique had increased in size considerably. He felt his clothes hugging tighter around his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I can think of\u2026\u201d Justin said as he looked at the box with the gun inside under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jerome, still seated in the chair behind the table, noticed his reflection in one of the windows of the house. Curious to see what he looked like, he stood up and walked over to the window. The family looked on as he walked much different than before. He was definitely wider, he had a certain swagger and his arms hang further away from his body as his back was spread out more. The wife beater, which had already looked good on him before, was filled to the max with much more muscle than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he stood in front of the window, giving him a perfect full-size reflection of his body, he took off his wife beater completely and looked in awe at his own shirtless torso staring back at him. He couldn\u2019t help but flex some of his new muscles similarly to what a body builder would do, just to show their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang\u2026I\u2019m ripped!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued performing some body building poses he noticed something in the reflection move. The lid of the box under the table was opened and someone was holding the gun in his hands\u2026</span></div></div>",

Luckily, Dylan fills in that spot. \u201c\u2026He shot you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerome looks at Dylan, raises an eyebrow and looks back at Justin again. \u201cWhat\u2019s he talking about?!?\u201d Then he noticed Justin still holding the strange toy gun in his hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve shot me with that?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Justin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s to worry? It\u2019s a toy! Come on\u2026nothing happened!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut a blue beam came out of it, shooting you in the chest!\u201d Davy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then it\u2019s probably a very expensive, elaborate toy gun. Maybe it\u2019s a laser pointer\u2026who knows!\u201d Jerome said as he didn\u2019t understand why everybody was looking at him so strangely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re really feeling fine then?\u201d Justin asked one final time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, buddy! Nothing to worry about!\u201d, Jerome said as he scooped up some more potatoes, \u201cThe dinner is really nice, Mrs. Smith! You\u2019ve outdone yourself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy thank you Jerome, would you like some more gravy?\u201d Debby said a bit blushing from the compliment. She dismissed the entire incident from happening and happily switched the subject of the conversation; as did everybody else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, however, wasn\u2019t entirely sure if they should act as if nothing had happened. He looked one more time at the gun in his hands and got a bad vibe from it. \u201cLet\u2019s keep this one safe, for now\u2026\u201d he said to himself as he went inside to hide the gun in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he came back, the entire family was discussion the weather, sports, comics and everything else besides the shooting incident. They were enjoying their dessert when Justin decided to join again. He looked strangely at his best buddy, inspecting his entire body, especially his chest were the beam hit, but couldn\u2019t find anything out of the ordinary. Maybe Jerome was telling the truth; maybe nothing is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family finished dinner when the evening started to set in; it became dark. Jerome, promising his mother that he would be back home before dark, said goodbye and left. Justin decided to go back to his room to catch up on some of his homework. In reality, however, he booted up his laptop and went online to search for any background information on the strange looking gun. He found a German website with a small picture of a similar looking gun. Some words in the text were \u201cKraft\u201d, \u201cMuskeln\u201d, \u201cwachsen\u201d and when he Google Translated a piece of the text, he found out that the gun was developed during the Cold War in Eastern Germany to enhance German soldiers. The device was claimed dangerous and forbidden and was banned from the country. Few guns survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin scratched the back of his head as he looked at the gun. So if he understood the text correctly, the gun could give any human being more muscles and thus more strength. His best friend Jerome would experience gains in strength and muscle definition; he laughed at the idea. That would be absurd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting late, so he put the gun back in the box and placed it on the top shelf of his closet. Then he turned off his laptop, turned off the lights and went to bed.<br>\r\nThe next morning, Justin\u2019s alarm went off at 6am. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes as he slowly woke up. After a long, hot, refreshing shower he went downstairs for breakfast. His mother was already up, having prepared breakfast, and his father was in the shower. The twins and Amber were still asleep as they had to get up much later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast Justin went back upstairs to pack his bag for the day. He only had three classes, so he could pack light. As he put the books in his bag, the box on the top shelf of his closet caught his attention. He decided, just for fun, to pack the gun as well. Just at that moment, the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin ran downstairs, yelling that he\u2019d get the door. When he opened, Jerome was there\u2026</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Meet the Smith family; an ordinary suburban household of six whose lives are bound to drastically change, for the better or the worse, you decide. First, let\u2019s meet the family members:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank Smith \u2013 45 \u2013 152lbs \u2013 6ft1 \u2013 sales manager at canned food factory<br>\r\nFrank Smith is the father of the household with an important job at a local factory. He is extremely skinny for his height. His work consumes most of his time, as does his red-haired co-worker Vanessa. His little affaire might cost him his job, but Vanessa\u2019s sexiness keeps him from breaking up. The office-affaire is a closely guarded secret, even from his wife and children, until not long from now\u2026<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDebby Smith \u2013 43 \u2013 188lbs \u2013 5ft7 \u2013 librarian at local library<br>\r\nSomewhat chubby, dark haired, blue-eyed Debby Smith is the wife of Frank and the mother of four loving children. Whenever she isn\u2019t at home slaving away as a housewife, she spends her time as a librarian in the local library. It\u2019s a small job, on voluntary basis, but it keeps her from losing her mind if she stays at home all day. She has a secret crush on the hunky neighbor from across the street, Joe, but it hasn\u2019t led to anything serious yet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin Smith \u2013 19 \u2013 142lbs \u2013 5ft9 \u2013 sophomore student at college<br>\r\nJustin is an avid sports fan, only unfortunately for him merely a passive one. His tryouts for the college football, basketball and baseball teams have all let to disappointments: he was considered too small, too thin, lacking too much strength. Unfortunately for him he has his father\u2019s genes. He now spends his free time working at the local Wal-Mart, at the sports section no less, with his co-worker and best buddy Jerome. He wants to move out of the house, but his budget prevents him from doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber Smith \u2013 17 \u2013 132lbs \u2013 5ft6 \u2013 senior year of high school<br>\r\nAmber Smith is the silent wallflower of the family. She inherited the same chubby features as her mother, although her hair is perfectly straight and dark. As the middle child, she always gets the blame. At school she is the same silent, awkward type with a very small group of friends. All she ever wants is get noticed, both at home as well as at school. She has a crush on Jerome, the hunky best friend of her big brother, but Jerome hardly knows she exists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan and Davy Smith \u2013 15 \u2013 138lbs and 121lbs \u2013 5ft9 \u2013 twins \u2013 high school sophomores<br>\r\nThe two youngest members of the family, Dylan and Davy, are twins, but they couldn\u2019t be more different. Dylan is an active, over energetic, 15-year-old with a passion for sports and a fit body to support it, while Davy is considered a typical book worm. He is an avid comic book fan and knows how to quote ever issue of Superman ever released. He wears similar dark-rimmed glasses as Clark Kent. From the faces you would see they are twins, but from the neck down they are completely different. While Davy spends his free time in the library and at the comic book store, Dylan is training in a nearby gymnasium to become a better gymnast. He wishes to run with the pros, but he misses serious strength to complete the exercises perfectly, all the fault of his lackluster gene-pool. Although the twins think of each other as either \u201ccomplete nerd\u201d or \u201cknucklehead jock\u201d, they do love each other in the end. Even during their many arguments and disagreements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you have met the main family, it is also good to know that there are some important supporting characters to make the story more interesting. A small selection: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe Daniels \u2013 good looking, single, neighbor from across the street<br>\r\nVanessa Raspberry \u2013 good looking, single, co-worker at Frank\u2019s work<br>\r\nJerome Fillmore \u2013 Justin\u2019s African-American best friend, classmate and co-worker at Wal-Mart<br>\r\nBrittney Michaels \u2013 Amber\u2019s best friend and classmate, has a hunky big brother<br>\r\nBrett Michaels \u2013 Brittney\u2019s big brother who is a class ahead at the same college of Justin and Jerome, quarterback of the college football team, helped the coach to prevent Justin from joining the team<br>\r\nVlad Petrovsky \u2013 gymnastics buddy of Dylan, parents from Czech Republic, but born in America, who is selected for the national team<br>\r\nBenny Williams \u2013 comic book nerd and best buddy of Davy<br>\r\nDwayne Fillmore \u2013 Jerome\u2019s father, a former wrestling champion, now used car salesman, big guy<br>\r\nHope Fillmore \u2013 Jerome\u2019s mother, good friends with Debby, slim and trained physique<br>\r\nKim Surname \u2013 the hot babe of Justin and Jerome\u2019s class, both guys have a crush on her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s springtime in California when the lives of the Smith family are about to change forever. Every member of the family is in one way or another not happy with their looks and appearance; they all wish to be a bit bigger, a bit stronger or a bit taller. Little do they know that their wishes are about to come true when a strange parcel arrives on the front porch. It\u2019s up to you to decide who grows first and what consequences that has on the rest of the story! Enjoy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGround rules<br>\r\n- No sex, no vore, no deaths, no anthros, no transformations, no body swap, no giants, no giantesses<br>\r\n- Muscle growth and size growth only, but keep it believable. Not bigger than 300 lbs and taller than 7ft. Both male and female can grow<br>\r\n- Make chapters longer than at least one sentence or paragraph. Try to avoid the \u2018question chapters\u2019; chapters which contain only one question to advance the story<br>\r\n- I retain the right to alter or delete chapters if they do not fit the story line or follow these ground rules<br>\r\n- Feel free to introduce new characters, but try to stay centered on the main character's family</td>",
