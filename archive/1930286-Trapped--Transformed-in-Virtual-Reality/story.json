He'd spent rather a long time tweaking it to suit him. He felt protective about it, and didn't like the others even asking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mum and dad, allowed him his privacy. They suspected that his beach game was filled with top-heavy women and probably only one male. Michael would have blushed had he known how accurately their guesses were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd taken his yearbook pictures, and aged them up slightly. Subtly changing his own features, an extra inch here and there, a squarer jaw and a more muscular chest and physique in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were familiar, but he worked to give them more curves, and disguise their faces. He smirked to himself, he'd always know whose face was the source for a particular swimsuit bimbo. Even if her curves were enhanced, the women were rather uniform. Michael had a type, and largely stuck to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women varied between a B-cup and D-cup, the range of clothing available was rather limited.... It was meant to be at the beach and not the mall, so he only allowed the women ...his women... swimwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael would have been deeply offended had he known that Jessica had investigated his little world. She'd prepared a little surprise for him when he next entered. It was only fair she thought, little realising how much she was altering based upon her own insecurities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael put his coffee down on the table beside the bio-bed, and prepared to enter 'The Beach'. He slipped the goggles over his eyes, and felt the drugs fill his veins, stopping him from twitching and spasming as he acted out his motions. The familiar warmth spread through his muscles, as his vision faded to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke to feel the heat of the sun on his body, and blinked as he opened them. Shading his eyes, he looked around from his position on the towel. There was some fine pussy on display... and he sat up to better admire them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he knew something was wrong... There was a heavy shifting from his chest, and he looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fap.to/images/full/46/695/69510355.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fap.to/images/full/46/695/6951035...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt herself start to panic and that was when a shadowy figure blocked out her sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, <i>Michaella</i>.\" They pronounced her name with enough emphasis that Michael blushed, the stranger knew who she truly was.</span></div></div>",

You're just doing this to spite me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my machine, I can use it to spite you if I want,\" he says. He reaches for the basket of game cartridges that sits beside the console, but you snatch it away, dancing out of reach. Ryan glares at your furiously. Having spent five minutes strapping and wiring himself into the headset and body sensors, he'd need to spend the same amount of time extracting himself from them if he wanted to chase after you. \"Mike, gimme the games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou linger outside the range of Ryan's leash, holding the games to your chest. \"Look, you have a new headset, let me use your old one.

He glowers, mumbles something under his breath, and tosses you his old headset. It is an early model, bulkier than his and fitted for his head, so it's a bit of a loose fit. You screw it down to your scalp as tight as you can. The bundles of thick wires dangle down about your ears, feeding into a single cable almost as wide as your wrist. Plugging it into the Player Two slot of the console sends static crackling through your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your first time, you choose a game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flick through the basket.

You choose that one, and he takes it and slots it into the console, which comes alive with the loud hum of internal cooling fans. He adjusts the slim metal headset on his head and reclines on the bed, and you realise this is it, your moments away from your first taste of VR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice, you can help me conquer Tamriel,\" he says, plumping his bed cushions and settling his head in them. \"Slight tip - get comfortable, otherwise you'll wake up with a hell of a crick in your neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie yourself out on the floor, but find it hard resting your head with the bulky apparatus screwed to your skull. \"Can I get a pillow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he says flatly. \"Now when you first log in, it's going to prompt you to choose a Daedric Prince and a race.

Try not to bite your tongue off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spinning circle of lights on the front of console counts down. Five... four... three... two... one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're aware of a sudden searching pain in your skull, but only for a fraction of a second before it is torn away, along with every other sensation. You're blind, deaf, unable to feel any part of your body, just floating in an abyss. The seconds seem to crawl past. Has something gone wrong? What if you were stuck like this. What if the headset burned out your brain - you've heard a rumor that sharing headsets could do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never been happier to hear the voice of Patrick Stewart, as the intro finally starts to run. Seems they got him back for the sequel. You listen to the narration of Uriel Septim, as the familiar music swells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight slowly filters into the darkness. You are standing in some sort of circular chapel made of pale stone. Statues of the daedric princes are spaced in alcoves around in the room. You realise that the game is asking you to choose a class, but for a long time you simply stand, staring at your hands, the floor, the sunlight filtering through the stain glass window, lancing through the air smoky with sweet incense. Beyond the walls, you can hear the sounds of a city, people going about their business. The experience is far better than anything you could have hoped, and you struggle to convince yourself that right now you're laid out on your brother's bedroom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember that Ryan is waiting for you to get him out of jail, and you scan the statues, searching for the Daedra to which you must swear fealty to.</span></div></div>",

Worship of Malog Bal grants bonuses to persuasion and strength, as well as restoring health and stamina after each kill.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hideous stone visage of the animalistic daedra leers down at you. You can't help but wonder what perks the other princes offer, but you promised your brother you'd choose whatever character he wanted. Dutifully kneeling at the feet of the statue, you feel a hot wind on the back of your neck, accompanied by a surge of strength in your limbs. Before you can rise, the game freezes, and a vision of a generic Imperial male appears before your eyes. There are options to change the race, gender, and appearence, but knowing that your brother will never let you play again if you waste several hours adjusting the settings on your face like usual while he rots in prison, you simple hit accept. The vague outline of your body coalesces into a definite shape - tall, broad shouldered and muscular, with lightly tanned skin. You're wearing a loose, dirty brown cloth shirt and pants, but other than that have nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting a few gold coins scattered at the foot of the statue, you grab them and stuff them into your pockets. Might as well make a start looting your way to success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice behind you nearly makes you jump out of your new skin. \"There are few who still pray to the Old Gods in this age, even fewer to such a cruel and callous God as Malog Bal. No matter. Perhaps only a dark god will see us through these dark times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hooded figure is walking slowly towards you across the chapel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the start of the main quest line? Because it is, I'm busy. I need to go bail my brother out of prison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure tilts his head slightly, confused by your statement. \"A quest? Aye, I have need for an adventurer such as yourself, it's true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head for the door. \"No, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... the fate of the world... your destiny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe some other time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but without your assistance, there won't be another time, brave adventurer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quest giver's pleas for help are soon lost among the hubbub of the city streets as you push open the chapel doors and step outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" The Imperial City is far larger and grander than you remember, the wide avenued streets stretching to your left and right as far as you can see. The White Gold Tower rises above the tiled roofs, stretching half way to the sky. It is far busier, the cobbled streets thick with NPCs going about their business. With some trepidation, you step forward, and are soon making your way through the thronging AI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, can anybody point me in the direction of the jail?... Hello...? Anybody?... Are you guys even listening to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI steadfastly ignores you, or when they do notice you it is only to give you a wide bearth. You quickly learn that there is none of the bowing and scraping you've become familiar with from the previous titles. No 'It's the hero of Kvatch!' or 'The Dragonborn!'. To them you're just a lowly peasant dressed in filthy rags. Merchants clutch at their coin-purses at the sight of you, and women cross the street to avoid you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Imperial City Watchmen sneers down his nose at you, but points you in the right direction nonetheless. You walk north, past the high walls of the Imperial palace, through the market district, avoiding the horse-and-carts that clatter along the cobbles, until you spot a set of gallows set away from the street and the Imperial Prison not far from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo guards in shining plate armour stand guard either side of the entrance, and you hesitate for a moment before stepping between them. They watch you keenly, gauntleted hands resting on the hilts of their swords, but let you pass. <i>I'm the PC here,</i> you think somewhat indignantly as you walk meekly up the prison steps. <i>They should be afraid of me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turnkey is a rather well-fed Imperial sat at a desk, cutting apart a leg of roast ham with a dagger. A heavy bundle of keys poke out beneath his generous belly. \"Speak,\" he says gruffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to visit my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBegrudgingly, the jailor gets to his feet, brushing the detritus of his dinner from his tunic. \"I'll have to stay with you in there, of course,\" he grumbles. He pulls up his sagging belt, slides his dagger into its sheath, and waddles to a heavy wooden door. Unlocking it, he leads you down into the cells below. The smell of unwashed bodies and urine meets your nose.There are rows of cells. Most of them seem occupied with thin figures slumped against the bars. \"What's his name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh.\" Your mouth hangs open dumbly, and you curse Ryan for not giving you the name of his character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No name, huh? Close to your brother, were you?\" the jailor mutters dubiously. \"Well it's your lucky day. We've only got one Imperial citizen in today.\" He stops at a cell and kicks his boot against the rusted iron of the door frame. The loud rattle stirs the prisoner from his bed of straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prisoner is bone thin, bald, with skin like old leather and a mouth empty of teeth. He stares at you with bloodshot eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Ryan, you look <i>terrible</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike! Over here, dumbass!\" a voice calls to you. Turning, you see a prisoner beckoning to you from one of the cells.</span></div></div>",

Your new eyes slowly adjust to the darkness but you're amazed at how realistic it all feels, right down to the damp chill associated with being underground and the ever so slightly slick feeling of the paver stones covered in condensation. Even your peasant clothes feel like true clothing than just part of a video game. As you approach the final cell and strain to see in the darkness, you can only imagine what they'll be able to do with this technology in ten years. And then every thought in your head vanishes as your eyes finally adjust to the darkness as your brother leans forward against the bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, you think it's your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you is a buxom woman clad in only the barest of cloth. Her face is incredibly sexy, her cheekbones high and framed by flowing golden blonde hair Her eyes are wide and sapphire blue, filled with anxious energy that seem to make them sparkle even in the low light. Her lips are full and a delicious shade of red, and you can see her shivering in the cold dungeon, causing her incredible breasts to jiggle uncontrollably. You only have a moment to take in her form before her slender hand grabs your tunic and pulls you against the bars of her cell. You know immediately that despite her sexy body, your brother isn't just a weak barmaid, she's a Nord warrioress, and you suddenly feel very small despite her only being an inch taller than you. Suddenly you feel those delicious lips pressed against yours, and you take some small amusement from the way your brother's eyes are clenched shut as tight as they can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jailer makes a move towards the both of you, but eases back as he sees the two of you liplocked. He smiles lewdly, but his ogling is interrupted as two other prisoners begin to yell at each other, and he hustles as quickly as his portly frame can to break apart the conveniently timed fight.Your brother peeks out from his grimace with one eye and quickly pulls out of the kiss, a disgusted look on her face. She rubs her face with a free hand and then fixes you with a deep smolder that you guess is your brother trying to scare you. Instead it just looks sexy as hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell have you been doing?\" She whispers, her voice husky and heavily accented like all Nords, \"I've been waiting in here for you for days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I came right here after watching the intro and making the character you wanted me to make!\" You whisper back, trying to keep your eyes locked on hers and not drift down into the more than ample busom that is directly below your face. Suddenly you're being pulled even tighter against the bars, and you think that you may have said the wrong thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell did you do that?! Time passes differently for players in instanced areas! It's been three days for me! I've been stuck in this damn fridge for three days keeping porkbelly up there from coming in here with his friends and porking me! I give you one job and you still manage to screw it up!\"Your brother pushes you back away from the bars and points a slender, yet muscled arm towards the guards at the entrance of the dungeon where the jailer is berating the two prisoners that had distracted him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go use the ability and convince them to let me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last glance at the angry beauty that is your brother, you march towards the jailer, desperately trying to think of a good story to let your brother off the hook.

And you both seemed to enjoy that kiss far more than any brother or sister should, especially given that she's a Nord and you're an Imperial.\" The jailer says in a calm, voice that seems to carry down through the cell block as he calls your bluff, and you feel your sense of bravado vanish in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there sputtering like an idiot before the guard grabs you by the scruff of your scruffy neck and hauls you out of the cell block. You hear your brother's voice ring out over the sudden clamor of the other prisoners, but you can't tell what he's saying before you're through back at the prison entrance, with the large wooden door closing with a heavy thud against it's frame. Suddenly you're pushed forward towards a chair and you barely manage to catch yourself on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit\" The jailer says from behind you and you hear his audible weight settling on his own chair. Your mind races for a plan, but the guard repeats the command and you feel compelled to follow it, feeling like a school child who just got reprimanded in front of the entire class as the jailer fixes you with a hard stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, whoever that woman is to you, she's broken enough of the Emperor's laws to have herself beheaded or hanged in public. But since she has caught several criminal scum for us in the past, the magistrates have seen fit to merely confine her to a cell until the middle of Frostfall. After which she'll be shipped back to Skyrim where she belongs, with penalty of death if she ever steps foot inside Cyrodil again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'The middle of Frostfall? How long is that? What is it now?' </i>You ask yourself, and instantly you know. Sun's Height, the Tamrielic analogue of July. Your brother was going to be stuck in this place for three months. And then exiled. Ryan was going to be pissed whenever you told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I could be willing to consider time served on account for...'good behavior' \" The jailer said as his bulbous lips twisted into a lecherous smirk. \"She'll still be sent back to Skyrim, but I'm sure that a four days in prison is better than four months...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe what you're hearing from an NPC from a video game. The level of detail was amazing and it was almost like you were speaking with a living, breathing person! Failed speech check or not,  this experience had been nothing short of amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've let your 'brother' know the terms of my deal, but until she sees reason I've no choice but to abide fully by the orders of the magistrates. Until then, I suggest that you do not come back here, or I'll take it as an attempt to help her escape, and you, a peasant, have no immunity from that punishment\" The jailer reaches up to his neck with a pudgy hand and scratches  under his second chin; a swift horizontal movement whose message is very clear to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send a messenger for you here in the city when she's being exiled to Skyrim. Or if something happens to her.\" The jailer raps on his desk with a pudgy fist twice, and the two guards from outside rush in instantly and grab you under both arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until then, good day, citizen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself hauled upwards adn backwards out of the flimsy wooden chair and the bright light of day temporarily blinds you as you're suddenly cast into the air, landing moments later on the hard cobblestone street. Pain flairs up and down your body but you climb back to your feet and dust yourself off. No broken bones in this body, but you're not looking forward to what your brother has planned when you both log off. Until you get your own, you realize that this could very well be your first and last chance to play in virtual Tamriel.<br>\r\nYou could always go adventuring on your own...Maybe your brother would appreciate it more it you busted him out of jail in grand fashion?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You spit on the ground near the orc's head and then wince as the action pulls at the wounds you'd sustained in the fierce battle. You could feel your heart pound in your chest the color had begun to drain from the edges of your vision, and the various arrows sticking out of your heavy armor suddenly felt like their archers had found their marks after all.<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and feel the magicka pool around you. With effort, you push both of your sore hands together and focus the energies into a powerful healing spell, and suddenly your body no longer feels near death. With your injuries heal, you get down to what had quickly become one of your favorite parts of the game: Looting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea how long you had been playing, once you had gotten the first short questline out of the way and were outfitted with your first set of proper armor, you'd stopped trying to keep track. Everything was so real, and there was just no getting over the adrenaline that pitched battle seemed to bring. Before you knew it you had already killed several rampaging dragons that had broken away from the Paarthurnaax's enclave to the north, romanced several barmaids and had faced enough giant spiders that you're pretty sure that you'd either conquered your arachnophobia, or made it a hundred times worse, you werent' sure. And then there had been this particularly epic fight in the mountains above Markarth, and from your vantage point on the peak you could see the trail of orc and Reachmen bodies scattered in their makeshift war camp. It had been a challenging fight, but so worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the armor off of the orc and set it aside while you pull your own armor off. Imperial plate had nothing against the exotic, bulky, and somewhat glowy orcish armor the warlord had been wearing. The outdated Imperial armor was probably the reason why you had almost died, but now you had a feeling you'd be unstoppable for the time being. Daedric armor was your goel, but you still had a ways to go before you could wear it. You finish looting the warlord and the nearby chest and end up tossing away your old boots and even your trusty mace in exchange for a larger hammer that was covered in runes and filled your muscled arms with an ethereal power that seemed familiar to the shrine of Molag Bal so long ago. It had been a good fight and a even better haul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but steadily you make your way down the mountain towards the distant city below. This would be your first time in Skyrim and you were excited to see what...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop in your tracks. Skyrim. You were in Skyrim. The place where they were going to send your brother after he got out of prison. The prison your were supposed to rescue him from. You think for a moment, trying to figure out how long you'd been adventuring, how many times you'd sped time forward by sleeping. <br>\r\nEventually a date crawls into your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n24th of Evening Star. Four days after the invocation of Molag Bal, the daedric prince you'd selected over six in-game months ago as your patron god. And two months after your brother was supposed to be exiled back to her 'home' province.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unsling your pack and rifle through the pile of letters you had received from various messengers. Not a single one of them had anything to do with your brother being released from prison, whether by waiting it out or by taking the other...option that was available to her. And then you recall what the jailer had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send a messenger for you here in the city when she's being exiled to Skyrim. Or if something happens to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd never gone back to the Imperial City after you'd left following the quest line and then getting lost in the endless adventure that this game had provided.  And since you'd never gone back to the city, the game never sent you a message. You'd essentially abandoned your brother to fend for herself. A cold dread, colder than the mountain air and snow combined, crept over your body as you forced yourself down the mountain and into Skyrim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to finish your personal quest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had taken you months to cross the massive province of Skyrim, searching every city, every town, every settlement for signs of your brother. With player tracking not being built into the game's programming nor this being a built in quest, you'd had to scrounge up information the old way by talking with NPCs and tracing leads, many of which had either lead you to dungeons for some side quest or simply went nowhere. You'd expected Ryan to make a name for herself as an adventurer in Skyrim, but there had been no tales of a beautiful warrior woman fighting the evils of the land. No tales of someone even claiming to be a man in a woman's body (Well, aside from the NPCs that had been zapped by the Wabbajack), or some angry woman just muttering about how her brother left her to die in prison. You'd even gone back to the Imperial City, only to find out that a random event had generated a riot a month ago and ended with the prison, the jailer and almost all of the records going up in flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you had come back to Skyrim, and while lodging in Whiterun had heard about a 'Dibella blessed' tavern wench on the far distant island of Solstheim. The one place that you'd forgotten about since playing Skyrim years ago. An isolated island that had been under the control of the first Dragonborn, but had been freed by another Dragonborn. In the time since the general main events of Skyrim, Solstheim had changed little. It was still largely covered in ash and it was still largely in control of the Dunmer, but the Imperials had re-established their presence on the island and was once again subject to Imperial and Skyrim law. And while this 'Dibella blessed' tavern wench was nothing more than the ramblings of a drunkard, it had been the one place in Skyrim that you had failed to look.<br>\r\nAnd now you were here. Your newish dwarven armor was coated in ash that was rapidly being replaced by snow as you stood in center of the small Skall village, having been directed there by the Dunmer and later, the Nords at the Thirsk mead hall had directed you towards the Skaal. The Skaal village had grown since you had last been here in the Dragonborn expansion for Skyrim, but it was still very small in comparison to most other villages you'd seen in Tamrie so far. It was still quite rustic, and the locals were not exactly being subtle about watching your every movement with suspicion. You took a deep breath of the cold, but not horribly cold, air and stepped forward into the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quiet inside, as you had expected. There were only two patrons that you could see, both sitting around the fire pit, their eyes following your every movement even as they drank from their large mugs. The innkeeper appeared to be busy readying the bar for the coming night, but even as he rearranged flasks of mead and check cleaned the nearby tables you could tell he was watching you as well. He made his way back to the long oak wood bar as you approached, a wary look in his eyes as he grasped a nearby rag and began scrubbing the inside of a mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello stranger, welcome to the Skaal inn. Can I get you anything? Maybe a warm drink before you get back on the road?\" His tone of voice and the words he used made it obvious, he didn't want you here. But you were a player, and you were no longer the buffoon who couldn't pass a speech check. You laid a heavy gauntleted arm on the bar and leaned in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to speak to your bar maid\" you said, your voice low, almost conspiratorial, but you could feel the power behind them. The irony that you were finally using your inherent abilities that your brother had planned out was not lost on you as you eyed the innkeeper as he looked you over, his eyes falling on the massive daedric axe that you had strapped to your back. His face blanched and you knew that you had him, long ago you had figured out that the game no longer simply did speech checks based on your speech skill. Instead the game was programmed to take into account the appearance of the character, the tone of voice used, and body and facial language. In essence, you truly had to be persuasive or intimidating for a speech check to work. If only you had known that when you tried to fast talk the jailer back in Imperial City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, may I, Uh, ask why?\" The innkeeper stammered, his programming obviously trying to maintain the appearance of negotiating when you already knew he would do what you wanted. You simply shrugged in your armor, the clank of the heavy dwarven plates and the creak of leather as your muscled frame flex within them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd appreciate the company\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh, I see. Just give me a, uh, one moment sir, please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the innkeeper hurriedly disappeared down into the cellar storerooms, where most of the inn staff typically lived at. You cast a glance towards the two patrons around the fire pit, and they quickly turned their attention fully to their mugs. You smiled inside your helmet, even after what had been almost a full year in this game you were still blown away by how realistic it all was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the creak of the storeroom door open and slow footfalls on the stairs. Soon you'd know if you'd found your brother or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crest of brilliant blonde hair rose up from behind the bar and as the body it belonged to came into full view, your eyes went wide.<br>\r\nIt was Ryan all right, but instead of the fierce warrior woman you'd been expecting (along with the eventual punch to the face), instead the woman before you was clad in a long flowing dress that still barely contained her breasts and curves. Especially the shockingly large one on her lower abdomen which was cradled protectively by two slender arms that contained none of the muscle mass that they had in prison. Her eyes were full of discomfort and worry, but still as blue as your remembered. She fixed your full-faced helmet with a stare and glanced backwards at the innkeeper who helped her up off of the last of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Ryan...but it couldn't be, could it? How could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted by the innkeeper as he stepped forward and presented her to you with a slight bow of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, this is my bar maid, Reianne. I hope that she meets with your satisfaction. Now if you'll excuse me, my other patrons needs some refills\"The innkeeper hurried away towards the fire pit, leaving you and the woman that was your brother alone by the counter. She fixed you with that same worried stare and you could not take your eyes off the large bulge that had taken residence where there had once been powerful female abs. And then she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...sir? I know my appearance might be misleading, but I am still capable of giving you...company. May I see your face, so that I may know you better?\" Her voice was soft, light, radically different than the husky voice that you had last heard in the Imperial prison. Your mind was just completely blown, it was all so much, so fast, and your epic personal quest had just been thrown a plot twist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh, well...\" You stammer as you try to find the words. Your hands seem to find their way towards the clasps of your helmet but you suddenly force them away and look around the tiny inn. \"Is there, uh, any place private we could go first? It's been a long, lonely road and the sooner I can find a proper bed, the better\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrestfallen is the only word that properly describes the expression of her face, and she points back towards the stairs. \"I...suppose we can use my room, if you'd like? You will have to help me however, sir, I am afraid that stairs are as dangerous to me right now as any bandit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod dumbly and take her hand in your armor plated ones, and slowly but surely you make your way downstairs, holding your brother's fragile form as delicately as you could before she leads you to a spacious room behind the wine casks. In one corner was a large bed, but to your surprise was fitted with actual cushions and cloth as opposed to the straw beds you'd seen in so many other inns. There was a large dresser in the other corner, and a table with several chairs next to it, with a vase filled with colorful flowers sitting directly in the center. In the far corner was a basin with jugs of water and what looked to be fresh cloth wrappings and other delicate, womanly things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother leads you to the bed and slowly settles down upon it, her eyes locking with you once more.<br>\r\n\"<br>\r\nPlease, sir, you must disrobe. Otherwise I am afraid that you may have to find company elsewhere\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment that you've been both hoping for and dreading for a in-game year is finally here, though you just cannot believe the circumstances it has occurred under. Your hands slide back up to the clasps in your helmet, and for what seem like the first time in forever, you slide it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan's blue eyes open wide as she...</span></div></div>",

Instead you small arms slide around your armored bulk and <br>\r\nyou look down in the crown of blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mike, I was so worried! I thought that you'd died!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" you stammer, but you're cut off as your brother...sister begins crying into your armor. You stand there for a few moments as she hugs you as tight as she can before you gently push her away. This is no way to do this. She looks up at you with a look of confusion and fear in her eyes, the watery blue orbs darting from you to the door, telegraphing that she's terrified that you're going to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you don't. Instead you undo the rest of the clasps in your armor and let the pieces clatter to the floor noisily and though you still tower over her, you at least seem a little less intimidating. At least you think, though you know that you have your fair share of scars and other war wounds that have been both admired and hated by NPC women. You stand there sheepishly in your undershirt and pants and give Ryan a weak grin, and she chuckles before hugging you once more.<br>\r\nShe soft and warm and almost weightless to your hulking warrior form, and you can't help but feel your cock stiffen as her breast push up against you. But then you feel the pregnant bulge and as gently as you can, you pick her up and lay her on the bed. She gives you a strange look that quickly passes as you settle next to her on the side of the bed. Your eyes look her up and down before you point at her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you as if you just asked the dumbest question on the planet. \"What do you mean 'what happened'? I took the jailer's offer after you left. It was either that or risk catching plague in that filthy pit. YOU never came back, and they couldn't find you in the city, so they sent me 'home'. Except my crimes followed me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink in confusion at her words. You never had found out the whole story as to why she had been thrown in jail in the first place. Ryan rolled her eyes and sighed dramatically, like how your mother sighed when your father did something dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that although the Imperials gave me a pardon, they also wanted to make sure that the exile was enforced. As since Nords value honor...well, you can imagine that not many people wanted to hire an ex-con. So I spent a couple of months waiting for YOU to show up in Whiterun, working in the Drunken Huntsman letting some damn elf fondle my ass before I finally was showing too much for him to ignore. And then I got kicked out, and let's just say there's as much a stigma against unwed pregnant women here as there is back home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take notice that she didn't say 'the real world', but let her continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used what gold to travel around looking for another job, but at that point I was showing too much that no one wanted a 'spoiled' bar maid\" She spit the last words out like they were poison, \"And then I remembered Solstheim. It was isolated, out of the way, I figured that maybe if I could just get away from the collective mass of ignorance that maybe, just maybe, I could live a comfortable life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm here now, we can just log out. I mean, it sounds like this character has been ruined for you...So we can just start over! We'll roll some fresh characters and go fight some dragons or something!\" You say hopefully, but the sad look on her face fills you with instant dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike...I can't. Something in the game broke, I tried logging out as soon as you got dragged away from me in the prison. That's what I was yelling at you, to log out so I could kick your butt, but I couldn't. And when I took the jailer's deal, well...I think I became part of the game\" There was a long silence as you stared at one another, your mind racing at what Ryan was implying. It was impossible. It had to be impossible. Didn't they take something like this into account when they made the game? They had to! Imagine the lawsuits they be getting because of this...And even worse how would mom and dad react?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, I...\" You start, but she shakes her head sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Reianne now, Mike. You saw the 'act' earlier, except it isn't really an act. It's just who I am now, just who the game expects and demands that I be. I can't explain it, it's just this...compulsion. I suppose that when I took the deal and it changed me from a player to a NPC. You see how weak looking I am, it's part of what happened.  As soon as they dropped me off at Falkreath I started losing skill points until I leveled out here. I think I'm like level five right now if now lower. But I can't pick up weapons and fight, I even tried to leave Skyrim to find you, but I couldn't.  And right now, I'm attracted to you even though you're my brother. Or were. It's just who I am now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leap up from the side of the bed and begin pacing around the room. \"This is impossible!\" You shout, to which Ryan...Reianne hurriedly shushes you, \"This has to be illegal, you can't just BECOME a computer program! This is a VIDEO GAME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReianne fixes you with a sad smile as she pulls herself upright. \"Virtual reality tech has it's dangers, Mike. I suppose that in your world, this'll be a case that helps move the technology along. It's not so bad. I'm pretty, I have a job, a home and a nice boss. Solstheim is really laid back, and the locals more or less accept me as one of their own. And I'll be a mom soon. What more could a woman want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're NOT a woman! You're not supposed to be pregnant! You're my brother!\" You say pleadingly even as she places a small hand on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike, I've been a woman for almost a year. I've had things that women are instinctively supposed to know put in my head. I don't know how to be a man anymore, and I'm looking forward to meeting and raising my child. You, mom and dad are going to have to let me go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there as she turns towards the basin and, as gingerly as she can, steps around most of your armor and begins washing her face as if nothing is wrong. But everything is wrong, and you've come too far just to watch your brother become a NPC.  A dark idea builds up in your head, you're a champion of Molag Bal. You have the power of persuasion on top of your racial ability. You could make her see reason...But you'll have to wait until tomorrow, you stupidly blew your Voice of the Emperor on the innkeeper, since you were so sure Reianne...Ryan would instantly want to log out. You watch as the woman your brother has become finish cleaning her face and turns to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I usually fix dinner, but since I'm so close to my due date Veignhar has just let me stay down here so I don't have to climb those damn stairs. He's not as good a cook as I am, but he does his best.  You might have to go yell for him to come down here, I'll just tell him you're a old friend and that should make him a little less terrified of you. You really do come off as a bit of a beast in your armor!\" She says as she waddles back through the maze of your armor and back to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod dumbly and exit back out into the storeroom. As soon as the door closes behind you, your plan solidifies in your mind, and you whisper \"I'm not an old friend. I'm your goddamn brother!\"<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit that dinner was decent. It was at least relaxing, even if Veighnar, the innkeeper, kept giving you nervous glances whenever he thought you couldn't see him. He also seemed to take up a bit of a protective posture, hovering over Ryan...Reianne whenever you got too close. It seemed that the intimidation effect your armor had was slowly wearing off. The older man had cooked some rabbits and though you'd grown used to the taste of less advanced food over the past in-game year, you'd certainly had worse. The inn was, now that you had had time to relax, actually quite cozy, and the inn had had a third room that Veighnar had simply been using as excess storage, but luckily had a spare cot. It was the standard straw affair compared to the actual beds that Reianne and he had, but you'd slept on the cold hard ground enough that you learned to appreciate any kind of bedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you couldn't get over how Reianne...Ryan acted. There was almost no trace of who she had been, the well-meaning, but still sort of an asshole, big brother who had hatched the crazy scheme that had started all this. Small holes of doubt began to appear in your plan. What if Ryan couldn't log out, even if you forced her to? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if it simply deleted her? What if all you went back to was a mindless body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if it worked, and she went back to a body and gender he no longer felt like she belonged in? Not to mention the fact that she seemed genuinely excited about the prospect of being a mother? There was no promise that, if what she said was true and her 'character' was no longer registered as a player, that if she was able to log out, that she'd be able to log in whenever she wanted and pick up this life. Could you really take that away from her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'But'</i> you hear the dark voice at the back of your mind say as you watch her waddle back into her badroom, '<i>What if the programming just vanishes when he logs out? What if he's trapped here and the game is trying to keep him trapped? You're his brother, it is your duty to save him!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you find your way towards your hastily prepared room, either way, you'll find out tomorrow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Baby is coming out backwards!\" An unknown voice calls out freezing you in place at what was just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReianne was having a baby... Reianne was having a baby right now...

The Kiddy games gotta be tossed out... and the popular ones too. You wanted to impress him with a strange pick. As he see's you set aside the obvious choices for the more obscure titles in his extensive collection, you notice him grin. Its working. You narrow it down to 3 choices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is one called \"Sword and Sorcery: The Shadow's Blade\" That you knew was a personal favorite of his, and very rare, being one of the oldest still playable in his collection. It was a tactical rpg where you had to command a colorful cast of characters around a fantasy battlefield. There was gear management, and magic management, and you had to talk to the character to keep morale up. Though it was single player he surely would be impressed if you could find success in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother one on the pile to consider was \"Toyventure\" a rather novel idea for a VR game that took a scan of the room you were in to let you play in a level based on your actual environment, with you shrunk down to the size of a toy figure. It was a little childish, but it was multiplayer, and you knew he had a soft spot for it, and you had heard it was a lot more adult than people would assume by the title, hearing a lot of controversy from its initial release, but it was hard to remember exactly what for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly was a game that you weren't sure what it was about. The name was scrawled across its box art in Japanese, and the box art had a picturesque watercolor painting of a tropical island scene with a great volcano looming in the background. You didn't know what this game's deal was, but you knew it had to be some kind of high art. Who knows you might be able to bluff it past him to make him think you were really cultured. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Experienz had gone to great lengths to make the virtual holiday feel just like the real thing. The reception area was a large, airy room with a glass facade that resembled the check-in desk of an airport. This led through into a waiting area made to look like the departure's lounge. Michael and his family sat on one of the long benches, waiting for their names to be called over the tanoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien fidgeted constantly; he was after all, only 5. Tugging at his mother's skirt, he whined plaintively. \"Just play with your games machine,\" Susan sighed exasperated. \"We'll be going in in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The batteries are dead!\" he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then go ask your father if you can play with his phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Mark, her husband, said bluntly. \"Not again. I've got important clients on there. If he breaks it again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give it him, dear,\" Susan said, and for the next few minutes at least Damien was quiet playing Angry Birds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael played with Rex, his dog, inside his pet carrier, stroking his fur through the bars. Though it was only going to be a short holiday (from the perspective of reality), none of the family had had the heart to put Rex in a dog home for the duration, as he always fretted and worried terribly. Jessica, his twin sister, chatted vacuously on her mobile to her friends. Ryan, Michael's older brother, sat with his head laid back over the top of the seat, his hoodie pulled over his eyes and his earphones in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anderson family, now departing,\" a feminine voice came over the tanoy. Grabbing their bags and elbowing Ryan in the ribs, the family moved on from the departure lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA peroxide blonde woman in a sky-blue, air hostess uniform greeted them in the next room, which looked more medical that transporational. The room was as stark white as her bleached smile, with a row of what looked like MRI scanners built into one wall. \"Hi and welcome to Experienz holiday! Are you ready for the trip of a lifetime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet we are!\" Mark crowed, rubbing his hands in glee. Even though the virtual experience was far cheaper than conventional holidays, he had still sunk several months pay into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! We just need to get your personality chips extracted and then we can begin!\" the woman chirruped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, this is... safe right?\" Michael spoke up hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! Experienz holidays is far and away the safest way to travel. In fact it's one hundred percent safe! Technically, we've never had a single fatality!\" she bubbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Technically\"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile wavered a little. \"...legally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit whining, Michael,\" Ryan grumbled, thumping his brother on the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you'd like a demonstration,\" the hostess said in a soothing voice and before he could resist she had plucked Rex's carrier from out of his hands. She placed it on one of the long beds inside the MRI-like scanners. Rex began to bark, but she pressed a button on the side of the machine, there was a bright flash of light, and Rex went suddenly silent, slumping limp to the bottom of his carrier. Out of the machine popped a small, plastic card about the size of an SD card. The surface of it was smoking slightly. \"Using this neural scanner, we're able to extract the personality of your dog onto a memory card,\" she explained, removing the card from the machine, holding it carefully between her thumb and forefinger. She carrier it over to an array of hundreds of slots linked to a bank of computers and pushed the card into one of the slots with a secure click. \"Then we use this machine to upload his personality into one of our many, custom-built, bespoke simulations that provide him with the most believable, immersive experience available. Over the course of a few days, he can experience weeks of happiness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens to his body?\" Michael asked, worried at the sight of his dog laying so still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's the best part! We upload personal fitness personalities into all of our bodies for the duration of your stay. While you holiday, they'll be exercising, eating healthily, and undergoing a full detox program. Not only are you getting a vacation, you're getting a tune-up too! When your time is up, we simply reprint your personality back into your body. Believe me, you're going to feel like a new man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was still concerned but Damien, unwilling to wait any longer, had already clambered into one of the machines and laid down, causing the rest of the family to follow him. Surrendering, Michael laid down with his head inside the body of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hostess moved along the row, zapping each family member in turn. When she got to Michael, she leaned down, giving him a view of her ample cleavage, and smiled reassuringly. \"Enjoy your trip,\" she crooned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Flash!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-hot fire seemed to run down every synapse in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael 'awoke' to find himself in a gigantic stone room. Before he could ask any question, his twin sister Jessica's voice said beside him, \"What is this? A church?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's be one crappy vacation,\" Ryan said popping up beside Jessica.  \"Yeah, church is boring.\"  Damien added in a pouty voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Damien,\" Michael's mother Susan said popped up by Damien and grabbing his hand as she looked around the stone room that seemed to be loading banners and rugs around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no church, this is a castle.\"  Michael's dad Mark said as he saw some thrones pop up at the end of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\"  Damien said running up to the smallest throne and hopping in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does this mean I'm a real life princess now?\"  Jessica said trying not to sound too excited.  Michael knew she was trying to play it cool, but he knew that being a princess was a dream of hers since she was a little girl, and he had to admit that being a prince did have it's appeal as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jessica had a glow about her, and as soon as the glow dissipated Jessica now was wearing flowing white and pink dress made for a princess.  Not only that but she seemed to have physically aged a year or two judging by her physical stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure looks like it,\" Mark said as he began to glow.  Soon he was dressed like a king, crown included, and now had a bit of a pot belly and a full beard on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one the family members went through a wardrobe change that was befitting of a royal family and even had minor physical changes that fit the role.  Damien now had long hair, Susan was now covered by so much fine clothing that she seemed to barely have any mobility, and Ryan was now very muscular.  Upon seeing this change Michael began getting excited as he soon felt a change and saw the glow surrounding him.  He was anticipating a lot more muscles much like Ryan but that didn't seem to be what was changing.  As the glow was dying down, before Michael could check himself out, he heard Ryan laughing.  \"Oh this is rich.\"  Ryan said pointing at Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\"  Michael said as he looked at himself and realized very quickly what he was laughing about.

You're a little shorter, at a little over 5 feet tall. You have a slim feminine figure, with a thinner waist and slightly wider hips. A pair of breasts are on your chest, looking about a large B-cup. Your hair is jet-black and flows like a waterfall down your back, long enough to touch the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour clothing is not as elaborate as your mom's or Jessica's, but is clearly just as fine. The dress you're wearing is primarily white, modest, and floor-length. The shoulders have a slight puffiness,  while the sleeves  get wider towards the end, being about 2 feet wide at the wrist. There is a gold lining on the arms just under the shoulders and on the end of the sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, you look like me!\" Jessica cries excitedly. Though her dress is different, and her hair is shorter, what you can see of yourself does look like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, yeah, you're a princess!\" Ryan chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" you ask aloud. Your voice is even high and soft, clearly feminine. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad considers, stroking his chin. \"I remember... in the contract, it said that our virtual bodies are changed to match the 'game' we're in, and our role in it. It said changes are random, but usually minor, but big ones can happen. Just... bad luck, it looks like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't want to be a princess,\" you grumble. \"Can't we change it? Or make a complaint?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't think so,\" your mom said. \"We all signed the agreement. And I don't think changing it is possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm stuck like this?\" you complain, pulling at the dress's skirt before dropping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, ornate doors appear on the opposite end of the room as the thrones, then open. A tall man with slick hair and a mustache and fancy clothes appears from behind the opening doors as the rest of the castle is formed. The man enters the room and bows before you and your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you arrive at last, your Majesties,\" the man says. \"As herald, I bid you welcome.\" He looks at each member of your family in turn. \"King Mark. Queen Susan. Prince Ryan. Princess Jessica. Prince Damien.\" He looks at you, and seems to freeze for just a moment before saying \"Princess... Serenity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serenity?\" you ask incredulously. <i>'That's the name it's using for me?'</i> you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe herald ignores your outburst. \"I shall go make the announcements, and your stewards and other servants shall arrive shortly. Pardon me.\" He then turns and walks out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after the herald disappears, Rex the dog appears next to you. You squat down and pet him, as he happily licks your hand and wags his tail. <i>'At least you recognize me and treat me the same,'</i> you think. But Rex starts to glow as well, just like everyone else did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like he gets a fantasy form too,\" your mom says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, what's he gonna be?\" Damien asks.</span></div></div>",

I understand you must be stressed after such a long journey.\" Right, the explanation in-universe for your sudden arrival was that the royal family was returning from a trip to foreign lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA maid, your \"lady-in-waiting\" in fact, showed you to your room, with Rex following behind in flight. It was large and luxurious; filled with everything a princess would want. Except, you weren't sure that <i>you</i> wanted such things. \"Er, milady,\" you said, not sure how to address your own servant, \"what is your name again?\" \"Rochelle, your highness.\" \"Rochelle; could you, ah, help me get ready for dinner?\" You were embarrassed to ask, but if you were going to be a princess, you'd need someone to help you navigate things like makeup and dresses; and you were <i>not</i> going to do something as embarrassing as asking your sister for help. She'd never let you live it down. \"Of course, your highness!\" Your maid exclaimed, and quickly began work doing your hair and makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as King Mark was heading to his room he was stopped by the Royal Chancellor, named Theodore, who explained, \"your Majesty, while you were away the Elves delivered an ultimatum; surrender our lands or go to war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark nodded. <i>So this must be what the brochure meant when it promised medieval fantasy politics simulation.</i> \"That sounds bad. What can we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sire,\" the Chancellor replied, \"I doubt you wish to give up our kingdom, so I see only two choices. Either we go to war alone, or we arrange a marriage between one of your family to one of the neighboring kingdoms' royal families in order to gain allies. But, you are the King and the decision is yours alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was now conflicted. He didn't want to lose the war; who knows how realistic this simulation gets. But, on the other hand, could he really send one (or possibly more) of his children off to be married?</span></div></div>",

The men to the Southeast, in the kingdom of Salisbury lie next to the border of both our land and the Elven Kingdom. I would advise negotiating arrangements with both.\" Mark nodded, unsure of all this political strategy that was clearly above his pay-grade. \"Make it so, then.\" \"Of course sire,\" the chancellor responded, \"I'll send the messengers at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, you came to the dining room for the feast, dressed in fine silks with your hair in a long french braid and your face made up. As you walked in, your sister giggled with excitement. \"You look so pretty Micheal! Or, I mean, Serenity.\" You couldn't help but blush. \"I-it's not like I'm enjoying this! But if I'm a princess I have to look the part...\" Your brother Ryan busted out in laughter at this. \"Ha! I knew it! You just wanted to play dress-up; I bet this wasn't an 'accident' at all 'princess'!\" \"Now now,\" your mother interrupted, \"it isn't nice to tease. Let's just get through dinner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the feast went on, your family returned to lively chatter and mostly forgot about your... gender issues. Your dad, however, was strangely silent with a distant look in his eye. Finally, as dinner came to a close he stood up and made an announcement. \"Everyone, I have some information about this simulation that will effect everyone. Apparently, our kingdom will soon be invaded by Elves in some kind of war.\" With this, everyone exchanged worried looks around the table. Jessica seemed especially nervous. \"We don't have to kill do we? And we're not in danger?\" Your father bowed his head and replied, \"I'm not sure. I hope not. In order to prevent that, I'm going to make alliances with nearby kingdoms. This means I will have to arrange marriages between some of you and their royal families.\" \"WHAT?\" Your sister balked at the question. \"There has to be another way! Can't we just end the simulation?!\" Your father sadly shook his head. \"I'm afraid not. We signed a contract stating we'd see this simulation through to it's end.\" While your sister was starting to cry, your brother began to laugh. \"So I get married to some hot princess right? And 'Serenity' here gets a handsome prince? Ha ha, hope you wear your best dress to the wedding Michael!\" Your glared at him, angry with everything. Being in medieval times? Fine, you could get used to it. Being a princess? You could make the best of it. But marrying a guy? No way, not your type at all. \"This is crazy!\" was all you could utter. \"Everyone,\" your father shouted, \"calm down. It's just a political marriage; you won't have to do anything you don't want to, and I haven't even met with the other families yet to decide who's marrying who. We still have a week or more before they arrive, according to the chancellor's estimates, so just enjoy yourselves and relax until then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to your room, you began pacing the floor angrily. \"Milady, are you alright?\" asked your faithful maid Rochelle. \"Alright!\" You growled, \"how can I be alright! My dad signed us up for this crazy nonsense, and now I might have to marry some stranger! Some... <i>man!</i>\" Your lady-in-waiting sighed and placed a hand on your shoulder. \"Don't worry milady; I am sure your father has your best interests at heart. Besides, wherever you go I will always be with you, ready to help.\" You nodded, finally taking in Rochelle for the first time. She was about your age but a bit taller with dark hair and dark skin. Her features were average, but attractive \"Thank you Rochelle,\" you said with a faint smile, \"that's very reassuring. And please; call me Mi-\" you stopped yourself, remembering your name in this world. \"Serenity. Call me Serenity.\" \"As you wish, Lady Serenity. Now please get some rest; you've had a long day.\" You nodded before she left, and then began undressing and settling into bed, with Rex laying on the foot of your enormous mattress. \"Well, I guess it's not all bad. That maid seems nice... and pretty... I wonder...\" Your thoughts drifted away as you fell into sleep.</span></div></div>",

Finally something good.</i> \"Thank you, Rochelle.\" She nodded as she placed the trey on your lap, then produced a list from her apron and placed it next to you. \"This is your daily agenda; Chancellor Theodore believes it important you begin your etiquette training immediately.\" You almost spit out your milk in response. \"Etiquette training?!\" you exclaimed, \"What does that mean?\" \"I'm sorry,\" your lady-in-waiting responded, \"but it seems the Chancellor does believe you should learn how to make a proper bride for any potential suitor. I know you don't want to be married, Serenity, but it would help the kingdom. And as I promised; I will be with you all the way for any help you might need.\" You looked at Rochelle's cheesy but earnest smile as she promised to aid you and couldn't help but smile in return. \"Alright, if it means I get to spend more time with you, I'll learn to be the best princess there ever was!\" The maid laughed at this and winked, \"I believe you are already the greatest princess in the world! But that is only one woman's opinion. Now, finish your food and tell me if you need help getting dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, King Mark and Queen Susan were eating breakfast together and arguing about the future. \"But I don't understand, Mark! This was supposed to be a vacation so the family could relax and grow closer! Now you want to marry our children off?\" Mark sighed and pinched his nose. \"Susan, we've discussed this over and over. It's a bad situation but we don't have much of a choice. We can't end the simulation and I have no idea what would happen if our kingdom were to be conquered. Would we be killed? If we die in here do we die in the real world? I don't know and I won't put my family at risk by gambling.\" Susan bowed her head. \"Fine, but I just worry about poor Jessica; she seemed so sad to think about being in an arranged marriage, and poor Micheal has to be married as a bride.\" Mark nodded glumly. \"I worry too; but we have to make do the best we can.\" The couple finished the rest of their meal in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the castle ballroom, you were carefully and slowly walking across the floor in heels with a book on your head; failing miserably at trying not to trip. \"Is this <i>really</i> the best way to learn posture?\" You asked in a huff. \"It seems so cliche'.\" Meanwhile, Jessica was doing just fine doing the same task. \"Seems easy to me Serenity! When can we move on to the task?\" \"Easy for you,\" you responded, \"because you're already used to wearing heels. Can't I wear royal flats or something?\" Rochelle shook her head. \"No, you must learn to walk with perfect posture, even in heels, to be considered a proper princess.\" Jessica couldn't help but giggle at this last statement, which caused you to roll your eyes. She still wasn't used to your being a girl now, but at least her giggles and excitement were more bearable than Ryan's constant teasing. \"Well anyway, I'm going to go pet Spike while you figure it out.\" After another minute, you were still tripping and hopeless. \"Gah! I'll never get it,\" you exclaimed in frustration. \"Serenity,\" Rochelle said softly, \"let me help you.\" You nodded and she stepped up behind you, placing her hands on your waist and back; causing you to blush at her touch as she placed in you into the correct stance. \"Now, stand like so,\" she instructed, \"and step forward. Do not move your frame, and step heel to toe.\" You did as she said, and before you knew it you were walking perfectly. \"Wow!\" Serenity gasped, \"you're walking just like a real girl!\" Rochelle gave her a puzzled look. \"I mean,\" your sister backpedaled, \"like a proper princess. Because of course you're a girl...\" She still wasn't sure how Rochelle would react to hearing this is all VR, and neither were you. The awkwardness was immediately interrupted when Ryan came into the room. \"Aww, Princess Serenity getting ready for the ball! Ha ha ha!\" You glared at his mockery, and started to respond, but Rochelle came to your defense. \"It seems, Prince Ryan, that Princess Serenity is working much harder for the family than you are. Why are you here pestering your siblings when you could be learning the rules of court yourself.\" \"Bah!\" was all your brother could offer in response. \"Look at me! What princess wouldn't fall in love with me at first sight? I don't need any lessons.\" Rochelle simply shook her head at him, but said nothing more. Ryan chuckled at her silence, taking it as a victory, and left. \"I'm sorry Serenity; I didn't mean to raise my voice at one of the royal family, but something came over me when he mocked you!\" You shook your head and placed your hand on her shoulder. \"Don't worry Rochelle; I'm actually glad that you have my back. And Ryan's a jerk anyway; you shouldn't ever feel bad raising your voice at him.\" Rochelle nodded, and then you resumed your lesson.</span></div></div>",

It was really starting to get on your nerves; but Rochelle promised she'd be able to get your mind off of it today. When you arrived at the place she told you to meet you were surprised to find Rochelle sitting on a horse. \"Serenity!\" she called out, \"I hope you're ready for your next lesson.\" Your eyes widened. \"Am I going to ride a horse? How is that etiquette training?\" She shrugged in response. \"Maybe it doesn't count as 'etiquette,' but I've never heard of a princess who can't ride a horse! Come now, let me help you up.\" You nervously approached the horse. \"What's it's name?\" you asked. \"Graymare.\" Rochelle answered in a reassuring tone, \"she's a good old horse; don't worry.\" You petted the grey horse with some hesitancy, but it only leaned in to your touch. After feeling relieved, you took Rochelle's hand and sat up on Graymare. As you gripped the reins you felt Rochelle's hands reach around your waist. \"Now take it easy, milady, just calmly guide the mare with a whistle and a light tap.\" You nodded and followed her instructions. Before you knew it, the horse was taking you down a path into the woods; you barely had to do anything yourself. Instead you found your mind wandering more to your maid who was resting against your back; causing you to become quite flustered, which she seemed to interpret as nervousness. \"Don't worry Serenity; you are doing fine. You're a natural at this.\" You nodded and tried to relax. As the path winded on, Rochelle continued to whisper reassurance into your ear. \"Rochelle,\" you finally started, \"do you like me?\" Rochelle laughed at this. \"Of course! Why wouldn't I? You are a beautiful and sweet princess who I am proud to serve.\" You stopped the horse, and motioned for Rochelle to join you on a log for a sit. \"What I mean,\" you started again, \"do you really like me? Not just as your princess?\" She tilted her head, finally taking it in. \"Well, milady, though I have served you my whole life, these last few days have opened my eyes to how wonderful you truly are. So yes, I do consider you a friend.\" <i>A friend? I was hoping maybe more...</i> Well, it would have to do for now. \"Thanks Rochelle, I consider you a friend too.\" With that, you both returned to the horse and chatted your way back to the horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was wandering around the castle grounds, taking in her flower garden, when she heard some strange sounds coming from the bushes. \"Hello?\" the queen asked as she moved closer to inspect. Suddenly, a nude maid carrying her clothes in her hand jumped out of the shrubbery. \"M-milady! I'm so sorry... I s-should... Ah, e-excuse me...\" Her stuttering response trailed off as she ran into the castle. Just then, Ryan stepped out of the bushes, pulling up his pants. \"Mom! You interrupted us! Oh well...\" Susan became enraged. \"Ryan! Your sisters - I mean, siblings, are busy training and preparing for the future for the good of our family. What are you doing? Fooling around with maids? For once, act like the oldest brother, would you? Please.\" Ryan shrugged. \"Why should I? This was supposed to be a vacation, and I'm having the time of my life! I think the rest of you should learn to not be so uptight and just chill.\" Susan could only sigh in frustration as she watched her son walk away. At least her other children had their priorities straight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you were once again wearing heels in the ballroom. This time you were continuing a lesson on ballroom dancing from the day before. Since you would be the bride at a potential wedding, you had to learn to let your partner lead; which wasn't hard since your partner in this case was Rochelle. Mostly you were just trying to keep up and not step on her toes. \"You're doing well; just relax.\" Rochelle had been saying some variation of that over and over again every time you danced together, but it wasn't your nerves that was making you antsy. Finally, you decided it was now or never; you had to make your intentions clear. At the next dip, as she led your frame downward, you reached your head up and planted a gentle kiss on her lips; it was quick and innocent, but she reacted just as if it had been the steamiest kiss of all. She dropped you on the floor as she reached her hand up to her mouth; then reached down to help you up after realizing what she'd done. \"Serenity! I'm s-so sorry but w-why did you do that?!\" she stammered out. \"Because,\" you explained as your face turned a deep shade of red, \"I like you! I thought you also...\" As your sentence trailed off, her eyes widened with understanding. \"Oh! M-milady... I never thought... with a servant like me...\" Finally, she kissed you back, and that's how the both of you were for several minutes, locked in an embrace filled with passionate kisses. \"So,\" you started after the two you finally broke away from each other. \"What does this mean for us?\" She shook her head nervously and began pacing. \"I don't know. A lady-in-waiting is not supposed to enter romantic entanglements with her mistress, this is not right...\" \"No!\" You said, raising your voice. \"It is right.\" \"But you are supposed to be married!\" \"And you are supposed to be with me, no matter what. No matter who my 'husband' is, we will still have each other. If you want me, that is.\" \"Of course!\" Rochelle replied with tears in her eyes. \"Of course I want you! I would be honored to be loved by one as fair as you! But this relationship is improper. Please, I must think...\" She walked away as fast as she could in her dress,wiping away her tears. <i>I can make this work, I know it. I just have to prove it to her...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day Rochelle brought you breakfast in bed as usual, but seemed more awkward than normal. As soon as you began to eat, she left the room; much the same as the way she preformed all her duties throughout the day. Eventually, you decided to take her aside for a talk. \"Listen,\" you began, \"I'm sorry if you felt pressured last night Rochelle. I didn't want to-\" \"No, not at all!\" Rochelle interrupted. \"I'm just concerned about the kingdom. You have to put your family and the kingdom first.\" You nodded. \"Say, why don't we talk about this later? I'll meet you near the flower garden around noon.\" Rochelle agreed, then went away to tidy up your room. In the meantime you found your sister Jessica. \"Hey Jess, can you help me with something?\" Jessica tilted her head. \"Sure, what do you need?\" You explained your predicament to her, by the end of which she was squealing in delight. \"That's so cute! So you really like her, huh? Does that make you a lesbian? You <i>are</i> a girl now, after all!\" You shrugged. \"I guess so? I'm not worried about that right now, tough. I want to do something special, to convince her we can make things work. But I need your help to set it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRochelle walked to the flower gardens with her heart thumping hard. She was so flattered that the Princess Serenity was interested in her, but so nervous about the future. How could they love each other when Serenity would likely be married off to another? Would the princess still want anything to do with a lowly maid once she was the bride of a nobleman? These questions were pushed to the back of Rochelle's mind when she saw her princess sitting at a table in a gorgeous green silk dress, with her hair done in waterfall braids; her lips were painted crimson to stand out in her pale, powdered face. As Rochelle stood in shock, Serenity extended her hand and waved the maid over. Taking a seat across from her princess at the table, the lady-in-waiting began examining the food before her; simple sandwiches and fruit, not complex but it was the thought that counts. \"This is amazing! Did you do this by yourself?\" The maid asked, to which Serenity shook her head. \"No, I had some help from my sister, she's the one who did my hair too.\" Rochelle raised her eyebrows at this, \"Princess Jessica? You went to all this trouble for me?\" Serenity chuckled in response. \"Of course I did! Why else?\" Rochelle din't know what to say; two princesses had made lunch for <i>her</i>, a simple servant. \"Thank you,\" was all she could manage, but it was enough. The rest of the luncheon went on in silence, and at the end the princess rose and said, \"so, have you made your decision? Will you at least try this?\" Rochelle thought about how to respond, but finally spoke. \"Yes, I will try. Just... Promise me you won't leave me?\" Serenity smiled. \"Of course not!\" Was her answer, and at this, they finally shared another kiss, not noticing the sound of an eavesdropping Jessica's excited giggles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more bliss-filled days had passed and you were finally beginning to feel this was a real vacation; you and Rochelle spent much time together, and you were even getting used to being a girl; it certainly didn't turn out to be as bad as you feared when you first arrived, you had not only found a girlfriend but also got closer to your sister in the process. This morning, however, Rochelle seemed to be hurrying you out of bed. \"Serenity, please, you must get ready.\" \"Ready for what...\" you mumbled in your half-asleep stupor. \"The royal houses of Clydesdale and Salisbury are arriving today! The chancellor believes it is important you and your siblings all look your best.\" \"WHAT?!\" you exclaimed, just now remembering. The last few days had been so dreamlike the arranged marriage had slipped from your mind. \"Please milady,\" Rochelle said soothingly, \"I know you must be feeling many negative emotion right now, but we must focus. Which dress do you wnt to wear today?\" You got out of bed and let Rochelle get you dressed and styled, but your mind was elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Mark of Experienza,\" Chancellor Theodore started, \"I introduce you to King Johann of Clydesdale, and King Basilius of Salisbury.\" Mark bowed in greeting at his two counterparts. \"I'm glad you could make it on such a short notice,\" Mark said in an attempt to sound kingly. Is that how kings sound? \"Of course,\" the king of Clydesdale, a tall and thin pale-skinned man with a blond beard started, \"we always look to make deals with out neighbors.\" The other king, a stout warrior man with tan skin, scoffed at this. \"Bah! Your people have always put money above common sense. Salisbury has been fighting the Elves for years and you only now come out of your icy mountains to help because you hope for gold from these people. Don't be fooled, King Mark, the Kingdom of Clydesdale is little more than a tribe of mercenaries pretending to be a proper kingdom!\" King Johann was offended by this. \"How <i>dare</i> you! Why I-\" \"Gentlemen, please,\" Mark interrupted, \"we are here to discuss a common foe; the Elves. For this purpose I seek an alliance with the both of you.\" \"Fine,\" Basilius grunted, \"just don't expect me to enjoy the company of this snobbish swine.\" \"And,\" Johann added, \"don't expect me to become the best of chums with this barbarian.\" Mark sighed. It was like negotiating an argument between his children. \"Very well. Can we now discuss the future of our kingdom?\" \"Of course,\" Basilius said, \"I'm glad that someone will finally help up with those pointy-eared bastards. But! I want <i>proof.</i> Proof that you are willing to sacrifice as much as we have to fight them.\" Mark gulped before answering, \"Sacrifice what, exactly?\" Basilius began scratching his brown whiskers. \"You have four heirs, yes? And I have two. I propose a marriage between my daughter Pamela with your prince, and my son Dametas with one of your daughters.\" Mark sighed; he knew this would happen but was still uneasy about it. \"I will do anything to protect my kingdom; and my family. I agree to your terms\" Basilius busted out in laughter. \"Good! Then it is settled! Let us drink and be merry!\" Just then, King Johann cleared his throat. \"Ahem. Yes. But what do <i>I</i> get out of this alliance?\" Mark scratched his head. \"What do you need? Gold or--\" \"Yes!\" the king of Clydesdale exclaimed before Mark even finished his sentence. \"Er, that is, that would be very nice. In addition, my younger son is unmarried. Seeing as you have two daughters and only one is betrothed...\" Mark nodded, understanding. \"It's a deal; whatever you need.\" Johann was grinning ear to ear. \"O ho! I'll be holding you to it my friend!\" The kings then spent the next hour discussing the specifics of their deals, before concluding to feast.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In time, you and all the members of the three royal families are heralded as they make their way to the feast table. You inspect each foreign noble closely, and nervously. <i>I'll probably be marrying one of these people... Probably one of the men...</i> All you can do is sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the Kingdom of Clydesdale is introduced King Johann, a tall fair-haired and pale-skinned man who explains his wife, Queen Hilda, is home pregnant. Following him is his oldest son Leopold, a fat man with a hairy beard, followed by his wife Erika. Then enters his sister called Brenda, a somewhat heavyset but beautiful woman with long, blond locks flowing about her emerald gown. Next is her brother, Wilhelm, a tall man with manicured features and long hair that seems to match his sister. Even his clothes are androgynous, being an emerald tunic with black silk breeches. You'd almost say he's <i>pretty</i>, and he obviously cares about his looks. <i>If I have to marry any of these dudes I hope it's him... Wait, what am I thinking?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kingdom of Salisbury's family enters behind their King Basilius, a man who seems to be muscles come to life. Basilius is accompanied by his wife Gynecia, who's face manages to still retain its beauty despite her age showing. They are followed by their son, Dametas, a short bald man who seems reluctant to be here, actually reading a book as he walks. Next is his sister Pamela; who is obviously athletic, though not as muscular as her father. She wears a breastplate over breeches, apparently preferring to be dressed as a soldier even at formal occasions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the feast begins, conversation is light. You can notice the tension between the families of Salisbury and Clydesdale is high; they barely glance at one another and occasionally whisper gossip about each other. <i>It's like those cliques in high school all over again...</i> Eventually, once the feasting is nearing its end, the Royal Chancellor, whose features seem strangely familiar to you, rises and suggests some dancing. Before you know it, the musicians begin playing a tune, and your father takes you and your siblings aside. \"Children, this would be a good opportunity to introduce yourselves to your betrothed. Ryan, go offer Princess Pamela a dance. Jessica, you go to Prince Dametas, and Mich-\" Your dad hesitates, before completing. \"Serenity, go dance with Prince Wilhelm.\" He mouths an <i>I'm sorry</i> to you before going to find your mother for a dance. Ryan can't help but laugh. \"Have fun 'Serenity!' Don't let him take advantage of you!\" He laughs all the way to the table where Pamela sits. Jessica just sighs. \"Ignore him. You just relax and remember your lessons, we trained for this!\" She walks away with a surprisingly determined look. You were a bundle of nerves as you walked towards Prince Wilhelm. \"Ah,\" he exclaims as he takes your hand, \"you must be Princess Serenity. I am lucky to have such a beautiful fianc\u00e9e!\" He kisses your hand, which causes you to blush against your wishes. \"Shall we dance?\" He asks, and you want to say no, but remember your place and force a smile. \"I would be honored,\" you finally whisper out. \"Aw, is my princess shy? Don't worry, I am a gentleman. I shall endeavor to please you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dance went smoothly, Wilhelm led and you honestly felt a little over prepared. You looked over to Jessica about halfway through to find her dancing was already finished; Dametas wanted to go right back to his books, and your poor sister was left loitering around awkwardly. Your brother, however, was making a fool of himself. After stepping on his partner's foot one to many times, she pushed him to the ground. \"Useless fool,\" she uttered at him angrily, \"did you learn to dance from an ox?\" Ryan stood up and shrugged. \"Dancing is for girls, so I never <i>learned</i> at all.\" Pamela actually smirked at this. \"You,\" she exclaimed as she pointed at your sister, \"he says dancing is a girl's sport, so let us prove him right.\" Jessica's face turns blood red as the warrior woman takes her hand and places another around her waist and begins leading her in a dance. You felt a little jealous of your sister, while also feeling vindicated by your brother's public humiliation. Even if Ryan was pretending not to care, you could tell he was embarrassed that his future bride already preferred his <i>sister</i> to him. <i>Guess you should've prepared after all...</i> When the dance was over, your dance partner thanked you, kissed your hand, and then left. \"At least that's over...\" You muttered under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to your room, you collapsed into bed with a sigh. \"How did you fair, milady?\" You were relieved to hear that voice, the voice of the one of two people who were keeping you sane in this crazy medieval world. \"Rochelle! Am I glad to see you!\" You said as you rose to look at her entering the room. She was wearing a simple maid's dress without a hint of makeup on her face, but you preferred her simple beauty all the more after so much pageantry from before. \"That bad?\" She asked you with a frown. \"No,\" you sighed, \"it wasn't horrible; just very tiring.\" \"Well, then let me put you to bed,\" she said with a sly wink. She began undressing you, and you kissed her neck over and over. Once you were naked she began kissing your breasts, causing you to giggle in delight, and now it was your turn to undress her. The rest of the night was pure ecstasy and the two of you fell asleep nestled into each other's arms.</span></div></div>",

Though he was silver-haired and in his autumn years, he held himself with an upright bearing and had a steely gaze that commanded a great deal of authority. Turning to King Mark, he bowed deeply. \"My liege. It is an honour to serve you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. and you are?\" Mike stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Rufus Reginald, sire. Your steward. You have been gone many years. I have been custodian of your castle and domain in your absence, but now that you are returned it is my duty to transfer the reins of power back into your capable hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, \"power\", I like the sound of that!\" Mike crowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be the VR tour guide,\" Susan whispered. Turning to the steward, she said, \"You're here to show us the ropes, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, my lady. Your arrival was heralded weeks ago and the castle made ready for your return. You have traveled a long way. I have arranged two dozen handmaidens to wait on you, easing the discomforts of your journey. The boilers have been stoked - you will find no shortage of hot water to fill your baths and all the time in the world to languish in them. Your apothecaries have concocted potions and unctions to sooth and revitalize your skin. For food, you will find a thousand delicacies awaiting you from all corners of the Kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spa treatment!\" Susan exclaimed giddily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald turned to Jessica. \"As for the Princess, her time will be occupied by the three foreign Princes who have traveled to the castle to vie for her hand in marriage. I fear, however, that she may struggle to choose. Each one is more handsome than the last.\" Turning to Ryan, he said, \"My Prince. The royal vault has been opened. It's endless treasures are yours to use as your see fit, as is the town beyond these walls, and its maidens...\" he said with a devious twinkle in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to slam so much virtual pussy,\" Ryan muttered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald bowed low once again, smiling warmly down at Damien. \"For my little lord, a grand tournament is to be held. The greatest knights will joust and fight for your entertainment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about Michael?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[[End Lifting]]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there seems to have been a mistake with his avatar.\" Mike added while pointing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

Yes, for her I would ask her to see the great sage Merlin, for he will know more about her hidden destiny.\" Reginald said, giving you a bow as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hidden destiny!\" Susan repeated with interest, \"It sounds like they gave you a quest early in the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful.\" You replied bitterly, not wanting to mention the fact that you seem to have an admin avatar just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo see Merlin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, experiment with your powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead she gives you a light kiss on the cheek and says, \"I am so glad you could come with us Emily. It would have been a shame to waste the money when Michael wouldn't come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you found yourself automatically in a deep curtsy as you said, \"It is a pleasure my queen, and an honor to be the wife of Prince Ryan.\" You found yourself giving a smile to Ryan as you said that last part. Inside your head you were screaming, but as for your words and actions, it was like you were on auto pilot. It was not even something you could try to fight. That was proven when, as you stood up, you clung lovingly to Ryan's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mother smiled, \"You are not a servant with us. You are my daughter-in-law. Do not bow to us, and please, call me Susan, except on official business of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself fighting another curtsy, \"As you wish... Susan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan put his arm around your shoulder, \"Well, the adventure has begun. I think we should check out our rooms.\" You wanted to argue, but the others agreed, and all you could do was look lovingly on Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got into the huge suite that was your room with your husband, you could feel a change in your head. You looked up at him, finding that you could speak now without being spoken to, \"What is going on Ryan? I am Emily. I mean. I am your wife!\" You growled, but in your feminine voice, it only sounded cute, \"You know what I mean, even if I can't say it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, \"Yeah, I hear you Michael. I made a deal with a friend of mine who is a programmer here. And the fun is only beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crossed your arms, then uncrossed them at the odd feeling it gave you against your breasts, \"Don't count on it my husband.\" That last party you didn't seem to be able to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"Well, let's find out, my wanton wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he uttered the last three words, you found yourself moving toward him. You immediately knelt there in front of him as you softly said, \"Your pardon my husband.\" You face was bright red as you began to undo his pants. As soon as they were down, you began to caress his cock, and then gently kiss it! You went back to stroking it as you started sucking his balls. When he was fully erect, you took him into your mouth. It was humiliating, but not only could you not stop it, you found yourself deeply enjoying it! You were loving the musky smell of his crotch, the taste of his cock, even the texture of it! And when, after what seemed like forever, you felt him begin to pump his hot seed into your mouth, you loved the taste and greedily swallowed every drop! When you had milked him dry, you put his pants back in place and then smile up at him, \"Thank you my husband!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stood up though, you felt strange. You felt wonderful! Every fiber of your being felt good! You even felt, well, happy! You giggled, \"Now what did you do to me? Not that I mind my love!\" You even almost 'meant' it when you called him your love!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"A little gift from me to you. Every time you suck my cock, that is what will happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, \"In that case, may I do it again my husband?\" The worst part of that was, you were not compelled to say that! It was just that it was so much fun! And it felt so good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan grinned, \"Oh, in time. But now, we have to consummate our marriage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in your happy state, that broke through, \"No! I will not do that for you my husband. I will service your needs on my knees, but I will not give myself to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan smiled, \"That is no way for 'my loving wife' to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, you find yourself in deep sexual need! Not only that, but you loved Ryan so much that you wanted to give him your body! You jumped up and hugged him, and you were thrilled to kiss him passionately as you felt him undo the buttons on the back of your dress! You gladly shed your dress and petticoats for him, and as soon as he was also naked, you did not resist him at all. Soon you were on your back and spreading your legs. As the head of his penis began to penetrate you, a shock ran through your body like electricity, only it was a huge wave of pleasure! And the deeper he pushed into you, the greater the pleasure! You moaned and screamed in pleasure! But all that was like nothing when you felt his hot seed pour inside of you. It triggered an orgasm that radiated from inside of you, and you screamed again, not believing that anything could survive such pleasure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over, and he pulled out of you, you climbed on top of him and said, \"Thank you! Thank you! THANK YOU!\" And that was not something you were being compelled to do or say!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"You are welcome Emily. And here is the deal. I can use those triggers on you any time or others, that will give you no pleasure at all. However, if you willingly play the part of Emily, I will give you those pleasures again and again.\" </span></div></div>",

Part of the changes to me is that I recover very, very quickly. Not that I need to my flexible wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, you got up, and, standing facing the bed, you parted your feet slightly and then quickly bent forward, propping yourself on straight arms, you long hair flying down and hanging all about your head. Worse yet, you couldn't move! You were stuck like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear Ryan well enough though. \"So Michael, you see, you are stuck as a girl, and my wife for as long as we are here. I don't need you to be willing, but it is only through doing, or allowing, things willingly that you will have any pleasure.\" He came up and reached under your hair to stroke your breasts. He was right, not only did you not feel pleasure, but the feeling of humiliation was intense. \"Do you like having these? I will bet you do. You were always a pussy anyhow. And speaking of pussy.\" He moved back, and soon you felt him stroking your pussy lips, even slipping a finger inside of you, \"You both are, and now have a pussy.\" He laughed, \"You and Jessica always did what you could to embarrass me, now it will be the two of you who learn.\" The humiliation was stronger, as he did this, and you thought you could not feel worse, but you were wrong. As you felt him slide his cock inside of you, the jolt of waves of shame and humiliation were almost too much to take! He took his time with you, and when he dumped his seed inside of you, you felt sick and wanted to throw up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after he pulled out of you could you move again. It was so disgusting to feel his thick cum leaking from your pussy. \"There has to be a way out. I will find it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as he lay on the bed, \"There is some food over there Michael. Feed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself obeying. And even though you were hungry, you couldn't even steel so much as a grape for yourself until he had finished. You were about to start your food, now cold of course, when he said, \"What are you doing my seasoning wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered what that meant, at least, until you found yourself taking your plate of food and walking over to Ryan again. You set it between his legs and began to stroke his cock with your dainty hands. You couldn't stop yourself, and you kept it up until he came, and you made sure it sprayed completely over your food! Only then could you eat! Of course, you didn't want it now, but you did, as you took dainty bites befitting a princess. Unlike before, his cum was salty and bitter. You humiliation was total as you licked the plate when you were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, \"Come on! Get dressed! Let's see how the rest of the family is doing. Oh, and just so you know. No matter what we do or say, they will consider it normal. So don't bother trying to influence mom or dad.\"</span></div></div>",

Then they slide up, and he began to cup my breasts in his hands! Soon he was squeezing and massaging them. It was humiliating! However, Jessica seemed unphased. She only sighed and said, \"The two of you make such a romantic couple. I hope I can find someone while we are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe talked a while, then Ryan whispered in my ear, \"Time for you to make a choice.... my lesbian wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, I was enraptured by Jessica! She was beautiful! Then I realized that I wanted her! I wanted sex with her! I shook my head. This wasn't right. She was my sister. But I wanted to ravish her! I looked up at Ryan, \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"You make a choice. If you let your desires flow, the two of you will become lesbian lover for the rest of the time we are here. So you need to choose your lover now. I hold the only antidote. Who will you be? My wife? Or my consort and a lesbian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Jessica.

This was wrong. She was my sister! I couldn't desire her! And in this form, I would be making her a lesbian. Hell! I would be a lesbian! I was afraid of moving for fear of loosing the battle. It looked like Jessica was fighting the same kind of thing. I just needed to tear myself away from that desirable body, those luscious breasts, those scrumptious lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I was running toward Jessica! We met, and so did our lips. I could feel her breast pressing into mine. This was so wrong, but I no longer cared! The feel of her body, the heat of her kiss, that is what I wanted, even needed! We kissed more passionately than any lover I had had before, and soon, we were struggling to get each other out of those heavy dresses and layers of petticoats!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, we finally ended up on her bed naked, entwined in each other's arms! I loved the feel of her breasts, and playing with her pussy, and even more, the feeling of her touching me in those places! Somehow, I ended up with my head between her legs, and I couldn't believe the wonderful taste of her pussy! I drove her to multiple orgasms! Then we changed positions, and I felt her tongue darting in and out of my pussy, licking my clit, and it was even more incredible! Before I knew it, I was screaming with an orgasm from my loving sister! (Though she didn't seem to know that inside this feminine form was her brother.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were both spent, we lay on the bed, wrapped in each others arms. As I stroked her hair, she smiled at me and said, \"I should feel terrible for loving my brother's wife. For how I feel about you, but I can't. I love you Emily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, \"As I love you Jessica. It is a shame I must sleep in Ryan's bed, but I have no choice. I would rather spend every night with you for the rest of my life.\" And when I said it, I realized that I meant it! Oh, I hope this did not carry back to our real bodies! \"We must be strong in front of others, but I we can only try to spend as much time together as we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica agreed!</span></div></div>",

My name is Abigail! I mean Abby. No! Abigail!\" You could not say anything different either, \"Arrrrggghhh! Well, anyhow, I am not your twin sister. I might have these,\" You hefted your newfound breasts, \"But under these skirts, I still have boy parts! What is going on? We need to fix this?\" What was that strange tingle in your head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan laughed, \"Too late bro, or I guess I should say sis. The program just locked in. Looks like you are a princess for the duration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your face, your mom stepped in, \"There has to be a way to fix it. We will find out. In the mean time, why don't you and your sister go to your room and relax a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to, but you didn't see what choice you had.

At least it can't get worse!\" You never should have said that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned a corner in the hallway you were walking in, there were two young men standing there looking a bit shy. They were about the same age as Jessica and yourself. One walked up to Jessica, And to your horror, the other walked directly to you! He was tall, and obviously muscular, and very, very handsome! As he bowed to you, you found yourself instinctively returning a curtsy to him! Something in your mind told you that this was Robert, the son of a noble family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awkwardly spoke to you, \"Princess Abigail, would you be willing to accompany me to the dance tonight, and sit with me at the meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to shout no, but as you looked up at him, you felt your heart flutter! You also felt a stirring in your crotch that shouldn't be there when you looked at a boy your age! Somehow, you found yourself saying, \"I... I, would be pleased to accompany you Robert.\" And the fact that he smiled at you made you feel even better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"Then that will by my honor my lady. I shall not be late. Now, pleas excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched him walking away, and you blushed when you realized that you thought he had a cute butt! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen both he and the other boy were gone, Jessica said, \"Did I just hear that right? Did you just agree to go to the dance with a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat shook you out of the trance that you were in! \"Oh my word! I did!\" You pulled your sister toward what you knew was the door to your shared room. Once inside, you said, \"And it is worse than that! I don't know what this place did to me, but not only did I say yes to him, I, well, I think he is hot! I am attracted to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stared at you, and then began to laugh, \"And you were complaining about wearing dresses?  You better be glad these dresses have so many layers! I doubt your boyfriend would like finding out that you have the same boy parts as him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed deeply, \"Stop it! I don't want this!

For you, you will have a girl's attraction to boys, but feel humiliated over anything you do. You mind will not want what your body needs basically. Be a good girl, and I won't make it worse. But trust me, I can make it worse. Oh, and I removed a block. You might find that you recognize your new boyfriend now. He is an NPC based on someone you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignored your pleading and laughed as he left again. Soon, you were ready and waiting for Robert to arrive. You hated this dress, your long hair, being feminine in general. In spite of all of that, your heart jumped when there was a knock on the door. A servant opened the door and Robert walked in. Your heart leapt when you saw him, but your mind was shocked! You didn't know him well, but it was Craig, an openly gay male in your class! You found yourself in a deep curtsy to him. \"Welcome Robert. I am glad you came.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bowed, \"I am at your service my Lady. Shall we go to the dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took his arm, but you wanted to run away. You could see where Ryan was going with this, but you couldn't do anything about it. Worst of all, the sight of Robert almost made you breathless! You had no idea how this would effect you outside of this virtual world, but right now, it didn't matter. You were not in the driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was a roller coaster of emotional highs and humiliations. You confirmed beyond doubt that you were attracted to boys, since the sight of one thrilled you, and his touch excited you. Especially Robert's! But with each thrill came same and humiliation on the inside. To your dismay, when you were with the 'other girls', though most of them were beautiful, there was no stirring. No attraction at all. For some reason though, your sister Jessica seemed very uncomfortable herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting next to Robert at the meal drove you crazy, and when enough time had passed, part of you was happy that Robert asked you to walk with him in the garden, while the other part of you dreaded it! In the garden, he took you into his arms, lifted your chin, and began to kiss you with passion! Not only did you find yourself returning the kiss with equal passion, but you could feel your cock quickly stand at attention! Soon he was massaging your breast with one hand as he groped your as with the other. Your body was thrilled, but your mind was horrified!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought things could not get worse, that was, until he said, \"Princess Abigail, you do me a great disservice, stirring my loins so, but granting me no relief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down to see a great bulge in his pants. There was no way you were going to do what he wanted! No way! Even as you gasped and said, \"You poor boy! Let me help you with that!\" You couldn't! You wouldn't! Even as you slipped to your knees and began to undo his belt, you were sure you could stop yourself! You were not gay! You couldn't do that! Even as your mouth watered and your heart throbbed at the site of his naked cock, you were determined that you could control yourself. You kept telling yourself that even as you kissed it and licked it. You kept telling yourself that right up to the point where you took it greedily into your mouth and began to suck on it with pleasure! Perhaps the worst part was when he came, and you actually loved the the taste of his cum! You sucked down every drop that you could as he held your head tightly to his crotch! When it was done. Part of you felt very happy. Another part of you wanted to throw up in disgust!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shock and dismay were not over yet though. As he stroked your head, he said, \"Thank you Princess.

You finally managed, \"You... you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI he pealed up layer after layer of your skirts, he smiled and said, \"From the first. That is why I wanted you so much. You are perfect! It would never arouse anyone's suspicion to see me with you.\" He stroked your thighs and you moaned in pleasure! \"I don't know how you came to be like this, but I am glad that you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as he stroked your cock, \"An evil wizard cursed me to be like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert smiled, \"Then to me, he is not evil.\" And before you knew it, he was sucking your cock! Again, you wanted to scream for him to stop, yet all you could do was spread your legs like a girl and moan in great pleasure. When you finally did come, you did so in his mouth like a male, but vast waves of pleasure coursed through your body as though you were female! It was so strong, you hardly felt guilty or ashamed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, the two of you kissed for a long time on that bench. Then he walked you back to your room. At the door he kissed you again, and then said...</span></div></div>",

I hope I will have your support in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to scream no! Instead, you jumped up and hugged him, \"Oh yes Roger. I want to be your wife!\" Of course, in this recreation, it wouldn't matter. The girl had no say in who she married, though a loving father might consider her feelings if he was so inclined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered your room excited, but as soon as the door was closed, the spell was broken. Now you were in shock! This couldn't be allowed to happen! You couldn't marry a guy! You are a male! As you stood, trying to think of what to do, you heard sounds from your sister's room. With her door partly open, you couldn't help yourself, and looked in.To your surprise, you saw your sister, naked and in a passionate embrace with Melody, her personal handmaid! They were obviously making love to each other!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as you quietly backed away. It was only after you were in your own room that you realized who Melody was. Like Robert was from your class, Melody was a recreation of a girl from your class as well. She was Theresa! An open lesbian! What was Ryan doing to the two of you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter in one way. You couldn't stop what was happening to either of you. After Jessica came out of her room, you pretended not to know about her as you cried and told her about Robert. Of course, there was nothing either of you could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your parents called for you to ask about marrying Robert, even though you made a supreme effort to tell them you didn't want to marry him, what came out was, \"Oh please father! We love each other! Please let us marry!\" And to your dismay, with that endorsement, your parents okayed the marriage, and you were officially considered 'engaged'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, there was no questions asked if Robert to you into his room, and your sessions of sucking his cock became quite regular. More than that, since you were compelled to act like a girl in love when in Robert's presence, you noticed that it was becoming longer and longer before those feelings would fade when you were NOT around him. That REALLY began to scare you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, you noticed that Jessica's sessions with Melody were becoming more frequent, until at last you noticed that Melody was spending frequently spending the night with Jessica. You never spoke of it though, because Jessica never came to you about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was this going?</span></div></div>",

In that time, not only had you gotten used to wearing dresses and makeup, but it was feeling normal. You would be horrified if Robert saw you without your makeup! That was the other thing, your love for Robert, and the things that you would do together, became normal too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, here it was, your wedding day, and where you should have been disgusted, you were as nervous and excited as any other bride would be! In your constant exposure to Robert, you had fallen in love with him for real. You couldn't help it. So you really looked forward to being his wife! You were also thrilled with the beautiful wedding dress you got to wear! It was an amazing feeling to walk down the isle with all eyes on you, the blushing bride.It was a thrill to say 'I do.\" and even more so to hear Robert say it, and then here the words, \"I now pronounce you man and wife.\" You were married! You were actually married!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in this time, there was no honeymoon, but it did mean that you moved into your own royal suit with your new husband, and once there, you happily serviced Roberts cock as much as you could, and felt honored when he would suck yours as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the two of you lived in marital bliss, and since your dad appointed Robert as his financial advisor, you were together frequently during the day, and had every night alone together. It soon all felt so right and normal to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you found out that Jessica and Melody had secretly taken vows, and considered themselves married to each other, even though that could never be public. You were married about three months when disaster struck for Jessica and Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the blue, a new noble male showed up as a suitor for Jessica's hand in marriage. This was not unusual, but what made this bad, and was no doubt a part of Ryan's plan to demean her more, was that it was Jay, Jessica's boyfriend in real-life. Here though, he was Herbert. Shortly after they were introduced though, Herbert revealed that he knew all about Jessica and Melody. Melody was from his lands, and he made it clear to Jessica that, if she did not marry him, he would betray her as a witch and have her burned at the stake. On the other hand, if she married him after she had given him three sons, he would allow Melody and Jessica to check in at a convent, where they could  live happily without anyone questioning their being together. Jessica agreed. What choice did she have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother two month, and all too soon for Jessica, Herbert and her were married. She had confided everything to you, so you felt horrible for her, and hated Herbert. Jessica soon found that it got worse. Herbert was abusive, and would often take Jessica, or make her do very demeaning things, on a whim. Sometimes she would come to see you just to escape her husband. You wished that she could have a loving husband like Robert. On occasion, you allowed her and Melody to use your bed chambers. Jessica's love for Melody had become so strong that there were times that only being with Melody could comfort her, like when Jessica realized that she was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pitied Jessica. She was always bouncing between a horrible, abusive husband, and her only true love wife. You wished she could be as happy as you were with Robert. And that no longer made you feel odd to admit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the one-year anniversary of your entry into that virtual world, after you had settled in to being a cross-dressed princess and wife to Robert, some major changes happened. When you woke up, you could tell things were very different. Smells were different, there were new and different sounds from outside, and even the bed and your clothing felt different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes with a bit of fear. You were no longer inside a castle with stone walls. The walls you saw were made of wood, and there were windows with real glass! You panicked a moment until you saw Robert, still asleep, laying next to you. So, it seemed you were still a couple, but this was not the time period that you had been in before. You got up, and quietly put on your dressing gown. How did you know what it was? You had to see to Robert's breakfast. You went down wooden steps, and found your way to the kitchen in the big house. There was a girl there who you knew was named Rose. One of your Irish bond-servants, making bread. You liked Rose, even if she was Irish, and soon you were seeing to Robert's breakfast. You could have had Rose make the whole thing, but you refused to let the man you loved be served from obedience instead of love. As you cooked, memories filled your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were no longer a princess, but your father was now a Duke, and the Governor of this colony based on Williamsburg of colonial times. Robert was his treasurer, and you all were still wealthy. Jessica lived in an equally large house next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime went by, and you enjoyed life in this time better. Though you were not the royal blood that you had been, you were still from an important family. More important though was the house was much warmer than the cold stone of the castle, and the dresses you wore, while still pretty, were a bit less cumbersome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica eventually gave birth, after a long and hard labor, to a baby girl that she named Sarah. However, Herbert only wanted boys, so Robert and you ended up adopting her. You loved being a wife and mother, even if you were still physically male where it counted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter six month though, things shifted again. Now you were in pre-Civil War days. Jessica was pregnant again, and like always, it was only the presence of Melody that made things tolerable for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, every six months, you seemed to move forward in time. You lived as Western settlers, then high society in New York just before the turn of the twentieth century, then again in San Fransisco when electric street cars were just new. You were frantic with fear as Robert went off to war during World Wars 1 and 2. That was when you knew just how much you really loved him! Then you were a fifties housewife, with your two daughters who were really adopted from Jessica, who now had a son. That was when it slowed down.You spent a year and a half in the 50's, and you liked it. The clothing were much more fun, but still feminine, the hair styles were better, and you had much more choices in makeup. I loved being feminine, and all that went with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe styles in the 60's and 70's were wild at times, and absurd at others. We jumped to the 90's, where some things seemed more normal, then, after what came out to the equivalent of ten years in those various virtual realities, we were in present day..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when things changed in a different way. The children were gone. I missed that a lot! It took Robert a long time to comfort me over my lost daughters! However, that was not the biggest change. In this world, I was trans. I had taken hormones to get my breasts and female figure, but not gone the whole way because of Robert wanting me to stay as I was. We still loved each other deeply. In this world, my family knew and accepted what I was and were happy for me. I still loved wearing skirts and dresses most of the time, but it was nice to be able to wear slacks some times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, in this world, there was no more Herbert for Jessica. Jessica and Melody were openly lesbian and also happily married. For the first time since her forced marriage to Herbert, Jessica was truly happy. We lived like this for two years, in virtual time.</span></div></div>",

Well, perhaps not 'just like that' since it had been a long time from your perspective, but better to say, without warning. One night, you went to sleep, and when you woke up, a smiling girl was leaning over you. \"Welcome back Michael I hope that you enjoyed your stay!\" She fired things out so fast that you couldn't get a word in, \"There are wardrobes over there. Male clothing on your right. Feel free to pick what you want to wear home from them. It is part of the service.\" She swished across the room, \"Here is a button to call if you have questions or need help. I must go to others who are returning. Have a great day!\" And she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around you at the ultra-modern room. It was good that you had been in a more current sim before waking up or this would really have freaked you out. You could see by the one screen that you had been in there for two weeks. However, in virtual time, you had been trapped in there for at least twenty years! Did the company know that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up, wearing the flimsy hospital type gown, and walked over to the wardrobes. You went to the right and got some underwear out. You began to dress, but the longer you went, the more wrong it felt. Totally wrong! Then you realized that, from your perspective, you had been wearing female clothing for the last twenty years, so you undressed and went to the other wardrobe. As soon as you pulled the panties on, it felt right and normal. You found a bra that fit, and then a nice dress. You got fully dressed, picking up a nice purse and putting your things in it. You saw your face and hair. Doing your makeup was normal and easy now. Your hair, while a whole lot shorter than you preferred, was just long enough to get into a reasonable girl's style. When you were done, you looked like your sister with short hair, which made you feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated to go out. So this was Ryan had done. There was no doubt in your mind that it would be a long time, if ever, before you felt comfortable in male clothing. It made you feel gross! This was awful, but you couldn't help it. So you braced yourself and walked out. You were in a mutual waiting area, and you weren't sure what to do next, so you sat down, crossing your legs as now felt normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit bored when a door opened and out walked Jessica in a nice skirt and blouse. You were so glad to see her! You hugged and chatted about your experiences together, until another door open. When the next person walked out, you both gasped, but for you, it was a total shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the guy walk out, and then stuttered, \"R-r-r-robert?\" Your heart leapt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw you, \"Abby?\" Abby!\" He ran to you and the two of you embraced and kissed. Then he said, \"My name is actually Craig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed deeply as you realized what Ryan had done to you, but you couldn't care at the moment. You felt your member rising and a deep blush came to your face. \"Um, my real name is Michael, but please, call me Abby. I think I am gong to keep that name.\" The two of you kissed again, then you said, \"I thought that you were an NPC! Was it the real you all of the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, \"The same goes for me. But now, I am so glad that you are real. I still love you Abby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart was soaring, when another door opened, and soon, Jessica found herself in a similar situation as she was locked in a loving embrace with the real Melody!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you kissed Craig, you wondered where this would go? What would happen when your parents found out?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michael immediately thought back to the view he'd caught down the faux-air hostess's dress as she wished him a pleasant vacation. He now experienced a similar perspective when he gazed at his body and saw a large, mature pair of breasts confined but not disguised by the bodice bound tightly around his torso. A very unattractive-brown skirt flowed away from his dress and touched his toes, wrapped in workman's boots. His dress was sleeveless, and his biceps were reassuringly firm from many hours of toiling away at the most menial labor. His legs felt similarly buff. None of his physical prowess could disguise the fact, though, that Michael's youth had been spirited away, and he was at least two decades older, staring face to face with his mom and father through strands of gray-brown hair jutting out from his headscarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! Andrew is our freaking maid!\" Ryan cackled. Susan and Mark stared at the panicky Michael with concern. He clutched desperately at his body, aware of every change in his curvature. This female physique had apparently given birth before - he felt the strain in his hips and around his loins. He looked up and caught Damien's confused stare. Jessica stood behind him, trying with all her might to disguise the giggles Ryan was infecting her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, uh... Let's not make this harder for Michael,\" Mark attempted in his much gruffer, more authoritative king voice. \"You'd be scared too to be in such a new body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan calmed down. \"All right. All right. I'm sorry, Michael, I didn't mean anything bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do I do!?\" Michael cried. He winced at his inescapable, higher-pitched British accent. \"I don't want to be a servant! We have to lodge a complaint!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Susan averted her eyes. \"I don't know if that's possible, son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can give you some of my wardrobe,\" Jessica offered. \"Nobody will be able to tell you're a servant, you'll look like part of royalty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's too big!\" Damien said with only the bluntness a five year old could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, since this is our vacation, nobody needs to treat Michael like a servant. He will be family. That's all. Nothing can change that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe discussion continued off of Ryan's declaration, agreeing with it, disagreeing, qualifying, debating the extent of this fantasy world and whether there were other maids and servants who might recognize Michael as one of them, and what would they do then. Michael could not believe the ease with which his family argued semantics when he could only think: <i>I'm in a dress! I have cleavage! I have the air hostess's cleavage! I can feel my vagina and I don't want to feel it anymore!</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He resembled the King, only younger with strong features and an angular jaw, and a slim silver crown nestling in the mane of dark hair. His blue doublet studded with emeralds stretched across his wide chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... Rex...\" Jessica drooled, a flush entering her pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>Bark bark!</b></i>\" the fresh Prince shouted ecstatically, throwing himself at Michael.

No doubt Rex was intended to be our maidservant for the duration of the simulation, while Michael was meant to be a Prince. There must have been a mix-up of the Personality Chips, probably as a result of inserting Rex first during that hostess' little demonstration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody get him off me!\" Michael screamed. The Queen whistled. Rex leaped off the trapped maid, seating himself obediently at her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan could barely suppress his smirks as he helped his brother to his feet, his face now coated in saliva. \"Three guesses whose bed Rex is sleeping on tonight,\" he whispered too quiet for the others to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get lost,\" Michael growled, shoving him away. To his dismay, this had even less effect than usual. His slim arms pushed against Ryan's chest and achieved nothing. In his new form, Ryan loomed a solid two feet over him. He gave Michael a hard shove, sending him staggering back across the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do that again and I'll have you beheaded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys! No fighting!\" Turning to her husband, Susan said. \"We can't have Michael feeling left out all the time that we're here.

Everyone in the kingdom is invited to celebrate the nuptials!\"  The room burst into applause as more and more computer generated characters appeared.  Now aware of the many eyes on him, Michael whispered to his sister sarcastically, \"Thanks a lot sis.  I was really hoping to be a bride on my first day of this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's better than the alternative, besides, you're so lucky!  You get to become a princess and marry the handsome prince!  It's every girl's dream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a girl!\"  Michael said gritting his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could have fooled me.\"  Ryan said behind Michael.  Michael turned and took a swing but Ryan easily caught the punch, \"You're lucky you're a girl right now or I'd be pounding you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan!  Let go of your sister, I mean brother this instant.\"  Susan said, she tried to walk over and scold her oldest son but was slowed down by Rex who was on all fours and impeding her path.  \"No Rex, you are human now, you can't be acting like a dog.  Bad Rex!  Ryan!\"  The kids mother said, \"There's still a few hours before the wedding, why don't  you try to use that time to teach Rex how to be less dog like, at least try to get him to walk on two legs so we don't have to drag him down the aisle on a leash please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Ryan said letting go of Michael.  Ryan looked at Damien and said, \"Come on squirt, let's get Prince Rex ready for his big day.\"  Damien happily followed Ryan as he grabbed Rex by the collar of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what am I supposed to do in the meanwhile?  I really don't want to have to clean this place up for a few hours.\"  Michael said to his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't have to!  You have to get ready for the wedding!  We have to find the right dress, some flowers, and make up and that's just to start.  They had make up in medieval times didn't they mom?\"  Jessica said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was horrified by the idea, he remembered how Jessica had once tricked him into playing dress up with her once when they were younger, and Ryan and the humiliating pictures he had taken wouldn't let him forget, \"No way!  I don't want to do any of that.  I'm already wearing a freaking skirt, isn't that enough?\"  Michael said pleading with his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we are the royalty and make the rules, so I guess it could be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"  Michael said while Jessica looked crestfallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Susan continued, \"we can't have you off on your own since you aren't royalty yet, so I'm going to let you choose.  Do you want to go with Jessica and get ready for the wedding, or do you want to be with Ryan and Damien and help try to make Rex more...presentable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither option sounded great, but they both sounded a whole lot better than being forced to clean.</span></div></div>",

He sure as hell didn't want to get 'made up' by his sister, but when he compared that to getting made fun of by Ryan for hours, answering awkward questions from Damien, all the while dealing with his overly friendly man-dog he knew what decision he had to make.  Letting out a sigh Michael said, \"I guess I'll go with Jessica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica squealed with joy, she seemed way too happy at Michael's situation as she grabbed Michael by the arm and started pulling him towards a different section of the castle.  Michael looked desperately at his parents for help, but Mark and Susan simply waved and called out, \"See you at the ceremony!\"  Even though this was the first time anyone had ever been in this made up castle, Jessica seemed to know where to go as she led Michael up to a tower.  \"The princess always stays in the highest tower.  We'll stay here and get you ready for the wedding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know.  Can't you just get me a...dress and leave it at that?  It'll be enough.\"  Michael said almost begging.  Jessica only smiled in response, \"Oh silly brother.  I have so much to teach you about womanhood.  You can't just put on a dress and leave it at that.  We have to do your dress, your hair, get some shoes, and we'll probably need a corset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corset?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, that's what mom and I are wearing now.  And if you're going to be royalty, you're going to need one too.  But don't worry, I have a feeling you'll just have to sit back while these things get taken care of for you.\"  Jessica clapped, \"Servants!\"  Suddenly a number of female servants entered the room awaiting instructions which Jessica started dealing out, \"You three, find a corset, shoes, and a dress for Michelle here.  And you two, draw a bath for her with the best soaps and perfumes in the lands.  She had to look and smell her best for the wedding.\"  The servants left and before Michael could complain about the situation, they were back again with the supplies asked of them.  The other two servants then took Michael by the arms took him to the what he guessed was this castle's equivalent of a bathroom where a stone tub filled with water awaited him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strip him, I mean her and clean her girls.\"  Jessica said as the programed servants started to rip away at Michael's cloths leaving him bare.  \"What are you dong?!  Stop!\"  Michael shouted, but the servants didn't listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not royalty quite yet bro, I don't think they'll listen to you quite yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This really isn't necessary Jessica, I can clean myself after ahhh.\"  Michael suddenly felt his anger at the situation melt away in an instant as the beautiful female servants started to rub and wash him down from head to toe.  Michael wasn't happy but he sure felt good.  \"I'll take that as a thank you.  And you're welcome.\"  Jessica said with a smile as she left the room.  \"Servants, when your done with the cleaning help her get dressed for the wedding.  See you down there, <i>sis</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\"  Michael said as he sat back in the tub and enjoyed the almost sensual washing from the servant girls as he let all his worries wash away.</span></div></div>",

He was currently looking at a kinda big, busty, but muscular woman in a white wedding gown.  If he didn't know any better he'd call the woman before him a MILF, but Michael did know better and shook his head getting that particular thought out of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" Michael's kingly father Mark said extending his arm.  \"No.  But I don't exactly have much of a choice though do I?.\"   Michael said as he accepted his father's arm as he began to walk him down the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like the simple 50 yard walk to the alter was a mile long.  Each step felt so slow and what made it even worse was the AI guests at the wedding were all very happy seeming and celebratory.  And Michael couldn't just allow himself to zone out and hope it ended, he had to concentrate with each step or else he would trip up on his way in his flowy white dress.  Finally after what felt like an embarrassing lifetime Michael finally made it to the alter where on one side his mother and sister and on the other side was Damien, Ryan, and Rex.  Michael was very glad to see that Ryan was struggling to keep Rex on two feet and seemed to be too busy to make fun of him.  Finally the AI priest started the ceremony and started droning on and on about holy unions and stuff.  Michael wasn't paying attention because he was too busy trying not to laugh at Ryan who was practically holding Rex in a full nelson.  The rest of your family were also amused by this and luckily all the AI seemed to not mind and was just rolling on with the wedding ceremony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a very long speech, there came the exchange of rings.  Since Rex wasn't exactly capable of such a task, Damien was the one who put thing ring on Michael's finger.  \"Thanks little man.\"  Michael whispered as he grabbed Rex's human arm and after some struggling, was able to put the ring on.  As soon as he did so the priest proclaimed, \"You may now kiss the bride.\"  And with an evil grin on his face, Ryan at last set Rex free who emediatly leaped on his unlucky target, Michael, and began licking Michael's face.  The AI crowd erupted in applause while Michael's family just laughed at Michael's misfortune.  After a few seconds and too much tongue action, Michael was able to crawl out from under Rex's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, great, I'm royalty now.  Can we start enjoying the vacation please?\"  Michael said glad that this was over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was the first to gain composer and stop laughing, \"We will, but not now.  It's already sun down.  But I promise we'll all have fun tomorrow.  I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\"  Michael said dryly as he walked away from his laughing family and headed to his now royal room with Rex following behind him on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down boy, you sleep out here.\"  Michael said to his hunky dog when he got to the room and shut his dog out of the room.  \"Gotta remember, tomorrow is another day.\"  Michael told himself as he stripped down to nothing, and after giving himself a minute to admire his nude form, jumped into bed for a nice nights sleep.  However it wouldn't last as long as he would have liked as he was awoken by an unexpected visitor.</span></div></div>",

He vaguely remembered once hearing something about robots dreaming of electric sheep, but as it turns out he was able to sleep and dream like he normally would.  Well, as normal as it could be under the circumstances.  He dreamed he was once again walking down the aisle and Rex was waiting at the alter.  But instead of being held up by Ryan, Rex was standing upright and tall.  Michael couldn't think of any other word to describe Rex other than handsome.  And before he knew it he was leaning in to kiss the groom, Rex opened his mouth wider and wider and swallowed Michael in one big slimy gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael immediately awoke feeling like he had on a coat of sweat, Michael wiped his forehead and realized it wasn't just sweat, it was slobber as well.  \"What the hell?\"  Michael looked to his side, and right there on top of the bed covers was Michael's dog/virtual husband, still in his now very dirty and worn in wedding garb.  Rex seemed glad to be with his master again, Michael saw that he'd somehow managed to get the door open.  So with an exasperated smile Michael said, \"Fine, you can sleep in here with me boy, but you stay on to of the covers and keep the cloths on.\"  Michael stood up to shut the door and upon realizing he was naked, grabbed the wedding dress and wrapped it around his chest and lower section like a towel.  He may have technically been the only man there, but it still felt weird being naked as a woman with another guy in the room, even if the guy was his dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon examining the door you noticed that there were a great many scratches on the door around the handle, Michael sighed as he shut the door up tight, \"Well, I guess Rex was bound to figure out opposable thumbs sooner or later,\"  And so Michael climbed back under the blankets with a curled up Rex at his side, Michael drifted off to sleep scratching Rex's head and said to himself with a yawn, \"As much as I hate to admit it, today wasn't ideal, but it didn't suck.  Some parts were even kinda...fun I guess.  Heh, oh well, we'll see what tomorrow brings boy, I bet there's no way the computer will be able to top today on the crazy and weird scale.  Night Rex.\"  With that Michael drifted off to sleep, but little did he know, that the computer, as always, was listening.  And always aiming to please the customers begins devising a program specially made for Michael.</span></div></div>",

Down boy,\"  Michael said as he was gently shoving his dog away from him.  Michael took of the covers, stood up, and stretched.  \"Man, I'm not going to get used to this.  I mean yesterday I get turned into a big breasted maid milf, get married to my dog, and that's just day one of this craziness.\"  Michael took a few steps but suddenly began to feel a bit woozy.  \"First step's a doozy,\" Michael half joked to himself, \"Where's the toilet or bedpan or whatever.\"  Michael stumbled his way to the chamberpot in a side room, but before he could sit down to relieve himself, he felt his stomach take a turn for the worse and he vomited into the smelly chamberpot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael continued to hug the chamberpot so to speak for a few minutes when a shout came from the door.  It was his mom Susan, \"Hey honey, are you up?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Michael said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when you're ready for breakfast just call out for some servants to help you get dressed, or if you prefer I could help you if you need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom, but I don't know if I'm up to it, I'm not feeling well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael heard Susan open the door and enter the room, \"Now honey, you don't have to be embarrassed about everything that's been going on.  I know it's not the vacation you hoped for, but you will still have a better time with your family than by yourself in your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really mom, I'm not feeling weaalll.\"  Michael said giving another heaving retch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael!\"  Susan yelled out running to her son's aide, she put pull Michael's hair back with one hand and with the other held Michael's waist.  \"What's going on, this isn't supposed to happen, people aren't supposed to get sick inside the virtual world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael hadn't even thought of his predicament from the perspective, he just assumed he'd had some bad mutton or something.  But what his mom was saying made sense, you weren't meant to get sick in this world.  Suddenly Michael's eyes began to widen with a bit of panic at the idea of something else going horribly wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay baby, don't worry, I'm sure it's nothing.  We'll just get you dressed and go see your father.  I think he can make contact with the administrators so we can ask them what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan helped Michael to his feet, and since it was the only thing there, helped Michael get back into the wedding gown and made their way to the main hall.  When they got their, the rest of the family was already enjoying their meal.  Jessica was the first to notice them, \"Morning Michael, are you getting married again today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan said a little seriously, \"Not now Jessica.  Mark, I think that Michael may be sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not possible here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell that to my stomach.  I've been vomiting all morning.\"  Michael said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan snorted, \"I bet you have morning sickness after enjoying your honeymoon night with Rex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up ass!\"  Michael shouted, he was not in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan kept laughing, but suddenly stopped when he got a look in his eyes, \"Wait, Michael, did Rex sleep in the same bed as you last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said shut the fuck up!  I didn't fuck my dog you sicko!  He just slept at the foot of the bed if you want to fantasize it so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien looked confused, \"Daddy?  What does Michael mean by fu-\" \"Nothing!  It means nothing.  I'll tell you when you're older.\"  Mark said giving Michael a bit of a dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm not making fun of you now bro.  I'm just saying, you know video games.  They don't show it when a man and a woman...you know.\"  Ryan said keeping it vague for Damien's sake, \"A couple just sleeps in the same bed and the next day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no no no I'm not hearing this!\"  Michael said covering up his ears and shaking his head, \"This is all just a bad dream and I'll wake up in bed getting ready to go on vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was doing her best to comfort her distressed son, Ryan got up and immediately contacted the administrator, and Ryan and Jessica tried to distract Damien to keep him from asking any more awkward questions.  Rex even wandered in and climbed onto the table and started digging into the spread.  A minute later Ryan came up to Susan and Michael.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I've confirmed that it is possible to get pregnant in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fan-freaking-tastic.\"  Michael said dryly.  \"Can I just leave now, I'll go hang out in a hotel while you guys enjoy the vacation.  I don't want to deal with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more,\"  Mark said grimly, \"You really do have a digital life form of sorts growing within you and because of that, you can not leave the world as it AI would consider that killing a life form and the computer won't let that happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's eyes widened, \"Are you kidding, so I-I have to stay in this stupid digital world until I fu- I mean freaking give birth?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly yes.\"  Mark said seriously as Susan began to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will it be?\"  Michael said dreading fearing the worst.</span></div></div>",

I have a life! I can't miss nine months of school. What about my exams. And my friends. What am I supposed to tell them?\" He thought of Samantha, the girl he had been meaning to ask out for weeks, and knew she wouldn't even remember him when he got out. With a long, choking sob, he began to cry, tears pouring freely down his face to splash on his cleavage. He saw Ryan try to hide a smirk and that only made things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, honey, it's okay,\" Sarah said soothingly, pulling him into a tight hug. \"It's your hormones. This is going to happen. Just let it all out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair!\" Michael sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know,\" she cooed soothingly. \"Look, don't worry about anything out there. Just focus on keeping yourself well in here. Your real body will be fine. We're all going to be looking out for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\" Michael choked out. \"But you'll be in here with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The vacation is only for a month,\" King Mark spoke up. \"After that, we're expected to leave. I'm afraid it's just going to be you in here on your own. The administrator wasn't happy about it either - they're having to keep the simulation running 8 months longer than expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't leave me here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were quite insistent...\" Mark said helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll work something out.\" Sarah stroked her son's hair gently. \"We've got a while month to prepare. Your father is going to find you the finest physician in the land, Jessica can help find you maternity clothes, and I'll be here to explain everything about morning sickness and the changes to your body. And Ryan...,\" she said, her voice rising over the sound of her sniggering son, her tone hardening. \"Ryan is going questing. A long quest to distant lands. Starting today. So he won't be around to upset you.\"<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n\"I don't see why I have to leave just because you fucked your dog,\" Ryan grumbled, sliding his sword into its scabbard and donning a long traveling cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven through the driving rain, Michael had come down to the drawbridge to see his brother off. It was better than staying in his room, where his Jessica and Sarah were excitedly picking out not just maternity clothes, but baby clothes and tapestries for the nursery as well. The simulation was still playing merry hell with his virtual hormones. He'd finally got a lid on his crying, but the emotions still bubbled beneath. Saying goodbye, he could feel tears welling in his eyes all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we won't be seeing each other for a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully,\" Ryan muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care of my body when you get out. I'm scared something will happen to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan rolled his eyes. \"Jeez, it'll be <i>fine</i>. It'll probably do better without your dumb personality inside it. I might actually be able to get it laid.\" He groaned and looked away as fresh tears began to stream down Mike's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care of yourself too,\" Michael sniffed, straightening his brother's cloak. \"I'm going to miss you.\" Before he knew what he'd done, he'd leaned forward, stretched up on tiptoes, and planted a kiss on the Prince's chiseled jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan shoved him away with a wordless scream of dismay. \"Eugh! Gross! What is <i>wrong</i> with you? God! Make it <i>ten</i> months!\" With that, he turned and hurried across the drawbridge, lest his brother try to kiss him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What <i>is</i> wrong with me?\" Michael muttered to himself. In reality he had been level-headed, dependable. Perhaps it was this woman's body, perhaps it was the baby, but his actions seemed to be slipping out of control. He didn't like how he could feel happy one minute and rotten the next, and be completely powerless to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood there watching his brother vanish into the rain, a hand tugged at his arm. A young handmaiden stood beside him, gently pulling him towards the warmth of the castle. \"My lady, you should not be out here in this weather. You'll catch your death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Michael replied. He tried to shrug her away only to find a second handmaiden clutching his other arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A woman in your condition should be sat beside the fire,\" she insisted. \"Perhaps some knitting, my lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to knit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if from nowhere, there was a third handmaiden throwing a thick, woolen shawl across his shoulders, her slim hands coaxing the Princess the doorway. Michael relented, realising there was no point fighting it. The child growing in his womb was as much a product of the simulation as it was of Rex and himself - it was only natural that the simulation would want to protect it. He allowed the handmaidens to lead him into the castle, where they sat him beside the fire and brought him bowls of hot broth. After a short while, Rex wandered in from outside caked in mud, and curled up at his wife's feet before the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>At least it'll be a comfortable 9 months,</i> Michael conceded.</span></div></div>",

Michael walking into the bathroom, and said loudly, \"I think I'm ready for my morning bath.\"  As soon as he said it, 2 female servants walked into the room.  Michael stretched out his arms in anticipation as the maids removed Michael medieval night gown (which Michael had gotten accustom to wearing to bed) and as soon as Michael stepped into the tub with the perfect level of water at the perfect temperature for absolute comfort, the maids began their gentle (and a bit sensual) scrubbing of Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he let the gentle rubbing of the servants relax him, he thought back on the last month.  As soon as his family had left he was absolutely miserable, but he was able to fight off depression by getting into routines where he would take his time.  He would wake up and spend hours having the maids clean him, dress him, and eventually after much prodding by the maids, put makeup on him.  Michael had even taken up hobbies to pass the time, at first it was cool things like archery, horseback riding, and sword training, but at the behest of many of the handmaidens Michael had started to give into starting to learn more 'appropriate' skills like knitting and cooking.  As Michael zoned out as he thought about which activity he would focus on today he was taken out of his doze by feeling a familiar tongue on his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No boy, the nice ladies are cleaning me now.\"  Michael said to Rex who was on all fours by the tub.  Rex put on a pouty face, Michael sighed, \"Fine, I know what you want,\" and Michael leaned over the tub and scratched Rex on the top of the head with his long and pristine finger nails and as soon as he finished gave Rex a quick peck on the top of his head.  \"You got what you wanted, now go to the dinning hall, now.\"  Rex smiled and turned around and on all fours left the maids to finish their job.  Michael smiled as his dog left.  At first he was really angry and resentful at being put in this situation by Rex, but he quickly got over it.  After all, Rex didn't do it on purpose.  Besides, over the last month Michael had grown very close to Rex, he didn't even really think of him as a pet, but more like a friend.  And this wouldn't have happened if Michael hadn't begged his parents to let Rex stay with him.  When his family was getting ready to leave Michael was getting really depressed at the idea of being stuck in an unfamiliar world with nothing but AI to talk at for 9 months.  Michael argued that he should at least have his dog with him, leaving him alone would be cruel and unusual punishment.  And thankfully his parents decided that Michael was right and left Rex in the simulation with Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, as much as Michael enjoyed his archery and his other hobbies, his favorite project that he had taken up was teaching Rex to be more human.  He'd gotten to the point where if Michael stood him up, Rex could walk around on two feet for a good ways.  Rex was even sitting at the dinner table like a normal person, he still ate by diving into the food head first.  As Michael stood up and let himself get dried off and dressed and made up by the servants Michael thought to himself with a chuckle, <i>Hell, by the end of these 9 months and Rex and I are out of here, I'll have him walking on two legs and acting like a civil human.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Michael made his way into the dinning room and sat down next to Rex, he said to his dog, \"Good to see you made it here without completely ripping up your clothes, good job Rex.\"</span></div></div>",

How did that, well, I guess you were always smart enough, you just didn't have the vocal chords or the practice.  This is so cool Rex!\"  Michael jumped out of his chair and ran over to hug his dog in excitement, \"I'm so proud of you Rex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex responded with, not his usual rough bark like sounds, but with something that kind of resembled, \"Ya yay.\"  And Rex enjoying his master's embrace very much commenced with his usual celebratory licking and washed Michael's chest with his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's eyes somehow got even wider and pushed Rex away while covering his boobs, \"Did...did you just...motorboat me?\"  Michael said not believing the words coming out of his mouth.  Michael didn't know whether to slap Rex or just laugh at the absurdity of what happened.  Michael thought about it, and decided that it was probably just an dumb misunderstand, after all Rex couldn't really know what he was doing right?  Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in a month, Michael looked at Rex and didn't see his beloved dog, but a big strong male who, while he was getting smarter and more human, was also an animal who's actions couldn't be anticipated or controlled.  Michael looked at Rex and realized he had two options, he could continue to try to continue to teach Rex human traits and train him not to do bad or inappropriate things like tonguing his breasts.  Or he could simply treat Rex like what he was, a dog, and discipline him and try to prevent Rex from realizing his potential.  As cool as it could be to have his dog be able to walk and talk, it could also have unforeseen consequences that could get Michael in even more trouble than he already was in.</span></div></div>",

Michael turned to see a very regal looking figure entering the dining area.  This figure wasn't the usual servant who routinely popped up to do medial activities around the castle.  He was decked out in a very regal set of clothing and had an air of importance about him.  The man bowed before Michael and Rex and said, \"Your highness, since the rest of the royal family has stepped down and gone on holiday, I believe that it is time we discuss your coronation so you will officially take the throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Michael said, \"Well, I guess that makes sense.\"  The man's eyebrows shot up and turned his focus solely on Michael, \"Ah yes, you must be the common girl Prince Rex wed.  I'm sorry, what was your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael found himself very angry at the dismissal by the pompous jerk, \"I'm Mich...I'm Michelle.\"  Then quickly added, \"Princess Michelle.\"  As though calling himself a princess would somehow come off as macho thing to say.  \"And who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am one of the Lords of the neighboring region.  You may call me Lord Karn of Valay.  And if you so kindly leave, I must speak with the Prince to discuss his coronation next week.  Why don't you go find a dress for the event.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael really wanted to punch out this misogynist know-it-all, but know the simulation might not take that well and even if he was royalty, he could still be in trouble, especially if the only one who could defend him was his dog who was still growling at the Lord.  Suddenly Michael realized that their might be a problem with the Lord's plans.  There was no way in hell his dog could become the king, event a very lenient computer program might decide that when it sees Rex crawling around and humping peoples legs during an official ceremony that Rex was mad or ill suited to be king and who knows what could happen to Michael then because no matter what happened, he still be stuck there and have to deal with the repercussions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, no my Lord Karn of...uh Valay.\"  Micahel said as he stood up and did a deep curtsy.  \"As you can see now that Prince is quite ill, and I do not believe that he could be crowned yet.  We don't want the people to see it's King not at his best right?  Can't we delay it for...say 8 months?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...the prince does indeed look ill, but I could delay the ceremony no longer than a month, otherwise the commoners may grow worried or restless and our neighboring kingdoms would view it as a sign of weakness and attack us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, a month.  Then the public will see Rex crowned king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yourself Queen my lady.  Now if you will excuse me, I must make the arrangements.\"  With that the pompous Lord left leaving Michael to his thoughts.  He spoke aloud to Rex, \"Damn, I don't think I see a way out of this.  If you don't get crowned as king next month, we could be in big trouble.  And if the ceremony doesn't go off without a hitch, we could still be in big trouble.\"  Michael took a long look at his beloved dog and weighed his options.  \"Looks like I'm going to have to make teaching you human characteristics my #1 priority.  Well, come on Rex, it's going to be a long month.  Now Stand!  No two legs!  TWO LEGS!\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The human training wasn't going well. If anything, Rex's behaviour was becoming worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that he wasn't smart enough to learn what Michael was trying to teach him - if anything, with his simulated mind processing at human speeds, he had become too smart. Smart enough to realise that Michael no longer towered over him, no longer was the source of all delicious foods. Now that Rex was a human, and a Prince to boot, <i>people</i> were obedient to <i>him.</i> He had even taught himself a few words - \"fetch\" being his first and favourite. All he had to do was point at something and \"fetch\" would send servants falling over each other to bring it to him. Even the Lords were submissive and meek in the presence of their soon-to-be King, even as they sneered at the upstart common girl that had <i>dared</i> to marry him. As a woman of lesser birth in this world, Michael had discovered that he had no hold over Rex except a stern voice, and that each time he used it it had less and less effect. The shift in power had not gone unnoticed by Rex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rex! REX! Heel, boy! Stay!\" Michael glowered at his handmaidens, who were tittering among themselves as the Prince chased a cat around the castle yard on his hands and feet, turning his royal clothing to filthy rags. \"Stop encouraging him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, my lady,\" Jane said, hiding her amusement behind her hand. \"Your husband is most willful. Surely you must have known that when you married him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willful? He'll be fucking writing his will if he doesn't shape up.\" Michael groaned as Jane clamped her hands over her ears and began to sing in a sweet but extremely loud voice over the sound his words. As the daughter of a noblewoman, she did this ever time he swore. It was so irritating that he was already watching his Ps and Qs. Some days he felt like he was being trained better than Rex was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a squelch and a shout of triumph as Rex threw himself forward into the dirt and managed to pin the cat, but it squirmed out from beneath him, bolting up a post to the thatched roof above. With its fur bristling, it sat there hissing down at the prince. Unable to reach it, Rex turned to Michael, pointing a finger at the animal. \"Fetch!\" he barked. \"Fetch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is hopeless. Absolutely fff-...flipping hopeless,\" Michael cried, defeated. Lifting his skirt tails above the muddy floors, he turned and marched back into the castle, Jane and Elizabeth at his heels. \"What am I gonna do? When the commoners see him at the coronation, they'll go nuts! I wouldn't be surprised if they revolted!\" Already there were rumblings of dissent. Ever since the King had left, dark rumours had spread through the court, about how a low-born serving girl, unremarkable in looks and approaching her forties no less, had ever succeeded in marrying the second-in-line. There were stories being told of blackmail, of children being born out of wedlock, and -of course- witchcraft. Many of the Lords, particularly those with unwed daughters of age, were pushing for an investigation, even an annulment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you upset, my lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, just piss-... peeved off,\" Michael grumbled. \"I know he can learn this stuff, he just doesn't want to. He can't be punished because a the Prince and I can't reward him with anything because there isn't anything he doesn't already have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane blushed a deep scarlet, lowering her voice to a hush. \"I hardly dare speak it, but I have heard it said that some women might... deny their marital obligations in the bedchamber, seeking to make their husbands more open to their persuasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to happen,\" Michael said firmly. He'd first have to supply his wifely duties if he wanted to deny them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is...one person you might try,\" Elizabeth spoke up. \"My Aunt was once a governess in her younger days. In her time, she tutored many young Lords, even the child prince Damien. Though she was strict she was very effective, so much so that they used to call her the Kingmaker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Kingmaker?\" Michael grinned. \"That's exactly what we need. Can you get her to the castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth squirmed uncomfortably. \"Perhaps but... she is a fallen woman. My mother refuses to acknowledge her. Unwed but with a child, and worse... She owns a building in the town, living and... working with other unmarried women. Hiring her should be a simple matter; my mother says she will do anything for a handful of copper coins.\"</span></div></div>",

Not only did Michael not have any desire to perform his 'wifely duty', but even if he did do as Jane suggested, he had no idea if it would work.  Rex was still more dog in mind than human, and Michael had no idea what would happen if he actually went through with it.  No, he needed help, and this Kingmaker seemed like the perfect thing to get Rex in King's shape.  Sure it would mean associating himself with a house of ill repute, but hopefully in a few months he won't have to worry about anything he does here with the computer programs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elizabeth, we must see your aunt.  There is no time to waste.\"  Michael said making his way for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me your highness, but is it such a good idea for the princess to be seen entering a place like...'that'.  Wouldn't it be best if I go see her as your representative?\"  Elizabeth said timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael realized his servant had a good point.  \"No, I must go and speak with her myself, but you're right about my appearances.  Go fetch, I mean, go get me a set of servant's clothing so that I can go there unnoticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth and Jane seemed appalled at the idea of the princess wearing commoner garb, but did not want to disobey Michael's orders and quickly fetched some of Michael's old servant robes and making sure nobody saw, changed Michael's clothing and quickly left the castle.  Michael was a bit in awe at what he saw, there was no loading or buffering of any sort, outside of this castle that he'd been cooped up in for a month was a living breathing world.  Michael admired the view but for a moment, he had business to take care of.  Quickly Elizabeth lead him through the streets and down alleyways until they reached a large house that was both run down and fabulous.  The building itself looked to be falling apart at the seams with giant cracks and chunks of stone just missing.  However besides that the building was beautiful with very elegant decorations and flowers everywhere.  The old phrase 'polishing a turd' came to Michael's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth quickly took Michael into the building and made their way to a dingy room in the back where a woman was waiting.  \"Hello aunt Maria.  You are needed in a matter of great urgency.\"  Maria looked the women before her up and down.  Even though Maria was a woman in her 40's and had visibly lived a long and hard life, she was still very strikingly beautiful and carried herself with strength and confidence.  As Maria got an idea of what she was dealing with she said to Michael, \"So you must be the new royalty, never expected you to make your big debut here of all places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shot daggers at Elizabeth wondering if she had been leaking information to her aunt.  But Maria suspected this and said, \"Oh don't get mad at my poor niece, it's obvious.  I know everyone else in the royal family...some more than others.  And you carry yourself much like they do.  Now, what can I do for you.  I suspect you're here for business, but I don't know what kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael stepped forward and said, \"I need the help of you, the woman who has been called the Kingmaker.  Rex, my...husband, is set to be crowned king within a month.  However he is...recovering for a disease that has debilitated him and greatly diminished his sense.  I can not get him ready to be king alone.  I need your help, I'll pay you however much you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria seemed to be deep in thought, and finally said, \"I accept, but I don't want money, I want you to do something for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it's not everyday I get a request from the soon to be queen.  I can get gold from anyone.  If I'm doing something for you I want something unique.  Something I can hold up high as something special that no one else can have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was suddenly nervous, he'd just been expecting to give this woman a pile of his pretty much unlimited supply of gold.  \"What do you want?\"</span></div></div>",

He frowned, that wasn't what maids wore back in medieval times, but before he could open his mouth to point out this little error in the program, a Matronly woman entered wearing a maids outfit but looking slightly more fancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up straight girls!\" She said in a commanding tone, instantly all the girls stood up straight nervously, the womans gaze falling to Michael \"That means you too, unless you think your royalty!\" Michael frowned and pointed a finger at her \"Now listen here, my family paid for this holiday and I...\" His voice trailed off as he saw the black sleeve of his dress, glancing down he saw he was wearing a matching outfit to the other girls. Stunned and blushing, he didn't even notice the woman close the distance to him, or her, until she had a firm grip on her ear and twisted it painfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see we have a bit of a trouble maker here, well dont worry, you will soon learn what makes a good maid in this castle!\" Michael shrieked in pain and quickly relented, apologising repeatedly until she let go of her ear.

The VR subtly imbedded these commands and conditions into her mind to help her stay in character, usually for the enjoyment of the customer but now it was making Michelle a better maid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the evening she finally was done with her days training and quietly hurried about the hallways looking for her family, finding porters and other people about the castle kept giving her little tasks to do on her way, she finally spotted one of her family in their room and her face broke into a relieved grin. She quickly went to the room and knocked on the open door politely, blinking at her knuckles as she had intended to just barge in, but a maid wouldn't do such a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is given permission to enter...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michael's eyes widened in shock. No... no... they couldn't! They couldn't just send him off like that! Perhaps it was a mistake, maybe his eyes were playing tricks. After all, the code was going so fast. Maybe he just misread something. He's here on vacation, right? They wouldn't just do this to a paying customer... right? As Michael continuously attempted to calm himself down, the room was slowly loading, revealing the interior of it. Michael quickly begin to discern a wooden floor that was reminiscent of a hut or a shack. Michael tried to gaze upwards, but found that his head was still stuck at an angle that caused him to gaze downwards and to the right, no doubt a result of the program still loading him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time unfroze, everything seemed to lighten in color as Michael felt that he could move his limbs again. Michael sighed as he proceeded to assess the damage. His first move was to grope his chest and he immediately discovered only disappointment. His fingers sunk into a mass of flesh that confirmed his guesses as he moaned as a result from grabbing them too quickly. Yep, he still had breasts. Michael sighed again as he glanced downwards to visually confirm his troubles. He had to stop his jaw from dropping as his breasts came into sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose weren't just any breasts - those were tits. No, perhaps calling them tits would be an understatement. They were huge. Michael didn't know much about bra sizes, he only really knew up to the letter H, but these tits were bigger than those girls with fake breasts he had seen in porn magazines that were labeled as \"K cup\". Michael gulped as he prodded his boobs with his hands, semi-hoping that these were just an illusion, or at the very least, a trick of perspective. But the more he prodded, the more he realized that he was truly stacked. His tits were spilling over his dainty hands and covering them completely... not to mention the weight, which strained his back immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nipples were also poking out of his dress visibly. Curious, Michael pulled the hem of his dress to be greeted by nipples as hard as rock candy. They matched his tits as they were also quite big, the size of a marble or so. Michael released his grip as the dress jumped back to its natural state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, just great!\" Michael thought as he circled the room he was in. It was archaic, with a wooden table standing in the middle of it and nearly no other furniture or appliances surrounding it other than a set of chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a way to start a vacation!\" Michael mumbled as he subconsciously began chewing on his nails. \"First, I become a girl. Then, I get transported out of the castle to become another girl, and a busty one at that.\" Michael didn't yet know that the body he was currently residing in wasn't a girl's, but a full-fledged woman's that had already come of age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I have such big boobs? Is this how the company visualize peasant girls to be or was a special body selected just for me?\" Michael was already guessing that the line of code he saw wasn't quite an illusion that his brain thought up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, where am I?\" Michael finally stopped grumbling as he took a look at his surroundings. However, before he has the chance to really observe anything, he heard the screech of the door opening. He spun around as he noticed a large, chiseled man, who looked like he was in his late twenties, enter the house, while taking off his work boots. Michael gazed in awe as he saw someone that looked like lumberjack ruffle his black hair before approaching him. Michael was slightly intimidated as the large man towered over him, thinking that he was probably done for. Contrary to expectations, he didn't encounter the trouble he was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How have you been doing, my young one?\" The man asks Michael in his deep voice as he pulls him in for an embrace. Michael was befuddled by this sudden change of character as the tall, intimidating man turned into a seemingly loving and caring person. Michael's brain went into overdrive to explain this as he whiffed the sweaty scent of the man that was currently warmly pressing himself to her. Why would he do this to him? Unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, um, I have been doing fine.\" Michael choked out the words that were barely audible due to the shirt of the man muffling his voice. He looked upwards as he forced a fake smile and said, \"Um, how have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, very good!\" The man laughed, releasing Michael. Unbeknownst to him, Michael was nearly at his limit as the pain from having his tender breasts squeezing against the man was accumulating. Fortunately, the man didn't leave him with anything but a pair of sore breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have just finished forging the ceremonial sword for the king. Even though he was coronated five years ago, for some reason he didn't have one until now.\" The man guffaws. \"I'm in a good mood because of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael tries to follow the conversation as he asks, \"Why would you be in such a good mood because of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as if though all the color form the man's face faded as his boisterous laughter ceased, quickly replaced by a frown. \"What you don't remember? You don't remember the promise we made two years ago?\" The man asks as he puts both of his hands on Michael's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael quickly shook his head as he stammered, \"No, s-sorry, I forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man seemed to be on the verge of an explosion before he quickly retreated his arms and shrugged his shoulders. \"Ah, no matter, I can just remind you. You see, when I - John, the son of a blacksmith - married you, I promised to not consummate until I achieved my greatest ambition, to design an acceptable piece for his Majesty to use. And have worked hard for days on end, until I finally finished my masterpiece. And today is the day I did it. So the time has come for us to consummate our marriage!\" John pulled in Michael for another embrace that seemed to last a century.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is that so?\" stammered Michael as he realized what John, his husband right now, was implying. Michael was horrified at the prospect of having sex with a man right now. This was definitely not the vacation he was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, my dear. Sorry, but dinner will have to wait,\" said John, as he scooped up Michael into his arms and proceeded to the bedroom. Michael tried to thrash in his arms but quickly found that it was useless as John was carrying him as if though he was weightless. As they finally reached their destination, John put Michael on the large, but hard bed before taking off his shirt. Noticing his stillness, John gestured at Michael to take off his dress and chaperon. \"I know that you are nervous for your first time, but trust me, it's going to go well,\" he said as he accompanied his words with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat John didn't know was that Michael wasn't exactly worried about having sex for the first time, he was worried about having sex with a guy! As he pulled the dress over his head, with the boobs getting in the way, he wondered how he could stoop so low. Here he was, about to consummate with a man, as a peasant girl. His chain of thoughts was quickly broken as he gasped from the sight he saw when John took off his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis penis, that was hanging limp, was massive, at about 10 inches long and quite thick as well. Michael couldn't help but compare it to the penis in his real life, noting that his was much smaller than that. However, he wasn't given much time as John laid his hand on Michael's head and guided it to the penis. Michael tried to resist, but as the penis was rubbed all over his lips, he resigned to his fate as he took it in his mouth and began suckling on it. Michael slowly bobbed his head as he felt the penis hardening in his mouth and quickly getting bigger. He noted that he wasn't gagging as much as he thought he would, perhaps the body given to him was adept at this sort of stuff. As Michael bobbed his head, he was mentally crying over the irony in the situation. He was expecting pretty girls to be giving blowjobs on this vacation, but certainly not that he himself would be that pretty girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs John's dick grew to full length, he retracted it out of Michael's mouth as it glistened with spit and pre-cum. John pushed him on his back as he straddled Michael. Resigned to his fate, Michael spread his legs as he mentally prepared himself. He was going to lose his virginity today, but certainly not in the way he thought he would, and certainly not with the sexual organ he thought he would. John, however, finally found a comfortable position as he guided his cock to Michael's vagina... and thrust it in in one go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael moaned as he felt the swollen member enter his snatch. He was expecting a painful start, but was surprised to know the entire experience was pleasurable. Taking that as a sign of approval, John began thrusting in and out as Michael began moaning even louder. He tried to cover his mouth with his hands to reduce the sound, but quickly found that he wasn't able to deafen much as John sped up his thrusting. Michael didn't even notice that he subconsciously wrapped his legs around the man that was fucking his pussy right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Michael noticed that John's breathing was speeding as he felt his dick twitching inside of him. He realized that John would soon be cumming and tried to escape, but the man's weight was too great compared to his weak muscles right now. Seconds later, he felt a warmth spreading inside him as he realized that John just blew his load inside his pussy. Panting, John asked, grinning, \"Want to go for another round?\"</span></div></div>",

His belly had not grown much yet so he was unsure whether he was pregnant or not. He had surveyed the entire village for anything to help him get back to the capital or out of the simulation but to no avail. He then got the thought that maybe he will never be able to leave. The only thing that comforted him was his husbands warmth and kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn stormed in, startling her. He enthusiastically told her to come quick. Michael did so without questions asked.

Michael realized that he could finally get out of here and end this. And as he finishes that thought a scout had stopped on the road by them. \u201cHis royal majesty himself will be here shortly, make room! Back up!\u201d the scout shouted and then dismounted his horse and stepped aside as the townsfolk followed his orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the ground started to shake as the sound of the royal mounted guard were closing in. Some people ignored the scout\u2019s order to get a better view of the caravan which made the scout even angrier than what he seemed to be before. \u201cGet back!\u201d He yelled, ready to draw his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael and John watched as the royal carriage halted in front of them. The king and the queen exited the carriage as all peasants cheered, including Michael and John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael knows he can\u2019t just walk up to his parents in his current form.

Its as if they've been sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan frowned and stared at Michael, watching him...or her, frantically attempt to open their mouth to get a word in about the whole thing. \"...our every whim?\" she asked tentatively. \"Yes, my lady.

We didn't pay for-\" \"Yes, it is.\" interrupted Reginald. \"What the fuck are you-\" \"You signed the contract, Mark.\" he said, suddenly breaking character. \"This is the kind of thing that can happen.

And the maiden here will experience serving you in whatever way you desire until the simulation ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the family was a little nervous, now, except for Ryan, who seemed to be grinning, as if he was planning something. \"Anything I desire, huh?\" he said under his breath...which Michael heard. He would've yelled at him, but his lips were still sealed. \"Anyway, I believe I'll be off. But don't consider me gone. Whenever you desire me, when you turn around, I'll be there.\" And with a burst of pixelated smoke, he was gone. The family stood for a few moments, taking all this in, before Susan finally noticed Mark pointing at his lips with a look of rage. \"Oh, right! You may speak, Michael.\" \"...this is bullshit!\" he began, which sounded somewhat absurd in his new form. \"Did you even read the contract, dad?!

Not only was his vacation ruined because of a seeming glitch in the system, he now was stuck inside the body of a maid for god knows when. Giving into his emotions, Michael couldn't help but angrily spout, \"And how exactly will I be able to do <i>that</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!\" Mark shouted, before kicking himself mentally at giving into a moment's rage. \"Sorry, you can speak. But think of it this way: you get to experience an entirely new life, separate from our own.

And I don't want to be a <i>girl</i>.\" Michael whined, clearly unnerved by his situation. He didn't fancy cleaning the castle halls during his vacation, while his family got to enjoy parades and fights while being pampered. He wanted to be a part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear, maybe we should call support again and try to get them to fix this situation? He's still a part of family and it is awfully unfair if we get to enjoy the experience while Michael has to take the fall.\" Susan whispered to her husband, though it didn't prevent anyone from hearing her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark shook his head. \"No. From what I read in the contract, each person must act the role that they weren't assigned, with no do-overs allowed. And unfortunately, I didn't check whether any roles were limited from being chosen. We should be lucky that he wasn't turned into the family horse!\" Mark chuckled, though it was clear that only he was amused by his own joke. Realizing that, Mark cleared his throat before turning his head and locking eyes with Michael. \"Look, we aren't going anywhere until we all enjoy this, you included. So be a good bo-... <i>ahem</i>, <i>girl</i> and play along,\" Michael emphasized girl even while looking at the woman who could be his wife, or even his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can still put him into a dress,\" Jessica suggested as she shrugged her shoulders. While she didn't exactly care about the situation, she was still particularly close to Michael as he was the sibling that bothered her least out of all her brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he can get a word in, Michael was quickly interrupted. \"No no no! Let him stay like this!\" Exclaimed Ryan as he was clapping his hands, clearly amused about this situation. Damien said nothing, but he was getting jittery from boredom, wanting to roam around the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet everyone.\" Mark finally spoke up, irritated from the excessive chattering that went on. \"My say on this as the king is final and I might as well say this to make the decision once and for all. Michael, I hereby announce that you will serve as a wench until the day comes that you enjoy it. Before that, you will toil effortlessly day in and day out to fulfill your role's requirements. That is all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlustered, Michael wanted to object, but could only utter, \"Yes, your majesty.\" As soon as he finished, he turned around to head out of the throne room, not realizing that he was walking in a womanly manner. Susan can only watch quietly as she pitied her son for the fate that befell him, while Ryan licked his lips as he watched his (former) brother shake his ass while gracefully exiting the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we got the troublemaker out of the way, let's be on our merry way, shall we?\" Mark announced as he saw his youngest son Damien playfully running to the exit as well, eager to explore the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Michael was cursing his entire family for putting him into this predicament. His stupid father for not properly reading the contract and then forcing him into this role. His mother who meekly agreed to his assertion with only the slightest objection. His sister for being so nonchalant about the entire situation. And his brother Ryan for being, as he called him, \"a fuckface\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMumbling under his breath, Michael proceeded to the servant quarters to get instructions and possibly equipment. He knew from playing many simulators that maids often had a head maid that would appoint work to the other maids and direct them to their post. When he finally arrived, he saw that the other workers were already in there, getting ready for today's work. The head maid, directing the other maids, noticed Michael as soon as he arrived before furrowing her brow and picking up a small wooden stick used for cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late.\" The head maid sternly said as she walked up to Michael. \"Hold out your hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Michael held out his hands, which was quickly followed by three lashes with the stick, each more painful than the last. Choking on tears at the unexpected pain, Michael withdrew his stinging hands promptly after he noticed the head maid stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This shall be enough to remind you for later occasions.\" The head maid said as she threw the stick into the corner of the room. \"You shall be working in the gardens today, trimming the bushes. I expect you not to disappoint me, Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding his head, Michael had to hold back his laughter at the unexpected revelation. It seems that while he did change gender, his name stayed the same for the duration of this vacation. As the head maid walked away, Michael noticed a set of shears on the bench. Quickly picking them up, he proceeded to exit the quarters and move towards the castle gardens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he arrived there, he gasped at the amount of work that he was given. The gardens seemed to expand for many acres of land, and he was expected to trim all the bushes before the sun sets... alone! Groaning, Michael decided that it was best to start immediately so as to not be punished for leaving any work left over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Michael was only able to work for 15 minutes before he heard a voice from behind.</span></div></div>",

Understood Michael? You can talk now.\"<br>\r\nMichael couldn't believe this, he could have expected this from Ryan, but even his father wanted to fuck him as if he was just a normal maid NPC. He wanted to push Ryan away, scream, cry and run away, but all he could do was nodding while saying \"Yes your highness, i'll do as you ordered me\" while smiling in what seemed a sexy way for him.<br>\r\nRyan got an hard on, thinking at what he'll be able to do with this hot maid that once was his brother, and Michael felt it and looked down surprised, even if he was actually scared at what was going to happen.<br>\r\nRyan got up and helped Michael stand up too, enjoying the sexy way she got up. \"Let's get somewhere less open... lead the way\" he said smirking and pointing at the servant quarters.<br>\r\nUnwillingly Michael started to walk toward the building, when she got stopped by Ryan, pulling one of her arms. \"Wait a second\" he said looking at Michael turning toward him saying \"Yes your highness?\" Ryan pointed at her dress smirking \"before going, make this outfit a bit more... sexy. And for a bit you should know what i mean right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes your highness, as you please\" said Michael smiling while he wanted to die inside. He felt his hands going up to her breasts and rip slightly open the top, showing even more of his cleavage, for his brother's happyness. Then he moved his hands to the bottom of his skirt, ripping it till just a bit lower than his ass, then ripped it horizontally making almost all of the skirt fall on the ground when finished, leaving his legs to the air, feeling a slightly cold breeze on them. <br>\r\nAll the time, Ryan was oogling at the spectacle happening before his eyes, he couldn't believe that his brother is now an older hot chick ready to get fucked by him whichever way he wanted.<br>\r\nWhen he sees the maid looking at him in a sexy pose, waiting for the next order, he snapped out of it, feeling his cock getting even harder, and enjoying the way she looked at his buldge getting even bigger, knowing that his brother was probably screaming terrified from what was happening inside this beauty.<br>\r\n\"Ok, now it's way better, lead me inside.\" As soon as he finished saying this, she turned around and started to walk like only porn stars or professional strippers could do. \"I should really thank the producers of this thing to have uploaded that way of moving\" he said under his breath.<br>\r\nGetting inside Michael was greeted by the faces of all the maids still there looking at him and his dress with stupefied looks on them. And by the head maid, that seeing the dress ripped like that started to fume, picked up the stick and started to walk toward him. \"What have you done to your dress you bit-\" saying this she was loading the hit with the stick.<br>\r\nSeeing this Michael could only try to protect himself with his hands, ready to be slashed by it. But luckily Ryan entered the room at that moment, and so the head maid stopped and moved the stick to her back saying \"You... your highness, what a pleasure to see you.\"<br>\r\nRyan looked at the head maid and the other maids. \"I would like you all to leave me here alone with Michael, and once you get out, close all the windows and door, so that none could see inside. And for her dress\" he pointed at Michael skirt, \"I ordered her to make it like that, so don't punish her. Plus from tomorrow you all won't be dressed so differently from how she looks now. Oh and go to the storage room, or wherever you keep the servants dresses, there are the new uniforms for the maids, put them on and let one just outside the door for her\" he said clearly enjoying the idea.<br>\r\nThe head maid could only nod and order the other maid to close everything and get out like ordered.<br>\r\nLeft alone in the room, with only candles making some light, Ryan got closer to his ex-brother now maid caressing her arm saying \"I quite saved your sexy ass there, uh\" and smiling he slapped her ass, hearing a girlish and happy \"eep!\" followed by a sexy smile from the maid. \"Yes your highness, if it weren't for you, i would have surelly being slashed with that stick by that evil head maid for what you made me do to my dress.\"<br>\r\nRyan laughed. \"I see that you still haven't lost your way of talking completely. But that isn't a bad thing.\" He said while sitting on a chair. \"Now, show me your gratitude by slowly stripping down, giving a generous lick to my naked bulge here, and riding it as only a porn star could do?\" While saying this he was always smiling and opening his legs, moving them foward, to let the space for her sexy hips to sit on his.<br>\r\nMichael couldn't believe this, he was hoping it was just a dream and that he was going to wake up right now, or if this was real that someone would remove him from this reality. But all of these thoughts disappeared as soon as he felt his hands move up to her shoulders, slowly removing the dress, turning around and making it fall like a stripper would do, and then to his hips, removing what was left of the skirt and slowly moving it to his feet, showing his bare ass and pussy to his brother, and looking behind with a sexy smile and winking, seeing Ryan already starting to jerking off at the display. \"How could i ever enjoy this, will i be stuck in here forever, sucking my brother's and possibly father's dicks?\" Michael thought as he turned around and sexily walked toward the jerking off prince, kneeling before him, between his legs, looking straight at his cock.<br>\r\nRyan couldn't handle this anymore, and started to jerk off at the look of his former brother, now hot maid, stripping for him. Then he got even more excited as she moves closer to him sexily and kneeled between his legs, licking his rod from bottom to top. The sensation was incredible, and he could help himself but said to her \"Again, do this again and again... i want you to suck it till i explode!\"<br>\r\nHearing this order, Michael started to suck on his brother's cock, giving him a professional blow job, while unconsciously starting to fingering himself, after all he as ordered to enjoy this, even if only as surface.<br>\r\nMoaning he kept sucking it till he heard Ryan start to scream, and felt his cock shooting his load on his mouth, while he was really far from climax.<br>\r\nMichael sensually moved his face away from his brother's cock, finally able to move himself \"freely\" as he finished his orders, and started to move looking for something in which spit the load of his brother. But he was stopped by Ryan \"Michael, get closer, let me see what is in your mouth\" he said while still panting.<br>\r\nMichael understood what was going to happen, and he didn't like it. He would want to spit that in Ryan's face and run away. But instead he sensually walked toward Ryan, still sit on the chair, and getting closer, opened his mouth, showing at him the jizz inside it.<br>\r\nSeeing this Ryan smiled and got closer to Michael's ear and, putting a finger under her throat, whispered to her \"swallow it, and show me that you have done it properly\"<br>\r\nAs soon as it was ordered, Michael swallowed hard \"-gulp-\" to make Ryan feel it with his finger. Michael felt so humiliated. Then smiling opened his mouth toward his brother, showing him that nothing was left.<br>\r\nRyan got up laughing \"I hope that you liked this, cause i surelly did, and we will do this a lot of times from now.\" He adjusted his pants and dried the sweat on his face, fixing the hairs, then walked toward the door opening it, to find the outfit left there as ordered.<br>\r\nAfter picking it up, he turned around and throwed it to Michael. \"Put that on, it's your new maid dress. Luckily dad found that they uploaded it and other nice stuff in here, to make things more enjoyable. Think, if we go to the castle mage, we can even get potions to transform people if various way: gender, looks, size even if only smaller, and even into objects. I'm telling you this only cause i know that sooner or later you would have found out, but now i can order you to never go there alone without a specific order from us royal family, and that if you'll ever go there, you'll only take what we order you to take, understood?\"<br>\r\nMichael nodded \"Yes your highness, as you order\". He couldn't believe this, the solution at all his problems was just there, but now he won't be able to go there anymore, all thanks to his pervert brother and stupid father.<br>\r\n\"Good, now put that on, let's see how it fits.\" said Ryan smiling.<br>\r\nMichael stood up and started to put the dress on while looking at a small mirror that was in the room, to have it fixed in the right way seeing this<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/1257495836_1/Top-quality-ML5345-Free-shipping-Strapless-Corset-Style-with-White-Lace-Edging-Adult-Alice-French-Maid.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/12574...</a><br>\r\nand his brother's smile<br>\r\n\"Perfect! oh dad was looking for you, go to his room\" said Ryan while leaving.<br>\r\nAs ordered, Michael started to walk walk toward the royal chambers, fearing what his dad could do to him seeing what his brother did.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Michael was walking, thinking at how strange it was that he was able to walk with those heels so well, he heard another familiar voice.<br>\r\nTurning around he sees his sister, Jessica, looking at him from a bit far away and shouting. \"Hey sexy maid, why don't you come with me? I've found some nice place.\" Turning around and starting to walk while waving her hand in a follow-me way.<br>\r\nHearing the command, he turned around and started to walk after his sister thinking \"Maybe after all of this I've got a lil lucky and won't have to end up doing that thing again... After all my sister, even if not much, seemed the more worried about me\".<br>\r\nAfter walking for some minutes, they reached a hidden part of the garden, with a fancy structure, even if not too big, and a gigantic pool with sliders and other water games. At the sides of the pool there were some sun loungers with beach umbrellas and little tables, and a bit further a bar with drinks, ice-creams, towels and other things that could be used near the pool.<br>\r\nSuddenly an \"Ahem!\" made by his sister made Michael snap out from the view and turn toward her. \"Yes my princess? What can I do for you?\" Michael wanted to bite his tongue for how he was talking to his twin sister, but remembering what happened some minutes ago, this seamed a lot more acceptable.<br>\r\nJessica starts to giggle as how her ex brother, not maid, turned around and talked so politely to her, but got herself together in a second.<br>\r\n\"I think that I'll lay here for some hours to sun bath a bit and you'll stay here with me to give me drinks and stuff, ok?\" Says Jessica while smirking at her maid.<br>\r\nMichael was quite happy about this, but found himself saying \"My princess, I've been told by prince Ryan that the king was looking for me, is it really ok if i stay here with you?\" Now he was really scared, if his sister sends him back, he'll have to see what his father wants to do with him.<br>\r\nJessica looks at the sexy face of her maid and giggles saying \"Oh don't worry, I'm sure that dad won't mind if I keep you for myself for a bit. So go to the bar, take a few towels and prepare a sun lounger for me, I'll be right back.\" Turns around and walks in the fancy structure, that surelly is a changing room, closing the door after her.<br>\r\nSeeing this Michael puts himself to work and starts to prepare the place for her sister with towels and one of her favourite fruit drink putting ice in it, he doesn't know why he prepared that too, but shrugs about it thinking that it was part of the program to please her.<br>\r\nHearing the door opening, he stands turning around, seeing his sister coming out from the changing room dressed in a bikini and sandals with cork heels. If he wasn't blocked cause of the program and if he didn't know that she was a older (and so sexier) version of his sister, he would have dropped his jaw to the ground.<br>\r\nJessica casually walks near her maid and spins around casually, to show every side of hers to the maid, asking her what she thinks of her looking, smirking pleased as Michael opens her mouth but wasn't able to say a word. \"Am I that good in this bikini? Cause if I can make even you lose your words, I can't imagine what other guys in the pools will do, when I'll reach this age.\" Says Jessica smirking while thinking at what she could possibly do with a crowd of guys drolling after her.<br>\r\nThen she starts to walk and lays down on the sun lounger that Michael prepared, kicking her sandals off, crossing her legs and noticing the drink that her brother prepared for her. Giggling she takes the straw and takes a sip, tasting it. \"Hmmmm... you made it really tasty, you know? When we'll get out from here I'll have to ask the producers if there is a possibility to keep you like this, it'll be really fun.\" Says while giggling and looking at her maid now scared eyes, even if the face haven't changed expression. <br>\r\n\"Michael, be a dear and place my sandals near the lounger in order, after all we aren't animals right? And after that kneel down and give me a nice foot rub, I'll tell you to help me put on the sun cream, but here we don't need it.\" <br>\r\nShe expected some kind of reply by her brother like \"Then you shouldn't have kicked 'em like that\" and \"Why should I touch your stinky feet?\" But all that she hears is \"Yes my princess, I'll start to work immediately.\" And sees the sexy maid walking while shaking her hips, bending down in a really sexy way to both pick up and put down the sandals, and obediently kneeling down before her feet and starting to rub them. There Jessica starts to think that something is quite off, even if she likes this, this isn't how her brother would behave. So she tries another thing.\"You know what? Why don't you give to my cute soles a few kisses here and there? And I won't mind if you put the tongue in these kisses too, so be generous.\" She giggles while saying this closing her eyes relaxing, and even if she kinda likes the idea of having someone kissing her feet, she know that her brother won't stay quiet about this, even if he is playing at the good maid. But she hears a \"As you please, my princess\" and opening her eyes, she sees the beautiful face of the maid getting closer to her feet and kissing them a couple of times, putting her tongue into it too! Jessica's jaw dropped and she finds herself without words for a few moments.<br>\r\nMichael was cursing himself. Not only he ended up giving his brother a blow job, now he is even kissing his sister feet. For how much hot he thinks that she is, he would have never kissed a girls feet like this. And now he is starting to worry about what might happen, if even Jessica will start to abuse of him, after all she was the last ray of hope with his mother to be able to live normally this vacation. But looking up to her face, between the kisses, he sees that she is really surprised of his behavior, and starts to think \"Probably she doesn't know of what my brother ordered me, and maybe she can help me if I she let's me explain things to her.\"<br>\r\nJessica lifts her back a bit, getting in a sit down position, looking at the maid that is kissing her feet with wide open eyes. \"Why are you actually doing it? Is it cause I look like this or what? Speak now!\" Then thinking for a second she added \"But don't stop your massage and kissing, it feels really good\" giggling.<br>\r\nMichael would jump of happines hearing this, but his body won't move, cause he has to keep massaging and kissing his sister's feet, but even if it's humiliating, at least he can tell her his story.<br>\r\n\"As the princess know, I was with Ryan before.\" Jessica interrupts him \"Yes when he told you to go to dad.\" \"Yes, but before that he made me do something for him, and gave me some orders, that seems that come from the king himself.\" \"What did that pervert made you do? Dance? Strip? I know for sure that this wasn't the dress that you had when we logged, and which were the orders?\" \"Well princes... I did a strip tease for him, and then he ordered me to give him a blow job, swallowing.\"<br>\r\nJessica's jaw dropped again, she couldn't believe it and thought \"Ryan has ordered Michael to give him a bj? Ok, I know that she is sexy and stuff, but cmon, she is... was our brother, he can't simply do that to him... her. But there is the fact that the guide told us to stop to treat her like a member of our family, or as a guy, and that she has to obey at our every whim, but there is a limit to everything...\" She looks at her sexy servant kissing her feet, feeling her tongue moving on her sole while doing it. \"Hmmm... but this feels good, to be able to control a person, a REAL person this much...\" She pinches her brother's nose with her big and second toes for a moment without thinking about it, kicking herself for what she has done to her \"No, even if she is a hot maid, programed to do whatever i want, she is still my brother, i can't do this to him.\" She stops her train of thoughs looking at her brother's face, that is still kissing her feet while asking her \"And which order did he gave you that comes form the king?\"<br>\r\nMichael got surprised when his sister pinched his nose with her toes, finding it strange after all that he has told her about his brother's abuse, but starts to answer. \"The prince told that he talked with the king, and choose to have me behave like the girl that I am, that I can't talk to you and the rest of the royal family as if you were my family, and that I have to please all of you in every way you find fitting, and even if i could find it humiliating or hate it, I have to behave as if I'm enjoying it, as kissing your royal soles now, and finally to never go on my own to the magician tower, but to go there only with one of you, or by your order, and to only get what you want.\" Michael finishes speaking and resumes kissing the soles without interruptions, wondering if his sister will help him or not.<br>\r\nJessica looks at him surprise about the order, even if not that much. \"So you telling me that you'll do whatever we say, without complaing but making an happy face, and that we are allowed to use all the funny stuff that is in the magician tower to play with you? Like shrinking you and make you lick my insoles clean or transform you into panties or food and use you as such?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, if this is what will please my princess I'll do it gladly\" Michael found himself saying that, but he is actually scared, his sister is letting her mind run too much, he risks to lose her as an ally but adding her to the abuses party.<br>\r\nHearing the answers Jessica lays back again saying \"Keep kissing and be quiet, I need to think for some minutes.\" She takes her drink in hand and starts to drink using the straw, looking at the maid kissing her feet as if she was birth to do that, immersed in deep thought.<br>\r\n\"I can't allow them to do this kind of things to her, she is family... even if right now she is just a maid, like all the others, made just to obey our every whim... No! I can't! It's still Michael, my stupid twin brother... that totally deserves it for being a pain in the ass...\"<br>\r\nWhile fighting between herself like this, Jessica finds out that she has started to touch herself under the bikini bottom, and looking in the eyes of a terrified (even if only them, cause the rest of the face seems pleased) maid, that is looking at her masturbating, she choose to</span></div></div>",

I think that I'll join dad and Ryan in their little game, after all it's really funny to have you do whatever I want, when I want.\" She says so while starting to caress her ex-brother's face with her bare foot, receiving back kisses on it, with a pleasured face, even if she knows that right now he is probably shouting and screaming, terrified by what she just said, but this makes her more wet.<br>\r\nIn fact Michael was really screaming in his head, while his body was still moving to please his sister. \"W... What?? She can't be serious! She can't do this to me! I'm her twin brother, I'm part of her family! This must be a dream! A really nightmerish dream, and I need to wake up right now!\"<br>\r\nBut even if he tries to deny it, he knows that now he, or better, she is now stuck in here and the mercy of his family. And he really hates it.<br>\r\nJessica is still masturbating lightly, and lets out a soft and sexy moan. Then she lifts her hand and looks at her finger, soaked in her juices. She moves her hand toward her mouth but stops, as an idea popped in her head, and then, smiling, she moves her hand a bit to the side, keeping it lifted with the palm turn to the sky. \"Maid, my fingers are wet, lick them clean and dry them off.\"<br>\r\nSaid so, she pleasantly sees Michael stopping the massage to her feet, standing up in a sexy way, and kneeling before her hand and starting to lick her fingers.<br>\r\n\"Oh damn, this is so hot... I have my brother, a REAL person here, doing whatever I tell him... her to do... I think that I could use her to make my fantasies real, using the spells I got before at the mage's tower... Yes, I won't ever have another possibility like this one... By the way, she is really good with her tongue... Probably they loaded in all the maids a porn star program of similar, but who cares, I'll find good uses for this sexy puppet.\" Is what Jessica is thinking looking at her brother licking her fingers.<br>\r\nMichael, wasn't that pleased. He always dreamed to be able to do this kind of things, but of his own accord, and not with his sister! Ok she is sexy... Really sexy... But she is always his sister, this is wrong!<br>\r\nBut Michael's thoughts got interrupted by Jessica that giggling asked \"Are my juices tasty?\". Michael wanted to shout to her, ok the juices were quite good, but he shouldn't be doing this with her. But found himself moving his face from the hand and while drying it with a towel he said \"Yes my princess, they were really tasty. Thank you to gave me the possibility of tasting them.\"<br>\r\nHearing this Jessica started to laugh. She knew that the maid's orders where to always please her, but she thinks that in the end her brother actually enjoyed it.<br>\r\n\"Oh well, happy that you liked it\" Jessica tries to stop laughing, then points at the changing room. \"Go in there, In my dress there is a poket with some vials, bring them here, I think it's time to test the possibility of the mage's potions.\"<br>\r\nMichael got another chill going down his spine. \"No... I can't believe it. Is she really going to use the potions to play with me? Does she really want to transform me into things to use, or shrink me down?\" Looking at the smiling face of his sister, he knows that she was really enjoying this, and that he won't.<br>\r\nEven so, he stands up, always in the same sexy way, that he likes to see, but hates to be the one looked at while doing \"Yes my princess, I'll be right back\" and goes in the changing room.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Jessica sees the maid sway her hips out from the door, with 4 vials in hands, 2 blue and 2 red. <br>\r\n\"Bring them here on the table and listen to me\" She pointed at the table right next to her, then puts her sandals on again and stands up, getting closer to Michael, that has just put them down and is now standing waiting.<br>\r\n\"As you can understand, I've gone to the mage, and he explained me how the potions work. There are 4 colors: red transforms into an object, when you drink it, you think at the object in which you want to change and you become that, but if someone higher in role than you, like us royals\" She puts quite and emphasy on the \"us\" \"is close to you, and thinking at an object, says it's name, you change in said object, even if you don't want to. Oh, and it seems that even while transformed you can talk in the mid of the user. Then there is the blue one that shrinks the drinker. You drink it and think at the size that you want to be and you shrink, but as in the other potion, if someone higher than you choose and says another size, you become that size. We'll see the other colors when we'll use them. For the duration, is till you touch another potion of the same kind. As soon as you touch it the effect is canceled. Have you understood everything?\"<br>\r\nMichael couldn't still believe it. \"So they'll choose in which object I'll transform, and which size I'll have to become?\" \"Yes princess, I've understand. But if someone wants to change into animals?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh that's simple, you just need the body alteration potion, that is yellow. But don't worry, I'm not going to change you into my horse for now\" Replies Jessica smirking<br>\r\n\"So, princess, which potion will I drink now?\" Asks Michael, even if he wanted to put a lot more of a worried tone in his question.<br>\r\nJessica looks at the potions picking one up and than back at her maid smiling. \"Oh...</span></div></div>",

Ryan and Jessica also run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael decides to be brave and get the wand from Damien but before he can act, a guard attaches a leash and drags Michael away. \"You heard the king's command.

He has no idea where he is being led.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they stop running, the guard hands Michael off to someone. \"This brand new slave needs to be processed and dressed in more appropriate attire. It is an affront to appear before the king wearing such filthy rags. Have him scrubbed and shaved thoroughly, marked as the king's property, and dressed in a slaves tunic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scrubbing and shaving are rough but pleasant at the same time like getting a deep tissue massage. The shaving is thorough. There isn't a single hair left on Michael's entire body. Michael is marked on his forehead and left butt cheek. His tunic is nice but a very simple white linen like a bedsheet turned into an oversized shirt with no sleeves and a large opening for his head. He is also given extremely simple leather shoes but nothing else to wear.</span></div></div>",

The guards are non-player artificial intelligences so they only do what they are programmed to do. If that means beat the slave, then they beat the slave. Michael so far has been okay because they only beat him if he disobeyed. The guards weren't programmed to be especially cruel. It did hurt when they marked his forehead and butt cheek but not severely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest problem is that Michael has not seen a single person with an actual mind. He's only been handled by these artificial intelligences that don't know he isn't an actual slave. But heading back to the throne room, Michael hopes to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the closer he gets to the throne room, the more he sees the evidence of the chaos that Damien has been causing. The throne room looks like a full blown magic war has taken place. There are many stone statues that look like they had once been guards. There is a big pile of ice cream behind the thrones. There is another wizard but he is frozen in ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad and Jessica are not there. Mom is still a chicken. Ryan is there but he's not a jester anymore. He's a full blown knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan said, \"Michael, I'm so glad you're back. We need everyone helping us find Damien.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael said, \"First change me into a knight also.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan said, \"Sorry. All the programmers that were in the simulation were zapped by Damien. They are continuing to try to help from outside the simulation but time outside the simulation passes a hundred times slower than it does inside the simulation. They managed to make me a knight just before the last programmer was zapped. We're stuck in our roles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael asked, \"Can I at least get some better clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the higher ranking servants spoke up, \"Sir Ryan, would you care to inspect the slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan said, \"No, I do not wish to inspect the slave, Neville.

I've already been reminded that I cannot change the laws or do magic. I'm stuck myself in this role and must play it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael said, \"Dad's a king. He could change the law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan said, \"I don't know where Dad is. I don't know where Jessica or Damien are either and Mom is in no position to help.

It's not a great role but it's not that bad. Sure he has to walk while Ryan rides. Sure he has to do work like gathering firewood. But it's not that much different from a camping trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party consists of Ryan, Michael, Neville the chancellor, Justin the squire, and Bill the marshal. Bill mostly ignores Michael.

On day four, Neville drags Michael off to a slave market and Ryan isn't there to help. Neville takes Michael's clothes away and offers to sell him. Michael is tossed in a cage while Neville haggles with the merchant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ryan arrives but Neville has a beautiful young female slave brought out. Neville says, \"Michael is a pathetic slave. He doesn't know what he's doing and has to constantly be taught everything. This young slave is skilled and more pleasant to the eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan says, \"But Michael is my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville says, \"He is a slave. bring him out and let's compare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael is brought out and stood next to the female. Neville encourages Ryan to inspect both slaves while Neville points out their differences. Neville even pulls Michael's butt cheeks apart and says, \"That's the only hole he has if you're into that kind of thing but I say that she has a much better hole for that purpose. Still, he is your slave. It is within your legal right to use his body. That would be the only reason that makes sense to me for keeping him. He's no good as a worker.

Everywhere he goes, creepy men and women feel him up and Neville just tells him that the law is not on Michael's side. Ryan tries to step in but gives up after a while. Slowly, Ryan starts to accept that this is normal. Ryan even holds conversations with people while those people fondle Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne man says, \"Your slave is well endowed.

Why not have a little fun?\", she said as she patted your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better go along with this until I can find a way out.\", thought Michael as he cooperated with the young stable girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better!

He's pretty popular with the mares.\", said the stable girl with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou passed Big Jake as she led you out to the field when the aroma of the stallion filled your senses. A whinny escaped your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be patient there girl!\", said the stable girl as she released you into the field. \"I'll be right back with your stallion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thoughts of being mounted by that magnificent beast overwhelmed you so much, that even the sight of the stable girl's beautiful rear didn't distract you as she walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, nobody seems to know I'm here. It's a temporary situation, so I might as well make the best of it. It's not exactly how I imagined having sex, but my body is certainly ready and willing.\", you thought as you waited for the stallion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the stable girl released Big Jake into the field, your lust was insatiable. Big Jake approached and prodded your rear with his nose. You responded by lifting your tail and allowing the stallion easy access.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of what you were about to do gave you a slight pause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell am I doing!?\", you thought, right before the stallion mounted you and found his target. It was way too late to back out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!!! That's it! OH YEAH!\", you thought as the stallion pumped his massive penis into your new vagina. \"Harder! Faster!\", your mind screamed as you whinnied. Your mare's body leaned into the thrusts to milk all the pleasure you could. The biggest orgasm of your life rocked you. Wave after wave of pleasure hit you as the stallion continued to pump into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you felt a hot rush of the stallion's seed fill you as the final orgasm hit you. Your mate finally dismounted and walked up beside you, nuzzling your neck as your senses returned. It was then that you finally saw it. Your family was standing at the back entrance to the barn. Ryan was laughing hysterically, while your Mom yelled at him to stop. The other members of your family were trying to suppress their laughter as they looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a virgin anymore, Eh Michael!? Or maybe we need a better name. How 'bout Buttercup? Yeah! Buttercup it is!\", said Ryan trying to control his laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\", said Jessica after she suppressed a giggle. \"Michael didn't choose this. It's obviously some kind of mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica walked toward you as the stallion wandered off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Michael. We'll get this straightened out.\", Jessica said as she rubbed your head. \"Let's get out of here so we can get away from Ryan.\", she whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stable girl!\", shouted Jessica. \"Please saddle up Buttercup. We're going for an afternoon ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an excellent idea.\", you thought as the stable girl prepped you for your ride.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was like no feeling you had ever experienced before! Even the feeling at the moment when his hot seed poured inside of you. It would be an honor to have the colt of such a fine male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you realized what you were thinking! You stopped suddenly in shock! You ignored Jessica kicking you to get you to go again. This was awful! Not only were you fantasizing about another round with Big Jake, but a part of you was actually hoping to have his baby! You felt a rumbling inside of you, and instinctively, your tail went up as you felt your thick manure pour out of your rear.

He was loving your humiliation. \"I have found out how to contact Experience Support. I think they will be glad to help, but, since you can't speak for yourself, I will be glad to talk to them for you!\" You didn't like the way he snickered. You also were helpless to prevent him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard him talking to someone else. The stable girl was humming, so you couldn't hear what was being said.

You didn't see her transformation though, as things got foggy for you. The next thing you knew, you were standing on two legs, looking at a beautiful mare standing in the stall where the girl had been!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down to see young breasts, with a bit of cleavage, pushing out from your chest. You were wearing the same dress that the girl had been wearing! You were about to turn to face Ryan, when you heard him say, \"Don't turn around girl. In fact, don't move a muscle until I tell you.\" This was bad. Try as you might, you couldn't move! He continued, \"You will find that, in addition to being a good servant girl for us all, you must obey me in particular. Now, tell my your name, who you are, and where you were born girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to growl out your name and tell Ryan where to go, but what came out of your mouth was, \"I am Tania, servant of, and stable girl for the Royal family. I was born here in this village to a peasant family my lord.\" You were shocked, but try as you may, you could say nothing different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, \"And tell me of the mare standing before you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her, and you could tell that the poor stable girl was inside there, trapped in a horse's body as you were. \"That is the Princess Micheal, who you have named Buttercup my lord.\" The girl whinnied in protest, but of course could not speak. You gasped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan laughed again, \"That is right. To the rest of the family, that horse is still you. And I don't even have to order you not to tell anyone. You can't.\" You heard him walk close to you. \"There is more though. You seemed to enjoy being mounted by a male so much that I thought you would enjoy that as a human. First, you have absolutely no sexual inhibitions whatsoever now.\" Then you felt his hands touch your sides. You inhaled deeply as they slid up to your breasts and began to rub them. \"Yes my cute brother, you can't help but respond. Turn and face me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did, and you were disappointed at the way he had stopped touching you. It felt incredible! But as you turned, several things happened. First, you found yourself in a deep curtsy, but when you looked up again, you found yourself filling with desire for, for, for your own brother!  Your nipples began to poke out noticeably, and you felt a desire deep in your abdomen, even as your pussy began to tingle and get wet! It was that deep desire that bothered you the most though. It couldn't be! It just couldn't!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan sneered, \"Tania, dear girl. You look like you want something. Tell me your desire girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to cry as you said with great desire, \"My lord, I am an unworthy peasant, but I would consider myself blessed if you would allow me to bear a child for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, \"Now, now. Come little brother. You want to be this girl and have my baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could have thrown up, but what you said was, \"Oh yes my lord prince. I love being a female for your pleasure, and it would be an honor to have your child. I beg you! Please take me!\" Part of you wanted to throw up, but whatever programming why did, you couldn't help yourself! You weren't just saying it. Somehow, you really meant it!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, he picked you up like a feather, and laid you on a bale of hay, \"Show me your desire girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay in the pile of hay, you pulled up the front of your skirt, and spread you legs wide! You couldn't help yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, \"You make such a cute girl Michael! Do you love it that much that you want my baby? Be warned. I had them make sure that just this one time will ensure that you become a mother. Do you still want me Michael?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help it. You need was growing by the moment! For a moment, you could use the term brother. \"Yes my brother! I want your baby! Please give me your baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, he mounted you, and you moaned and then screamed in pleasure as you felt his penis penetrate your pussy! The feeling of a penis inside of you was incredible beyond words! Even his rough handling of your breasts did not detract from it! Only, much too soon, he began to cum inside of you. You were disappointed at the loss of pleasure, but as his hot seed filled your womb, you were thrilled to know that you were sure to get pregnant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, he pulled out of you. He laughed, \"There we go. The deed is done. You will not tell anyone you are with child until the right time, and you will never tell them that I am the father. Understood girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded happily as his cum dripped from your pussy. He smiled, \"Then don't bother to clean yourself up. Peasant girls don't bother anyhow. Go, tend to Princess Micheal and make sure that she is ready to be mounted by Big Jake again this afternoon. You will make every effort to assure the rest of the Royal family that she enjoys being a mare. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded happily as you jumped up and started tending to the poor girl trapped as you had been. As Ryan walked away, your feelings of need, and desire faded, and as you felt his cum running down your leg, you stared to cry. \"What have I done?\"</span></div></div>",

As you groomed her, you spoke to her, \"I am sorry that you got drawn into my brother's cruelty. I am not sure which of our fates is the worse, but at least you can rest assured that your coupling with Big Jake will be very pleasurable.\" It didn't seem to please her, but later that evening, you could tell that she did enjoy her time in the meadow the the sexy stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a peasant girl, your work day was long and time to yourself limited. You were glad that the stable master was busy with other things, especially the way that he and the stable boy eyed you. At last you were able to wash the remnants of Ryan's cum from your legs and pussy. It was so humiliating being a girl, but squatting to pee, the breasts and long hair that got in the way, so many things reminded you constantly that you were female. Worse than that, as a peasant girl, you were the lowest of the low. In the world at this time, you even had to obey the stable boy, just because he was a male! You cried yourself to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Princess Jessica showed up again. You heard her voice before you saw her, \"Girl! How is Princess Buttercup? I hope you are giving her the best of care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned, and automatically went into a curtsy. \"Yes my lady! I assure you that she will get nothing but the best always!\" You tried to force yourself through your orders and programming, but what you said next was, \"I was just preparing her for a romp in the meadow again my lady. She seems to enjoy it greatly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something unexpected happening to you. As you looked at the girl who was your sister, you began to realize how beautiful she looked as a princess. And the more you looked, the more turned on you were getting! Then you began to realize what Ryan had meant yesterday, about you lack of any sexual inhibitions. She may not know about the tingle in your pussy, but you were worrying about how obvious your erect nipples were, and you were worried that there might soon be a smell from your wet pussy. If she was insulted, you would be punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something you never would have expected happened! Jessica walked up to you with a strange smile, \"Tell me your name girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down, not in subservience, though it probably looked that way, but to try to calm your building sexual desires for her, \"Mmm...my name is Tania my lady.\" You so desperately wished that you could tell her that you were her brother, trapped in the body of this peasant girl, but of course, you couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled and reached out and stroked your hair, which made you quiver! \"Are you able to be discrete Tania?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were really getting worried now. \"A..about what my lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jessica's hand left your hair and began to stroke the side of your breast. \"About my visit of course.You know, I have always wondered what it would be like to make love to another female, and you seem to be attracted to me, but, if we acted on that, would you keep it our secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were quivering in need, \"Of, of course... my lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled, \"Then I have two orders for you. First, never tell anyone about this, and second, when we are alone, do not use my titles, just call me Jessica. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost moaned, \"Yes.... Jessica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, \"Then kiss me Tania, and show me your desires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't wait for a second invitation! You couldn't! You sprung up and wrapped your arms around Jessica and began to kiss her passionately. While you kissed, you caressed her breasts, causing her to moan. You whispered, \"Jessica. in the loft, we would have some privacy.\" And she had you lead the way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was happy to help you pull off the dress you were wearing. The only garment you owned. He layers of skirts and petticoats was too much to remover in the time you had, but you undid her bodice, and as to the rest, there might have been layers, but since underwear had not been invented yet, your hand eventually found the jackpot. Jessica moaned as your fingers slipped into her pussy as you sucked on her nipples! To your pleasure, it was not all one-sided, as she pleasured you as well. Soon enough though, you moved your head between her legs and began to expertly lick her pussy. He moaned, then cried out, then soon screamed in pleasure as her orgasm hit her hard! Something inside of you triggered with her, probably a programmed response, but you didn't care as you felt a huge orgasm sweep through your body as well! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, while you both lay there panting, you found you loved the smell of Jessica's pussy, and you kissed it gently from time to time. When you were recovered enough, you got up, dressed, and then did your best to erase signs of the barn from the princess. Then she hugged you tightly! \"Oh thank you Tania! That was incredible! We will have to do that again soon! This stable is not a great place though. I will have to speak to my father. Perhaps I can have you sent up as my personal servant. Would you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was thrilled, \"That would be wonderful my lady... um.. Jessica.\" We kissed a long time before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was gone, I heard a voice from behind....</span></div></div>",

You were helpless to stop him as he took some reigns and used them to tie your neck just over a rail, in such a way that you could not stand, but were bent over. He then tied your hands to the rail as he said, \"If you scream, I will stuff your mouth with horse dung.\" You kept quiet. You knew he would do it. \"Now, let's see what we have here.\" He began to roughly squeeze your breasts, and you were helpless to stop him! Soon, your body began to betray you yet again as your nipples hardened. \"Let's see what this mare looks like. He lifted your skirt up over your back so that you were naked from the waist down. Then you felt his fingers begin to stroke your pussy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou protested, \"No! John! Stop this! I will tell the stable master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, \"You are just a girl! Do you think he cares about what I do with you as long as the work gets done?\" A moan escaped your mouth as you touched your clit, \"Ah! There is the spot!\" Soon he was using one hand on your pussy as the other helped themselves to your breasts! The worst part was, your body was so easily turned on that very soon, you wanted to feel him inside of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had you moaning and squirming, He said, \"Ask for it girl. Ask me to mount you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did! \"Oh yes! Please mount me John! Please take me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he laughed, and played with you more, which drove you crazy! The more you begged, the more he laughed at you. It was so humiliating! Finally, he said, \"I will. I will take you, but first you have to agree to be my woman. You move in with me tonight. Do you agree? Swear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was cruel, but you needed him right now! \"Yes! Yes! I am your woman! I will sleep with you! I swear it!\" You gasped in pleasure, for as soon as you said it, he was driving inside of you! Unfortunately for you, he came far too quickly to give you satisfaction! You felt large quantities of his hot seed pumping inside of you. All you could do is whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he dressed himself, he left you tied in that bent-over position, his thick cum dripping from your pussy. When he finally released you, he grabbed you and kissed you roughly. \"Tell me again. You are my woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had sworn it. In this world, it was binding. You couldn't help it now, \"Yes John. I am your woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"Good! Maybe I can't keep you from the royals, or even the knights and freemen, but your place from now on is with me. Don't forget it!\" He squeezed your ass as he kissed you again. \"Now go, get your things and move them into my place in the shed. Then return to work. Tonight, I might even allow you some more pleasure if you please me today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to obey him now, but you cried as you moved your things.

The only break in her day was being mounted by Big Jake, and you knew from personal experience that that was very pleasurable!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you had finished your work, John had made it clear that you better find him. Since you agreed to be 'his woman' he had treated you little better than he treated the horses. At one point in the day, he found you and soon had you on your knees. The worst part was that, as soon as you saw his cock, your mouth watered! You wanted it! You loved the smell of his crotch, and even the taste and feel of his cock in your mouth. When he came, you loved the taste and texture of his cum! Whatever was done to you, it really made you into the worst slut. Perhaps the worst part, you were really beginning to enjoy it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found John, who took you to his shed. There you cooked his meal. You had to wait to eat, since you got the leftovers. When he was done, he had you remove your dress and come to him. He was rough, but he played with your body long enough for you to get some pleasure before he laid you on your back and made you spread your legs. Unfortunately, from that point, his cum was pumping inside of you. He then collapsed on top of you, pinning you underneath him for a long time, his cock slowly shrinking as he was still inside of you. If you were not already pregnant with Ryan's child, not doubt you would soon be with John's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days began to blur after that.

You curtsied to him, \"How may I help you my lord?\" You had some idea already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over and took your hand, \"Come Ms. Roberts. You vacation time is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Roberts? Somehow, he thought you were someone else! A woman! The stable girl must not have been an NPC after all! She must have been a customer! You began to panic, \"No my lord! I am not called Ms. Roberts! I a Tania! I mean, I am Tania, the stable girl!\" You couldn't tell him who you really were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"Wow, they ran your program deep, but no worry, you will be back to normal very soon. As I said, time to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to yell \"Wait!\", but things began to fade around you very quickly.<br>\r\n__________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to come to. You saw that you were in a room that you recognized as one of the 'sleeping rooms' where guests bodies were kept while they were inside the VR. At first, your thought were, \"At last. I have escaped that horrid life as a stable girl.\" That didn't last long though as you began to become aware of your own body. You didn't know how long you were actually inside the simulation. Time passed differently there. To you, you had been a young female for months, so at first, what you felt didn't feel that unusual. And for a female, it wasn't. It wasn't until your mind cleared enough to realize that your real body shouldn't have breasts, and especially not the familiar feel of a pussy between your legs! They had read your 'program' from the wrong character! They had put you back in the body of the woman who was 'supposed' to be the stable girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over in a panic. There was a female attendant there, and a man that looked familiar. You realized that it was the man you saw talking to Ryan. The staff member who had swapped your horse body with the stable girl! You were still strapped down, but you started to say, \"Wait! You made a mistake! This is not my body! I shouldn't have been the stable girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked worried, \"What? Wrong body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at that moment, you saw a look of realization on the technician's face. He realized what he had done. As he was violently typing on his keyboard, he calmly said to the woman, \"Don't worry. Happens all the time. They are in there for months from their perspective. Sometimes the persona carries back. We just need her to sleep a bit longer while the re-programming takes effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to protest, but before you could, you fell asleep. As you mind drifted, you wondered what the technician was doing?</span></div></div>",

Especially compared to the huge ones you had as the stable girl. Still, it was wrong. Totally wrong! You heard the nurses voice again. \"Hello again. Are you feeling better now Miss Connor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over at her, and started out to tell her that you were not Miss Connor, or Miss anything! Instead, you found yourself smiling and saying, \"Yes, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse looked at you. \"Now, tell me your full name, age, and gender of birth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to say that you were Micheal Smith, 16, and born male. What came out was, \"I am Gail Lynn Connor, twenty-two, and I was born female.\" How could you be smiling as you said that!?!? This was all wrong! She asked you more questions, and you couldn't help give answers that, while you were sure they matched your body, you knew they were not yours!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse grinned, \"Great! You are just fine. As soon as the technician clears you for technical things, you are free to go. I hope you had a great time on your vacation!\" You thanked her even though you wanted to scream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was out of the room and the door was closed, the technician stood up, \"You can stop trying to deny who you are.\" He stood up and walked up to you. \"I couldn't allow you to reveal my mods to my bosses. I would be fired or worse. Thankfully, we can reprogram the brain as easily as the computer. It is just a computer of sorts after all. So now, you are programmed to BE Gail Connor. You are incapable of communicating anything but that you have always been her. You can't change it, or resist it, any more than you can resist this.\" He reached down and began massaging your breasts! You sat there and let him as you enjoyed it! Then he leaned in to you and began kissing you. You returned his kiss with passion! When he broke the kiss, he smiled, \"You see? If I have the time, I might even come to visit you after work some day. For now though, you may go as soon as you sign these papers Gail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit breathless as you just said, \"Thank you.\" And you got up, signed with the name of Gail L. Connor, then left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked out, unable to tell anybody that anything odd had happened. He wasn't going to win though. You caught a cab and gave your home address. Your parents would get home eventually, then you would find a way to tell them what had happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got there, you were inside before your realized that this shabby apartment was not the 'home' you intended to go to. This was Gail's place, and it was shabby, dirty and cluttered. You had no idea what to do now, but you felt yourself start to cry. You realized that this was the only address you could think of as 'home'. You had no idea where your parents lived. Well, that wasn't true either. You could remember your parent's address, but they were Gail's parents, not Micheal's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a knock on the door. Who could that be?</span></div></div>",

He was a bit overweight, and smelly, and not all that handsome. Gail, er, you, had told him to get lost many times. You were very short in this body, and had to look up at Bert who was significantly taller. \"Not now Bert. I want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he cut you off, \"You want to be my girlfriend Gail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a strange tingle in your head, \"Um, yes. I do want to be your girlfriend Bert.\" You didn't, but you couldn't say it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBert stepped inside, closed the door, and then pulled you to him! In spite of the intense smell of his body odder, you wrapped your arms around him and began to kiss him passionately! You couldn't stop yourself! Even as he began to rub your breasts, all you could do is moan in pleasure and let him! Finally you gasped out, \"How are you doing this to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his hands slid up your top and began to unhook your bra, he chuckled, \"One of the programmers there is a guy who owed me a lot. You were the payment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were panting, \"I will not be your girlfriend. I won't do this!\" But even as you were saying it, you were pulling off your top and removing your bra! Soon you were undressing Bert! As you were pulling off your skirt, you pleaded, \"Don't make me do this Bert! Please!\" This was beyond belief! First, you are trapped in the body of a geeky, flat-chested girl against your will, and now you are somehow programmed to be this jerks slave! You kept trying to fight it, but you found yourself pulling your skirt down. No matter what you did, your body seemed to be on auto-pilot. Soon you were both naked, \"Bert! Please stop this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, \"I have wanted to see you naked for a long time girl. Lay down and spread your legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that you realized that, against what you wanted, your pussy was very wet! You did as he said. It was disgusting to lay down on the filthy floor, and worse to have him stare at your pussy  as you spread you legs wide. When he climbed over you, he said, \"Now beg me to give you my baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped. You closed your eyes and focused on not saying it. You barely lasted two seconds, \"Oh Bert! Please give me your baby! Please get me knocked up! I want to have your baby! Please make me pregnant with your child!\" You wished you could throw up, but not as much as when you felt his cock penetrate your pussy, and then push in. It felt different than when you were the stable girl, tighter and less comfortable. Like when you were the stable girl, you couldn't stop yourself, but what made this bad was that this was real! Unless you got your own body back, you could get pregnant for real! You could have a real baby! Then what? You realized that you might find out as you felt Bert cum inside of you. This can't really be happening! You were a boy! You can't be a girl! But as he grunted and pumped inside of you, all you could do was say, \"Thank you Bert! Thank you! I hope I can have your baby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward, Bert dressed, but made you stay naked. It was disgusting as you felt his cum leaking from your pussy and running down your leg. Bert smiled and said, \"You know, your apartment is much nicer than mine. I might as well move in here. If you are lucky, I might even let you marry me.\" He smiled and patted you on the head, \"Stay as you are and start to clean up this place while I go pack my stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was gone, you cried as you began to pick up.</span></div></div>",

She appeared blind, to the changes, as Michael equine body started to distort. None of it stopped, Big Jake's enthusiastic thrusting, her forelegs locked around the barrel of Michael's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grunting whinnying coming in time with his thrusts. But as the thrusts continued, they took on a softer, more human timbre. It was clear the sim had planned on centaurs appearing in the game... at some point. The horse head was flattening taking on more recognisably human proportions, and the long muscular neck was taking on the shape of a human torso. Withered human arms were clear, flapping like loose skin, clearly lacking bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the thrusting continued, the arms thickened and lengthened. A distinct human face was clear now, with full lips, the equine ears vanishing into the long mane, and shifting to dull human ones. Comprehension appeared in the eyes, human thought clear. A strangled, too high, too human whinny came from Michael's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut another issue was becoming clearer. There was a shimmying rhythmic shaking to Michael chest, as Big Jake kept on pumping away. His focus entirely on his thrusts. Michael's chest swelled larger and larger, topped by an immense bust. One in proportion for a horse, but when compared with a human, far far bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, for Michael it was too clear that he was becoming a centauress, rather than a centaur. Coherent thought, and clear speech was beyond him at the moment. His (Well Her) body's lungs being driven by simpler things than talking. Michael was gasping, and moaning, the tone suggesting that she was on the verge of climaxing. The rein the stable girl was holding down to a simple chain.

Finally you simply decided to click on the publisher with the highest rating and moved the decision back to later. Finalizing your choice with a small comment you opened your VR-helmet up to the connection and your field of view dissolved into hundreds of tiny squares -you loved the pixel effect- before turning utterly black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for a silver circle to appear in the centre of your vision, gleaming with light that seemed to come from somewhere behind it and two R\u2019s where soon \u201cthrown\u201d against it with the sound of hammer striking the anvil. Without further ado, you are send forward, a basic avatar that consisted of little more than a blue humanoid haze that signalled your position in the room to others \u2013 if there had been others right now. Instead you found yourself utterly alone in a circular room with the emblem of the published gracing the ceiling above you and the floor beneath you. On the other end of the room you can see three doors, a small glow signalling them to be the options of the three worlds that are currently available. R.R. has gotten quite some praise for creating this shared worlds, which are inhabited by multiple games, whose genre varies from one to another. So which are you going to enter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Chronicles of Dawn</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first door was carved out of marble, elegant columns flanking it, while a bright sun seemed to hover above it \u2013 made from polished and gleaming metal. Beneath it a relief seemed to stretch far wider than it should be possible with the dimensions of the door. You could make out griffins that soared through the air, elves loosening arrows and dwarves standing side to side with steel shields, but at the same time you could see a ship with its sails full of wind and humans marching with pikes and muskets on their shoulders. The Chronicles were set in a world that looked like someone had thrown a fantasy world and the renaissance into a blender \u2013 before smoothening all lines between them over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Wasteland</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the first doors elegant look, this one seemed hastily put together, its door frame made from rusting and clumsily weld together metal poles and you did at least imagine that one could be identified as a stop sign. Barbed wire seemed to be slung all over it and you could see a few crude drawings that showed a tank wrestling with a giant scorpion, a half-decayed head with cybernetics sticking out of it and a skull that looked like a cross between human and lizard. Far grittier than the Chronicles, the Wasteland was a post-apocalyptic  World that was easily the size of the real one, in which players had to defend themselves against each other, mad robots, depraved cyborgs and mutated tribes from the depths of the death lands. +<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Endless Galaxy</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last door was just as elegant as the first one, but at the same time also far more simply. Golden light seemed to rise from the floor as you looked at it, before shifting and forming a smooth and perfectly geometrical doorway that seemed to open into the black of space with dozens of stars twinkling in the background. Above the doorway you could see an ever changing circle, whose inside was adorned by image of dozens and dozens of species \u2013 their homeworlds and motives ranging from waving children to burning ships that exchanged fire with one another. Describing this world that was one of the largest virtual rooms ever designed was easy: Space Opera.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt two kicks to his bladder and instantly put his smaller, feminine hand on the belly and rubbed it almost instinctively to try and soothe the flurry of kicks.

You're twenty-six years old, a little doughy around the middle, with thin, receding hair. You work at The Escapist, a small comic-store-cum-cyber-cafe situated on the edge of the university campus in a trendy part of town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Escapist was established before you were born by your parents and though they technically still own it, they're rarely around these days - not mentally anyway - so you practically run the place yourself. The first floor is given over solely to comics, and had been your father's domain while he was still around - he was the biggest, most-insufferable nerd. Ground floor sells coffee and tea and cakes and is home to a collection of soft, chintzy sofas and chairs that your mother lovingly put together over the years. That woman had a taste - or a lack of it - all her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basement is yours. Seven months ago, at your parent's behest, you'd taken charge of the <i>cyber</i> half of the cyber-cafe, renovating the basement by stripping out the ancient, obsolete computers and installing shiny new servers powerful enough to run virtual environments, along with two dozens bunks on which customers could recline while their minds sampled the simulated worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't been cheap by any means, but it had proven popular, not least by your parents. They took full advantage of owning their own VR suite to enjoy a sort of early retirement, uploading their minds into the servers to exist in whatever simulations were running, living in the identities of the NPCs. It's been four months since you spoke to them last. Since their insertion they've gained an almost legendary reputation among the customers for their rare but memorable appearances. Usually they just live in the background, playing out their parts. Both had been avid roleplayers in their time and this suited them down to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still see them in a sense. Their physical bodies have been fitted with simple Bodyguard personalities and still work in the shop where you can keep an eye on them, performing any tasks simple enough for the crude AI in their brains to comprehend. The amount of dumb crap they get up to on a daily basis never fails to brighten up your day. They keep the shop tidy and themselves physically active, cqretakers waiting for the day when their body's original owners return from simulation, should that day ever come at all. Judging by how comfortable your parents have become in their virtual existence, it is starting toolk unlikely that they'll ever return. Considering how much money you're raking it from their cafe, that might not be such a bad thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular day, the business is doing well. The wet weather has driven customers off the streets into the VR suite where they can experience any weather they desire. Furthermore it's end-of-year exams and students have packed the place, dosing themselves up on large amounts of caffeine before diving into time-dilated edutainment sims to cram revision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell above the door rings. It's a student, a stack of heavy textbooks held in her arms. Her auburn hair is all over the place and she looks manic, strung out, almost close-to-tears. She stands at the counter as you prepare some guy's cappuccino, and you watch her growing increasingly agitated as you carefully draw a triforce in the milk foam. As you cross the counter to give the guy his drink,, she grabs your arm. \"I need more time! I have an exam in, like, two hours. Please, you have to give me more time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bunks are ten dollars an hour to rent,\" you reply. \"If you want time-dilation, it's five dollars extra for each additional hour, so times two is fifteen, times three is twenty, and so on.\" Judging by the textbooks, the jittery nerves, and the way she throws wads of cash at you, you're thinking <i>medical student</i>. She buys one hour on a bunk at x200 dilation, which you generous round down to a nice $1000. Easiest money you ever made. If this keeps up, you might have to look into expanding the basement, perhaps buy some more sims. Your parents would love that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou show her down into the VR suite. They call it the <i>blue room</i> for the flickering glow of the blue LEDs that adorn the computer banks that sit against one wall behind their protective glass. Other than their illumination, the room is kept dark. Almost all the bunks are occupied with limp bodies laid out on the soft foam mattresses, their faces obscured by visors, their mouths open and drooling. She climbs into one of the two empty bunks and you key in the details in the display beside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One hour at x200. You'll want the library sim - it should have all the books you need. There's a few students in there already so at least you'll have company. If you need any help, there are terminals dotted around the sim that will send an alarm to me. Press any one of those and I'll come sort you out. Okay? See you in 8 days,\" you say. She secures the visor over her head and you engage the sim with a press of a button. Easiest '1k you ever made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a minute just to check on the server vitals. Finding everything ticking over nicely, you head for the stairs that will take you back up to the cafe. As you do, the alarm begins to bleep. Somebody in one of the simulations is requesting assistance. It is...</span></div></div>",

You hear the buzzer but, glancing down the two rows of bunks, you can see no light. Then your eyes fall on the server. The amber light is flashing there. Your parents are in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been four months and there's not been a peep from them so far. When they inserted their minds, they'd given you specific instructions not to meddle in their new lives. As the administrator, you were essentially a god inside the simulations, capable of controlling every aspect of their existence, bestowing upon them infinite wealth, perfect bodies, anything they could possibly desire. As serious gamers and roleplayers, they'd made it clear they didn't want such preferential treatment. They wanted to live the lives the computer randomly selected for them, and any intervention or boon from their Godlike son would serve only to break their immersion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter how much I might beg you for a vorpal sword of +20 dragon slaying, you're not to give it to me,\" your dad had stated fiercely, as he'd fitted the neural-ripping headset around his bald cranium. \"If we don't earn things within the limits of the game, then it doesn't mean anything.\" That had been the last thing he'd said to you before he'd become an empty shell and a data file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they're asking for your help, it must be serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush back upstairs, grabbing one of the more trustworthy nerds as he sits flicking through a comic. \"Man the desk for me, Mike. I just need to check on the sims. If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, come in after me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the keys for the server room from beneath the desk, you dash back downstairs. A blast of freezing cold air hits you as unlock the sliding glass screen and step into the compartment that contains the server banks. A headset keyed with administrator privileges is plugged into one of them. You fasten it over your head and seat yourself on the floor with your back against the warm metal of the computer. Flicking the visor down, you're transported automatically and immediately to the source of the alarm within the simulation.</span></div></div>",

Jacking directly into the servers grants you admin status and privileges, manifesting as the ability to rework almost aspect of the sims while inside them. Usually the purpose is to enhance the game-playing experience by tweaking the challenge or inserting fun twists, but there is also a significant amount of bug fixing. Bugs and glitches are just as common in sims as they are in non-VR games but the potential consequences are obviously much more severe, doubly so when the minds of the players are fully inserted as data files, as in the case of your parents. While getting stuck in a glitchy wall can be traumatic for a wired-in player, any damage to a downloaded player's data could have terrible consequences, rendering them mutilated or insane, or deleting them entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially if their mental patterns are affected, they can become confused or psychotic, unable to access their memories of the real world, fully believing the reality they're in. It can turn them into mindless vegetables (sometimes literally). By law, any downloaded player with significantly data corruption cannot be returned to a real world human body, as their behaviour may be dangerously unpredictable.

Understandable of your parents to establish their demesne there - they always loved holidaying in Greece, though you suspect that there will be fewer of the karaoke nights they enjoyed so much in this time period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sharp jolt, you come to a stop on hard rock. Somewhat unsteady, you find yourself on a rocky shoreline looking out over the sapphire blue Mediterranean sea. It is evening and warm, the sun just beginning to set below the horizon. A little way away from the coast there is a large fortified villa atop a hill. There are tents camped around its walls and you spy an assortment of different banners and standards fluttering in the sea breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like the aftermath of a siege. Soldier nurse their wounds or wipe down their swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ornate robes of white and gold scrape and snag on the rocks as you walk towards the villa. There is a gilded scepter in your hand and a tall hat on your head which threatens to topple off with every step. A heavy golden cross dangles around your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stride through the military encampment, the soldiers stop and stare, mouths dropping open. A few mutter prayers and cross themselves while a wounded man tries to crawl towards you, begging to be healed. As you enter the walls, a knight hurries towards you, dropping to his knee. He looks and sound Spanish, though you can understand the language perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Father! The Knight's of Santiago are blessed by your presence,\" he says incredulously. \"Once again I, Captain Alvar Di Castro pledge my sword and my life to your service as well as those of my men. We are truly, truly honoured...\" He hesitates, his battle-scarred face looking almost nervous at broaching the question. \"Although it is a curiousthing... The last news that I heard said you were in Rome. How... how did you get here so fast? And with no guard at your side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo apparently you're the Pope. The system likes dropping admins into powerful roles for ease of solving problems. You do your best to emit an air of moral certainty and righteous authority, throwing in a few wavy hand gestures and latin. \"Domus erectus, um, habitus... corpus? Uh. Yeah. Official church business. Jesus told me to come here and sort out some... like... stuff. Bad stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain lets out a sigh of relief. \"Thank the Lord. You have come to...\"</span></div></div>",

Why don't you fill me in on the details while we walk to this \"witch\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Knight nods, rising and leading you deeper into the villa. There is blood on the walls, and men drag out the bodies of the dead, blood still oozing weakly from a few of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know, the Knights of Santiago were funded by King Phillipe to assist in his retaking of the Holy Land. We met with him and his retinue en route. Among his entourage was a young woman of common birth. I did not like her from the first moment I laid eyes on her. Her ways are most unnatural. She behaves like... like...a foreigner! She drinks and carouses and resides amongst the men, and in battle she picks up a sword and attempts to fight alongside us. Twice I have been forced to abandon my post to drag her away from the fighting, yet when I try to scold her she curses me in a most foul and unladylike fashion.\" His gauntleted fist clenches. \"Were she not under the King's protection I would have her in the stocks or a scold's bridle, or across my knee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo one of your parents had evidently landed in the body a young frenchwoman and fancied herself a Joan of Arc character. \"Her curious ways aside, you have to respect her passion for crusading though, right? Maybe she's just a bit overzealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Knight's eyebrows raise at the suggestion that there could be such a thing as <i>over</i>zealous. \"That is not all, Father. There is evil magic at work. Three days ago we were visited by a sinister double. Perhaps it would be easier if I showed you... Remember that my sword is yours if you need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walks through the villa, he gathers men to his side. You arrive at a central courtyard. Seated on the side of the pool there is a gaudily dressed man clutching a handkerchief to his mouth as if to keep out the pervasive smell of blood. He has a crown on his head and a bejeweled sword by his side, though it looks unused. The corpse of one of the enemy soldier has been propped against a tree, feathered arrows bristling from his foreign clothes. Two women are quarreling over a short-bow and quiver. They are petite and slim, with short dark hair and pale skin that looks to have sunburnt badly in the greek sun. Curiously enough they are identical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it here. You can't shoot for toffee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I shoot as well as you do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shoot like a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>are</i> a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takes one to know one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king by the pool sees you, breaking into a smile and giving an exclamation of relief. \"You made it! Oh, thank goodness. Your fathers have been driving me round the bend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Mum. Not in front of the Captain,\" you mutter, as the King grabs you in affectionate embrace, his beard scratching against your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, whoops. I sometimes forget who I am,\" mum blushes. \"It's been so long since we saw you last. You never come to visit us,\" he says chidingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too embarrassed to see his old man in tights, I bet,\" one of the twins chuckles, breaking off their fight and stepping up behind the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we're not the ones wearing the dress!\" the other twin laughs, gesturing to your elaborate robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look between them both. Something is very wrong here. \"Which one of you is my dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both are!\" they say in unison. \"We've been duplicated!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We think there's been a glitch, dear,\" mum says. \"We called as soon as it happened. We're worried your father's data might have been corrupted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Corruption'?!\" Captain Alvar Di Castro hisses between his teeth. There is the sound of sliding steel and you hurriedly usher him and his men away with assurances that you have the situation under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't supposed to happen, <i>ever</i>,\" you say matter-of-factly. \"What <i>exactly</i> did you do to cause this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" dad-A protests. \"Me and your mother were just lying in bed after a hard day's crusading when *pop*, another me just appears out of thin air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've not been downloading any viruses on to the system, have you?\" dad-B inquires suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet he's been installing all sorts of dodgy sims while we were away,\" dad-A nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has, look, he's turning red!\" dad-B guffaws. \"Ugh.

They fall over themselves trying to reach you, suddenly eager to please. On closer inspection, they are indeed entirely identical, right down to the smattering of freckles on their sunburnt noses. Dad is in the character of what appears to be a young French peasant woman. His ill-fitting, drab peasant garb hanging from gangly limbs. Understandably for a peasant of this era, he looks like he has been chronically underfed his whole life, he is short and slim-verging-on-anorexic, with barely-there breasts and skin that sticks a little too tightly to his skull, making his dark brown eyes look even bigger. There is an ubdeniable prettiness to the character model however - a cute upturned nose, ears that poke out adorably from the cropped-short brown hair, and a rather pouty mouth - which makes him look like a modern day cocaine-addicted fashion model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA identical short sword hangs across each of their waists and there is a matching scar running over the bridge of their noses, so the error duplicated those too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place a palm atop both of their heads, doing a quick scan of their attributes and traits.

You peer closer, your faces almost touching as you examine his eyes. You move to dad-B, taking his chin firmly and twisting his head back and forth to better examine him. Both of them had the spark of sentience - that little glimmer of awareness in their eyes that no VR could emulate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're both Player Characters, that much I can tell. I'd hoped one of you was an NPC duplicate. That would have made things so much simpler,\" you sigh regretfully, much to their relief. \"Have you noticed any other glitches in the game world?\" All three shake their heads so you keep pressing. \"No lost textures? You've not taken advantage of any broken mechanics like inventory bugs?

I was an up and coming duke until the King of France caught me in the Queen's chambers. Then it's \"off with my head\" and I'm waking up as some lowborn bastard from some godforsaken branch of the dynastic tree in some godforsaken French backwater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you snap. \"Unless you want me to delete you both right now and start again from a save that's a little more cooperative, tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not easy being a lowborn girl in the middle of nowhere, y'know.

I kinda interacted with both of them at the same time, if you know what I mean,\" dad-B squirms. \"Well if you're going to break a promise with your mother you might as well go large.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it sounds like he became infected with a replicating virus while getting double teamed by a defective-peasant NPC.

There actually is a curiosity about this.  You see, we actually used a mod so that no matter what countries we were in, no matter the age gap or language barriers, you mother and I would always end up married.  But that's no happening now with this lord.  Something's wrong.  That duke must have some sort of glitch or override program hidden within it that shouldn't be there.

After 8pm, you flick over the sign on the door to 'Closed'. No more customers are allowed in, though a few remain sleeping on the VR beds in the basement, still plugged into the simulations. It's not unusual for one or two customers to pay to stay overnight. Most will have filtered out by the morning. Usually you set the system to automatic monitoring and head to bed, waking only in the case of an admin emergency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich reminds you to revoke the block on your parents.

Impressive. A cursory glance at his statistics reveals the glitch - a basic integer overflow has set the duke's Diplomacy stat to the highest technically possible, 255. His diplomacy is so implausibly huge that it effectively overruled the mod your parents put in place, allowing him to demand a marriage. Furthermore it had allowed him to simply <i>request</i> the countries of other rulers. The defective AI is expanding its borders without shedding a single drop of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to fix this before bed.

I just handed over my user status, there was nothing I could do.  I couldn't stop myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your dad in horror, that shouldn't be possible for a user to transfer status rights over to an NPC, but this was a glitched and complicated NPC so who knows what could happen, if it figured out how to interface directly with the program, could it take your father's body?  You pulled up the information on your father and sure enough not only was he no longer registered as a user, but he was corrupted, and pretty soon he would not be able to function at all.  You had to fix this now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay dad, I can think of two options, one, I take over your body and transfer admin control to you.  You get out and take my body and fight this from this outside.  It would only take you an hour max so I'd only have to live in your place for a few months, a year tops.  I'd do it myself but...you're too corrupted, if I delete the corrupted data I'd have to delete you too and I'm not doing that.  I couldn't live with myself and I don't want to replace you with a backup save dad that has your memories, it's not right.  The other option is I try to fight this guy from the inside.  I try to defeat him through normal means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can't beat him, his diplomacy is so high you won't be able to raise a finger against him from within.

The screen kept flickering and the frame rate would drop.  \"That's odd.\"  You said to yourself as you turned around a corner and saw a hand read through the menus and grab your throat.  You tried to reactive your defense protocols but they weren't working, something was shorting them out.  You looked into the eyes of the man who had grabbed you, and judging by the gawdy crown on his head this must be the Emperor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Emperor looked at you and with a smile and silky smooth voice said, \"So, you must be the God of the world that my wife has told me about.  My advisers told me her stories were lunacy, but something about what she said always struck true with me.  Now I know for sure, it was you of whom she spoke.  But you won't be a God for long, you will grant me your power and you will do so now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to ignore what he was saying and focused on trying to lower his stats but you found you couldn't.  This glitch was something that couldn't be lowered, it would just fill itself up to max instantly.  And the more you tried you realized the harder it was becoming, did he have truth to his words?  Was the glitch actually forcing you to transfer your god like admin powers to him?  No, that would not do.  He'd have to be deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned knowing that wasn't exactly a happy option.  Just up and deleting a figure so key to a world would cause the game to reboot itself with you and your parents on the inside and that could just be chaotic for the three of you.  But with the Emperor sapping your power away second by second you knew you didn't have a choice.  \"Activate Protocol: FU-NUKE on my prompt.  GO!\"  As you felt the power being sapped from into the Emperor, you hoped that you were able to delete the Emperor and hard reboot the world in time.  The world went black around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped that when you opened your eyes you'd be in a freshly started up world with your mom and dad around you with hopefully some of your admin powers in tact if you were lucky, you really did because as not good as that option was, the alternative with a glitched Emperor with God like admin powers was worse.</span></div></div>",

Despite the body, I'm still a guy and still want to go by Kal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, I still don't see wyh you can't just get in the spirit of all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was getting into the spirit of this I'd have gotten knocked up years ago and died of the plague.  We've had this conversation.  I'm not getting in the spirit of the game, I'm just going to stay locked up in the library until my admin powers come back.  Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady you will not speak to your mother like that.\"  Your dad said before softening up, \"There's...something that we need to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not like the tone of his voice, \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see dear...\"  Your dad softly said before your mom interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have received a proposed alliance from France that we could not turn down.  You will be leaving to marry their Prince in a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did what?  I'm your son?  How could you do that to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing personal it's all just a part of the game.\"  Your dad said trying to soften the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be honored, we've been receiving marriage proposals everyday, but we chose not to settle until we could get the best for our little girl.\"  Your mom said in what you guessed was supposed to be a comforting way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing you could do, well, you could kill yourself and respawn as some random person somewhere else in the world out of spite, or just go through with it.  You'll get your admin powers back eventually and you can get revenge then...but why wait?  If you are the future Queen of France that puts you in a big position of power.  You might even be able to do what your parents would be able to stand.  Beat them at the game.  As you made it back to your room for a nice bath you made your decision.</span></div></div>",

Jacking directly into the servers grants you admin status and privelages, manifesting as the ability to rewrite almost aspect of the sims while in them, ostensibly for the purpose of getting the users out of trouble or enhancing their experience. There is little you can't change or do - the maps can be remolded with a wave of your hand, avatars can be edited or swapped out entirely, AI characters can be deleted, added, or possessed. If you wish it, you can become invisible, fly with ease, or noclip, allowing you to walk through walls. The simulation can be sped up or slowed to a crawl. One of the most useful abilities is the Narrator Voice. The Narrator Voice, when activated, allows you give a command to any character, both AI or player, and they will be forced to obey it, whether they want to or not. Intended to move along stalled narratives or railroad players towards particular choices, it is particularly handy in the VR D&amp;D sessions you GM every Friday night when dealing with the invariably unruly, rebellious party members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn essence, the administrator is God within the simulation, and the computer works to incorporate this as seamlessly as possible, so as to maintain the suspension of disbelief for the players. Should the world have a mythology, it will strive to insert the admin as the Supreme Being and Creator or as a member of the pantheon of gods and goddesses. More mundane sims have more mundane admins. Military sims usually have you playing as a field marshal or admiral, historical sims as one of the powerful leaders of the age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body goes limp as your mind enters VR, targeting in on the call of distress.</span></div></div>",

It's no biggy in any event - you've been a virtual woman before and it's just something you either adapt to or can change anyway - but to your surprise you find that you're a man, and a hell of a man at that. The idealized torso of a Greek god greets your eyes - muscles that look to have been carved from marble, bronzed skin that stands out against the whiteness of the snow, an 8-pack, and an artistically tiny penis (dang!). No doubt the computer has placed you in the form of a member of the local pantheon, as per protocol. That would certainly explain how you can be naked in this weather and not already suffering hypothermia. You climb to your feet, enjoying the sense of power in the body's limbs. The snow reaches to your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I?\" you speak to the empty wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words of the computer burn in the corner of your vision. <span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">[Lokam, trickster god, last of the Aedra.

The air shimmers over your skin as clothing forms around your body - a soft, black tunic that fits snugly around your broad torso, fur-lined boots of dark green leather and a cuirass of the same material fastened over the tunic. A sheathed, slim sword materialises on your left hip, while a full skin of wine materialises on the right. A heavy woolen cloak covers all of this and you draw the hood up against the weather. Trudging on, the village grows near, a collection of timber buildings in a vaguely norse-style of architecture huddled close together. Snow is piled high in drifts against the walls, almost burying the low buildings. From the largest of the buildings comes the unmistakable sound of very drunken revelry. Knowing your father, that wouldn't be a bad place to start looking.</span></div></div>",

Sitting around a table with five drunken, rowdy, beardy nerds as they drank and fucked their way through one of your father's campaigns had been one of the highlights of your childhood, and had taught your young mind a whole new dictionary of colourful language and much about female anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing you remember, your dad always had a fondness for taverns. At the closing of each night's adventuring, he would usually endeavor to get the party back to a tavern, and start the group there the next week. That would be the logical place to start looking for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forge towards the largest building from which golden light, heat, and revelry flows, your tall, strong body ploughing through the waist-deep snow with ease. The smell hits you as you step over the threshold - woodsmoke from the roaring log fire, roast pig, dried herbs that haang in massive bunches from the rafters, and first and foremost the sweat of two dozen carousing vikings, who are singing, fighting, and drinking with great frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad could be any one of them. Since simulations were being started and shut down all the time, the system automatically placed your mother and father's minds in new bodies completely at random whenever they were transferred to a new simulation. He could be any one of the vikings. He could be the scar-faced barkeep watching the rowdy warriors with a wary eye, or the flat-faced tavern wench hurrying too and fro with jugs of ale, having her large, flabby bottom pinched by drunken men. Many of the vikings have collared slaves at their sides, human and animal, huddled up small on the benches, refilling their master's cups, any of which could be him. He could be the flame-haired viking girl dancing on the tabletop, or even the scrawny dog slumbering before the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you step further inside, your tall, muscle-bound form draws the room's attention. The singing peters out. Many of the vikings halt with horns of ale halfway to their dripping lips, staring at your bronzed body in disbelief. There is no denying the aura of power you emanate - standing before them is either a King or a God. Some begin to pray or clutch at religious trinkets plundered from abbeys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing your throat awkwardly, you say, \"Uhm, hi. Yeah, is there a Mister Kensington here?

It is hard not to picture using those braids like reins as you ride her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is clearly deeply drunk. As she staggers and nearly falls, you grab her tightly. Giggling, she presses her hands against your thick chest as if to determine you're real, before turning to the vikings with a jubilant cry, \"Didn't I tell you, lads? Didn't I say my dancing could call down the gods themselves!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warriors roar their approval, hammering their fists on the table, demanding free ale in light of such an auspicious occasion. The bartender draws a well-notched sword from beneath the bar, explaining politely how he didn't care if Ragnarok was upon them, there would be no free ale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl has fallen asleep in your arms, her head on your chest.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The footprints lead you to the door of a building that sits in the center of the village. Unlike the other huts, this one is circular and made of stone and, as you push open the door and step inside, you spot rows of pews in the dim interior. Spaced around the walls are statues carved from wood. It's a chapel. It makes sense for your father to be here - if you want to contact a God, this is the place to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single candle burns upon the altar at the rear of the chapel with what at first looks to be a figure wrapped of furs beside it, but as you approach it starts to look more like an animal. As you move closer still, you realise that you're only half-wrong. It is a cat-person on her knees before the altar, her hands clasped together, her head bowed and her eyes closed as she mutters a prayer beneath her breath. Her body is covered tip-to-toes with short, brown-and-cream coloured tortoiseshell fur. One and a half cat-like ears twitch atop her head; the right one looks to have been partly bitten away. There is the look of a stray animal about her - she has a thin, hungry build, the suggestion of wiry muscles beneath her fur, which hangs a little loose. Her only clothes are a hessian sack to protect her modesty, a frayed length of rope tightened around her slim waist as a belt. A tail growing from the base of her spine sticks out beneath the sack, lifting it so that you have a full view of her pert little buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't seem to have noticed your presence. You clear your throat with a quiet, \"ahem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus!\" The cat-girl jumps a foot in the air, fur bristling all over her body, her tail poofed up like a loud. She relaxes a little when she sees you, her large, amber, left eye flicking over your Godly form. Her right eye is missing. A thick scar cuts across her face. Examining her closer, you see evidence of scars across the entire of her body - long, crisscrossing areas where the fur refuses to grow. Around her slender neck is a heavy iron collar and there are manacles on her wrists and ankles. \"God, you scared me to death! Warn a guy before you sneak up on him next time, I don't know how many of my nine lives I've got left!\" she gasps, clutching her heart. She has small breasts, her nipples obvious in the cold against the hessian sack. Beneath her breasts, a second pair of nipples pokes against the rough fabric, with two more pairs below those in a line down her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it's me!\" she snaps back. \"I've been praying <i>hours</i> for an admin. Do you have any idea how uncomfortable it is kneeling that long on a freezing cold stone floor?\" she moans, rubbing life into her knees. \"What kept you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>do</i> have a shop to run, you know. Remember, the one you left me to run on my own?\" you retort. \"You've no idea how busy it is up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the alert sounds, you're supposed to come check up on us <i>immediately</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <b><i>did</i></b>.\" You wave a hand at the world. \"You're in a sim running at x50 speed - no matter how fast I come, it's going to take me a few minutes,\" you state tersely. \"Anyway the important thing is I'm here now. What's the problem?\"</span></div></div>",

I don't know where she is, I don't know what they're doing to her, and there's nothing I can do about it.\" She seats herself on one of the pews, unknowingly slipping into the DM voice she used to use for tabletop games as she begins to recount the tale. \"It was late October when your mother and I decided to venture into the frigid wastelands of the north. Far too late in the year to be travelling, but she was a hunter for hire and there was good money to be had hunting yeti before the winter snows set in. Unfortunately, only a few miles from the town, we discovered it was us that were being hunted. We were Ambushed by bandits. She killed a few but was overwhelmed. I tried to fight them but my claws broke against their armour and, for my troubles, I lost an eye.\" She reaches up to touch the grisly facial scar that mars her face. \"They beat me to within a hitpoint of my life. When I woke, I was alone. I managed to crawl to this village but they're less than enlightened regarding beastmen. They locked me in chains and made me their slave. For all their boastful talk, they're cowards. They refuse to seek out and kill the bandits, no matter how much I beg them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to look sympathetic but - \"You did kind of sign up for this sort of stuff. A life of peril and adventure and all that. You specifically told me not to interfere because you wanted the real experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she's dead, she'll just wake up when the simulation resets or switches over to a new map, with a new body and a new life. It's just like waking up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that!\" she snaps. \"What I'm worried about is that she might not be dead! The more ai hear about these bandits from the Northmen, the worse it gets. Theyre the remnants of a group Old God cultists. They're deranged cannibals! They don't kill their victims, not at first anyway. They torture and eat you while you're still alive, piece by piece!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, you know NPCs talk a load of shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if they're right. What if they're out there torturing here right now... And I'm stuck here in this stupid catgirl body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If mum was in that sort of situation, she'd alert me herself,\" you remind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? It took me weeks before I had an opportunity to slip away from my owner. To call an admin, you need to be at a holy site, and you need hands and lips to pray,\" she added darkly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nutty cannibals are still within the game though. They're a part of the experience. Unless its a bug, a problem with the code, I'm not supposed to interfere. Your rules, not mine.\" You glance at a watch which doesn't exist. Somewhere up there, your shop is being run by a student. A student for Gods sake. At /50 speed admittedly, but you don't feel comfortable leaving the store unstaffed for any length of time when it's this busy. \"Look, how does this sound - I've got backup copies of both your data. If she shows up and she has been tortured to the point where her mind is gone, I'll just reload her from her previous save. It'll be like it never happened!!\" you say breezily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth falls open, stunned, and you realise you might have crossed a line. \"That's supposed to make me feel better?! You don't save-scum your own mother, Kal! That's not an option. I want you to help me find her and make sure she's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, fine,\" you concede...</span></div></div>",

Your finger flicks downwards and the number drops a figure - 11. She lunges out, wrapping her arms around yours, trying to wrench you away, but her strength is nothing compared to a god. \"No, wait! What are you doing?\" You flick again, ticking the number down to 10 then 9. \"Kal, that's me you're editing! Think about what you're doing!\" ...8...7... \"Stop it! I can't think!... I can't... can't...\" ...6...5...At 4 she seems to lose the power of speech entirely and simply sinks her teeth into your arm, though her fangs fail to even penetrate the godlike resistance of your skin. You continue until your dad's intelligence rests at 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young khajit removes her teeth from your arm, staring up at you with bewilderment in her dull, animal eye. She looks around the human room in confusion, her whiskers twitching and her ears flattening against her head timidly. She seems paralysed with fear. She doesn't resist as you grip the hem of the sack and pull it over her head. \"Mew?\" she says quietly as your hand slides up over her torso, caressing all eight of her nipples before cupping her small breasts.

That was the funny thing about intelligence vs. wisdom, while intelligence is usually measures how much a person knows or how easily they can learn new things wisdom dictates common sense, such as judgment abilities and how people react to situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example a person with high intelligence but low wisdom would be able to due complex math equations in their head but would not be able to understand why they shouldn't walk around butt naked or be able to tell when a person is lying to them. To put it bluntly they would be an idiot savant or bunny ears lawyer character, incredible gifted at what they do but lacking any form of common sense. (They would likely go along with being willing slaves regardless of their own abilities simple because they couldn't understand the moral and social implications of their stats.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other example, what I just did to my dad, having high wisdom but low intelligence is the other side of the coin. With a low intelligence stat my father's mind is little more than that of the beast he is role playing as and as such all of his decisions will be based completely on his wisdom stat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich would explain why my new cat girl slave was getting into my petting of her. While she lacked the intelligence to understand the fact that I was domesticating her into a slave/pet she could understand that every time I pet her she feels pleasure and will therefore try to get me to pet her as much as possible so that she could feel good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis put her in the perfect state of mind for... conditioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer change time dilation from fifty X to fifty thousand X\" I called out as I changed the settings with a smile. \"I'm deserve a break after all the work I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew\" The cat girl's response was to rub her naked body on mine, trying to get warm and realizing that my body produces a [Aura of Contentment].<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how else should I change you?\" I mutter out, \"I could change your stats some more or give you some [Special Skills] to make you a better slave... hmm speaking of stats I wonder what my own stats are like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly pull out my own stat sheet and let out a laugh as I see my godly values.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrength: 440<br>\r\nDexterity 490<br>\r\nConstitution: 460<br>\r\nIntelligence: 412<br>\r\nWisdom: 410<br>\r\nCharisma: 470<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat girl on my lap tried to claw at the screen but as she was not an admin the claws just went right through the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave the girl a predatory leer. I just noticed that my dad's cat girl form was actually fairly average as far as cat girls go. Perhaps I could change her body type? Maybe a super hourglass figure... Loli characters have also become highly desired due to laws allowing such things in VR, as long as the players are adults of course. (Either way I'd have to get rid of the eight nipple thing she has going, its kind of creepy.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy just stop at her form? Cat girls aren't the only type of fetish out there after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFigure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe something else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do?         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Activating my admin powers I froze the world's time to think about how my life is lost in the real world. I looked down at my hand hoping to see my old hands, but sadly I knew it was false hope as I knew I already took over an AI body when I went into this world. These feminine hands only serve to reinforce my thought of never returning back to real life. Opening my admin menu wounded what to do in this world. I can depossess my current body to take over an a different body, freeze time, take over other NPCs though this is limited two only ten people, and that's about it. What to do in this world.</span></div></div>",

Better go get Houki or Cecilia to see if I can pass as being Chifuyu. Getting off my chair I began to look for one of the two. Walking down the hallway I manage not to trip in the high heels Chifuyu wore. After a couple of minutes I walk to what I believe was Cecilia room. Unfreezing time on the door I open to see Cecilia in her nightgown in her bed, I began to unfreeze time on Cecilia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecilia, wake up I need your help with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was met with an unintelligent response. Great, now how to wake her up. I don't want to get the bed wet so no cold water. I can't just walk up to her and slap her face. Foundling her might work but it might only give her wet dreams. Ah fuck it, I going to straddle her and fondle her. Walking up to her bed I took off those annoying high heels. Straddling her I began to roughly fondle her to wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ..... Yes ....... Please ..... Ugh, who is fondling me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be me Cecilia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Miss Chifuyu, what do you need if me?\" I need you to come to my office, I need help with acting like Chifuyu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, just let dress, and can you get off me please, it is kind of hard to get off the bed with you straddling me Miss Chifuyu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting off her body I picked up the high heels and moved to random chair in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't Turn on the light and open my dresser?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked, I forgot to unfreeze her things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me an moment, I froze everything in the world. Their, it's done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around I met the sight of a naked Cecilia opening her dresser to grabber her bra and panties. She pick a pair of matching white. Once she was done putting them on she went to grab her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I am done Miss Chifuyu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded at her response. I got off the chair and began walking to the office. Once I was in the office I asked her to review my performance on acting like Chifuyu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did Cecilia respond to me performance?</span></div></div>",

You select the Player_ID, app, and above your head a pulsing golden sphere appears. Invisible to the game characters, but marking you as a player, 'Admin', is written beneath in a simple font. Looking around you scan the crowd, most still look the same, though you spot a scattering of blue spheres, and pink spheres spring into view identifying the players. Beneath each ball, their names are written, though you're too far away to read them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou activate the Find app, and enter the player's id. Making a small cupping gesture with one hand, a translucent disc appears, spinning like an unsettled compass before it settles on the direction for you to go.

Your own latin is appalling, so thankfully the NPC's will just speak English to you.

Some take it as a challenge, and are trying to make a living in the world, getting by as a merchant or an artisan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, you suspect that RX-20, is one of those folk that played this as an adventure game, living the life of a mugger, a thief, or an adventurer.

Other NPC's step around you, as you pass them oblivious and unoffended by your behaviour. None notice your gaze fixed on your hand as you walk.

Those fantasies working to make your pulse race, and your body's excitement build. Each stolen glance, or crude leering stare seem to drive those fantasies... no, those fears, make them appear more justified, more palpably real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach the courthouse, even the compass feels obvious and marks you out. It's been pointing the same direction for a while, so you take on a more natural walk. You feel your hips sway, and your rear float as your instincts give you a more feminine gait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking past the guards, mounted on their horses. A horseman on each side of the broad, thick double doors. Flanking them, you see two more guards on either side, their eyes scanning the crowd for trouble.

Surely, they'll confuse your embarrassment, and crimson cheeks as suppressed arousal, as approval for their unwelcome leers. Once in the shade, you turn to look over the street scene yourself.

You wonder what he's getting from this experience. A job as dull as this can't be why he came into this sim. With a shrug, you think up dozens of reasons why he might be here. In real life, he might live in a tiny apartment in the city, and take this as his indulgence a holiday, a chance to connect with nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet echo on the cold marble floor, as you cup your hand, keeping it low by your side.

Your body constantly brushing against the other girls... <i>other </i>girls.

Just looking at this man made you feel uneasy, like he shouldn't be able to exist at all and that his very presence was violating certain laws of nature.

As for your console, that was disabled when I took control of this simulation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped your fear didn't show on your face.  VR hackers were relatively rare, due to the complexity of the technology, but two or three times a year one would make the news.  Most of those were just bored people or attention whores, but every now and again came news of a truly terrifying VR hacker.  Hackers who could trap people in simulations, even alter their memory files and effectively mind control them in the real world.  And if this guy could shut down an admin like it was nothing, he clearly knew what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why have you taken over a history sim?\" you asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sideways Man looked down at his pipe briefly before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you familiar with the work of Ren\u00e9 Magritte?\" he asked.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was a Belgian Surrealist painter, and he created a piece known as the Treachery of Images.  It depicts a pipe, much like this one, captioned with the phrase 'Ceci n'est pas une pipe.'  In English, it means 'This is not a pipe'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with anything?\" you ask annoyed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Magritte was referencing to the fact that his image was only the likeness of a pipe, only a <i> simulation </i> of a pipe.  Just like this place is a simulation of the Medieval world.  But you see, I disagree with M. Magritte's reasoning.  I don't believe the images around us are betraying us, I think they are simply telling a different truth.  In other words,\" the Sideways Man held out his pipe to show \"this is indeed a pipe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't respond, but you were starting to see where the hacker was going.  And it wasn't good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is why I hacked into and took control of this random history simulation.  Because I can rule this world, and this world is real enough for me.\" The Sideways Man declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis guy is insane, and you need to get yourself and Madeline out of here and out of the simulation before things get further out of hand.  There's one last thing you can try; even without your admin console, you should still be able to activate a security purge to remove the hacker's tampering from the simulation.  But there's always the chance the Sideways Man prepared for that.  Still, you have to do something, so you send the signal to activate the purge.  </span></div></div>",

Huge, mahogany bookshelves of textbooks rise to the ceiling and seemingly stretch away all the way to the vanishing point, the infinite shelves only ending when they become obscured in the dim murkiness of the library. There re is a strong, pleasant smell of wood polish and old paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDotted here and there are posed anatomical statues, human figures with their skin stripped away, displaying their purple-red musculature, their internal organs, venous system, skeleton, or nervous system. They look unbelievably lifelike - anatomy has certainly come a long way from the plastic models of old. If you didn't know any better, you could swear some of them moved. The audience of dissected humans and the deep silence of the library is unsettling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to you, there is a desk, on which a book has been left open. Next to the desk, there is a computer terminal. The screen glows amber. It was from this terminal that the alert had been sent. Whoever had accessed the terminal had been part way through typing a message too, though had been unable to finish or send it. It just reads '<b>HEL</b>'. Taking a step closer to the terminal, your foot brushes against something on the thick, crimson carpet. An arm lays on the ground. Curious, you pick it up, glancing round for the model to which it belongs. None of the ones close to you seem to match the pale complexion of the limb you hold in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the arm twitches, the fingers gripping your arm fiercely. You yelp in surprise, prying it away and throwing it. The arm wriggles and thrashes on the ground. Backing away, you trip over something else. It is a shoe, complete with a foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>At least they can't have gotten far.</i> Approaching the intersection between shelves, you round the corner into the next aisle to find the place strewn with books, as though they had been pulled from the shelves and thrown. A severed human hand crawls slowly across the carpet like a spider. A little further on you discover a small chunk of flesh. Then a torn, tattered shirt. Another foot... A pair of jeans... A knee... A thigh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the trail, the silence gives way to human voices until rounding a final corner, you almost fall over two figures (well... 1.5 really) on the ground. It is the girl you served only a minute ago, the medical student, her arms and legs cleanly severed and her clothes gone. Naked and helpless, she desperately tries to squirm away from the man crouched over her and the scalpel in his hand. You recognize him immediately as one of the pre-med students that frequents the cafe, though usually he isn't nude and rambling like a madman while foam bubbles from the corners of his mouth. He swings the scalpel down, cutting a long, deep line from between her breasts down to her navel. Thrusting his hands into the cut and inside her abdominal cavity, he continues to rant. \"anterolateral...oblique...linea alba...no time no time...pulmonary trunk...pericardium...NO TIME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raises the scalpel again. Grabbing a heavy textbook, you heft it at him. It strikes him across the head and he scrambles away on all fours, hissing at you like an animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, get out of here, ya creep!\" you yell, throwing a Twelfth Edition Gray's Anatomy. \"Fucking med students! Learn to unwind already!\" Your barrage forces him back. He cowers behind a bookcase while you stoop to check on the shaking, limbless girl on the ground.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The journal is very intriguing. The only reason a hacker would keep one is for security. Every hacker knows that any computer can be hacked, but a journal can't unless you can put your hands on it. Most hackers are cowards hiding in their basements, safe behind a computer screen. You crack it open and start reading it. The first third of the journal is pretty intelligible. As you already figured this guy figured out we are all living in a very advanced computer simulation. Upon reading this your anxiety begins to rise again. You manage to push it down again. As you read on you can tell the guy is starting to loose it. He rambles on about the meaning of it all and becomes obsessed with contacting the administrator of reality, otherwise known as God. He starts doing some really sick shit trying to get God's attention. He then found a way to hack the real world, or rather the sim you live in. Yours is not the first cyber caf\u00e9 he has visited. The technical side of it looses you somewhat, but he found a way to hack users within the VR environment. The code he inserts into the users avatar carries over and rewrites the users code in this reality. According to his notes he was working on a way to do more than change users. He was looking for a way to change things in the real world without the need to go through VR. He was essentially looking to steal admin rights to reality. He was hoping to get God's attention this way. He also rambles on about reincarnation and wondering if we're all users playing a game in the sim, or simply AIs' muddling along according to their programming. \"What a nut\", you mumble. If you hadn't seen the change yourself you could just dismiss this all as another person loosing their mind in VR. There is an actual syndrome to describe this. You figure your parents reached that point years ago. You look at the prize you have in front of you and ponder what to do with it. You could just trash it all and try to forget what you've discovered. You doubt you can do that. You can't forget something as life changing as this. You could have a lot of fun with this stuff. You could also pick up where he left off. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the girl ran out of your cafe with her new pair of knockers, you returned to your office. Eager to experiment with the new software that you just obtained, you plugged back into the educational simulation that the hacker had broken into earlier. A quick sweep through the simulation's core code confirmed that your wayward hacker didn't cause any irreversible damage to the sim beyond what he did to the (un)fortunate girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the sim's system wasn't going to crash from an unexpected error, you opened the file containing the malware from your private server. Lines of invasive code struggled to escape the firewalls you erected around it, but the malware was crafty as it seemingly adapted and started breaking down your security. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry buddy, but your creator left me with a tight leash.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInputting the security code from the notebook, your firewalls flared up and the malware was safely contained behind them once again. You entered more codes as the malware soon became as docile as a dog and you could safely use it without fear of corrupting your own avatar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing the sim, you scouted for potential users to test the malware on. In a quiet corner of the library, you found the one to beta-test your new software. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in the corner of the library was your typical 16 year-old geek with bulky glasses, bad acne, and a little too much mass around her waist. The young woman's hair was a greasy red curtain as she skimmed over the book; \"Weight Training for Dummies\". You felt a tinge of pity for the young woman as you yourself had been on the receiving end of a horrible puberty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what I can do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving a hand, the young woman's avatar turned into a series of complex code and equations. Thanks to the upgrades you procured from the hackers notebook, you could \"see\" the strands of DNA within the VR. You injected a sliver of the malware into the girl's avatar, watching as it wriggled its way into her skin then began to alter the complex coding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned away and hide behind one of the mahogany bookshelves. Unfreezing the sim, you watched with anticipation as some of the girl's acne began to disappear and she visible cleared up. The girl wasn't aware of the change though and went on reading her guide book for dummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible.\" you whispered. \"If that hacker wasn't insane, he could have literally bridge the gap between the real world and the virtual world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you paused the simulation and pulled up her avatar code. The malware pulsed bright-red against the avatar's blue code and you quickly entered the kill code. It flared up violently for a moment then cooled to soft blue and you could no longer differential the malware from her avatar's code. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I know it works...how do I convince her to keep coming here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the malware had already given the med student a huge pair of knockers and cleared up some of this girl's acne, so you wanted to see how far you can go with it. It would be suspicious if you only gave her a discount, especially when she starts noticing the changes you would be causing. It would be bad for business if you were caught using an illegal software patch on your customers. Especially one that was capable of tampering with their physical bodies. Prison would be the least of your worries if you got caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that I'll have to bite the bullet and offer a special to everyone for awhile.\" Pulling up a calculator, you estimated the loss you would be dealt for this experiment and it was within tolerable margins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...now what about this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled out the other memento that the hacker had left behind. The scalpel materialized along with the sub-menus that would allow you to bypass both security and influence other sims. It was almost like a portable admin privilege and if you hadn't surprised the hacker back then, he could've hijacked your entire cafe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and stored the scalpel back in your inventory. It might come in handy later, but you didn't want such a broken item out in the open. Who knows what would happen if another Jack the Ripper appeared in one of the simulations. Unplugging yourself from the sim, you pulled up the girl's name and avatar. You placed it on the list for the group discount along with a few other regulars to ensure that you wouldn't be singling her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter confirming everything, you left your office to man the front desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl...no Susie, you looked up her name on the list, came out of the cafe about an hour after you injected the code in her. Her acne was definitely better than it was before and you called out to her before she left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse miss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye-es.\" She stuttered. \"Wha-t is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to inform you that I'm offering a discount to all the regulars here. You've qualified for the discount and now all visits will be at half price, so I hope that you'll continue to use our services.\" You gave a pass card and her eyes lit behind her thick glasses as she took it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Than-Thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you for using the Escapist. I wish you a good day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie basically skipped out the door after you handed her the card, so you figured she would be coming back soon. Afterwards, you handed out the same card to the rest of the regulars on your list and by the time that was over, it was already past midnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou massaged your sore neck as you walked back down to your office and pulled out the fold-able bed. \"Not the first-time\" you thought sleepily and collapsed on it in a heap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day has been one of twist and turns, but you were still down-right giddy at the thought of experimental with the new software.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait for tomorrow.\" You fell asleep with that thought in mind. </span></div></div>",

You did say that you hadn't tried mental changes, but after all, if all it is is \"data\", then changing it should be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara stood up and started to put her clothes back on. You followed suite and you both headed back into the VR booth's. Rather than letting Sara sit in one of the chairs that any random person would sit in, you invited her into your own room and let her use the one beside your own personal one. She graciously accepted and you plugged yourself in shortly after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin less than a minute, you were standing back in the same infinitely sized library that you had first met Sara in.<br>\r\n\"Eh, been here, done that\" She said to you.<br>\r\nShaking your head and with a few swipes of your hand upon the digital keyboard, the library faded away into dust quickly reforming into a large beach. Crystal blue ocean in front of you and palm trees and jungle mountains behind.<br>\r\n\"Does this suit you better madam?\" You asked. Sara laughed at you.<br>\r\n\"Well go on then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled out the scalpel from your inventory and a quick tap on Sara gave you all the information boxes you needed to edit her. You started as intended, making her significantly taller. She now stood so tall that you only just the underside of her breasts. Sara was ecstatic. \"This is amazing!\" She cried, giving herself a good feel over.<br>\r\nWhile Sara gave herself a feel up and down, you kept scrolling through the various menus that the scalpel had provided to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first time you had ever used this, the menus had been climbing over themselves to appear in front of you.

Sara pulled a chair out of thin air and sat down on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the scalpel, you cut around her head and removed her skull cap. Sara's brain was there in all it's glory, pink, wrinkly and unmoving. As soon as you touched the scalpel to her brain, smaller sub menus appeared, giving you various sliders to adjust.<br>\r\nHer specific brain functions all appeared to be above average.

Within a few minutes, Sara's IQ had hit 1000.<br>\r\nYou finished up and connected her skullcap back on.

You have doubts that being a girl will be an improvement seeing how Sara doesn't seem to happy being one. \"Let's do it now\", she growls leaping off you. She doesn't even bother getting dressed as she heads for the VR booths. Since it's way past closing time you're the only ones here anyway. You chase after her after grabbing the equipment. She lays down on the VR bed and you hook her up. You select a basic beach vacation sim and upload her. You then go to your chair and start up your found equipment. The link is pretty simple and intuitive. You set yourself up in the same sim and upload. You find yourself standing on a sunny beach. Sara is a few feet off wearing a bikini that shows off her impressive new rack. She walks up and with a smile says, \"Make a man out of me.\" In your hand is the scalpel. With a mental command it becomes a less intimidating bottle of suntan lotion. You hold it up to Sara and a bunch of commands appear in the air in your vision. You search around and find the ones you're looking for. \"This may feel a little strange\", you say. You then plunge the bottle of suntan lotion into her avatar. A look of shock comes over her face and her avatar starts to shimmer. You can tell the code is inserted and withdraw the bottle. She looks down at herself and asks, \"How long does it take?\" Her voice starts to crack and become deeper with the last word. You watch as she starts growing taller. Her breasts shrink and a bulge begins to grow in her bikini bottoms. In seconds there is a real good looking guy standing in front of you wearing a woman's bikini. Sara looks down at himself and his hand immediately goes to the sizable cock that is hanging free between his legs. \"That was what I was talking about\", he exclaims. \"My turn now\", you think. You command a mirror up from the sand and commands float in the air around your reflection. This is a common way to change an avatar's appearance in regular VR sims and you figure it'll work for this as well. You find the commands you're looking for. You then plunge the bottle into your reflection. Your point of view changes and you look down to see a hand disappearing inside your chest emanating from the mirror. The hand vanishes and you feel the invading code changing your avatar's base code. You've never felt anything like it.   </span></div></div>",

In addition to great sex you found it was much easier for a minority female to get a low interest government loan. You're currently tripling the size of the VR section of the caf\u00e9. For special clients you plan on using the tech you acquired to transform them into anything they wish, for a price. You don't plan on telling them the details as to how you can do this. If you are an AI construct in some sim you plan on being a rich one.</span></div></div>",

He pulls off his hat and comes right up to you. \"You took something of mine\", he states. You then recognize him from his eyes. \"You, you're the nut that left that stuff\", you state. He then smiles, stretches out his hand, and says, \"Mark Heart, love your new look. Never thought of using the tech that way, very cool. These guys are not government agents, they're angels.\" He then starts hooking the devices he put on the two agent's heads to a laptop he pulls from his backpack. \"Angels, are you kidding me\", you reply? He then pulls a pair of sunglasses from one of the agents and hands them two you. Before you do that you notice that the agent's eyes are completely black. \"Put them on\", he states. You put them on and the world takes on a new look. You can see strange colors and energies, auras. \"What is this\", you mumble? Mark laughs and answers, \"It's what makes up this reality.\" You pull them off and ask, \"What about these two being angels?\" Mark shakes his head and explains, \"That is one name they've used. They've used others. Think of them as an anti-virus program, but they're more than that. They protect the system and carry out them orders of the administrator. When something needs to be altered in the sim, the agents carry out the change. With a sim this complex changes must be performed from the inside.\" Mark explains this while typing away on his laptop. \"Ah, there it is\", he exclaims typing on the keyboard. Suddenly in the agents hands appear what looks like, well you have no idea what they are. The closest comparison is the nuralizer from MIB. Mark picks up one and says, \"Try it out, with the sunglasses on.\" You put the glasses on and then grab the other nuralizer. It's very similar to the what you experienced in you sim with the device Mark left behind. While holding the device strange symbols appear in your vision. \"What is this\", you ask?

He apparently has a current preference for busty women as he has left you as a very busty Asian girl. He fucked you so well and long you think you may have had enough of being a girl for a while. You sigh as you don't have much of a choice in the matter. He's the only one that knows how to use the angel's devices.

You also figure it's the only reason you're still alive. He could have easily erased you as he did the two angels, at least you figure he could have. Like so many other times in the past few weeks your mind ponders the mysteries of the simulated world you live in. It seems crazy. You remember growing up, having a family, going to school, and so many other things. You wonder if any of it was real and what kind of creature would create a world like this and why. You wonder about your true nature. Are you a construct within this world, or a user that wanted to experience a whole life? The latter gives you some comfort. It appeals to you that you, the real you exists somewhere plugged into a VR simulator. If desires carry over from on to another it makes sense if you wanted a completely immersive experience you would have your true memories blocked. That could explain so many things. People that claim to remember past lives may just be remembering past VR simulations. Memories not completely blocked out. If any of this is true, why would anyone create a world with so many problems, war, and cruelty? The question seems dumb as soon as you think it. You recall some of the most popular sims are war sims. You turn restless, bothered by these thoughts.</span></div></div>",

She shrugs and says, \"Yes, with a demi bra you may have to go up.\" She then rattles of the names of other bras causing your head to spin. You figure this is why women spend so much time shopping. \"Why so fucking complex\", you think as the clerk continues to give you a bra lesson. Apparently which bra to get is tied to what kind of outfit you're wearing. You're more confused than before, but try to hide it. You wander off back to the bras and start sifting through trying to remember everything the clerk said. \"This is going to take forever\", you think. You grab several in your size of different types not wanting to waste a ton of time on just one thing. You grab some panties and then spend time debating what size is your ass. You figure medium and grab a handful of different types avoiding the dreaded granny panties that no college age girl would wear, except real geeks. You're not to keen on thongs or bikini, but when in Rome and all. It's then off to the rest. You watch some girls that are about your age pulling outfits sizing them up. One of them is a real bimbo with big breasts like yourself. \"Geez Tiffany, this outfit is so cute. You'd look great in it\", one of the girls says to the bimbo looking girl. You see your opportunity and follow them around selecting the same size outfits as the girl with your body type is grabbing. You then move on to shoes. Shoes are easy as you can just size your foot right up to them. You know there is some secret formula for matching shoes to outfits, but don't care at the moment. You grab some sandals and something called wedges in your size. You then grab a purse you saw some other girls admiring. Feeling pleased with your selection you begin heading up front. You then notice the girls from earlier looking at jewelry. \"Shit, what college age girl doesn't have at least her ears pierced\", you think. </span></div></div>",

After he composes himself he says, \"Well, first of all I didn't do that in the library, provided you're talking about the dismemberment of young coeds. That was done by you're twin. Seems her and her fellow med students think it's fun to look at each other from the inside. A little on the sick side if you ask me. I'm a into theoretical physics, mathematics, coding, and such. In any case you don't have the IQ, or knowledge to fix it.\" The last bit kind of pisses you off. When it comes to VR you consider yourself an expert, though you do find your current situation hard to explain. \"Fuck you, I know a lot about VR. I'm a fucking expert. I built that caf\u00e9, every SIM in there I coded. I don't know how you manage to have changes carry over from VR to the real world, but I can figure it out\", you blurt out angrily.

You answer that and it'll take you closer to how I did it.\" This causes you to pause. \"Are you saying we're still in a SIM. This is not one of my designs\", your mind races around the answer. Your transformation makes sense if you never left the SIM. The problem is how did he code the city. The memory and processing power would be immense. Gary leans forward and with a sigh says, \"You're so close, you want to say it. This is the world you, I, and everyone else was, well born in to, but it's not real. It's a simulation.\" Your mind spins and you nearly fall back. Everything falls in to place. You've heard the theory that the whole universe, all of reality was a computer simulation, but always dismissed it as foolishness. \"Ahh, there it is. Now you know.

There are not a lot of cars in the parking lot and not many places where your car could be hiding. \"What ever\", you say under your breath pulling your keys out of your purse. Right away you notice they are not your keys. Curious you press the remote and a pink Mini Cooper fifty feet away chirps and flashes its lights. \"See, there it is right in front of you\", Gary says with a smile and begins walking towards it. \"That's not my car\", you shout racing after him. \"It is now\", Gary says getting into the passenger side. You pause for a minute looking around afraid the real owner may show up. \"Hurry up and get in. A hot girl like you shouldn't be standing in a dark parking lot\", Gary says. You get in and lock the doors. You look over at Gary and ask, \"How are you doing this, the car and my ID?\" You pull out the ID and show him. Gary sighs and replies with, \"I'm not doing it, Kara, you did. Reality is rewriting itself around the changes you made to your base code. Pretty soon the world will only know that Kara existed. Consider yourself lucky that this happened and not the alternative. If they had showed up we'd have had some problems. Hell, they may still show up if the change hasn't completed yet.\" You look at him and ask, \"Who is they?\" Gary shakes his head and explains, \"In you VR caf\u00e9 is your servers protected by anti-virus and malware detectors? (you nod) This reality, this VR is no different. There are protectors that detect and eliminate foreign code and errors. They've gone by many names, angels and more recently the men in black.

Moving quickly to the blue door, you step through into the next room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is less enclosed than the entrance room, a wide-open space of creamy sandstone, the walls painted with intricate panterns and paintings of gods, the floors coated with persian rugs. A fountain bubbles in a shallow pool in the center of the room, the water flowing out along a chanel set into the floor that runs around the room. Illuminated by hot sunlight streaming through the narrow windows, beyond which you can see only an ocean of desert. The windows are too thin to squeeze through and it's unlikely the developers bothered to render anything outside the harem anyway. Which means the user you're looking for is somewhere in this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDotted about the room are about thirty or forty figures, most of them women, all of them beautiful, in various stages of undress. Some recline on sofas, beckoning you closer, other sun their naked, bronzed bodies in the patches of golden sunlight, others lay at the pool's edge, running their long limbs lazily through the water. Some caress themselves wantonly, watching you with lustful eyes. To your right, two petite asian woman fill the room with soft moans as they explore each others bodies with their tongues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figures' movements are sluggish, repetitive, robotic. They're AI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat awkwardly. \"Um... hi! I'm the admin. Somebody requested assistance from this simulation, so if whichever one of you is the user could make themselves known that'd be great.\" You pause for them to respond. Not one of them moves, except to continue with their programmed activity, ignoring you completely. \"Everybody, if you could all just stop what - or who- you're doing and look at me for a moment, I'm looking for a user. If the user could please stand up, that'd be great, because I'm a very busy guy.\" Again, no response. You sigh. \"Computer, what users are logged into this simulation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">Dennis Hepplewhite</div></i>------<br>\r\n<b>Half an hour ago...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Kal, is it packed in here today or what?\" Dennis said, as he stood at the counter, blocking the flow of customers and requiring everybody to reach right around him to grab their coffees. \"You're going to have to start forcing them in with a stick soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" you say absently, as you try to prepare three drinks at once. Dennis had been stood there for five minutes now and showed no signs of moving. \"Mr Hepplewhite, are you going to order drinks or....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Kal! None of this <i>Mr Hepplewhite</i> crap. Call me Uncle.\" Dennis wasn't really your Uncle, but he was your father's oldest friend and had known you since you were born. Like your father, he was a massive comic book nerd and roleplayer. He was in his late middle age, though still dressed in the fashions of a 15-year-old, with long, thinning hair and a big, black neckbeard. \"I just came here to see how my favourite nephew was doing. Look at you, all grown up, running your own business!\" He stretched right across the counter, knocking over a large bowl of sugar with his belly, and ruffled your hair roughly, causing boiling hot coffee to spill over your fingers as you dodged away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grgh! Mister Hepplewhite, if you'd kindly -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Uncle', please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Uncle</i>,\" you say through gritted teeth. \"I'm really, <i>really</i> busy today. If you can just leave me alone while I'm trying to deal with customers, that would be just great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis shrank back, looking like a wounded child. \"Oh... Sorry, buddy. Just proud of you is all,\" he mumbled. \"You know I've always thought of you as my own, and ever since your parents left you've just been so stressed out all the time.\" Suddenly his expression brightened. \"Hey, I know what'll help you relax! Gimme one of those education sims.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy to be rid of him, you handed him a credit chip good for an education sim of his choice.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nIn Sultan's Harem, you groan. \"Alright Mister Hepplewhite, you can come out now.\" But as you step closer into the room, you notice a message scrawled across the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Let's play a game.

Allow me to be your guide as you learn more about the sexual practice of fellatio,\" she says, reaching for your trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of your hand, the AI character goes limp, falling back onto the divan. Her body begins to lose its shape, bloating and losing definition while shrinking at the same time. Her torso swells, her breasts shrink. Her arms snap to her sides, melding with her body like warm butter. Her legs shrivel up into her body. With a <i>blorp</i>, the flesh of her torso merge with that of her chin, eradicating her neck, so that she is now just a tube of flesh with a face, nipples and pussy, but even they begin to disappear as she shrinks further, her dark skin taking on a more mottled, meaty texture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe divan is shrinking and changing too, the pale wood and soft cushions merging together and softening as it wraps around her body. The outside surface takes on the appearance and texture of brown bread mottled with sesame seeds. As the concubine completes shrinking to a size that will fit nicely in your hand, the hot dog bun closes around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the hotdog. The simple AI inside it is still running and the meat squirms a little as you bite into it. You eat her slowly, looking expectantly around the room as you do. When you're finished, you lick your fingers. \"One down,\" you say loudly. \"You may as well come out now, Mr Hepplewhite, because I'm going to find you eventually, and you probably don't want to experience what I'm about to do to these AI.\"</span></div></div>",

I guess we're buddies now after sharing a testicular self exam together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exam was over and Mark's mind was pulled out and returned to his own body. The lesson resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the testicles, the sperm travel up and deep inside your body. The tubes do not go straight to the penis. The sperm enjoy a rollercoaster ride inside your body with one giant loop before reaching the prostate.\" You turn around, squat, bend over and spread your ass cheeks. The dais rises until your ass hole is at Mark's eye level. \"The prostate is located beneath the bladder and very close to the rectum wall. When a doctor needs to examine a prostate, he uses gloves and lube. Since this is virtual reality, that won't be necessary.  Reach in and find my prostate. It is shaped like a walnut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel two hands penetrate you and know that Cynthia is inside you. As soon as Mark found your prostate, he withdrew his hand but Cynthia lingered.</span></div></div>",

You went through about twenty different penis transformations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you demonstrated the different stages of arousal. \"Now I am just about to ejaculate. See how my scrotum has pulled my testicles in tight in preparation for pumping the semen out.\" At least you get to enjoy the pleasure of the orgasm you get when you ejaculate on cue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you start teaching about the changes that happen during puberty. Mark seems more relaxed now about touching you. He runs his hands through the hairy chest you now have. As you teach about birth control, Mark's hand lingers long after he put a condom on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia says, \"Mark, that's innappropriate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no worse than what you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought you were hetero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.

He fondles your balls. \"Mom, I'd like you to meet Kal. He accidentally got stuck in the demo male but agreed to stick around and not interrupt the lesson. He's a great guy. He's nice. He's even forgiven you for yanking his cock painfully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's someone in there?

Another false alarm, the third this week. With a system this complex and finely tuned, it's understandable that there would be a few glitches here and there, the odd ghost in the machine. That remainds you, you've got that great new Ghost in the Shell sim to try out this evening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou switch off the warning for that bunk and head back to the front desk. The workload continues but around mid afternoon it starts to calm down as students log out and hurry off to their exams. Around 6pm you check in the  blue room to find one of the students logged-out but asleep in his bunk. You poke him awake, remind him of the time and he runs away crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 9pm, you flick the Open sign on the door to Closed, leaving the door unlocked so that the last few customers in simulation can wander out as their time expires. There are days when you stay open later but you figure the system needs time to cool down after an intense day. As do you. You pour yourself a coffee and start to tidy the place up. Dad's body tries to help. The rudimentary Body Guard program in his brain finds a broom and begins to sweep away at the floor with stiff, robotic strokes, moving back and forth across the shop with the simple pathing of a roomba. Mum's body, also inhabited by a Body Guard, gathers the used cups from the tables, and manages to only smash two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping open the till to do a count of the day's takings, you marvel at the thick piles of crumpled notes. As you do, the doorbell <i>tings</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, we're closed,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Tescos carrier bag is thrust into your hands while a large knife is thrust beneath your chin. \"Put everything in the bag and nobody gets hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up into bloodshot eyes set in a head adorned with scars and open sores. The guy is twitchy as hell, strung out on something, and the knife is shaking alarmingly. \"Sure thing, buddy,\" you say soothingly, taking handfuls of notes and begin to stuff them into the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't move, bitch! I said don't move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror, you see mum wandering obliviously towards the counter, coffee cups in hand. The robber turns the knife towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, she doesn't know what she's doing,\" you cry out. \"She's just got an AI in her head; she doesn't understand what's happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't come any closer, bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stab my mum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coffee cups clatters to the floor. With a sickening crunch, your mother grabs the robber's wrist and drives down on his arm with her elbow, snapping the bone in two. The knife flies upwards, spinning in the air. With the mechanical precision that only a computer program could wield, she pulls it smoothly out of the air and drives it clean through his other arm, severing nerves and arteries, sending a spray of blood over the chintzy chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad's body sweeps at the blood, smearing it over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robber howls in agony, slumping away into a table. You leap over the counter as fast as your flabby, asthmatic ass will allow (probably would have been quicker to just walk around) and carefully take the knife from your mother while trying to appear as non-threatening as possible. Who knew the self-defence prototols on the Body Guard would be that effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point the knife at the guy but all of a sudden it hardly seems fair. His arms hang limp and he's losing a lot of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, what do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMum smiles serenely and returns to collecting crockery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, move,\" you bark, waving the knife in the direction of the blue room. He obeys, sullen and teary eyes. \"Lie down and strap that on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell you doing, man, I need a hospital,\" he sobs, bleeding all over your nice clean VR bunk. As he straps the headset on, the neural clamps immobilize every muscle from the neck down, rendering him floppy. You lower the knife and slide out the keyboard next to the bunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to strip out your personality and upload a bodyguard program. They come with first aid training; it'll be able to stop the bleeding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fueargajerkdunhdhuhsdneefurguuweeeeee,\" he blurts, the human equivalent of an old dial-up modem, as his consciousness is sucked down a wire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Download at 100%] displays the computer. You heave a sigh of relief, knowing the guy is now safely stored in your hard drive. Even if his body bleeds out, you're covered.</span></div></div>",

You wince from the sounds. It's definitely not a good idea to leave it there like that, even if you want to have a little fun with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum, make sure to watch after him. Dispose of him if he starts acting up,\" you add the last command just in case the AI goes rogue or something. It shouldn't, speaking from experience, but there is a chance that it can be glitched. Better safe than sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk upstairs, the stairs creaking under pressure. Hmm... it seems that you might need to renovate the store soon, lest you be sued by a disgruntled customer who broke his leg in a fall. Rolling your eyes, you proceed to the phone while picking up the cup of your - now warm - coffee. Taking a sip, you spit it out onto the floor as your crunch your eyebrows and take a small detour to the microwave. <i>Damn</i>, you think, <i>reheated coffee just doesn't taste the same</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialing the classic 9-1-1, you hum as your hear the ring of the phone, before suddenly being cut off by the operator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, what's the emergency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... uhm... I have a... well, there's a person that's kind of bleeding out here... Yes... Uhm, it's 69 Dickley Rd... NO! Why would I joke about that...?! It really exists!... Okay, goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hang up the phone, swearing under your breath. It isn't your fault that a mayor in the past had poor naming sense. Heading to the microwave, you take out your cup as you take a big gulp this time, satisfied, and head to the basement. As you approach it, you seem to smell an... iron smell. Sort of like... blood...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop your cup, shattering it and drenching your pants with coffee, as you rush downstairs, nearly tripping over the old steps. You emerge as you hear a sickening crunch. You glance over... and puke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of you is a gruesome scene. Mum is repeatedly smashing her fist into the body of the robber. Guts and intestines are spilling out, Ribs are protruding from the stretched skin, piercing through the muscle and skin. Splatters of blood are strewn all over the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run up to Mum and power her down before rebooting, wiping all of her functions. What the hell happened...? Was there a fight? You look at Mum. There seem to be no signs of struggle. Or, at least if they were, Mum has been highly proficient during the battle, not even incurring a single injury. Looking at the carcass - it is unrecognizable and is mashed into a bloody pulp - you ponder if there has been a glitch in Mum's system. Probably not, you have coded the AI yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<i>Oh shit</i>. Shit. Shit. Shit. How can you have been so careless...? You remember the command you have given her. <i>Dispose of him</i>. Now normally a human would understand the following addition 'if he starts acting up'. But this is an AI. You need to give the conditional statement before the command. Otherwise, all you have is a command and a hanging conditional statement. Shit. That's why Mum disposed of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the sirens outside. Quickly rushing upstairs, you greet the paramedics as they rush into your store, overturning pots and plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp as you lead them downstairs. You can even see one of the paramedics resist the urge to vomit. <i>Heh</i>, you smirk, <i>seems like not all of them are hardened</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the body, the chief - at least you assume he's chief since he looks like the oldest - looks at the corpse and scoops up a handful of guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... Is this it?\" He asks, turning to you and thrusting the guts into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! That's it! Now get this away from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see the paramedic pale as he stumbles back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did... did you... murder him...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heavens sake no! I've uploaded his consciousness to this baby right here!\" You say as you knock on the VR unit, getting some blood on your fingers in the process. The paramedic's face visible calms down as his shoulders slump, relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's not a problem then! According to the People's Act, established a couple of years ago, the person is the mind itself, not the body. At most, this is simply destruction of property.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah. There was a law like that. Looks like you dodged a bullet on being charged for murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we will need to reconstruct the body. I assume that he's in there, right? Studying or playing or whatever. This accident happened then, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, that is not what happened, but it is for your best interest to simply nod your head. After all, uploading an AI to someone's body without permission isn't exactly... legal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Do you have a video of him? We can't exactly reconstruct from... this.\" He says as he waves his hand on the bloody corpse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. I have footage. Let me get... it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush upstairs, aiming to extract the security footage immediately. You just hope that the burglar doesn't sue your store down to bankruptcy. This could be a big case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you stop. Why should you give them the footage? You would most likely be paying for the reconstruction anyways! And fuck him! He tries to rob you and get away with it...? You should teach that punk a lesson!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind thinks back to dad's study. Back in the day, your father was an avid watcher of... what was it called...? Oh yeah... anime. He would watch those magical girl shows constantly, and it would annoy you every time he made a pose from some dumb show. You have watched a little bit of the anime he had stockpiled - and he has a lot of it - so you could pick out a Sailor Moon DVD or whatever and hand it to the paramedics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a chance - a pretty good one - that they would realize it's not real footage, but anime has diminished in popularity over the years, so you hardly believe any of them heard of it. And the way they looked at your VR units was as if though they thought it was some sort of alien contraptions. They're probably not very versed in the digital world anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to...</span></div></div>",

Your ready for him to strong arm you, threatening to take you to court if you don't give him what he wants, effectively robbing again, but, instead, he begins to cry. He whispers. \"Please... put me back in there... please\"  This man... could ruin you if he escaped jail time some how.

At least, the worst of his injuries. As a final security measure, you close the door on his VR pod. It's strong enough to prevent someone being physically ripped out of the VR environment, so you assume sturdy enough to survive if he somehow woke, and wanted to break out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to your console, you enter the pod ID and find him in the virtual world. He looks just as wired, just as strung out in VR, as he was in the flesh. Residual body image having ensured he ended up with a body he recognised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera view easily followed, as he ducked into an alley. He was pathetic, but at the same time still dangerous. He deserved a little punishment, even now he looked like a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's something I can fix.\" you thought, as you flexed your fingers. A few keystrokes, had your first punishment ready and lined up for use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour finger hovered over the 'enter' button. No second thoughts causing you any concern, no anxiety, just sheer anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye predator, hello prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStabbing the button, you kept your eye on him. The image rippled and changed. Immediately the difference was obvious, to you and him. He'd lost several inches in height, and stumbled. He dismissed the stumble, as dizziness at the new viewpoint. But you knew it was down to the high-heels he was now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real changes were hidden beneath the same thick coat he probably slept in. Watching his face, you see the uncertainty and fear flash across his new face. His hands patting at the smothering coat, the sense of wrongness building and building. Rubbing your hands, you see realization dawn on her face. The awkward angle of her ankle in those new shoes, the odd constriction in the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost bouncing with excitement in your seat, you see her grip the edge of her coat, trying to ignore, to dismiss the slender fingers she now controlled, and with a suddenness of somebody plunging into icy water, she ripped the coat wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c4e80ea371e3027b973f819346c3ac98/tumblr_ppit2eihaM1s77uywo1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/c4e80ea371e3...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like a flasher... if scantily clad women were flashers in dirty overcoats in dark alleys. As if recalling the last few minutes, you see her run her hand over her arm. Squeezing her soft flesh, searching for the broken bone, staring at her hands for signs of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStabbing another button on the keyboard, you have 'Voice of God' activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in my world, now. Bitch!\" You snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words echo around the alley, deafeningly loud, but audible only to your robber. Her head snaps around looking for the source of the voice. You have to wonder how stoned he was... did he even know it was a VR experience he was robbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen as he tries to address the empty air. It's the usual snivelling excuses, and pleading. You don't feel sympathetic, the memory of the adrenaline, the violence still too fresh to ignore or forgive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou double check that he's in the fully 18+ version of the game. The sleazy streets will be a new experience for her. Deciding you've heard enough of her whining, you decide to set some rules for her game. Doubting she'll listen at the moment, you stab another button. A range of sleazy options appears. With the full version of the game, you can indulge quite a range of fetishes, and fascinations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice cuts off, with a tap of the keyboard. Her eyes widen, her fingers scrabble at the gag that's appeared over the lower half of her face. Finding nothing to claw at the panic fills her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, girl.\" your voice fills her ears once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/170ad34c2fb4d5a001e085f629423e6e/tumblr_pt130cMOPq1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/170ad34c2fb4...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nostrils flare, as she fights for calm, and she forces her muscles loose to properly listen to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name is now Aiko Tanaka, and you're a whore. You'll be ungagged once I've laid out the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reaction is hard to judge with so much of her face hidden, but she isn't happy. The promise of the gag being removed does make her willing to listen. Typing in the victory conditions, you tell her to walk the streets, until you're ready to set out the rules, her new background, and what she needs to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith cruel delight, you switch on time-dilation in the sim. It'll make time in the sim last longer than time in the real world. Her pace takes on a comedic quick step, with her pacing back and forth in the alley. She races out, at an exaggerated walk, as random tramp wanders in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe public safety of being visible makes her squirm, and button up the long coat. But the neighbourhood isn't great, and it's night in the sim too. Her choice of clothes... Well, your choice of her clothes adds to her discomfort. The neon lights advertise all kinds of trashy entertainment. She hurries past the whores working their corners, cheeks flushing at how similar she looks to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gag is drawing too much attention, so you vanish it. Aiko's fingers brush over her full, pouting lips, her chest rising and falling as she gulps air deep into her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to her backstory, you type with the occasional chuckle to yourself. Usually it's the client that sets up what they want from the sim, but you want that to be as trashy and degrading as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you have the props ready in the cache ready to add to the environment. You tap the 'Voice of God' key, and the sim slows to normal speed. The change invisible to her, a glance to the in-game clock telling you the five minutes of your typing was two hours for her of street walking in the red-light district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe feels the new additions arrive in her coat pocket. Her hands dive in the deep pockets, snatching out the contents. The disgust on her face, as she opens her clawed hand to find a fistful of condoms, and a purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou outline her situation.</span></div></div>",

With the worst of his wounds dealt with by you, the pod will keep him stable while he's in the VR world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door startles you, and you look to the glass door expecting to see the police. Your heart stops racing, as you spot your three friends waving to you. A little late, but more than welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott, Charlene, and Simon are all eager for a late night session 'off the books', and you're the guy to hook them up. With the shop closed, the four of you are free to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenalin must still be flowing through your veins, as you don't spot the mess which your friends notice instantly, the splashes of blood are too clear on the tiled floor, and the trail towards the occupied VR pod ensure you don't really have to answer their questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistractedly, you merely shut the door behind them. Glad for the distraction, and finally taking on board their observations, you lower the blinds hiding the mess from view from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabbling one on top of the other, they work out what happened leaving you to merely nod when they get things correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott taps the pod, well, the screen on it's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you made her a whore?\" he asks, theatrically glancing between the game screen, and the actual player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlene tenses at the 'whore', eyes narrowing, she scowls between you, and Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... well... I've just made her feel vulnerable.\" You shrug half hoping Charlene will stop glaring your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He tried to rob me!\" you shoot back defensively. Her scowl instantly softens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I suppose.\" she looked a little embarrassed, \"I just don't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon is oblivious to the interplay, and smirks, \"We could make her tonight's game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott instantly got on Simon's idea. \"Yeah... Make her a whore... and.... and we can be the pimps chasing her down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was now nodding enthusiastically, \"Or madam, Charlene can play too... Obviously...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the game were decided, Simon was already looking for an empty pod to use. Following his example Scott was hunting for another. Charlene took a second look at the damage, and half-shrugged in resignation, \"Just don't make me trashy...\" Even the warning was half-hearted, as she looked for another pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faint hiss, and -<i>thunk</i>- marked Simon entering his pod, as it sealed him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya in there.\" Scott offered all of you, as he pulled his door closed with the same hiss, and -<i>thunk</i>-.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch Charlene's ass, as she sways towards her pod. Those gorgeous hips, as she slips inside, as if getting into a sports car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks and blows you a kiss as she slides her door closed, aware of your attention, and playing it for her amusement.</span></div></div>",

Your silence, encouraging her to continue. \"It's just he's flipped, so perhaps if we all flip, then I could be a pimp, and Simon and Scott could be the madams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing is rapid, as she waits for your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... sure.

He literally was in his office. An expansive mahogany desk filled his vision. It was dark and ornately carved, with a layer of dark green leather studded across the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning his hands across the surface, he felt the brass studs beneath his fingers. It truly felt like the real world. It felt like it was meant to be an antique, certainly impressive and intimidating. The fewer players, the more capacity the sim had to create for those in game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back, he saw his girls, five of them anyway, and behind them flanking the door two goons. They stood as if at attention, alert, and ready to act. Fully a head taller than the girls, or more. Scott guessed they were over 6' tall, maybe 6' 6\", or more. Their height aided by their muscular build. They were dressed in suits, shirts, and trousers, perhaps deliberately or just slightly too old. They bulged beneath, their firm pecs and bulging arms not quite fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to take in the women, you guess none of them is taller than 5' 6\", and their clothes are just as skin-tight. Well, perhaps more than a little skin-tight, and rather simple and sparse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal's words as he was downloaded, echoing through his memory. <span class=\"cgrey\">\"You rose through the ranks, by guile, and deceit, to your current position of authority, and your ability to deliver.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've a personal job tonight.\" Scott started, trying to project authority, command their obedience. But he didn't get any further, his words coming out in too high. Clearing his throat he tried again. \"Boys, keep things running here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod to the goons, he wanted them to take control in his absence. Again, his voice was too high. The realisation crashed down on him, and a few odd niggles started to make horrifying sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet didn't quite reach the floor, and his hands roamed over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ff3b801d1f851e1a0a9a31ff592ef7e/tumblr_pteg5zXpSa1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ff3b801d1f8...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly he discovered, he was a she. Somehow, he'd become the madam, rather than Charlene. Her scrambling hands found a pony tail trailing down her back too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e854f66d2e70c7b63fdc36aa732fad05/tumblr_pteg5zXpSa1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/e854f66d2e70...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting from side to side, Scott felt the wider hips, and the fuller ass too. The looks of concern were clear on everybody's face. Breaking their questioning gaze Scott gripped the ornate handles of his (well, her) seat. The same carving as the desk marking them as a matching pair. Pushing it backwards, she hopped off it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hope of standing, and towering over them, imposing her will by sheer intimidation vanishing as she was only average height. A couple of the girls taller than her, and their expressions. Dizziness struck Scott as he felt his backstory loaded into place. Clutching the desk for stability the personal history was implanted. Selena n\u00e9 Scott was blessed with her backstory. Her mouth twisted in discomfort, the <i>memories</i> oddly unsettling.</span></div></div>",

Terrified it's the police coming to investigate, your mind races.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a moment to find the person, until you look down a little. Dave is there in his wheelchair, \"I'm not too late, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou release the breath you didn't know you were holding, and unlock and open the door. Stepping aside, he wheels himself in. His arms look more muscular than your thighs, but you quickly close the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... We've not really started.\" you tell him. Quickly you fill in the events early on, jabbing a hand towards the robber, and letting him know the game you had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOffering to help, is quickly rebuffed. He always tried to do as much as he can himself. Managing to get from his chair to a convenient pod without any assistance. It's a little ungainly, but he scooches inside. He's as familiar with the pod, and the cables as yourself. The only relief from his dysfunctional body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe even smiles, as you reveal that everyone is getting a gender change. \"Don't make me too old, or too ugly.\" he chuckles, as he pulls the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the control console, you see he's already in the dream state, in the pre-load arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea hits you, making you smile, sure it'll appeal to Dave's sense of humour too.

Besides, they probably deserve it for not bringing Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavina will be statuesque. With the longest legs, and the highest heels too. You can picture her, intimidating the tallest guys, towering over them. She'll be well on her way to 7' tall with those heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gallery opens with the different options.

Hell! With every breath. The zipper slowly tic-ticking lower as she took in a deep calming breath. The riding crop gave her some sense of control and of being in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA latex gloved hand rising to her temple, as she felt the local knowledge downloaded into her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoram: A heavy, who kept the customers, and girls in line.<br>\r\nAlex: Another heavy, who looked good in a suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPictures came too, as she got to know her staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki: A Japanese girl with enhanced lips famed for her blow-jobs.<br>\r\nShawna: A wide-hipped Latina, and lover of anal.<br>\r\nToni: Who role-played with the best.<br>\r\nBetty: With an immense rack, and a love of tit-wanks and facials.<br>\r\nSimone: An all rounder, with a cruel and manipulative streak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon gasped realising, she was now, Simone. The images were horrifyingly graphic, especially her own leaving her feeling queasy, with a faint taste in the back of her mouth, that she didn't want to think about. She sincerely hoped, she hadn't ended up in Charlene's avatar. The idea of being up against two pimps, in a whore's... and ex-whore's body filled her with dread and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Charlene was towering over his girls. Physically much bigger, and stronger than any of them. She saw them cower in her mere presence, unable to even meet his eyes. 'Charlie', was known for his cruelty, and the leering face promised degradation for any girl who dared disappoint, and not much better for those who satisfied him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrified girls surrounded him, fake smiles plastered to their faces, desperately trying to read his expressions, and guess his will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept his voice low and gravelly, almost impersonating Christian Bale's Batman, as he commanded them. His commands to the goons no less clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly, she considered spending the night, spending the game here, and just enjoying his own brothel, rather than hunt the streets for prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was horrified, with his new body, abundantly female, and clad as he'd imagined. It was a shock to feel the constriction around his (No!) her waist. <i>She </i>couldn't forget her new sex, not in this game, not now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/51a615e4d32e07eed677265aee6ea914/tumblr_pt0sprNVh41whx09oo1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/51a615e4d32e...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a gaudy goth, she left the cathouse behind her and went hunting. The knowledge pouring in about her girls, was ignored, as she went prowling for the guy. Scott wanted the game to end as soon as possible. The cold night air whipped around her, and found every gap in her clothes. A breeze confirming what she'd expected/dreaded she wasn't wearing any underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game zone wasn't too large, only a few blocks. The players had access to the wider city, but the hunted girl was bound to the Red-light district, it's boundaries marked by the triangle of brothels. Should she try and escape she'd simply re-enter the game world from the opposite side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cornered and contained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal watched with amusement from his console. Each starting with a similar set-up, and none had thought to send out their staff to help.</span></div></div>",

There was fear in any looks that went her way, her confident strut, and her height made her tower over all the other women, and many of the men too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt even taller than she was, the bag bouncing against her thigh reminded her of the goal of the game. Nipping into the half-light of an alley, she took the various things from her bag, examining them with a curious eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first item unfurled with leathery stiffness, leaving her holding it uncertainly by the straps. It was an armbinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/24/bb/a9/24bba9425290a8c91cebc057565350af.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/24/bb/a9/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamming it back in, she plucked out the next item, she had to puzzle out what it was.

Davina the Domme, quickly considered, and dismissed the idea of trying it on for size. The thing just seemed to call out to be worn. The picture of herself wearing it, and being mute was too terrifying, it reminded her of his useless legs in the real world, a horrifying vulnerability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe urge to experiment was too strong for her, as she watched the pedestrian walking past the end of her alley blind to her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Blind to the Danger', she muttered to herself in a low voice. Lurking near the corner, she didn't have long to wait. With a swift blow to the back of her neck, Davina dropped the woman, with little more than a dry grunt, as she fell to the ground. A quick look both ways confirmed she was unobserved. Dragging the limp body in the murky alley, she went to work practising on the random woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer unresisting arms were hard to slip into the sleeve, they were too floppy, but with a few tries she found the right technique. Sliding the sleeve up to her shoulders was easier. The straps didn't look strong enough with chrome popper to hold it in place. But she pressed them firmly until they snapped into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c574b0db378d55041b36bc1039caf1b4/tumblr_ptfyp2xmEi1rhktfxo2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/c574b0db378d...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft moan came from the woman. Davina heaved the restrained woman upright. As her eyes started to blink, Davina felt her get steadier on her feet taking more of her own weight until she was simply holding her in place. Her eyes snapped open, but she was still groggy and slow-witted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/12/d5/c8/12d5c8f333aa1123ed5dbd5093adb583.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/12/d5/c8/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took in Davina's full chest before her eyes roamed up to Davina's face. She was becoming aware of her predicament, her arms writhing in the tight binder, with no chance of escape. Her eyes shot even wider as the danger became clear, \"Wait... I'm Simone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavina leered down at her aghast features, \"Hi, Slave Simone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone's chest rose, as she readied her loudest, most desperate scream of her entire life. It was smothered and stifled, as the red ball was jammed between her teeth. One hand held it in place, as the other worked feverishly to tighten it in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were tears and shock in Simone's eyes. Davina wondered if it was pulling painfully at the girls hair. Carefully, she adjusted the straps, and the girl: Simone's hair into two pig tails, to keep it clear of the straps and buckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes silently begged Davina for mercy, as she focused on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/82/66/e8/8266e85cd51990939c5bcabfa00b5454.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/82/66/e8/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, with calm indifference, as only practise could bring she ignored the look, double checking the straps were tight at the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a hand down her defenceless flank, she purred in Simone's ear, \"Good enough to train.\" She shuddered and quaked beneath the caressing touch, her own bound vulnerability intoxicating, new and deeply arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a shift from the bag resting against Davina's leg, and looking down she saw the bag replenish itself. A new armbinder, and gag filling the formerly empty space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your purpose served.\" She smacked Simone's ass with a resounding flat palm, before driving her into the light of the street. With casual indifference, Davina walked away, leaving Simone frozen with fear and uncertainty.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simone had only gone a few paces, her ears itching to hear the sound of her tormentor chasing after her. A few dozen paces from the alley way, she risked a glance over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding to her humiliation, she was walking away from her. Simone felt almost offended that she was trussed up like a Christmas turkey, and wasn't of interest. Unsure why, she stopped, turned and watched until the domme vanished around a corner, not even looking backwards out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms squirmed in their confinement, but the sleeve remained firmly in place. She wasn't sure the tugging was even reaching the popper that held the degrading thing in place. Nostrils flaring, she knew she'd need help to free herself. The ball-gag stopping her breathing properly forced her cheeks to billow then hollow, as is she were constantly giving head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Simone to realise that even in the red-light district she stood out. The armbinder, and gag marking her clearly as prey rather than predator, as slave rather than mistress. Her head flashed about as she looked from one face to another. Some were leering, and looked ready to offer their help... the price far too clear. Simone shuddered. Others couldn't meet her gaze, preferring to pretend she wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was the ones who were leering, and didn't look ready to help that sent shivers down her spine. Faking dignity was hard, but she straightened her back, and walked quickly.... but not running back to the brothel. Chest thrust forward, just from the armbinder, Simone had little other option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting away the tears she was terrified would soon show, Simone worked on her silent glare. Whenever anyone came too close, or paid too much attention, she scowled at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the longest walk of Simon's life, and the most degrading. Bust prominently displayed as if proudly presenting the girls for approval, it bounced and rolled with every step. Eye-catching, a constant reminder of how badly she'd failed so far. Thoughts of winning were being replaced with just wanting the game to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brothel was a blessed relief, once she finally reached it. The steps to the front door, a final obstacle in her heels. Reaching the door, a whimpering mewl dies in her throat, as she looks at the closed door. Unable to ring the bell or even knock on the door. The threat of those burning tears returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with a humiliating pecking motion, she bobs her head. Knock the ball-gag against the glass panel in the door. The looming shape of Alex appears through the frosted glass, distorted but recognisable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door wide, Alex fills the frame. Simone tries to squeeze past him, eager for the privacy. It takes him a moment to recognise Mistress Simone. Recognition dawning, a broad smile appears on his face. A beefy arm grabs Simone's shoulder and effortlessly heaves her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grip is firm, painfully so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon tries to give some commands through the gag. But only gurgling moans get through, and a trickle of saliva spills free, heading for her chin. Surely, it's clear what needs to be done. But Alex doesn't work on the buckles of the gag, or the laces of the sleeve, or even just un-pop the sleeve and free her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorry, and panic spike, as Alex takes her deeper inside. Her racing feet barely keeping up with his heavy-handed control. Passing Goram, you silently beg for him to free you. Indifference is written on his face, as he leads you into the parlour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour humiliation deepens, as the girls take in their mistress, with cruel delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new recruit.\" Suki adds with delight. Her gorgeous full lips purse, as she sizes Simone up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New girls start as the bottom.\" Shawna chimes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawna's hands slipping beneath the binder, tracing their way down Simone's spine. Firmly her fingers slip into Simone's sumptuous butt cleavage. An unexpected strength easing them apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ripe and ready.\" Shawna's judgement making Simone's cheeks burn crimson. That was Simon's judgement too, on first glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress no more.\" Goram growls in a low steady voice. \"Welcome back, Slave Simone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always warned you, your reign would be brief.\" Alex's words waft through your hair, almost sad, but more resigned at her attempts to rule a brothel. \"A woman's place in a brothel isn't at it's head.\"</span></div></div>",

Giving a sigh of relief, it looks to be a traditional murder mystery game, and if you can get away from the players and computer characters, then it should be an easy job to debug and exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Brigadier enjoys the view as you sigh. You mean to give him a polite nod, and just ignore him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbidden the words, \"Oui, monsieur.\" come from your lips, and you bob a curtsey to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh Shit!</i>\" springs to mind. Apparently you have to fulfil your character's duties as well as sort the user's problems. With a wiggle you head off towards the party guests. As you turn you feel the gentle pressure of an old man's hand on your ass as the Brigadier helps you on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the room and take in the view.</span></div></div>",

This body really is designed only for decoration. The other maids, are identical down to the last freckle, and you scowl internally at how much you are on display. The girls lack that vital spark, and you guess that they're only there to supply drinks or satisfy other needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do recognise the scenario. It's a murder-mystery game, set in an old English manor house. It looks like the players are all guests, with the staff just there to complete the scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the lewdness of your outfit, you are fairly sure that the game is being played 'properly'. Although you know of times, when some used the VR world to experience consequence free sex. You feel your bust shift, as you sigh deeply. With a discreet cough, and a firm look of disappointment, one of your sisters nods towards the tray of drinks. You decide to make the best of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to find out more, you tour the room, allowing the guests to take their drinks. You pay a great deal of attention to them as you go, and feel the attention returned. At least, the men are staring quite obviously at your cleavage as you approach, and you ass as you wiggle onwards. You try to quash the wiggle, but your hips refuse to stop, looks like it's part of your character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside the Brigadier, you spot a bespectacled minister. Nervously he polished his glasses as you approached, in a vain attempt not to ogle. The next people to take a drink, were the married couple. A statuesque blonde, and a crimson sheath dress, and a frustrated husband in a dinner suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also an American tourist there, though given the game, he might be a long-lost relative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens, and the butler enters. He takes you in with a contemptuous, dismissive glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir. These people have broken down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Jameson. But please call us Bob and Marge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master shakes their hands, and summons you with a snap of his fingers. You wiggle rapidly over, and give a curtsey to the three of them. Your tits give their own jiggle of a greeting too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou receive a jealous look from Marge, and wonder if Bob has a roaming eye, or just prefers the bustier gals. Her elbow brushes against his side, not so much jabbing him, but a friendly reminder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drinks for our guests. What'll you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't wish to intrude when you're entertaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I insist.

It's a short walk to the main guest room, and you open the door with a theatrical flourish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob's gaze rising from your arse, pausing at your cleavage, before gazing around the sumptuous room. The room is lined with oak panels, a wide stone fireplace warms the room. A large window offers a view of the terrible weather, and out across the gardens, the lawn, and the maze. A large four-poster bed with intricately carved pillars is against the far wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge pushes past her husband, 'accidentally' bashing him with a bag as she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone cold and dismissive, as if you've done something to earn her anger. To attract the attention of her lecherous husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cases thump on the floor, and she starts to unpack, filling the dresser as she goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Bob's words are warmer and more genuine. But you just wish he addressed them to your face, rather than your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you need anything.\" You gesture to the rope bell-pull beside the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I or one of the other girls will attend to your needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis draws an angry snort from Marge.</span></div></div>",

You bend from the waist as you slip your head into the cupboard. The feeling of flashing your panty covered ass to anyone who is passing by. Your slender fingers with their glossy crimson nails dart over the display with smooth speed. You enter the password to identify yourself. It's a standard feature in a murder-mystery game, to reduce cheating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you a floor board creaks, and your fingers slip, activating one of the game mods.

While you appreciate a woman showing off her body, you positively hate when it has to be you to fit in. The tightness of your uniform, the low cut of the neckline, the bobbling dance of your bust... Having a bust... the hem of your skirt, the way it pouffs out. All combine to keep you very aware of your role in this game, (eye-candy), the type of girl who bends from the waist when she picks a fallen spoon from the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've also discovered a host of other factors that annoy you in these games too. Being an identical bimbo, an interchangeable cog in the machine is an extra humiliation. Previously, that was a perk, as a guy a nice piece of ... <i>scenery </i>... to enjoy, but you listen to Marge you want her to be heard, so that you aren't the girl flashing her frilly panties every time a guest <i>accidentally </i>drops something on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave Bob and Marge to unpack, as you head downstairs to the other guests, away from Bob's leering gaze, and Marge's growing jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps you can use your identical nature to hide amongst the herd, rather than be picked upon like prey. It's very hard to tell, but you imagine Bob, Marge and the Brigadier are players, along with the Vicar, and the two other guests. You doubt anyone has signed up to play as servants. Hell, the hope is for you to pass unnoticed, as you fix whatever bug summoned you into the game, and this disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to stomp angrily down the stairs, but you know that only leads to greater humiliation, as your bust will bounce eye-catchingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you take your first step down the stairs, you feel your body ripple and change. An ominous squeak coming from your skirt, and you feel the material brush over your talcum-powdered flesh. Suppressing a grumble, you take a deep breath, and look down at your new outfit. Dreading, Knowing what you're going to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/45/11/80/4511805ed211b5b65b7b17b981a0f3d3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fine satin and silk frillies have been rewritten as clingy Latex. It looks like Marge isn't winning her argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step feels spring loaded, as the latex contains and constrains your sexy body. Grumbling in a low murmuring purr, you finish your descent of the stairs. The sound of the guests seeping through the door. Taking a deep breath, you feel your cleavage rise and fall, as you step into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the three other identical girls. Their expressions blank and unemotional. They're oblivious to the change to their humiliation. You bob a curtsy to the Brigadier when you catch his eye. Though you rather suspect his eye was on your plump, frilly arse as you closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your station at the side of the room. You wobble as you take your station. Damn It! Marge has really lost the argument now.

As each of you has become bustier, blonder, and poutier. The massive heels also increase your feelings of vulnerability. The frilly latex collar joined by latex bracelets, that look strong enough for bondage. For keeping a girl, like you, in her place. You feel the hope that this is a murder-mystery game slipping further away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cross your fingers behind your back, hoping this is just because of Bob and Marge, and not what was planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maids serve the guests with wine and snacks for a few minutes, until they are rejoined by Bob and Marge. The triumph on Bob's face matches the scowl on Marge's. Once everyone is settled around the table, you have to pour them all a glass of wine. As you do Bob's nose is buried in your cleavage, his breath hot against your skin. Even when you move onto the vicar beside him, you feel your panties shift, as his hand brushes, accidentally, against them. The Brigadier's moustache twitches at your simple presence, making you wonder if's he's a woman outside of the game. Margaret Jameson seems to take your appearance as a personal insult. Being snappish and sneering as you fill her glass. Your heels feel loud on the wooden floor, each teetering <i>tik-tak</i> of your feet announcing your movement. Driving your hips and butt into a frenzy to keep you from toppling over. You walk past the empty chair at the opposite end of the table from the Brigadier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe even waits until you reach your station at the sideboard, before raising his glass to toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our Guest of Honour...\" he huffed proudly, before turning to face the closed door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the door, you hear, \"No... <b>No!</b>... Please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shot rings out, unmistakably, the heavy sound of a body slumping against the wall, before sliding relentlessly to the floor. This covers the sound of feet fleeing, as chaos erupts within the room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once you are able to see, you recognize a tall man with an ivory green suit and a purple handkerchief. As you inspect the man by following down his person, something obstructs your view and you immediately know what has happened. You were placed into a female body around 5'4 in a scarlet dress that exposes the thighs due to the length and slits in the sides. This doesn't come to you as a surprise because you have been in female bodies before, but those weren't as overly sexualized as this one, they were mostly androgynous figures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you take in your body and the man, you realize that you are in a cramped closet with this man. You are slightly annoyed with this situation because he's blocking the door and doesn't allow you to get to the admin panel placed in all of the hallways. There seems to be cleaning supplies and a single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling. As you were inspecting the room, the man finally breaks the silence with a voice as deep as Shakespeare play. \"Well? Do you agree to the deal I proposed?\", the man asks this with an impatient attitude. Worrying that you may get into trouble, you ask the man to run the proposition by you again. The man looks annoyed, but he responds. \"You're making me say it again, Selena? I want you to take care of George Roberts and his family tonight! I want them out of the way before he promises everyone their share of the inheritance. I'm only telling you because you're the only person in this entire building that I can trust. Everyone in this \"family\" was just a part of the mafia like us. We're not even related.\" You're taken aback that this is the plot of the murder mystery but you've seen crazier. You look away and stare at the items again, then back to your body. You can see your exposed cleavage rise and fall as you breathe and you know you can't take this man out. It seems like your only choice is to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like the safest way to deal with this is to play the character you are currently inhabiting. You glance back at the man and ask \"What's in it for me?\" The man signs, but he answers once again. \"We've been over this. I'll forgive you for killing my brother, your dead husband. I may even marry you like you asked.\" You think about this and feel like you should get out of the closet before you bring up any sore topics again. \"Alright, I...</span></div></div>",

Once again he had just spent his day working at Imaginetech Industries developmental division where he'd spent at least 10 hours a day 5 days a week for 8 years with almost no time off.  But finally all that time at work, all that time not having any social life to speak of had finally paid off.  He'd been selected to be one of the select few to be selected to join the Imaginationland beta test.  Imaginationland was a brand new form of virtual reality in which a person could actually put themselves into a randomly generated world with whatever theme the user chose.  Unfortunately Nate's neck still hurt from the electronic port that had to be installed into his spine that allowed this to happen, but it was all going to be worth it.  He would have the ultimate escape to go into after work where he could do literally anything.  Nate quickly installed the necessary equipment into his computer and without even reading the instruction, Nate inserted the necessary wiring into his neck, felt a rush of electricity into his body, and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow if he'd read the instructions he would know that there were problems with this beta.  Most notably, not every scenario in the system had been tested and could potentially have unexpected results.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd also, since it was just the beta the user would not have any control over the avatar the chosen scenario would choose for them.  That feature would be added in the future if all went well with the beta.<br>\r\n__________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate had no idea how long he had been out of it, it had felt no longer than the blink of an eye, but he awoke inside a virtual world.  It hadn't been what he'd expected, outside of unending blackness was just a few floating series of menus.  Nate tried to look down but realized that in this opening setting he didn't even have a body or any sort of avatar at all.  After a few seconds (or maybe it was minutes or hours, Nate didn't have any grasp of time in this place) Nate set his focus to the menu's and found that he could scroll through them and search for a setting to insert him in.  Nate searched and searched and found so many amazing and crazy choices.  He felt like reading every one of them from University Life, Jungle, Underwater Experience, Inside a Harem, and it went on and on and on.  Nate even found one that said 'Life of an Imaginetech' developer that he could use in case he wasn't sick and tired enough of his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was overwhelmed, there was just so much he could put himself in!  He was feeling even more stress now than he ever had at work.  \"I just want to relax!  Is that too much to ask!\"  Nate complained allowed, but the Imaginationland menu seemed to be listening to him and presented 5 different choices for optimal relaxing.  \"That's more like it.\"  Nate said as he examined the 5 easy going choices before him.</span></div></div>",

Pretty soon Nate found himself looking down from above at a Kindergarten classroom.

Now go to the time out corner, we'll talk about it after we finish learning out alphabet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate couldn't believe it, this lady was now taking his little hand and was leading him to a stool in the corner so that he could think about what he did.  <i>Man, we sure did a great job with this program, I actually feel really crummy and embarrassed for this.</i>  Nate thought as he sat in the corner occasionally avoiding the eyes of fellow elementery school students when they would look back curiously.  Nate decided to use this time to his advantage and took a look at himself, from what he could obviously tell, he was now a girl in kindergarten.  Not only did the pigtails give it away, but so did the bright yellow shirt with flowers and a pony themed skirt.  It took a few minutes but Nate went from annoyed at being placed in a girl's body to intellectually interested.  <i>This will give me a chance to really test out how real Imaginationland feels even as a completely different age and gender.  Plus it'll be a fun story, the guys at work will get a kick out of this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Miss Moffet finished up teaching the alphabet she let the kids play on their own in the classroom.  She then walked over to Nate and took a knee.  \"Now Natty, do you know why I put you in the corner?  Do you know what you did wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Miss Moffet.  I'm sorry I said a bad word.\"  Nate said politly deciding it best to play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Moffet replied with a nice and comforting hug, \"Good.  I'm very proud of you.  Now I'm not the only one you need to also apologize to Bobby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Miss Moffet.\"  Nate said as he hopped off the stool and walked over to the boy who ratted him out who was playing with some toy soldiers with some other boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, um, Bobby.  I just wanted to say sorry.  Mind if I play with you guys?  I can be the navy guy.\"  Nate said deciding to get into the scenario a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!  I don't want to get cooties!\"  Bobby said, and then out of nowhere he pushed Nate onto his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was really taken aback, not only at how rude the boy was, but how helpless he was to stop him from pushing him to the ground.  Miss Moffet apparently saw the whole thing and rushed over, \"Bobby!  You do not push anyone, especially a girl.  Go to the timeout corner right this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate decided that enough was enough, \"No Miss Moffet, I appreciate it but I'll take it from here.  I'm gonna get out of here and delete this punk, or hell maybe I'll turn him into a little girl and see how he likes it.\"  Nate said, \"Computer, I think I'm ready to leave and get back to by body for now.\"  Nate's confidence suddenly disappeared into nothingness as an error message popped up saying...</span></div></div>",

You know you can talk to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  No problems.  Nothing wrong whatsoever.  I just need to go to the bathroom.\"  Nate said and without even waiting permission, Nate darted off to the hallway.  Nate's eyes widened, he'd expected to reemerge in the emptiness of the programing and become disembodied again, but he was still a 6 year old girl named Natty and this was an elementary school hallway.  \"No way.\"  Nate said a little worried as he ran to the exit, he opened the door and once again Nate could only look dumbfounded.  Outside of the school was a neighborhood, and Nate figured that around that neighborhood was a town, and outside of that town was a world.  \"The computer put me into a fully fledged world.\"  Nate said feeling a bit overwhelmed before he composed himself, \"Computer!  Get me out of here now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The user is too young to access the interface.</u>  This message popped up once again.  \"Computer I am a 30 year old man, you interacted with me just minutes ago.  You must recognize that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The User is not Nate Wallace.  The current User is 6 year old Natty Paige.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Nate was getting angry and desperate.  \"Listen, you are still a computer AI, artificial intelligence can not kill human's right?  Well if you leave me here for 12 years like I take it you are suggesting, then my body and therefore I will die.  Put this right.\"  Nate said confidently feeling like this form of logic would work on the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever instantly this message popped up, <u>The User has been in this world for 10 simulated minutes, however in the User's physical world less than a millisecond has passed</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?!\"  Nate said shocked, this was not good.  Nate could be stuck here for at least 12 years perceived by him, growing up as a girl in this world, and his body would only age a few minutes, if that.  \"So I won't die, but I'll probably go insane, fantastic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Nate began to weigh out his options, he could simply wait 12 in simulation years.  He'd grow up, go to school all over again, only this time as a girl.  Hell once he got out he could probably sue his company and write a bestselling novel with his experiences.  But he was still putting his faith in the Imaginationland program that nothing else would go wrong.  Or on the other hand he could try to hack the system from within to try and get out now.  He could end up trapping himself forever or even getting himself deleted, but at least he had a shot of getting out now without the risk of slowly going insane while some simulation tried to teach him the alphabet all over again.</span></div></div>",

He didn't even know why his thoughts went down that path, and he didn't want to find out. All he knew was that he had to figure out a way out of this simulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way he saw it, he had two options. The first was to try the backdoor access to the hard code of the system. He remembered how to access it; a three-word code repeated three times would allow him access to the code that ran this simulation. The thing is, Nate wasn't a coder. He knew a bit of the programming language that ran this sim. Was it enough to age himself to 18? He didn't know, but he could try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other option was to stay young Miss Paige, but to play it as a girl who suddenly knew as much as a 30-year-old adult. By changing the way his character is perceived, maybe he could change his legal status within the simulation. Of course, that was a long shot, but if he stuck with being a 6-year-old, he'd have time to refine it as he went along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate sighed.

But Nate quickly realized to his horror that the AI wasn't building him up to a 22 year old body, it was deconstructing him to the body of a 22 day old baby girl.  \"No!  No!  Cancel!  Undo!\"  Nate shouted out, but all that came out of his toothless mouth was \"Goo goo gah geh guh goo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Unable to comply, please try again.</u>  The menu screen read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GUH GOO! (UNDO!)\" Nate tried to scream out more desperate than ever, but knew the AI couldn't tell what he was saying.  The computer could decipher and translate hundreds of languages, however baby speak was not among them.  After repeatedly trying to get the computer to fix the mistake, Nate realized what a bad spot he was in.  He was a stuck as a baby girl in the middle of a computer simulated world.  He wasn't even able to speak and probably wouldn't be able to for at least a year in what Nate would experience as real time.  On top of that add in the whole helpless baby, possibly without anyone around to help.  Nate figured that there was no way he could die, he thought, but Nate began thinking that might be preferable to just being a helpless baby roaming around an elementary school simulation waiting for his vocal chords to develop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs these thoughts of hopelessness ran through his head, Nate began to cry and cry and cry.  He didn't care, at the moment it was the only way for him to let out some of the steam that had been building up in him.  However he wasn't as alone as he thought.  The AI menu who had been unintentionally ruining his life was still there and was absorbing information about the current scenario and was coming to a conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Logic Error.  This is the elementary school simulation.  The user is not of elementary age.  Must adjust the situation to fit user parameters.</i>  So the AI began to launch a new program.

It is Imaginationland Intelligence duty to protect the user throughout the simulation.  Solution: AI must care for user.</i>  After the millisecond of processing, the menu screen that had been inadvertently ruined Nate's very existence changed itself from the pre programed menu avatar, into a form that comprised of what it deemed to be elements of the pinnacle of motherhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate felt himself being picked up off of the ground and felt a soft cloth wipe the tears from his eyes.  Now able to see clearly Nate was surprised to see that he'd been picked up by a beautiful woman.  Looking at the woman Nate was surprised to see how she looked almost exactly like what a mother would have looked like in a 1950's sitcom where the women dressed well in the most fashionable garb of the times even though they just stayed home and took care of the kids.  The only thing that stood out was the extremely large pair of breasts that seemed to be available for easy access.  <i>What's going on?  Who is this lady?  What's going on?</i>  Nate thought to himself.  As Nate thought this, the AI said aloud in a woman's monotone voice, \"I will care for you as you grow.  This avatar as been designated Mother.  You will call this form that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate felt a small percentile better about his situation, <i>Well, at least I won't be left out on the street until I'm old enough to under this.  That's good I guess.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother's blank stare towards Nate was giving him the creeps, but it seems that Mother was running some sort of scan, \"Baby Natty stomach is empty.  I will assist you in filling it.\"  Nate was confused at the wording, but suddenly realized that he was indeed hungry, and when he realized this he found that his head was being lead down towards what Nate realized was an exposed, milk filled breast.  Nate opened his mouth in shock, but found his mouth applied to the nipple like a suction cup and Nate found his mouth was filling with milk, Nate swallowed and kept drinking and drinking and drinking the milk til he couldn't drink anymore.  \"Baby Natty stomach is at capacity, research indicated a gas release is the next step.\"  So Mother gently put Nate over her shoulder and gently patted Nate's back until he let out a huge (for him) burp.  Nate thought to himself, <i>Wow, that felt really good, and that milk really hit the spot.</i>  As Nate looked into the robotic, yet oddly comforting eyes and thought, <i>Maybe this won't be as nightmarish or hellish as I originally thought.  I can get through this and soon, well not so soon, I'll be able to get out of this.  I've just got to focus on relearning how to speak so I can reprogram the system and hopefully get out of this.</i></span></div></div>",

Even though he knew in his head how the human body was able to move and speak down to the names of the ligaments, he found that the program itself prevented him from doing anything physically that a normal baby could.  As soon as Nate realized this he found himself getting depressed and zoned out of his everyday life as the days just went by.  Every day consisted of being fed, sleeping, and 'mandated recreational activities' which usually entailed the Mother program placing him on the ground amid age appropriate toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was the one time Nate was thankful for his crappy real life.  His many years of corporate boring monotony had trained him well for this.  Being forced to eat mushed peas and roll balls around?  Absolutely heavenly compared to many years of staring at blank computer screens and filling out piles of useless paperwork.  As crummy as the daily life of a baby girl was, Nate found himself breezing through life with practical ease.  That's not to say his daily life didn't have the occasional surprise, a couple of months into baby life just one day out of the blue Nate had the ability to walk, and was able to do so without stumbling at all.  He was able to run around the house Mother had created for them without stumbling once.  A little moment like this felt like a gargantuan victory that motivated Nate to just keep chugging along until he could speak and reprogram.  Little by little Nate found little victories.  A few weeks later he could burp on his own without having to be picked up and patted on the back, a few weeks later he was able to operate his own spoon so he could feed himself when the mushed veggies were put before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough not every advancement was exactly a victory.  Eventually Mother decided Nate was old enough to immerse him in gender roles.  One day Nate woke up and no longer was his room a gender neutral yellow with him wearing onesies, but his room was a bright pink and now Mother was dressing him up in nothing but dresses.  Nate didn't like it, but he knew one day right around the corner he'd be able to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally one day Nate woke up from his usual zone out of his day at lunch when he saw there wasn't a bowl of gunk in front of him for sustenance, but a cupcake with two candles in it.  Mother leaned over and blew out the candles and robotically told Nate, \"Happy Birthday little girl Natty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No longer baby Natty...huh?!\"  Nate was shocked as a cute little girl voice came out of his mouth as opposed to his usual seemingly random noises.  \"Finally!

He felt his head push up against the massive breasts that he had fed on for so long and he was once again surprised at how real it all felt, and at how the gesture felt almost...genuine. Nathan, suddenly caught up in the moment, automatically returned the hug and accidentally smeared the cupcake along the avatar's back.

Even with his intelligence, his tiny body was unable to peel the wrapping paper away, and his virtual caretaker eventually unwrapped the gift itself. As it lowered the package back to to Nathan, he saw that it was a dress up doll that was an almost eerie copy of Mother's figure, though the face was different.

Nate figured he had to be about 4 years old and this must be his first day of school.  The other children in the class then began to load around him.  Nate was at first really excited to see other 'people' who weren't Mother for the first time in years.  But at the same time he was a little scared, after all even though Mother was overbearing and controlled every aspect of his life he knew what to expect from her, this room and these new programs were the unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 20 four to five year old boys and girls loaded into the school room the teacher popped up and began to teach.  It was just basic stuff like the alphabet and numbers with plenty of playtime and naptime in between.  Nate of course knew everything that was being taught but like it was with talking and walking when he was a baby, he just couldn't make himself vocalize this knowledge.  And even though it was just more computer progams, by the end of the day Nate was having a lot of fun with his school 'friends'.  Nate played with building blocks with a couple of the kids and even though everything was really simple it was a lot of fun to Nate who'd been deprived of simple pleasures like this for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the school bell rang and the world became a blur of shapes and colors again.  Moments later Nate was back at home with Mother.  \"I hope that you have enjoyed the start of your education little girl Natty.

I.E. AS A TEACH, SPENDING TIME LEARNING TEACHING SKILLS. IF POINTS ARE NOT EARNED, PLAYER WILL BE RETURNED TO BEGINNING. (To the beginning!?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.)

A series of clicks and whirrs indicated that the insertion was complete, and then he could only hear the classroom buzz of children kicking, muttering and scrawling on their desks with half-chewed pencils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWind blew up Nate's skirt... Skirt? He lowered his hand to check the sensation when he noticed the piece of chalk he was holding. His hand, he saw, was much slimmer than he remembered, with a wooden bracelet around his wrist and lime-green painted nails. His breathing accelerated and with it the rate at which he noticed the width of his enormous bosom, hidden from innocent children's eyes by a professional white blouse tucked into his skirt, belted in such a way that it billowed and obscured his figure. He felt it all, though, including the very frilly, very sensually-cut bra that spoke more of velvet sheets than glue stuffed up six-year olds' noses. Dirty-blonde hair tickled his forehead, cupped his ears and made it impossible to feel air on the back of his neck. Some of it fell on his eyes, so when he turned to face the children he barely made them out through the strands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Z!\" a puny girl with horn-rimmed glasses chirped. \"You didn't say the last letter, Miss Moffett.

How could you be the opposite gender in a computer program and- And feel all that? And, it dawned on him now, how could you be a teacher and not teach a class you had apparently just been teaching!?

This was like the presentation he'd been roped into giving a few weeks ago, except he hadn't even been given lines to forget. He nervously glanced around the room and marvelled at how detailed it all was. Every notice and picture on the wall was unique and believable. On the desk in front of him was a stack of writing exercises, each one exhibiting a different variety of sloppy handwriting. Nate hurriedly searched the desk for some clue as to what he was meant to be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Moffet...?\" one of the kids spoke up, having waited long enough for the teacher to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we do painting now?\" another child said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When's lunch?\" asked a third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate approached panic, seeing he was running out of time to figure this out.

He half expected to open it and step out into a white void or some such incongruous thing, but the outside of the classroom was just as realistic as the inside. So far the simulation had proven indistinguishable from reality, a slightly worrying thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no idea where he was going or why, Nate wandered down the corridor until he came across what seemed to be a back entrance. As he approached it, he turned to look back and saw that none of the children seemed to have followed him... a belief that lived only until a small girl emerged from behind a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Moffet?\" she began, looking strangely at Nate before continuing...</span></div></div>",

It's a beta, you can't expect it to go smoothly. Especially when it's this complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate blinked.

I really, really wanted to know what comes after Y, Miss Moffett.\" He reached out and opened his hand, revealing a few coins in the palm of his hand. \"I've been saving up my dinner money to buy my sister a birthday present, Miss Moffett, but I'll give you it if you come back to the classroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was aghast. \"That is <i>evil</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it?\" the other player whispered with a mixture of pride and disgust. \"I programmed those puppy-dog eyes myself. Emotional manipulation is just the start of it. So... fancy coming back and teaching me my alphabet?\"</span></div></div>",

He looked between the two children who were gawking at him expectantly, one with the most horrible guilt-tripping eyes conceived, and decided that being a kindergarten teacher was not the worst fate possible. Besides, the obligation ended when the school day ended, and then he could figure out how to escape the simulation, or at least transfer his mind into another virtual body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started walking at a clipped pace back down the hallway. \"Fine. I will teach you the last... letter of the alphabet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other player said nothing but merely gave a goofy whoop as she followed. By the time Nate remembered he had never gotten her name, they were already re-entering the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplause and droning yays filled the room when Nate stepped back in. <i>My God. They really want me to feel good about playing this part,</i> Nate thought. He made it to the chalkboard after a minute of children rushing his legs, hugging them and expressing their undying love for Miss Moffett. He convinced them to return to their seats, amazed at how their touch lingered on his fishnets with startling accuracy. Silence fell on the crowd. He saw the player sitting in the second row near the wall, hand cradling her chin as her shoulders lolled, a convincing impression of a bored, giddy kindergartener.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If she can play the part...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate shook away the remnants of his discomfort and, seizing a piece of chalk, wrote on the board \"Z.\" He turned back with what he hoped was a kindly smile. \"The last letter of the alphabet,\" he cooed. \"Repeat after me. Z.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room roared out of sync, \"Z!\" and because it seemed like the right thing to do, Nate went on, \"Let's say the entire alphabet now, very slowly and in order. Everybody follow me: A - B - C...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll anxieties that had been swimming inside his head were momentarily drowned out by the booming of hyper-energetic children with no sense of voice volume. Maybe being a kindergarten teacher really was a vacation, at least compared to his old life outside the program...</span></div></div>",

She held her radiant smile until he had disappeared around the corner and then she shut the door. A sigh escaped her lips without the sweet honey she had affected when addressing her class. Nate emerged from behind his masquerade. \"Thank fucking God-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should watch your language,\" a voice said from somewhere in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate's stomach dropped a few feet. \"What? W-Who's still here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player skipped from behind her seat to Miss Moffett's desk, sashaying in her red-and-black checkered ruffle skirt. \"You should be glad that I'm not part of the simulation, because profanity would cause an almost irrevocable torrent of VR backlash if anybody heard it. A kid especially.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to be left alone...\" Nate groaned. He reached down behind his desk and by luck found Miss Moffett's purse within seconds. Rummaging inside, her car keys, wallet and other essentials came with a little more effort, after sifting through cosmetics, pepper spray, and loose change and credit cards that showed Miss Moffett as at least comfortable in her financial position, if not very lucky indeed given her profession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe insisted: \"Come on! It couldn't have been that bad a first day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. It was fun to keep children from stuffing crayons up their nose while they were trying to draw the alphabet on a piece of colored paper, most of which their drawings don't even show up on, or are unintelligible. Sleeping time would have been nice, but you guys did that already. Reading time too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you have tomorrow to look forward to!\" the player said with a bounce in her step. \"It'll be even better. Tomorrow, we're starting numbers-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look...\" Nate tried to address her while reading Moffett's driver's license. She lived in Apartment 4 on 256 Missouri Road... Mabel Town... \"Don't you have, like, a bus to catch, parents to pick you up?\" He gestured out the window where the yellow busses were staled on the curb, nearly flooding over with the amount of little people crawling inside of them. \"I want to get on with a semblance of my adult, independent life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that will be a little bit difficult.\" She said it with a sing-songy mischievousness. That made Nate look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why is that difficult?\"</span></div></div>",

I hope not,\" Nate grimaced. He finally picked up the purse and hoisted it onto his shoulder. \"What am I supposed to call you, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrissy,\" the player answered. \"I did write it on my paper, you know. Exclamation mark and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... Do I get to know your real name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Chrissy' gave a sly grin. \"Oh, I don't know, I think I like being mysterious. Maybe if you keep doing a good job, I'll tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Nate grumbled as he opened the door. \"How long do we have to keep this up for, anyway?\" he asked, figuring his 'daughter' wasn't about to let him quit when he felt like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least another day or so,\" she replied. \"Preferably more. We're supposed to go through all of the characters' routines.\" She walked out the classroom door and looked around to check there was no-one in the corridor. \"That's a day in simulation time, of course. We haven't actually been hooked up for as long as we've perceived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that,\" Nate growled. Imaginetech's marketers and higher-ups often touted that one could enjoy days of virtual vacationing before there would be any need to return to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not completely clueless?\" Chrissy teased. As they began walking to the buildings front door, she spoke more quietly, \"Now remember, as long as anyone else is around, I'm your five-year-old daughter. Oh, and do try your best to act like a woman. I don't really want to see what we'll be faced with if you're not convincing on that front.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nate exited the building, his virtual breath was taken away by the vivid impression of the outdoor world before him. The sun shone, the birds sang, the wind blew and a thin but endless stream of cars and people flowed through the streets. Chrissy giggled happily at Nate's awestruck expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he'd shook off his amazement, Nate nervously glanced between the three cars in the school's parking lot until he noticed that one had a booster seat in the back. \"I guess this is my car?\" he asked, approaching it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the car key from his purse opened it. After a second's thought, Nate opened the back door as well. He started climbing into the driver's seat when Chrissy's voice interrupted him. \"Help me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate turned back to her, confused. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me up,\" she repeated, standing on tiptoes and gesturing to the booster seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate studied the car's back seats for a second before concluding, \"You could get up there yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I'm not supposed to,\" Chrissy hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, right, yes... dear,\" Nate stammered, noticing a man in a suit passing by. Chrissy smiled as Nate lifted her into the booster seat and fastened her seatbelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the driver's seat, Nate searched for clues as to where he was going, and found a map in the glove compartment. \"Oh, good.\" He placed the map on the dashboard before starting the car and guiding it out of the parking lot. He drove slowly through the unfamiliar streets, frequently referencing the map and wondering if this town was based on a real place, or if the system had somehow made it all up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you think you could hurry up?\" Chrissy said, leaning sideways to see around Nate's seat. \"I don't think struggling to find your own home is expected behaviour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying!\" Nate barked back. \"Here it is, Missouri Road...\" he said, taking a left turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, you don't feel like your driving is any worse than normal, do you?\" Chrissy asked as the car pulled into the conveniently available parking spot in front of the apartment building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you...\" Nate twigged to her meaning halfway through his sentence. \"Shut up,\" he spoke over her giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate got out of the car and opened the back door for Chrissy. He hoped she would at least exit the car by herself, but she just looked at with an expectant smile until he sighed and lifted her out.</span></div></div>",

Nate pulled out his key\u2019s and nervously looked for a clue on it to which room was theirs; right now only one thing was on Nate\u2019s mind though, he was extremely worried he would have some boyfriend or husband waiting behind the door to his apartment he didn\u2019t know how much longer he could keep this charade of being a \u201cfemale kindergarten teacher with a daughter\u201d going on before he slipped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing his key\u2019s back in his purse in frustration at not finding a clue of where they lived Chrissy chimed in with a worried expression on her face and said \u201care you doing O.K. Nate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nate looked down at Chrissy and took in her worried look then nodded and said \u201cyeah, I just don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d Chrissy pointed to a directory on the wall of the apartment building and said \u201cthat should tell us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the directory made Nate chuckle a little. Strolling over to the directory the discovered they lived on the top floor with an irritated gesture he slammed his finger into the directory where his apartment was to emphasis his feeling of disdain to the simulation right now, soon afterwards they continued on their way to the stairs. The long accent to the top was a lot more tiring then Nate would have expected, when they got to the top he was a little winded. Chrissy still had all the energy one would expect from a little girl in kindergarten practically running circles around him. Finally they made it to the door; it seemed very daunting standing in front of it and not knowing what his fate held on the other side. Fumbling with the keys slightly he turned the lock and opened the door to find... nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out an exasperated sigh of relief as he called out \u201chello?\u201d the silence that followed was like music to his ears. A massive smile came across his face at this burden coming off his shoulders. Chrissy smugly as she said \u201cwell mommy, it looks like there is no daddy in the picture\u2026 congratulations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate replied with \u201cyeah I know. I have never been so relieved to be single.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally getting the chance to take in the apartment he noted it was a little on the small side but decorated in a way some would considered \u201cquaint\u201d with some nice family pictures of Nate and Chrissy in different places. At the far end was a small kitchenette with a bar style counter and two comfy looking bar stools with small backs. On the opposite side of the room from the kitchenette was what had to pass for their living room with a small T.V. with some little girls toy\u2019s scattered in-front of it and a used and abused sofa a little bit back from the T.V. . Still it looked comfy. Then finally there was a small hallway with two rooms on either side of each other and a bathroom in the middle at the end of the hall.  <br>\r\nAs Nate shut the door behind them he asked \u201cso how do we log out now that the simulation is over?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrissy stopped dead in her tracks and said \u201cyou really didn\u2019t read any of the information on this beta test did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously Nate looked to the ground and said \u201cwell no, not really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight tinge of frustration with him Chrissy replied with \u201cWhatever, we can\u2019t leave until the simulation session is over. In the real world that is 3 hours; to us that is\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was instantly reminded of her situation by her dirty blonde hair that fell to her shoulders. The lights flicked on. There stood Chrissy in the doorway still in her pajamas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dYou start off with a shower, then get dressed. Your outfit will be a black pencil skirt, white blouse, stockings, and any pair of black heels will do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chrissy instructed her \u00e2\u0080\u009cmother\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to go get ready.

Nothing suspicious there yet. Nate knew girls had to apply conditioner to their hair as well as shampoo, so she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel completely lost there either. What was alien to her was the feeling of scrubbing her body with the soap, running her hands along her smooth skin and her flat waist. Of course, the AI just chalked this up to Nate thoroughly washing her body and not sensually feeling herself up. That certainly wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be appropriate behavior for a young woman entrusted with molding young minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nate wrapped her hair up in a sloppy fashion with a towel and wore another pink tower like a dress like she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d seen girls do on the TV and in movies. Chrissy was waiting for her on the bed with her backpack on ready to go already. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGeez, took your time in there, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dShut up...\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nate said passively. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better not talk to me like that in front of the NPCs or other players.

She struggled with the lacy black undergarments but eventually fastened the bra and the panties were easy enough. The stockings gave her a little bit of trouble, but the rest was fairly simply. She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even want to bother with the heels just yet, so she went over to have a seat at the vanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the first thing about styling her hair, but she figured the first thing to do was brush it.

The computer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just assume that based on that alone that must have meant Nate was actually a man. Instead, it presumed that Nate was probably a young woman that simply hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had the life experience yet. So, the game concluded that it was running on a tight schedule. The school wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s session for the day until all players were present and accounted for. Which meant the beta would last even longer, with time being frozen. Of course, the developers didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want that to become a glaring issue so they created a few subroutines to better assist players that were trying to adjust to bodies or lifestyles different than their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The first subroutine became very apparent as Nate saw her hands take control of themselves as if they had minds of their own and started applying the makeup. A tube of cherry red lipstick ran across her lips. She even felt herself fold them a few times to spread it around and even it out. Next, she applied eyeshadow and mascara with foundation and blush. The second subroutine taught her body her to style her hair like muscle memory, which made her blowdry her hair, brush,  and curl it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The third subroutine made her subconsciously close her legs, activating a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeminine mannerisms\u00e2\u0080\u009d protocol. She even crossed them, placing one over the other. Within the next ten minutes, she was ready with her heels on. She walked around the room and paced back and forth, finding the third subroutine also assisted with her movement. Her hips swayed and she moved with grace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dSo you can walk the walk\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chrissy chimed in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fool any NPC, hey even if you told an NPC that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really a man they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably laugh and think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a joke. But the female players, the real life women are going to be able to tell if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t learn how to act the part.\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chrissy checked her Hello Kitty watch, seeing that...</span></div></div>",

Nate smiled in anticipation as he looked at all the young faces having their fun knowing soon that he would be having fun among them.  There were little kids building sandcastles, people getting themselves a tan, and even a group of hot college aged girls playing volleyball.  If Nate had a body at the moment he would be shaking with excitement.  \"Alright computer I'm ready to join, now how do I build myself a body?\"  Nate questioned the computer program, but sadly Nate did not know that there was no such an option for the beta of Imaginationland.

Only after you speak you notice your voice had sounded higher than normal. And...<i> 'Did she call me 'Cassy'?'</i> you think. Quickly glancing around, you find yourself standing among the volleyball-playing college girls. Three girls standing near you and four opposite. You don't have time to think or examine further before the ball falls towards you, and instinctively you quickly hit it back.

You look down at yourself again, and again see the body of the same slim girl in the same blue one-piece bathing suit. Your breasts look to be a C-cup, while examining your hips and butt seems like those are about average or slightly slimmer. Feeling your head, you determine your hair is in a ponytail. You pull it forward to look at it, and see that your hair is a light brown and long enough that the ponytail almost reaches your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, change my avatar,\" You say, but an error message appears: <u>Avatar cannot be changed during a session.</u> \"Well then, end session,\" you try, but another error message pops up:</span></div></div>",

Flicking the air in front of him/her to try and bring up a menu only resulted in more than a few odd glances from the virtual people nearby. Eventually, Nate resorted to trying mental commands, but that did no good either. Next came the verbal commands, first softly whispered and steadily rising, till more than a few people were staring at the busty and seemingly crazy woman talking at nothing. Finally successful, a semi-transparent panel appeared in mid-air, which appeared to only be visible to Nate. Trying to touch one of the options, the slender female hand passed straight through with no resistance and no effect. Grumbling slightly, Nate realized that he would have to speak these commands as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExit program,\u201d was the first he tried\u2014more than a little weirded out by the feminine voice, but all that happened was that he heard an error tone. Trying again resulted in the same tone, and the same for a third try. An icy chill settled in Nate\u2019s gut before he tried to assure himself that it was just a temporary error. Steadying his breathing, he next tried another command, speaking \u201cChange avatar\u201d and this seemed to work, somewhat. Rather than the same error tone, that option lit up on the floating menu. Nothing else happened though, so Nate said it again, and again, and suddenly Nate felt a horrible lurch as he shot up out of the woman\u2019s body and towards the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could get used to shooting through the air, his perception was turned back towards the ground. He seemed to be heading for a beachside bungalow further along the beach. On the porch, Nate was able to see two women: one was a chubby Asian woman reclining on a lounge chair <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fetis.kir.jp/ero2/imgf/0036-Busty_Asian_8.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fetis.kir.jp/ero2/imgf/0036-Busty...</a> , while the other was more slender and leaning against a railing <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://20.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kuhqbnYyui1qa272qo1_500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://20.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kuhqbn...</a> .

Her breathing took a bit more effort, largely in part to the very large fleshy breasts that rested atop her chest; the body seemed to be mostly used to it as it should have been, but it still felt a bit odd to Nate\u2019s mind in any case. This woman\u2019s body was entirely softened by a layer of pudge, but wasn\u2019t nearly as large as some of the people Nate had seen both in real life and within the virtual realms. Soon his gaze settled on the woman across from her, the woman in the polka dot bikini seen on the way in. She was yawning now and looking out at the beach beyond, a look on her face that seemed to suggest she would rather be out there, rather than here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering his mouth, Nate tried asking the computer to switch avatars again, but this time there was only the error tone from before. The same icy dread gripped his stomach as multiple tries resulted in the same tone. Asking the computer for explanation brought up a message box with text stating \u201cUser command system temporarily disabled, please try again later.\u201d With that, the box vanished; leaving Nate staring slack jawed at the air where the box was just moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d came a feminine voice, jarring Nate out of her shock. Looking up, the other woman was staring at him, with a puzzled look on her face. \u201cYou were saying something under your hand, and now you look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Nate scrambled to say something considering that he was apparently stuck as this she for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, my mind was somewhere else,\u201d was the best response she could come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe busty woman didn\u2019t look too convinced, but still shrugged her shoulders and resumed looking out at the sand and waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, she spoke up again, \u201cYou know Kimiko, when you said \u2018Hey, Isabella, let\u2019s head out to the beach, we can have some fun there.\u2019 I kind of thought we would actually being spending some time on the beach, not just hanging out on the front porch of our bungalow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella \u2013 apparently \u2013 looked over at Nate \u2013 who seemed to be in Kimiko\u2019s body \u2013 waiting for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was still trying to get used to all of this, so he came up with a half-truth, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not quite used to\u2026this,\u201d motioning towards her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella tsked before saying, \u201cOh come on, you look fine,\u201d and walking over to Kimiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at Isabella, Nate got quite an appreciation for how big the other woman\u2019s breasts were, especially when viewed from beneath. Isabella reached down, and Nate wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect.</span></div></div>",

And besides, how angry can he be when the simulation feels this <i>good</i>? The hot, golden sunlight carresses every inch of his skin, which feels soft and sensual, responding to every movement and touch with a buzz of pleasure. He balls his toes and stretches out his leg, enjoying the simulated sensation of the sand as it flows over his foot.

He repeats Imagetech's unofficial slogan. \"What happens in virtual reality, stays in virtual reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lies back, letting the sun slowly bronze him, he puts together a list of the things he's always wanted to try but been too afraid or unable to do.

Not because he had a desire to be a hot woman or anything like that, but he was so envious of the idea of getting money, drinks, and attention just thrown at you just for how you looked.  Nate had always been the perfect picture of blandness so he'd never gotten any perks for well...anything.  But as Nate looked down at his digital ample bosom he knew that today was anything but the normal and bland day for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate looked around and saw a bar area of the beach with a dance floor and everything, \"I think it's time to enjoy the perks that can come with this body.\"  Nate laughed to himself, \"Time to skank it up.\"  Nate stood up off his beach towel and headed to the bar area with an extra bounce in his step (in more ways than one).  Nate knew he wanted to attempt to get free stuff like he's seen happen in bars all his adult life, but when he got their he realized he didn't really know how to do it.  He suddenly found himself nervous seeing that he was surrounded by beautiful people, even though he was now a smoking hot and stacked woman, he still felt like a nerdy guy he really was on the inside.  Nate knew he still wanted to go through with the plan, after all it's still a unique experience he can't turn down.  So he decided to temper back the diving in head first plan and chose to go to an empty bar-stool and try to formulate a plan, but the second he sat down it seemed the computer was giving him an assist as the hot bartender in a bikini that almost rivaled his own as far as skin showing, placed a shot of tequila before Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's on the house to start you off.\"  The bartender said with a wink.  Nate looked a bit dumbfounded at the free drink but then felt a rush of energy.  <i>Wow, it's already starting and I didn't even have to try!</i>  Nate downed the shot and said to the partying bar crowd, \"Let's get this party started!\"  The crowd reacted with a collection of positive hoots and hollers.  For the rest of the simulated day Nate continued to drink and party with all of his new friends.  If his mind wasn't clouded with booze Nate would admire how every single AI character at the party each acted in their own individual way seemingly making completely independent actions.  But Nate was drunk so he just enjoyed the feeling of all the eyes at the party on him, watching him drink and dance.  And with each drink and with each dance Nate felt like he was having a more and more amazing time.  He loved how all the guys were practically pouring shots down his throat.  He even was so bold as to do some shots out of some nameless guy's belly buttons.  After a while and some more drinks and some more prodding the party goers convinced Nate to make out with people, starting with the bartender chick and eventually moving onto whoever wanted a to next.  Nate even found that his bikini bottom was being stuffed with money, and deciding that he didn't want to disappoint his new anonymous best friends Nate gave the crowd what they wanted and took his bikini top of and tossed it into the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nate took in the cheers and admiration from everyone around him Nate shouted out to the heavens drunkenly, \"This is the life!  I don't want this to end!\"  And Nate passed out on the beach.</span></div></div>",

Initially just a wire-frame outline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a different body.\" you holler into the half-formed darkness. The idea of spending your time in some horrendous gingham dress, stuck in the kitchen of some farmhouse in the middle of Butt-hole, Texas, doesn't sound much fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut life as a cowboy, as a gunfighter, even if it's brief, at least it'll be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newly forming world, judders, but continues forming the same pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to pick out a few sounds in the background. As textures and colours start to fill in between the lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounds like a piano, unfortunately a piano in need of tuning. You try to locate where it's coming from, it sounds like it's from beneath you. Downstairs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a new sound, and start to wish the piano player were louder as well as better. It sounds like next door two people are fucking. The groans, moans, shrieks, warbles and general noise suggest that she's really enjoying herself. You smile to yourself, or would if you had your body yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world is fairly well formed now. You can see the simple wooden walls, a rather scruffy looking double bed with a brass frame. Against one wall, there's a dresser with a mirror. The world takes another step towards reality, as you can now start to smell various aromas. Coming in through the window, the scent of horse shit, teases your unformed nostrils. There's a more powerful aroma, and it's nearer too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk, you realise you're inside a brothel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head over to the mirror, weirdly floating rather than walking. It merely reflects an empty room, your own body being the last thing to be created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a clue, your body suddenly appears in a brief white flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Oh fuck, you're in a brothel... and you're a whore!\"</b><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/bb/d0/bf/bbd0bf66ba34f1726bda31814c23fd1d.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A rough looking cowboy stares back out the mirror at you.</b><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/77/65/01/77650128d586118880a97552ad0abb37.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>You gasp in surprise at the face there.</b></span></div></div>",

Perhaps a product of being in a dry desert environment or maybe you were now a smoker.  You look down over your bosom and see that your foot had rubbed against a spur that was on a small pair of cowboy boots.  And along side the boots were a shirt and a skirt.  You were actually kind of pleased to see the skirt, \"At least I won't have to be seen looking like this,\" you said looking down at your wet dream of a body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you said this thought you hear a commotion from outside of the room, it sounded like someone was sprinting and all of the sudden the door slams open.  A young man, at most 16 ran into the room breathing deeply.  \"Mam, mam I'm sposed to be tellin' you...uh.\"  He stopped talking as soon as he looked up and saw that the woman he was talking to was not dressed and he didn't seem to be expecting that.  And you didn't expect any unexpected visitors.  Feeling a harsh violation of privacy you take one of your six-shooter and point it at the boy practically shrieking, \"OUT!\"  The sight of the gun seemed to unfreeze the boy as he fell over backwards and crawled on all fours out of the room.  You slammed the door behind him making sure you gave him a good kick in the ass on the way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling a bit you quickly picked up the skirt and started putting it on wanting to minimize the number of people who would be seeing you in women's undergarments.  You could still literally hear the boy shaking in his spured boots and call out, \"Well what is it boy, you came barging in here for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mam, Miss Sheriff mam, I came to tell you something mighty important that needs your attention.\"  Shieff eh?  Sure enough you picked up the shirt and there was a tarnished silver star on the chest.  You quickly button it up as much as you could, but sadly for you and a boon to all men around you the shirt was small for you and only buttoned at the bottom barely leaving your impressive bosom on display.  You slip on the boots and open the door, the boy turns as soon as you opened and kept his eyes on your chest.  You gave a quick fake cough and flashed the gun in it's holster.  The boy quickly started looking you in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Sheriff, there's some important business downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you the first time, what is it?\"</span></div></div>",

Nate started trying to think of a quick way out of it, but despite the Body Change command, he still had his hangover headache and couldn't think clearly.  So to get his mind off his headache and onto his problems at hand he began to pace and mutter aloud to help with his thought process as the computer listened on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So for now I'm unable to exit the simulation program as a whole or even change my body out of this female form.  But I can get out of this scenario and into another.  As nice as it is here, and as much as I love the free drinks from the guys, it's not the best place to be finding backdoor channels into the computer programing so I can fix it from inside.

A new scenario such as the one he found himself in usually had a few minutes of cinematic scripted action at the beginning before the VR players regained volition and could engage in the computer-generated world around them, to give them a chance to get up to speed with how the VR world worked and their place in it. His heart sank as he realised this scene would run on rails and its probable end point, given the VR world he was in. Wilderness, check. Big-titted girls, check. Barbarians flying giant birds, check. Shit, he had said it himself before the transition, <i>Challenges of Gor</i> and here he was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough the next few minutes were predictable, if you happened to be a big-titted girl in a VR sim of an alien sword-and-sorcery world where men were men and women were property to be captured and enslaved. A chiming sound in his head indicated the cut scene was at an end and he was now free to do as he pleased in the sim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree, well, his hands were tied firmly behind his back and to his cross-tied ankles, securing him on his knees on the scratchy grass, his shoulders pulled back and his assets well-displayed. A saliva-soaked leather wad was held in his mouth by a strap buckled behind his neck. His captor, a scar-faced brute who had chased him down easily as the scripted action of the cut scene caused Nate to run fruitlessly around the clearing squealing in feminine panic was tending to his flying creature, rummaging in one of the large bags behind the elaborate saddle on its back. Nate's place in this world was pre-ordained. He wondered why anyone would want to be a big-titted female in such a scenario as he wriggled fruitlessly to get loose -- after all the VR system had a cut scene ready for such an entrant so it was expected some female players might want this sort of experience. Hell, maybe even some guys... <i>Takes all kinds</i>, he surmised but he wasn't that kind himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a game though and he was a player, not a part of the scenery so he'd be able to do something, escape somehow. There would be an opening, probably quite soon. The usual scenario would be for him to overpower his captor and equip himself with the guy's gear. He would be a scenario actor, a non-player character of some kind, present in the game to act as a foil to the real people like Nate playing the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scar-faced man spoke in a gravelly voice as he continued to dig around in the large saddle bag. \"You know, this is a great respawn point, I've captured at least six girls here over the past couple of weeks game-time.\" Nate's eyes opened wide. That didn't sound like an NPC, it sounded like a player talking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've made some serious coin in the slave markets thanks to finding this RP.\" he said as he came back to where Nate was secured carrying a canvas sack in one hand. \"Yeah, yeah I know you can't understand what I'm saying, you're just an NPC but I miss talking to someone while I'm out hunting so it's either you or the boid and frankly, you're a lot easier on the eyes than Foghorn Leghorn over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached down and massaged Nate's left breast, his thick fingers digging into the soft flesh. Nate could feel it, the VR sensory suite was damn good but it was a sensation he'd rather be on the other side of if he had the choice. \"Bigger than mine, you're a real titty-monster and not implants either. I LOVE this world!\" Nate's eyes widened further. His captor was a woman in RL? He grunted at the player, trying to tell them he was a player too but nothing comprehensible came out from behind the gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna get it on, sweetcheeks?\" She give his breast a last squeeze then tapped his forehead lightly. \"Later, later. I know you're programmed to want to please me the best way.\" She put her head to one side. \"I sorta hope you're one of the man-haters that are supposed to turn up sometime at these respawn points, all the others were kinda vanilla in the sack if you know what I mean. A fighter, a biter, someone I can slap around the way my so-called boyfriend likes to slap me around sometimes...\" she shrugged, \"...bastard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, let's get to work.\" She said, tipping the sack open.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll just walk away nice and slow.\"  You said backing off keeping one arm in the air and the other on his giant breasts.  You knew the last thing you wanted to do in a situation like this in Los Santos is get on anyone's bad side, AI will start shooting each other if they bump into each other, let alone if they think another character is giving them sass  You had felt as though you'd successfully backed out of the situation when the man took a glance at his cell phone and said, \"Wait a minute miss.  My employer would like a word with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a dime you quickly reversed directions and began following the man.  You glanced around looking for any possible escapes but the beach was too open and his stacked chest would make him very very easy to pick out in a crowd.  The man led you to another man.  Even though you were out by a beach, this man was sitting on the back porch of a beach house in a full on fancy Italian suit.  He sat there with a drink in one hand, and with the other he was motioning you to sit.  It took a beat but you recognized this character as a member of one of the mobs who were prolific in the city.  Gulping you took a seat as in a panic you thought to yourself, <i>You can do this Nate.  Just don't say anything stupid and you might get out of this alive.  And if you live long enough you'll figure out how to get out of here and destroy your computer circuit by circuit.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day young miss.  My name is Tony Marconi of the Marconi family.  When I saw you I thought there was something special about you.  And not just your bouncing beauties.\"  Tony said looking unapologetically at your boobs.  You sat awkwardly in silence until the guy who brought you said, \"Mr. Marconi paid you a compliment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to get on Tony's bad side you quickly say.  \"Oh yes.  Thank you very much Mr. Marconi.  They are...big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving his compliment acknowledged, Tony nodded and continued, \"When I looked at you I saw something special, you've got moxi to just pop up hear on my private beach without and invite.  And you ain't just prancin' around like the other bimbo's looking to party, or looking for favors.  No, you look like you think you belong here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mr. Marconi sir.\"  You say quickly.  You certainly didn't feel like you belonged but you didn't want to disagree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if a beautiful woman thinks she belongs here, who am I to argue.  But first you've got to prove yourself.  Now, on the other side of the beach is a stash of imported cigars the cops so rudely took from me.  Go get them back and you just might prove you belong not only on this beach, but in my organization.  Now get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great.</i>  You thought sarcastically, <i>I've been drafted into the mob.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went off in the direction Tony pointed you in and quickly find the cigars.  You were a little afraid of being caught by the cops, but luckily thanks to a bunch of conveniently placed chest high walls you managed to get the cigars quite easily without being noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go Mr. Marconi sir,\"  You say as you present the cigars.  Tony sniffs a cigar and smiles, \"You did good doll.  And you can call me Tony.\"  Tony grabbed a stack of cash and handed it to you.  \"Buy yourself something nice.  I can count on you.  I'll call you up when I need help with something.  Here's a special phone I got especially for you.  Bosco!\"  Tony snaps and the guard Bosco came over to you with a pink phone with a wallpaper of Tony's face on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally leave the beach and for what felt like the first time since you got to Los Santos via a stupid computer program you breathed.  You tried to call for the Menu again but don't any response.  You figure you can't do anything about it now, you've got to focus on surviving.  And to do so you're going to need powerful friends like Tony Marconi to do that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later you walk out of a thrift shop where you had spent nearly all of your hard earned money on a way too expensive bra and shirt that barely covered your massive breasts when you heard your phone ring.  You answer it and it's Tony who informs you of your next job.</span></div></div>",

We aint having none of that.  So we're going to...insensitivity him to stay a good boy.  We're going to take pictures of him in a compromising position with your help.  Head to the Los Santos Eclipse Towers Apartments.  I got you a room there and I'll have my boys across the street with the camera.  You do that rest doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Tony gave his mission prep monologue, he hung up before you could ask any follow ups, like where were the apartments and how was he going to get there.  You smack yourself when you realize the easy answer to the last part.  The game was named grand theft auto for a reason.  So when you were sure nobody was looking, you smashed the front window of car, and even though you'd never hotwired a car in your life, in 3 seconds you'd managed to start the car and were on the road.  And conveniently enough the car had a GPS that happened to be programed with the Apartments you were supposed to go to.  So driving much faster and recklessly than you ever would in real life you made it to the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked up the the apartment and before you knew it you were inside a very nice room with a great view.  But you couldn't enjoy it for long, because there was a knock on the door.  Nervously you open the door to find what must have been the police chief Tony told you about.  He was about 40 and obviously dyed his hair black to hide some grey.  It might work if his hair wasn't about 10 shades darker than his handlebar mustache that looked like it came from the 1920's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Police.  I'm Los Santos Police Chief Conrad Wallace and I was told there was an emergency but wasn't given the details.\"  The officer seemed ready for action, but when the door was answered by the beautiful and top heavy Nate aka you, he holstered his gun and walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, there was an emergency...\"  You say trying to think on your pretty little toes, \"There was a...rat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConrad's face seemed a bit dumbfounded at this, \"A rat.  Just a rat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well rat's are dangerous, they could have viruses and stuff.\"  You try to keep the distraction going, when you remember what your mission was supposed to be.  <i>Her goes nothing.</i>  You think as you shout out the loudest and mostly piecing scream you could muster, \"I think it's in my shirt!\"  And you quickly rip off your shirt and inadvertently your bra in the process revealing to the officer your massive chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed a bit but remained fairly calm, \"Please calm down miss.\"  This wasn't enough, you'd have to go further.  You scream again and point down on the ground at nothing, \"There is was!  It walked over my feet!\"  And making sure you got in a good position by the window, you jumped into Conrad's arms and tried to move your face around so it looked like from afar you might be kissing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please calm down and get off of me!\"  Conrad said trying to put you down as gently as he could.  The second he does this the phone rings and you see Tony's face pop up on the screen.  And you weren't the only one who saw this.  \"Wait a second, why are you getting calls from that mobster?  What's going on!?\"  Conrad shouts at you, but you'd already quickly put on your shirt leaving your bra behind and said, \"Sorry, gotta run, I'll call an exterminate later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were afraid that Conrad would follow you and try to question you some more, but the mission seemed to be over and thankfully it didn't seem there would be any immediate consequences for this.  You finally get to answering the phone and Tony starts up, \"Well done Doll, you got the pictures we needed to keep the police chief in check.  Don't worry about them getting out there, chief will do whatever it takes to keep these babies secret.  I'll just keep them at my place for...safe keeping.  As a reward for doing so good I'm gonna let you keep that apartment for yourself.  I'll drop by to visit sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tony hung up you took a moment to think, it doesn't look like the next mission will start til you go back to the apartment.  This gives you your first chance to explore the city and maybe you can find a glitch in the system or something that can help you out of here, but then again straying from the path could put you in a whole lot of danger, for all you know completing the story might be the best way out of this.</span></div></div>",

You take the time to button up the shirt, and slip the tie up around your neck. With your bust, it's not really a disguise, but it helps it feel more normal. You also hope it might guide the computer to recognise you as male, and fix this hodge-podge of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Mmmhh mmm</i>.' he clears his throat, \"This way for guests madame.\" His demeanour entirely different, the cold contempt forgotten. Apparently he's blind to your recent costume changes. Perhaps if you dig deeper, you still have some control even if you can't access the top-level controls of the menu options. Perhaps, the controls are available at a less intuitive, more basic level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leads you towards the sprawling beach-house, and the source of the music.</span></div></div>",

Nate rolled over on the bed and buried his head in the pillow hoping everything would just go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait, pillow.  Bed. Window?  What?</i>  Nate thought to himself as he forced himself to sit up.  He looked down and under the covers and saw that he was not only still the hot bikini wearing sunbather from before, he now didn't even have the skimpy bikini to cover him.  Nate pulled a move he'd seen in movies and wrapped the blankets on the bed around him as he assessed the situation aloud.  \"Okay, I drank a lot at the bar on the beach.  I remember that...but nothing else.  I drank and drank and...I think I threw my top into the ocean.  Very smart move.  But that doesn't explain the lack of bikini bottoms and does not explain why the hell I'm in a house and and...I need to puke.\"  Nate ran into what was thankfully a bathroom and puked.  Nate leaned over the toilet and after a few heaves realized that he hadn't held his long hair back.  \"Oh god that's nasty.\"  Before worrying about the whole not knowing where he was situation Nate decided the puke in the hair had to be the priority and after dropping the bedsheets, started up the shower.  Nate used a series of shampoos and conditioners and after the initial grime was washed off, Nate found himself enjoying caressing his body with soaps and suds.  Nate had no idea a shower could feel this good.  Nate spent minutes letting the water hit him and rubbing the soap all over his body.  Pretty soon it felt like he had hands running across his body.  But eventually Nate noticed that some of the hands that were rubbing him were not his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate heard a voice from behind him say, \"It looked like you could use some help,\"  Nate finally quickly turned around and came face to face with his fellow shower user and probably (Nate deduced) the owner of the bed he had awoken in.</span></div></div>",

Literally a dream coming true, he mused. But how...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprised to see me?\" she began, smiling as she continued to slide her soapy hands up and down your body, which you allowed, both because you're too shocked to tell her to stop and you kind-of want her to continue. \"Well, I never thought I'd swing this way myself. You know, me being with another chick. But...\" she said, gently drawing you towards her, \"There's something...special about you. It's like I can't keep my hands off of you. And last night was wild, thanks for that.\" she said with a wink, which made your expression curl into an incredulous-sorta look. You...really had sex with her, last night? I mean, it's a simulation, anything's possible, but...you weren't entirely sure how that made you felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over her body (which she noticed, and caused her to smile), she was a very good looking woman. If you were a man right now, you'd have a blatant erection, but you're feeling a...unique kind of stimulation that'll take some getting used to. And you'd always found lesbians hot, of course. Most guys do. But you never thought that you'd be the lesbian...I mean, obviously you never thought that, but still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was exciting and arousing, and with the way her hands were sliding up and down your body and stopping in 'specific areas', you could tell she wanted more. You weren't sure if she actually wanted this or if this was the simulation's doing, though. Maybe it was making these good things happen specifically to give you a good time. And that's fine, sure, but it takes away from the authenticity of the experience, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-she's kissing you. On the lips. With tongue, too.

Maybe Nate had just been too distracted with the pleasures of his shower, but he could have sworn this guy wasn't there a minute ago.  Nate was stunned, but after a second Nate got a faint memory of this guy.  In particular his abs, which Nate vividly recalled licking and sipping drinks out of and off of last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis guy obviously took Nate's staring at his abs as an okay and continued to rub and massage Nate's beautiful body all over.  And with the way this guy was making Nate feel he didn't want him to start.  After the initial moment of shock, Nate did something he didn't do very often.  He lived in the moment.  He lived in the moment as this mystery hunk caressed him in the shower.  He lived in the moment as he didn't turn down a kiss from the man.  And he lived in the moment when he let himself be carried back to the bedroom where he lived in the moment between the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter it was all over the man turned to Nate and said, \"I'm Sirus by the way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate while breathing heavily said to himself, \"I'm uh Natalie I guess.  I can't believe I did that.  I've never done anything like it before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned to Nate and said, \"Don't worry about it Nat.  You were a natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate smiled at the compliment.  Being a guy stuck in a cubical most of the time Nate relished whenever he got a compliment.  Even if it was how good a lay he was from some guy.  It was then that Nate remembered about his stupid job and stupid work and stupid life.  Kind of reluctantly Nate stood up and said, \"And I've got to go.  I need to write a report about this and stuff.\"  <i>Although I'll probably leave out all the details,</i>  Nate thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirus grabbed Nate's arm so quickly Nate didn't even see him move.  And with a weird look in his eye he said, \"You know you don't have to go.  You could stay and just live a carefree life for the rest of your days if you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like this guy was speaking to Nate's soul.  \"But I have to go.  I-I have a life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you hate that life.  Just say the magic code words and you can stay here forever.\"  Sirus whispered into Nate's ear.  Nate's mind was suddenly taken over by a cloud of thought about how this was actually feasible.  He could just live out the rest of his days on the beach getting drunk and staying here.  And maybe he'd even swap things up a bit later on if he could figure out how.  All he'd have to do was stay and say the code words just like this guy said.</span></div></div>",

How do I actually get to join in?\"  With that the computer program took his orders and Nate soon felt himself being placed by the computer into the body of one of the bodies involved in this little adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly question was, what body would he be placed in?</span></div></div>",

Just as he was about to enter it, he caught a glimpse of an impossibly proportioned, feminine figure squeezed into a skin-hugging hot-pink leotard, the spandex material of which was wedged so far up her curvaceous backside that there was no way this was a reality following the normal laws of physics. \"Wait! But I asked for a super<i>hero</i> scenario!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later he sank into the back of the superheroine's head and was suddenly in control, hurtling through the air towards the falling woman with what felt like half a wardrobe riding up his arse crack. He collided with her. She wrapped her arms around his neck, still screaming without even a pause for breath. \"Don't worry, I've got you,\" Nate said in his most heroic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got me? Who's got you!\" the woman gasped, wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's actually a very good question,</i> Nate realised. They were still plummeting uncontrollably towards the sidewalk below, the wind roaring past them, the skyscraper windows flashing past at a dizzying rate. It no longer felt like a game, the concrete rushing towards them looked terrifyingly solid. Nate kicked his long, bare legs desperately. \"Fly! C'mon, fly! There must be a flight ability! They wouldn't design a superhero game without it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate's heart was beating like a drum and he would not have been suprised to discover his body had wet itself in the real world.

While holding onto his fellow faller Nate turned around so he would take the brunt of the damage as the two hurtled towards the concrete below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THUD</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concrete cratered beneath his impact, billowing out a cloud of dust. The force of the collision ran through him like but as the shock faded and the dust settled he realised that he was, amazingly, alive and unhurt. The woman cradled in his arms however was a different story. She was bruised and her arm was clearly broken in several places, or else it had about four elbows, but the AI didn't seem at all fazed by it as she climbs off you. \"Thank you, you saved my life!\" she cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of her arm turned Nate's stomach. \"Are you alright? God, I need to work to work on my landings. I'm new to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI damsel merely shrughed. \"I'm fine! Nothing a glass of orange juice can't fix. See you around!\" And she skips away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, so the AI needs work</i>, Nate acknowledged, pulling himself from the superheroine-shaped impression in the ground. <i>But the rest of the simulation feels fantastic. My heart was really going back there. Everything feels so real; the people, the buildings, the ground. Especially the ground.</i> Dusting himself off, his hands discovered the pair of (literally) comical-sized breasts that are the centrepiece of a physique that is so oversexualised as to be anatomically impossible. A tiny cinched waist separated his flared hips and curvy rear from his overdeveloped upper body, all of which was squeezed into an exposing latex leotard consisting of barely enough rubber to construct a condom. A silver lasso hung from a metal belt that sits jauntily around his hips, while a pair of practical, navy blue, knee-high boots adorned his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was only when he caught sight of himself in a shop window that he placed it all together.

The Impenetrable Woman was one of comic books' earliest superheroine and an icon of female empowerment, a curious contradiction considering her blatant male demographic appeal. He struck a heroic pose, savouring the muscular physique that bulged subtly beneath his feminine curves when he flexed and the sense of power that came it.

A warrior princess of the Amazons of Pleasure Island, Diana left her homeland behind to venture into and protect Man's World. Moulded from clay by the god Hephaestus and bestowed with superhuman abilities by the Greek Pantheon, she fights crime with her God-given abilities, her martial prowess, a magical tiara, and her Lasso of Control, an enchanted whip that allows her to control anyone its grip.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Cool.\" Nate ran his fingers along the enchanted whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>An infamous polygamist and fetishist, Bill Moulton conceived the character with considerable reference to the early bondage culture of the 1940s. In her initial outings, Diana would often find herself tied up or restrained, and her Amazonian friends engaged in a large amount of wrestling and bondage play. A frequent victim to her own Lasso, she was on several occasions forced to submit to the wills of her male enemies. During the Golden Age, it was written that the Impenetrable Woman would lose her abilities should she ever be penetrated by a male, an event that occu-</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was unfortunately no longer paying the slightest bit of attention.

Suddenly, a building whizzed next to Nate as he was mere moments away from the ground, the woman in his hands still screaming. \"Better late then never, I guess...\" Nate says as he tries to stretch out his arms to grab onto something. With some level of suprise, his arms do stretch out! And just in time; he suddenly grabbed onto a pole jutting out of the side of the building, and he winced as his whole body seemed to stretch downward, weighed down by the woman. \"Get off, please.\" he says between short gasps, his arm stretching all the way down into a paper thin rope. Carefully, the woman climbs out of Nate's grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Elasti-Girl!\" \"Elasti-Girl...so that's my name.\" muttered Nate to himself. There was a small crowd gathering around, cheering him on for his act of heroism. But presently, he was more worried about getting his arm off the pole. \"Can someone help? My arm's sorta...stuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Nate had un-stuck his arm, and was pleased to be able to feel it again. Out of curiosity and interest, stretched out his limbs a little bit to get used to being stretchy. He found he could stretch out his arms and grab things from far away with ease, and he could stretch out his legs to reach high places (although the men loved the view). \"Being a super-heroine might not be so bad...\"</span></div></div>",

And I guess while I'm here I just have to live like it is real.\"  Nate took off the glasses and put them beside the bed, \"Man I hope Becky gets back soon.\"  Nate said to himself as he shut his eyes and drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, Nate had a strange dream, unusual in its mundanity. He was back in his old body walking through his house from room to room. Every now and then he'd pick up a photograph, or his wallet or some a possession and look at it in wonder, as if seeing it for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the phone rang. It was his boss, demanding to know why he hadn't shown up for work today. Nate listened to the angry tirade for a while, holding the receiver some distance from his ear. Quite calmly, Nate found himself saying, \"I quit,\" and replacing the receiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, in his dream, he wandered through into his study. The VR hardware was there, a tangle of wires centred on his computer, which was lit up and humming away, evidently still running the Imaginationland! simulation. Nate stepped forward, his finger hesitating over the power button that would shut down the computer and end the simulation, and for some reason Nate felt a sudden rush of panic. <i>Don't press it! Please!</i><br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nThe impact of something huge and heavy slamming against the side of the building woke him from his dream. Rolling onto his side, feeling the shift of his heavy breasts within their cotton slip, Nate realised he hadn't woken at all, he was still inside a simulation as false as any dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing hit the building again, jolting him fully awake. He registered the sound of distant screaming and destruction for the first time. He jumped from the bed, pulled on his glasses, and wrenched open the curtains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat looked like a fifty foot tall, coca-cola coloured amoeba with a circular, tooth-lined maw was climbing the exterior of the building, using dozens of sucker-tipped, slimy tentacles to grapple and pull itself up. The police had gathered beneath it, ineffectually firing their guns into its underside. As Nate watched, one of the tentacles lashed out, plucking a kicking and screaming woman from one of the apartments through her window. The appendage constricted. The woman's flesh drained away, pulled into the monster, until only a skeleton remained. It tossed that away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What was that Becca said about protecting her neighbours?</i> Nate fretted. He hoped she wasn't too mad. \"What the hell is that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>That is the Life Leech, one of Nano-Nurse's most resilient foes. It feeds on the life energy of anything it touches and will also sap the powers of any superhero caught in its grasp, making them its own. It seeks out Nano-Nurse for her abundant life energy.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I kill it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>This information is not available at this time.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black tentacle burst through the window, spraying him with glass. He fell back. It slithered towards him with incredibly speed, wrapping around his ankle and dragging him back towards the window. Nate felt an aching exhaustion fill his body. The monster was draining his energy. The appendage wrapped further around his leg, climbing higher, the octopus-like suckers kissing the bare skin of his thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heal my heart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe undergarments shredded to pieces on his body, for a moment leaving him entirely naked. His breasts swelled to a heroic bust size, which were swiftly encapsulated by pink spandex, which appeared out of nowhere on his body, hugging and constricting every inch of him almost as bad as the life-sucking monster. A pair of five inch heels formed on his feet and he kicked out, driving the point of them into the rubbery flesh. The tentacle recoiled in pain and Nate was free.</span></div></div>",

However once the unhealthy cells were consumed, the Life Leech continued to consume until it began to devour humans and their life energy.

Nate thought that he'd have to try doing this in his spare time if he survived this ordeal.  \"Okay, I don't think punching that thing will work, and I have no idea how me regenerating will help anything.  So I guess...I've got to...heal it?\"  Nate said to himself trying to see how that would work.  \"Maybe my healing powers have an opposite effect on whatever that is.\"  Nate said to himself as he tried to come up with a logical reason for what he was about to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here goes nothing.\"  Nate said as he once again powered himself up and made a leap for the creature.  The Life Leech seemed to detect that Nate was coming for it, so it whipped many of it's tentacles in his direction, but with a fist glowing in a powerful light Nate swatted them away and even managed to chop some off as if it were nothing.  Soon Nate hit his target, he was clinging to the side of the Life Leech.  Nate dug his long fingernails and high heels deep into the Life Leech before saying, \"I can't believe I'm doing this,\" and took a deep breath before putting his lips into the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I feel like I'm making out with jello.

But rather than bounce away from Life Leech, the Nano-Nurse boots just sunk into the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  No!  NO!!\"  Nate screamed as he sunk into the Life Leech.  Nate tried with all of his might to try to pull himself out, but the only thing he could grab was the leech itself and it kept forcing Nate further down into it until he was completely submerged in the living goo.  <i>Well that's it, I'm going to die here.  I've never been one to believe in reincarnation, but maybe since I'm in a computer program right now maybe I'll get a new life or something.</i>  Nate thought to himself in a desperate attempt to keep calm.  But that calm didn't last long as Nate began to see his skin dissolve before his eyes.  He didn't know if it was his powers or some sort of enzyme in the creature, but Nate couldn't feel a thing, he could just watch as his body began to dissolve.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then a funny thing happened, the Nano-Nurse powers hadn't been absorbed and Nate's body began to regenerate.  And then it began to dissolve again.  Then regenerate.  Then dissolve.  Then regenerate.  Nate watched this happen over and over again with a mix of fear and intellectual curiosity.  After this had happened many, many times Nate noticed that the Life Leech was shrinking around him.  <i>I think I've got it!  This thing is burning so much energy trying to absorb me that it's starting to shrink down.  Kind of lame way to defeat a villain, but I'll take it.</i>  Nate thought as it eventually got to the point where it had shrunk so much the Leech Life was basically a nasty lair of slimy skin on his body which Nate wiped off easily.  \"Now what do I do with you?\"  Nate asked the small puddle of black goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>In a situation like this, Nano-Nurse can use her Containment Capsule to contain a villain and hand it to the proper authorities.</u>  Menu read as it popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate a small empty pill capsule on his belt and held it up, \"Now how do I fit you in here?\"  And like it was hearing him, the pill shot out a beam of light at the goo and absorbed it into the pill.  \"Neat.\"  Nate said as he put the contained Life Leach on his Nano-Nurse belt.  \"And now that I've saved the world, I'm going to take the rest of the day off.  Good night city.\"  Nate said as he prepared to super jump back into his apartment building.  But he jumped headlong into another Menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Natalia Hart is expected to go to her job at this time.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate groaned as he read the sign, he really wanted to go to bed and end the day after what just happened, but on the other hand he remembered that Natalia worked with her boyfriend and Nano-Nurse's arch enemy so it might be best not to keep a guy like that waiting.</span></div></div>",

Well, you think she was Jack from Sales seems to have been affected differently. Well, mostly the same. Sat in a chair, she looks out the French windows across the pool, to the high compound walls.

But she sits there, calm as she can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/382ad2a9be51cdc9ba6fa867af816c47/tumblr_oq2je23FZW1w2lwkto2_r1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/382ad2a9be51...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe resists the urge, the teasing itch from her chest that demands attention.

It's the suitcase of crumpled male clothes that unsettle her more than anything. Is a strange man about to walk in on her.

His reluctance to visit the brothel shown in his more staid clothes. As the head of finance he was always more focused on the spreadsheet than anything in the real world. He too, like Jack is trying to work out who she is. The plain white shirt, that he'd have worn to work, looks out of place in a brothel.

Or at least that she fits panties now. The top drawer of the whore's bedroom lies half open, and a pair of quite sparkly, and rather revealing cut cleave to Jack's flat crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she doesn't like her conclusions. The stench of sex hangs in the air, and she's a busty woman. There's also the vague, but persistent sense of arousal in the air. Shaking her head, she tries to resist the logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a brothel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's in the brothel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's a <i>whore?</i>..!..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a different bedroom, Robin is fighting the same conclusions. Her whorish body, and the setting, all tell her she's a whore in a brothel. But she shakes her head, resisting it. A vague... distant... perhaps false memory of an office intrudes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrasping that with both hands, Robin decides she must have been a secretary. A sad, half-convinced smile forms on her face, the corner of her mouth quirking upwards in amusement. Probably not hired for her secretarial skills, but she ripped through the drawers until she could assemble something vaguely secretarial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery seam strained as she pulled the top into place. The pencil skirt felt alien and unfamiliar, too. But she dismissed it as part of the amnesia. It was probably she just wore a pant suit to the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she stood admiring her reflection. The women sleeping on the loungers were just a busty as herself. Though she hoped she looked the most professional of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/d59b062c362e91ec4b7853b533ca5fc1/tumblr_p216hcYLAr1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/d59b062c362e...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears of joy run down your face, as the whole board seem to come to the same conclusion one after another.

He was falling, from a very great height.  \"Oh FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!\"  Nate screamed out as he plummeted towards the very real looking street bellow him.  Nate was trying to think about what would happen if he died in this fantasy world and realized in a scary moment that he had no idea.  As Nate fell farther and farther Nate instinctual shouted out, \"HELP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly out of nowhere, a blur came out of nowhere and hit Nate like a train.  Nate closed his eyes as  he thought for a second that he had just died, but when he opened his eyes he saw not his body smashed all over the virtual concrete, but he was practically floating down, and he wasn't alone.  Nate looked up and saw that he was in the arms of a very large and muscular man with an almost cartoonishly chiseled face.  \"Sorry I'm late,\" the handsome flying savior said, \"I had to catch the evil meta humans and lock them up in jail before I could save you.  I hope you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment Nate didn't really care and just said, \"Oh thank you thank you thank you so much!

Kent walked up to Nate and said, \"I saw the whole thing Lucy!  Ultraman came out of nowhere and saved you!  Such good timing.

Nate tried to push him off but Kent was infinity strong and kept the kiss locked in.  <i>I am so turning you into a plant or something when I get out of here.</i>  Nate thought as continued to try and fight off the kiss, but as the kiss continued on Nate began to feel himself getting lost.  <i>What's happening?  I-I can't keep my thoughts together.  I know I'm supposed to do something with a computer.  Do I need to type up a story?  Think Nate think!  Wait, why did I call myself Nate, my name is Lucy Lang.

We've got the show horse competition over the next few days and after you win, which I know you will, we'll find you a proper stud and breed us a championship colt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate suddenly stopped, he did not like what he'd just heard.  <i>Breed with a stud?!  No no no!  Not happening.  No way.  No how.</i>  Nate was getting restless and started to wander and inadvertently buck a bit.  \"Whatchu doin' Polly?  What's gotten into you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nothing's gotten 'into' me and I'm gonna make sure it stays that way!</i>  Nate thought and then screamed out loud in his mind in the hopes the computer would hear and understand him.  <i>GET ME OUT OF HERE NOW AI!  I DIDN'T WANT THIS!</i>  Suddenly Nate felt a painful electric shock rock through his body.  <i>Looks like that did something.</i>  Nate looked down and was freaked out to see that his hooves were going in and out of focus and also seemed to seemingly be skipping frames of movement making him look and feel the very out of whack.  \"What's happening!\"  Nate turned his head and saw the cowgirl was also glitching out, and worse she somehow seemed aware of it.  Before Nate could pander what this meant, he felt another massive electric shock and blackout out for what felt like a split second.  When he came he instantly realized something was even more wrong.</span></div></div>",

Nate wiped his the sweat off of his brow and tried to get it together, but before he could calm down, Nate was suddenly ecstatic.  \"I have arms!  And a voice!  And...\"  Nate felt an unfamiliar weight on his chest and he looked down to a sight he wasn't expecting, \"Breasts.  I have breasts.\"  Nate felt them up and jiggled them around to completely confirm what his eyes were telling him.  As some long hair blew in the wind in front of his face Nate realized that he might not be ogling his own bare breasts with his eyes, but with eyes that belonged to someone else.  \"I must have swapped with the girl or something.  But then where is my old horse body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate turned to look around but almost fell over as his steps didn't feel quite...human.  Nate turned around and his cursed very loudly to the virtual heavens as he saw that instead of legs and a sexy cowgirl ass like any normal sexy cowgirl would have in such a situation, he had the lower body of a horse.  \"I think that must be the horse body I had just before, those glitches somehow much have...combined our digital code or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nate stood their in the plains, he noticed that the sun was going down, and his bare nipples were getting uncomfortably hard as the air chilled.  \"Damn.\"  Nate said as he shivered a bit and put his hands over his nicely sized breasts.  \"Didn't notice how big this girl's boobs were under those layers of cloths...speaking of that, where the hell did the girl's cloths go?\"  Nate gazed around the area and a few feet away he saw the cowgirl's leather vest on the ground.  With his 4 hooves he took a step, but stumbled to the ground.  \"Damn.\" Nate said after eating dirt, but he quickly stumbled up and found himself taking slower steps and adapting fairly quickly.  Nate bent down and picked up the vest to put it on.  It didn't exactly provide any real coverage or warmed, but he decided it was better than wandering the range as a naked centauress.  It wasn't til this thought the he realized just how utterly insane the situation was.  \"As...interesting as this whole thing is, I can't wait for the simulation to just end so I can go back to my boring, yet not completely glitched life.\"   A second later Nate smacked himself on the forehead.  \"Wait a damn second.  I have a voice now, I can just get out here.  Computer!  End the simulation and put me back in my real world body.\"  Nate smiled to himself at how his luck seemed to be turning, one second he's stuck as a horse and doomed to be a show horse who is fated to paired up with some stud horse, and now he was a freaking centauress, but at least he was in charge of his own destiny (or so he thinks).  As soon as he finished his command a big red message popped up before him with a message the made Nate's heart sink.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message said...</span></div></div>",

Worst case scenario I probably sleep in a barn and eat oats.  And hell that might not be so bad, I've always been meaning to go camping someday and live off the land so to speak.  I'll just be doing it in a more...eccentric way than I'd intended.\"  Nate then saw the sun was going down and decided to head off to the farm that he could see about half a mile away.  Nate started to trot over to it, but he felt like he was going at a snails pace and began to pick up his pace to a trot and after a bit of that began to run at a full gallop.  Nate smiled and laughed to himself as he felt the wind run through his significantly longer hair.  It felt very weird, but Nate had to admit running like this felt pretty good.  Nate felt a pinch of disappointment as he finally made it to the farmhouse.  It was a nice two story house with what seemed to be a barn for farm animals attached to the side of it.  Nate pondered running around the house a few times before finguring out his eating and sleeping situation when he suddenly heard a male call out, \"Hey, Polly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised to hear the voice of someone else in this simulation, Nate turned around and saw that the person who called out his simulation name was...</span></div></div>",

Nate still trying to figure out how this world works decided to test the waters a little bit.  \"Okay, but if it's okay with you can I take another lap or two around the house?\"  Nate said.  The rancher shrugged, \"All right just so long as you get into bed before sundown.  I'll get it ready for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was happy that at least it seemed he wasn't going to be talked down to as a centaur, he seemed to be sleeping in the barn so he wasn't exactly a peer, but it could be a lot worse.  Nate ran around the house a full gallop a few times enjoying the wind flowing throw his hair once again, although he didn't like the heavy bounce of his breasts,  \"I really hope I'm aloud to wear a bra in this universe, it'd probably help out...and I can't believe I just said that and meant it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate finally circled back around to the barn and he walked up to the booth where the rancher was waiting and took a look at where he'd be sleeping.  Nate had been expecting an uncomfortable pile of hay but it turns out in this weird universe he'd be sleeping on a mattress with blankets and pillows and all the fixings.  Feeling like he'd hit a small jackpot Nate maneuvered his way under the blankets and the rancher threw some more on top so he was nice and toasty.  Soon enough all of the worries of this crazy situation melted away under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days were interesting, Nate had been woken up each morning for his 'training' by the rancher, however he just left after waking Nate up.  Nate theorized because the cowgirl had been the one training Polly before, he was now his own trainer, so Nate not having any idea how to train, simply had fun running around the ranch.  The first day he'd woken up Nate was exploring his barn area and actually found that the other stalls didn't contain hey and oats and other animals, but normal human stuff.  There was a stocked fridge, a microwave (Nate figured an oven or stove in a wood barn might not be the best idea), a tv, and about 3 stalls filled with cloths.  Nate was a little relieved when he saw this as he put on a bra that he hoped out control the bounce as he ran, and put on a nice t-shirt.  He noticed that the closets had plenty of blouses and centauress adjusted dresses, but he knew that he probably wouldn't touch those if he could avoid it.  Nate was glad for these discoveries, because as oddly freeing as it was to run in the wild practically topless, having cloths on was definitely a more comforting feeling.  And he wasn't do this, he was having nice conversations with the rancher, who Nate learned was called Tex.  He'd just talk with Tex about sports and the gossip going on around town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 5 days of running around and adjusting to his environment Nate saw the Tex had backed up a horse trailer to the barn and called out, \"Time to get in Polly, it's time for the County Fair.  I've already got your stuff packed.\"  Nate obliged and walked into the trailer.  The drive was long and boring, but being driven around while standing was kind of an interesting experience.  They finally got to the fair and Nate was a little surprised that at the tent he was being dropped off at that he wasn't competed with horses, but with other centauresses.  As Nate looked at the ceroundings Nate also realized what kind of contest he'd have to win in order to get his body back.</span></div></div>",

He'd been expecting horse stalls, dirt, cows, and all around rodeo feel.  What Nate instead got was a grand stage with professional lighting that looks like it was more for Miss America as opposed to best in show at a county fair.  As Nate stared stunned Nate felt a weight on his back as Tex dropped Nate's bag of stuff for the show on his back, \"You head on to the back and get ready for the first event.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay.  And what event is that again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Polly?  Getting nervous?  You know that you start with the Swimsuit, evening wear, and then...\"  \"Talent show.

Don't be silly, this is the Centauress County fair, not the Human Miss America, no you finish up with the lingerie competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly me.\"  Nate said, as he then made his way to the dressing room, <i>Well, that might actually be a good thing.  I have no idea what I'd sing or how dancing with hooves would work out.  Now all I've got to do is stand there and look pretty, I can surely do thaaa.</i>  Nate's brain suddenly froze as he made his way to the dressing room where there was about 20 of the most drop dead gorgeous (and topless) women he'd ever seen in person.  Sure they all had equine lower halves, but that was practically old hat at this point for Nate.  Nate got a huge grin on his face instinctual at the site of all the large bouncing breasts, but that grin turned into a worried frown.  <i>Oh crap.  The AI told me I have to win this thing to be able to fix this, and I think I can objectively say there are a lot of women here hotter than I am.</i>  Nate tried to think about the situation and if he could do anything to fix it as he made his way to his own stall where opened the bag and for the first time got a look at what he'd be wearing for the contest, a blue bikini top, a red dress, a black top half of a nighty, and a box of makeup and hair product.  All of which Nate didn't really know how to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad, this is bad.  No way I can win this thing.  I'm going to be stuck like this for the rest of my life, there's no way I can win this, I don't suppose I can get a crowbar and go Tanya Harding on every one of these girls.\"  A light went off in Nate's pretty little head, \"I can cheat!  I've still got limited control of the AI!  AI!  I command you to make it so I win this contest.\"</span></div></div>",

And when he opened his eyes he was in for a shock.  In the mirror in front of him was not the cowgirl he'd met and fused with just a few days ago, but the face and body of a supermodel.  A perfectly symmetrical flawless face with long and luscious blonde flowing locks starred back at him, Nate also noticed a significant weight change shift on his chest.  He went from a respectable B cup to at least a sizable set of DD's in a millisecond.  Nate marveled at the breasts and then looked at his face which was so flawless and perfect that it didn't even need makeup applied.  After a few minutes of examining and shock, Nate heard a call for the contestants to line up for the first round.  And with an air of confidence he never thought he'd have for a beauty pageant, Nate put on his evening gown, which now strained against his new fleshy assets, and took to the stage with his fellow contestants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in his 30 years of human life, Nate didn't have a lot of experience at trying to look sexy.  He was just guy who went about his business, occasionally got a girlfriend if he was lucky, but overall his life was plain and boring.  But now on a stage full of beautiful creatures, he could tell that he was the most beautiful and all the eyes were on him.  It was both a terrifying and empowering experience and he absolutely rocked it.  Nate knew that he had to win this thing and it wouldn't happen if he just stood there and looked good, years of watching beautiful women on television taught Nate that the ones who stand out are the ones who 'strut their stuff.'  And strut Nate did, he moved his horse hips and puffed out his chest, he whipped his hair seductively and winked at the crowd.  He had them eating out of the palms of his hands and he knew it.  After the evening gown competition came the lingerie round and Nate did more of the same but in sexy underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he put on his bikini top in the back room Nate was confident that there was no way he could lose, he was by far getting the most love from the judges and crowd.

And most importantly Nate felt free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunantly he didn't quite grasp how free he was, because that free feeling from his chest, the glares from his competition, and the noise from the crowd all could be traced to the bikini top that had popped off of Nate the second he walked out on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took longer than it should have, but Nate did eventually notice his nudity and with a flushed face ran backstage to try and find a spare top, but before he could a rather official looking man said, \"I'm sorry, but you've been disqualified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was in shock, \"No!

Texture came next, then colour, until the void had been replaced with rain-soaked countryside beneath a grey, portentous sky. Noise flooded into the simulation - screams of fury and pain, and the ring of steel - a second before the AI combatants materialised around the horse and its rider. Two armies, thousands strong, clashed in bloody battle before them. A wall of men in mismatched leather armour broke and ran as a group of knights in plate armour fought their way inside their ranks, hacking and slashing through them with abandon. A perfectly rendered streak of pink brain splattered across the grass as one of the knight's swung his mace into a fleeing man's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the Sam Hill... What are these, injuns?\" his rider gasped. Twisting his head, he saw the cowgirl staring around her in wide-eyed confusion. \"Whatever it is I reckin we better be high-tailin' it, Polly.\" Her heels dug into your sides and she pulled hard on his reins, steering him away from the conflict. Nate didn't need to be asked twice inclined to agree with her. His hooves found good purchase in the soft soil as he galloped as far from the battle as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesnn't get far. The pound of a hundred hooves rang in his ears. Suddenly, he's enveloped by cavalry. Stallions! They press in on all sides, their large, muscular bodies digging into his smaller one with the armour that adorns them. They're faster than him and Nate's breath streams through his nose as he charges faster and faster. Pure, animal terror overwhelms him. <i>I can't escape! If I slow down, I'll be pulled under and crushed!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rider leading the charge shouted out, \"The enemy is routed! Their King is exposed! Attaaaack!\" The cowgirl screamed, wrapped her arms around his neck, and buried her face in his mane, as the cavalry changes course, driving straight into the enemy forces. Nate whinnied in dismay as he felt bodies trampled beneath his feet. This was horrible! He was killing people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the cavalry was taking casualties too. One of the horses fell screaming from an arrow in the neck, pulling the rider with the banner under it. Then another. And another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last stallion fell, Nathan found himself alone, surrounded by soldiers, most of them running, some of them closing in with swords drawn. A horse dressed in the enemy colours lay dead on the ground before him. A man in ornate plate armour stood beside it, his visor pulled back, vainly beseaching his fleeing men, \"A horse! A horse! My Kingdom for a horse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his eyes fall on you.</span></div></div>",

Must be a spy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- ah-!\" Suddenly grabbed by the guard he'd turn her around &amp; force her hands against the wall, pressing his body into hers. \"Stop, please..\" He let one hand off &amp; she kept it there, hearing the noise of unbuckling leather. <br>\r\n\"No missy, your all mine..\" <br>\r\nThen a warm, hot &amp; five-inch long dick slipped under her robe &amp; onto her ass, the guard slipping his free hand under her robe &amp; groping one of her large breasts.<br>\r\nMoaning quietly to not attract any attention, the pleasure to Doug felt good, but the scenario made him want to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly thrusted his dick between her cheeks &amp; slipped his hand under her breast, groping it hard. She almost yelped as he then stopped groping her &amp; brought his hand down to her robe, quickly yanking the tie off &amp; going to slip her panties off. <br>\r\n\"No- s-\" <br>\r\nSuddenly being grabbed by the hips &amp; being moved back, he'd use alot of strength to push her to the ground. \"Mmn.\" He hummed while straddling her breast &amp; positioned his dick between them, Doug panicking as he pressed them together &amp; slowly thrust. <br>\r\n\"Ooohh-\" Moaning &amp; squeezing them to his own movements, he'd speed up after a few seconds, Doug now noticing his blade &amp; daggers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a good time to get the jump on him she thinks, his arms focused on her breast &amp; him staring at her devilishly. With her own hands at her sides, there is a good chance to do it stealthily..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Starting off light before he got into the really fucked up shit, maybe bang an entire rainbow of technicolor skinned babes before he tries something else where he can be a bit more forceful. He selects it and leans back ready to be transported to what he thought was going to be some kind of kinky alien getaway. He was surprised to find a sudden pain jabbing his side, and what felt like a cut on his head... Pain?! why was there so much pain at the start of something called Alien Sex Planet. He opens his eyes in the game world. Looking around him he sees a room of twisted metal, there is a fire burning in this high tech cabin, and a door that leads outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets up to stumble over in front of a polished chrome bulkhead where he can see himself clearly in this world. He is stunned at what he sees. His pasty white old flabby body was gone, as to be expected, but he wasn't some powerful young man, he was a woman. She was tall, with dark skin, with a figure he would kill for if it wasn't on him. She had full E cup breasts and wide hips with a soft fatty bubble butt, and a waspish waist. her body was fit enough, thin and athletic, but far from powerful. Her eyes were wide and large, and beneath her relatively small nose she had plump lips, and a soft chin. Her outfit looked like it was some kind of Nylon, with a metallic sheen, purple probably, though hard to tell in the burning ship, consisting of a tube top, a bikini bottom and matching Go-go boots. Her lips and eye shadow matched the purple of her clothing and her head was adorned by a blonde curly fro of all things. Her outfit was tacky, impractical, and just about what he would be wanting to rip off some alien babe. More concerning though is she's injured. her bare midriff has a noticeable wound and there is a gash on her forehead that needs to get treated at some point, but it wasn't as dire. She could probably make it outside, but from what she could tell she crash landed somewhere, and though getting out of the smoke would help her clear her thoughts, who knows what kind of hostile alien world awaited her outside.</span></div></div>",

Even groggy his fantasies still appealed, the widened hips that force a woman to wiggle as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe imagined fucking her, his hands sinking in to the soft abundant flesh of those perfect titties. His conquest moving him towards the completion of the game, getting 100 women pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling at the idea, it came out more as a giggle. Her head pounded even at that noise. Her unresponsive hand slapping her, as she tried to massage her forehead. Lifting it away, she saw another tattoo that chilled her blood. Repeat Offender, was marked on the inside of her other arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two tattoos took only a moment to sink in, Breeder... Repeat Offender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surge in adrenaline washed the drugs from her veins, and in second she was bolt upright in bed. Gazing horrified, hypnotised by her body.

Too clearly he knew how to lose. He collected quite a few women in this game. Having built up a harem to enjoy in other environments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pawed at the window, it faded from sight.

But, the chiming, high voice undermined any hope of being believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected the orderly smirked. \"Nope... you're notes say you're name is Barbi.\" The cruel smile daring her to challenge the orderly's mocking words. Hoping to intimidate the orderly, she hopped off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Doug was used to looming over women, standing 6' 3\" tall, he was taller than most men. However, as Barbi's feet hit the floor, she had to look up to the female orderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe... No, She... She had to adjust, denying her body would only lead to humilation was too clear.

Ready to rage out her frustration on any staff who dared to interrupt, or offer unneeded help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling into the gym parking lot, she felt the wind ease, allowing her mane of hair to settle back. In the glove box, her gym membership card, was there. Her picture just another humiliating reminder of her situation. A face covered, and perfect in make-up, was clearly a woman who wasn't heading to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of those taut and toned bodies was oddly intimidating as she sat in the car. Intriguing too. Gritting her teeth, Barbi knew she had to get through this to earn her fifty points. She'd endure whatever was necessary to beat this damned level and escape this hideously sexy and provocative body. Her mind wandered to the gym bunnies in their leotards, and the studs in their tight shorts, that clung enticingly. A firm movement that hinted at a cock beneath. Their muscular gleaming stomachs making your own flip-flop nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head you try to dismiss the images, to derail that train of thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force your mind to the gym bunnies.

Your fingers quake on the padlock of your locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sign catches your eye as you quickly walk down the hall. You force yourself to keep to a walk, knowing that if you start running, you don't know when, or if you'll be able to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Stepford Gym\" The sign greets you in large pink letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span class=\"chotpink\">For the woman who wants to please her man.<br>\r\nKeep taut!<br>\r\nKeep toned!<br>\r\nKeep your man!</span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a painful reminder of how distorted this reality is... and your current place in it!</span></div></div>",

Feel the heavy sloshing of your own bust. The sports bra doing little to control anything. It simply smooshes your bust against your torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the gym, you spot another lycra clad beauty. Imagining her bending and stretching.

Her gaze dropping to her phone, she nods to herself before imperiously crooking a finger, inviting (rather demanding) you come to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barbi Delacroix.\" she surprises you by knowing your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your husband isn't happy with your body.

Today is another day of sitting around the house while William is away at work. You don't want a job of your own because you're preparing to a full-time mother. Problem is, William seems scared by the prospect of having kids, even though you'll be the one devoting yourself to their care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news is that William has been rocketing up the corporate ladder and bringing in loads of money, so when you do have children, they'll be well provided for. Unless, of course, he continues to blow increasing amounts of cash on things to distract you from needling him about starting a family. His latest and most extravagant such purchase is the virtual reality helmet which is now in your hands and hooked up to your computer via an assortment of wires and little boxes that seems more complicated than it really needs to be. A second helmet lies on the desk, so William can join you when he gets home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a sophisticated (if not sophisticated-<i>looking</i>) piece of work, but apparently the real reason this stuff is so expensive is because if they allowed just anyone to create their own simulation, they'd... use up all their gigabytes or something. You don't really understand technology very well, but you think you can get this thing working. You've started up the program, and now the screen is telling you to put on your \"virtual interface headset\", which you assume means the helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you make yourself comfortable in the chair and carefully place the helmet on your head. Everything goes black for a frightening second, and then your vision is filled by a menu consisting of the options \"Create Simulation\", \"Enter Simulation\" and \"Disengage\". You try to lift your arm, but find that you can't. You can't even feel it, in fact. You would gasp in response to this, but you can't do that either. You frantically wonder how you're supposed to select anything, but then the \"Create Simulation\" option flashes by itself. Apparently the system just <i>knows</i> what you want it to do. You're not sure if that's amazing, or amazingly scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next screen, if you can call it that, doesn't seem to have any actual options on it. It begins with just the words \"Think of something.\" in large letters. Can you really create any virtual world imaginable just by thinking of it? As your mind races with possibilities, lines of text fly in and out of your vision too fast to read. You're apparently supposed to focus on something and read what the computer has to say about it. So what will you think of?</span></div></div>",

Off in the distance, you see a speck come out from behind one of the clouds; at first you think that it\u2019s a bird maybe, but that thought doesn\u2019t last long as it continues to get bigger and bigger finally revealing that it\u2019s a massive dragon as it goes roaring past you.

Your shock is compounded when you realize that you are high up \u2013 <i>very</i> high up \u2013 so high that the ground is just a mosaic of colors laid out beneath you.

Cracking your eyes open reveals that you are now on the ground with nothing the worse for wear despite your apparently meteoric drop to the ground. All around you, you see a bustling marketplace in what appears to be a medieval city, filled with all manner of people: humans, orcs, elves, gnomes, and even a smattering of things you think are called anthros.

Your first thought is an exaggerated hourglass shape, but as you look closer, you see that your belly adds a little extra space to the middle of that hourglass; it\u2019s not fat by any means, just a little extra softness almost entirely hidden in the shadow of your bust above. Tearing your eyes away from your curves, you turn your attention to other portions of your body, like the thick and silky black and white fur that covers your whole body, and the long and whip-like tail that swishes around behind you. On the very tip of your tail is a little tuft of blood red hair/fur that matches the thick waves of hair that spills from your head and down around your shoulders. And thinking of your hair, it hasn\u2019t changed much in the switch, only lengthened slightly and split somewhat around the additions of a pair of horns and longer and floppier ears sprouting from your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to visually explore your body \u2013 and eventually start running your long dexterous fingers around as well \u2013 thinking that you could get used to this body.

To help encourage him to assist you, you thrust your chest out, seeing that is where his eyes are lingering most of the time. You are unused to your new dimensions though, so that small motion gets overblown and ends up with your meaty breasts knocking over a number of things on the top of his stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince and blush as you hear the sounds of things falling into each other; your blush only deepens when you hear and feel the topmost button on your shirt go shooting off somewhere, exposing yet more of the furry canyon between your luscious mounds. Judging from the saucer-like appearance of the shopkeeper\u2019s eyes as well as his slack jaw, he has noticed \u2013 and really how couldn\u2019t he \u2013 and likes what he is seeing. Clearing your throat loudly causes him to regretfully tear his eyes away and look up at your face; he then starts to rattle off a detailed set of directions leading you through the marketplace and to a store where you can get what you want. After telling him thanks, you turn on your heel with a flirty giggle and walk away, making sure to add plenty of extra sway to your hips and derri\u00e8re as a bit of thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly make your way through the milling crowd of the marketplace, helped in no small part by your stature. You only now realize that you stand nearly head if not head and shoulders above everyone else, though there are some people that are as about tall as you and a rare number that look to be even taller. You practically shiver at this though, the prospect that you can literally look down on most other people being particularly thrilling to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the directions laid out by the wolf, you soon find yourself heading out of the main marketplace and into a somewhat less traveled area of the city. There are still plenty of people about, but not the heavy mass from the main square and most of them seem to be more what you consider adventurers would look like. You are still attracting plenty of attention, eyes going wide as they see you come bouncing down the narrow streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose track of your path sometimes, the narrow winding roads making it easy to get lost, but it never takes long before you find your way again. And so it is that before you realize it, you are nearly walking past your destination. The building could do with some sprucing up and definitely needs a new paint job, while the sign above the door is worn and weather beaten, but you can make out the peeling paint that reads \u201cIron Tusk Craftsmen\u201d. The door creaks open at your touch revealing a large room overflowing with stacks upon stacks of what you can only think of as adventuring gear: leather armor on mannequins lean against racks of gleaming swords, while some of the suits of plate armor have wizard staffs shoved into the neck openings, there\u2019s even bows hanging from some of the torches on the walls. As you pick your way through the piles \u2013 only knocking a few things over, and not causing too many domino effects \u2013 you hear more clattering coming from the back of the room, like someone else moving around in this hodgepodge mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the noises as best as you can, you take a looping path that eventually leads you to a counter in the back of the room, similarly covered like the rest of the space. You can almost make out someone bent over behind the counter, bent over and up to his or her waist in a crate digging around and making quite a bit of noise. It takes several increasingly loud times of clearing your throat before they seem to hear you. They bang their head in their haste, and you assume swear in a language you don\u2019t recognize, before turning around to face you rubbing their head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall slender man \u2013 now that you can see him clearly \u2013 is momentarily taken aback at seeing you, but he recovers quickly; \u201cGreetings, my lady, and welcome to the Iron Tusk Craftsmen. How may we assist you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was looking for adventuring gear or something like that,\u201d casting a glance over your shoulder, \u201cAnd it looks like I\u2019ve come to the right place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are correct; we have many pieces of equipment for everyone from beginners through the experts. May I ask if you have a particular preference for a style?\u201d Noting the quizzical expression on your face, he continues, \u201cSuch as heavy platemail with a great sword, or lighter armors with a dagger or bow, that is what I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2026eh\u2026I\u2019m not sure,\u201d you admit, this all seemed much simpler in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t a problem, ma\u2019am\u201d ducking down behind the counter again, \u201cWe have something here for just such a circumstance. Ah, here it is.\u201d Standing up with a large crystal set in a stand, \u201cThis is a little something put together by our own Madame Morrigan; just put your hand against the crystal and it will recommend a style. You can, of course, choose something else either now or later, and even mix and match styles if you so wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, you do as directed, finding the crystal oddly warm beneath your hand. After a moment of nothing happening, you are about to speak up, when the stone starts glowing brightly and projecting a sphere just above it. Within the sphere, you can just make out images flashing through rapidly, though as you watch, the speed slows down so that eventually you are able to make out little pictures of swords, bows, and staves, each with a matching outfit just behind, heavy armor, lighter armor, or a robe respectively. The flipping keeps getting slower and slower, but not quite stopping yet, but you can tell it's getting there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stare down at the little image of a bow with light armor standing behind it, not quite sure how you feel about it. The more you think about it though, the more that seems like a good idea: being able to pick off targets from a distance without having to get your hands dirty, and being able to keep fully mobile without being too weighted down. You look up at the tall man behind the counter and nod, agreeing with the assessment of the odd little crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods in return, but just a slight tilt of the head, \u201cYou will want to see Master Orinan, in that case, just through here please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuffles out from behind the counter, edging past the precarious stacks and leads you through one of the side doors. The room beyond is obviously a workshop, and much more structured than the main showroom, with a great deal more empty floor space, and well organized workbenches. An even taller and more slender man is standing at one of the tables, carefully shaving off hair-thin flakes of wood from an obviously masterly crafted bow. The man from the counter starts to open his mouth, but \u2013 presumably \u2013 Master Orinan holds up a finger without looking back, and the one you were following shuts his mouth so quickly that you can hear his teeth click. The Master continues working with the soft scraping of his tool as the only noise, but you are starting to get a little irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are about to say something yourself, no matter if this \u201cmaster\u201d holds his finger up towards you, he gives one last look down the length of the bow before starting to speak himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Sebastian?\u201d and as he finishes, he turns around and sees you, which seems to answer his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes briefly open wide, before returning to their previous half-lidded state; you wonder if you really look so out of the ordinary that <i>everyone</i> has to be so obviously surprised at seeing you. You can now see that Master Orinan is an elf, the long pointed ears sweeping back into his hair is kind of a giveaway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you wish to take some of my equipment, is that it?\u201d Orinan says, moving closer, almost seeming to float across the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and Sebastian chimes in, \u201cShe used the crystal, Master, and it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets cut off as Orinan holds up his hand in his direction, while continuing to look you over, \u201cThat will be all, Sebastian, you may return to your other duties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way that Orinan is looking you over makes you feel somewhat uncomfortable, there\u2019s an unmistakable aura of haughtiness about him, but there\u2019s also something almost predatory as well, almost as if he is trying to figure out the best spot to grab a hold of you or to sink his teeth. You barely notice that Sebastian bows so low that his face is almost completely hidden as the thick curls of hair cascade forwards, but you do see that when he stands upright again, he brushes his hair back, momentarily revealing somewhat pointed ears, but shorter than those sported by Orinan; <i>another kind of elf maybe, or perhaps a half elf</i> you assume, based on some of the stories you have read. Sebastian then lopes off, leaving you alone under the gaze of the haughty master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re an aspiring fortune-hunter, and came to me after using Morrigan\u2019s crystal?\u201d to which you nod in response. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t know for sure what you want?\u201d he asks and gets a repeated response. \u201cIn that case, may I suggest that unless you have a rather large surplus of funds, that you begin with the basic package; it will grant you a basic suit of armor, a bow and standard quiver of arrows, and a short sword for close in work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grimace, you now realize that you don\u2019t have any funds at all, you were dropped into the world with only the clothes on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly picking up on this, he then says \u201cIf you don\u2019t have any money at all, that won\u2019t be an issue. You can take the equipment and in return do a couple simple jobs for me. It\u2019s not the first time that an adventurer to be has come to our little shop to get started completely penniless, and done quite well for themselves from then on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s certainly different from my normal life, and that\u2019s what I wanted after all</i> you think. You agree to his terms, wondering what kind of \u201cjobs\u201d he\u2019ll send you on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is one other matter, I don\u2019t have any armor already made for one with your\u2026build,\u201d even without looking him in the eye, you can practically feel his gaze tracing along your bust and hips, \u201cbut I have a set close to finish that I should be able to adapt easily enough. In the meantime, why don\u2019t you take the training bow over there and proceed out through there, you can practice with it in the training yard beyond the shop. Do be careful now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to ask if he needs to take your measurements or anything, but realize that if he isn\u2019t already asking for that, he must already have it in hand somehow. Grabbing the indicated bow and a bundle of arrows hanging with them, you head through a rear door and into a fenced in yard behind the shop. A couple of people are practicing with swords in one corner, but you have a long clear shot to an obvious archery target: a straw dummy in the rough shape of a person. You remember a bit of the archery work you did in gym back in school, but even this training bow is quite different than the one you used then. Slinging the quiver on your back, you nock and arrow, sight down the length, and let fly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your first shot is terrible, you\u2019re actually afraid that it will fly over the fence and hit someone on the other side. You forgot to adjust for your new body, your curves getting in the way of the bow. Your second shot is no better, nearly catching the bowstring on your breasts both coming and going, and just barely missing catching a button on your shirt and tearing it free too. You hear some laughs from across the yard \u2013 apparently the swordsmen are enjoying the impromptu show \u2013 but you ignore it, focusing on improving your accuracy. The third, forth, and fifth arrows are much closer, missing the target just to one side or the other. That one week every year you spent with a bow and arrow in school isn\u2019t much of a help now, but it is a starting point at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finish shooting the last arrow from the quiver on your back, you look over the target and see the hits that you have made, along with all of the misses. Marching over, you gather the arrows up and return to where you started, and begin again. This time you make quite a few more hits, even scoring a few direct shots to the roundels painted on the dummy. As you continue to draw and fire, you start to realize that you\u2019re progressing far faster than you should be able to; your accuracy is going up, and that\u2019s somewhat expected with the practice, but your speed and even strength are also obviously increasing, you\u2019re able to fire much faster than before as well as pulling the bowstring back much more easily than when you started. You\u2019re nowhere near approaching superhuman levels or anything like that, but it\u2019s almost as if every shot is getting you more practice than you might expect. It\u2019s actually kind of nice, being able to pick up something new without as much effort as might normally be required. <i>Maybe it\u2019s to do with this virtual world</i> you suppose, before <i>I wonder if this applies to other things in this world too?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swordsmen aren\u2019t laughing any longer, and they don\u2019t seem to be practicing now either, judging from the lack of sounds coming from their way. You don\u2019t look over at them though, still concentrating on firing arrow after arrow into the target. On the third round, you are only having a few misses, with most getting close to the targets. You\u2019re still not pulling off trick shots like firing multiple arrows at the same time or splitting arrows from nock to tip with each following arrow, but it still feels good to be able to get so many shots on target from where you were just a short time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun steadily moves across the sky, but you focus solely on the back and forth repetition. You just finish gathering the arrows again after the umpteenth time when you hear someone clapping. Looking around, you first look over at the pair that was practicing with swords, but they both shake their head and point behind you. Turning around, you see a short and bearded man sitting atop the fence, looking mighty pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, sorry if I surprised you, lass. I was just enjoying the show,\u201d he says with a grin\u2026you think, it\u2019s hard to tell with that thick beard almost completely hiding his mouth, chin, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he hops down from the fence, you get to see that he is quite a bit shorter than you thought, standing maybe about four feet high if that. He walks up to you, and you notice \u2013 with a bit of shock \u2013 that you can just barely see him over the swell of your bust, another step closer and you wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything except the top of his rusty hair, and another step beyond that and you wouldn\u2019t be able to see him at all. Briefly shaking your head, you notice something else: there\u2019s something about this newcomer that reminds you of your William, especially around the nose and eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster high-and-mighty\u201d you can practically hear the sneer in his voice, while hooking his thumb over his shoulder, \u201casked for me to help out with this newcomer. Do you happen to know where she is, since I don\u2019t see any raw rookies back here, well, except for those two\u201d he says with a twinkle in his eyes waving a hand towards the swordsmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a slight grin crossing your face as you reply, \u201cI seem to be a quick learner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I can see that, a very quick learner indeed.\u201d He then holds his hand out \u201cKolgruik Nightriver, at your service.\u201d Noting the look on your face, and most likely expecting it, he continues, \u201cBut you can call me Kol, if you would prefer.\u201d Taking the offered hand you give your own name, to which he responds, \u201cHmm\u2026Debora Hall, eh? You not from around here are you, as surely I would remember someone like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about the way he says that makes you feel like he is just stating a fact, rather than anything on the more lusty side of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I just\u2026dropped in,\u201d you respond, chuckling on the inside at your wordplay. \u201cI asked about where I could get some gear and was directed here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, this is an excellent spot for aspiring adventurers. I started out here myself\u2026I\u2019ve upgraded my equipment a bit since then though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reaches over his shoulder and pats the butt of what can only be a rifle. Bulky and with a faint golden color, it\u2019s so long that he has to hang it diagonally across his back or the barrel would be scrapping on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVera here has served me well since I rescued her and helped fix her up. She\u2019s not exactly subtle, but she certainly gets the job done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to ask, \u201cVera?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d his eyes narrowing. You stammer out that there\u2019s nothing wrong, not at all, you were just wondering why he named his weapon that. \u201cThat\u2019s a story for another time, and we had best get moving along anyways. From what I understand, your equipment should be just about ready and then you\u2019ve got a job to do, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spins on his heel without another word and marches back through the door, leaving you standing there for a moment before you follow along wondering just what your first task would be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThere\u2019s a group of brigands who have attacked a caravan carrying some supplies I requested. They didn\u2019t kill anyone \u2013 only a few injuries \u2013 but they made off with some items including some rare furs that I need for my work. I\u2019ve heard that they may have taken an old abandoned mine as shelter. I need the two of you to go locate them if they aren\u2019t there and recover the fur. Recovering the other stolen items would be a pleasant happenstance, but what happens to the thieves is of no consequence.\u201d Orinan says as he finishes laying out your new leather armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of it, it isn\u2019t nearly ornate as Kol\u2019s, but it looks like it should afford you some protection while allowing you most of your mobility. The bow looks a bit better than the one you were using for practice along with a quiver of matching arrows, and a shortsword with a sheath that hung from a belt. Slipping the blade free, you see that it is nothing special, just a sharp piece of metal with a pointy end, but it looks like it would still leave a mark on whomever or whatever it hit. All of the leather and the wood is dark, not quite black, but close. While you continue to look over your armor and other gear, you remain only partially aware of Orinan giving Kol more detailed directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards the end of the discussion, you chime in, \u201cIsn\u2019t this something the pol- guards should handle?\u201d stopping yourself from saying police since that didn\u2019t seem like it would apply here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf looks at you with a slightly baffled look, while Kol actually bursts out laughing. \u201cAh lass, you really aren\u2019t from around here, are you? Don\u2019t know how things are done wherever you\u2019re from, but here the guards are only good for protecting the city and the neighboring farms, and not even that sometimes. Something like this is why adventurers flock to this region.\u201d He then turns back to the elf, \u201cNow you were saying, Orinan\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, you follow Kol as he leads you through the city, shuffling this way and tugging at that as you try to get used to the armor wrapped around you. The elf did a remarkable job at getting the armor suited for your body even without taking your measurements, but it\u2019s still something you have to get used to. The chest piece hugs your breasts and gives them quite a bit of support and does so without being overly confining. The leggings similarly grip your legs but allow you walk freely without any difficulty. Rather than a helmet, the armor includes a toughened hood to pull over your head, but for now you leave it down. The fact that you can feel how your fur is being pulled in the wrong direction doesn\u2019t help matters. Whatever thoughts Kol has on your new outfit, he keeps to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun is hanging low in the sky by the time the two of you reach one of the city gates, but Kol leads on anyways. Outside, there\u2019s a stiff breeze that carries what could only be the smell of the farmlands. It briefly stops you in your tracks, too used to the smell of cities. Even if this old city doesn\u2019t smell much like the real one, it\u2019s close enough that you didn\u2019t notice much off. Outside is a completely different matter. It doesn\u2019t even smell like the park that you used to go to as a child. Kol waits patiently as you stand there stunned, his face passive beneath his beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you recover, the dwarf leads you along the road. You pass by a stable, and ask if the two of you will be needing horses. Kol just shakes his head, saying that the mine isn\u2019t far off, though you can also hear him mutter that he doesn\u2019t do well on horses. Even still, you look back over your shoulder a number of times as you walk along, wondering if it wouldn\u2019t be best. You continue this till the stable is hidden from view by a rise in the landscape. The city beyond remains visible, crouching in a pleasant looking valley formed in a trough between two mountain ranges. The road winds back and forth, seeming to never follow a straight line. It even crosses back and forth over the same river multiple times. On an uphill portion, the road cuts right next to the river as it cascades down a short fall. It\u2019s still enough to send a spray of mist and drops into the air. You are only mildly surprised now that you can feel the water against your face, the coolness quite pleasant and refreshing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou occasionally come across other travelers using the same road, ranging from single people to large caravans of more than two dozen. Kol greets a few but most don\u2019t pay much attention to two more wanderers, though you still attract more than the usual number of second and even third glances. It\u2019s actually starting to get a bit old, so many people outright staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun dips below the mountains, and on and on Kol goes. You follow along, your eyes probing the growing darkness as you almost get the sense that someone or something is near. You can see how Kol is on edge as well, one of his hands edging towards a knife on his belt. A rustle in the bushes draws the gaze of both of you. In a flash, a large stag bursts from the growth. The animal briefly freezes upon seeing you, before bounding off again. Kol looks back at you and gives a slight chuckle under his breath. Only after that do you realize that you have your blade in hand, having drawn it as soon as the bush started to split apart. You slip the sword back into the sheath before the two of you set off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stars are just starting to come out when Kol suddenly announces, \u201cWe better set up camp here. We\u2019ll be able to get to the mine early tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you find that it\u2019s a pleasant little spot just off of the road with a steam just a short distance away and a large tree to provide some cover. He directs you to collect some wood, while he wrangles up something to eat. You shrug and wander away, making sure to keep the chosen spot in sight. Soon enough, you make your way back with your arms full of wood and find Kol already preparing a couple of rabbits he hunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf joking, you say, \u201cWow, Vera really is quiet, isn\u2019t she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaw lass, Vera wouldn\u2019t have left much of these little things; had to go with one of her little sisters.\u201d Kol pants a small device on his belt, which looks like a hand crossbow collapsed down. \u201cMade for silent work, you see,\u201d he continues with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shows you how to get the fire going and soon the rabbit meat is sizzling in the heat. You briefly wonder how you eating meat will work, <i>cows don\u2019t normally eat meat, right?</i> but the smell of the meat is enough to set your stomach grumbling, so you don\u2019t really care. The meat\u2019s a bit bland, but it\u2019s filling and doesn\u2019t make you sick, so that\u2019s a pretty good thing. The wind rustles the leaves above you and the stars look gorgeous as they fill the night sky. You honestly think that this is one of the best nights you have had in a long time, it certainly beats all of the nights that you have lain at home alone while William was working late or traveling for business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Kol pulls out a small pouch from his belt, takes out a piece of paper and crumbles something on to it. It certainly looks like he\u2019s making his own cigarette, but you\u2019ve never known tobacco to be blue like that. The pungent green-tinted smoke it gives off after lighting doesn\u2019t look familiar either. The smell is actually enough to make you gag, but Kol seems to realize your discomfort and moves so that the wind carries most of the smoke away from you. He regales you with tales of some of his memorable travels. You listen intently, leaning back against the rough bark behind you. You drift off to sleep sometime later, somehow knowing that if trouble arises, you and Kol will be awake to face it.</span></div></div>",

You guess you're in the range of 7-8 feet from your ears down to your paws.

They feel heavy, yet perfectly balanced.  Deciding to leave them be for now, lest you draw unwanted attention, you decide to find out where a safe place to stay would be.</span></div></div>",

And treasure, endless excitement, adventure, and treasure. The dark void unfolds like origami into a calm area. A study, furnished with warm earthy tones, authentic Mahogany, and a plethora of books, maps and charts. You realize you're sitting, having just put back the phone. Judging by the phone you were in some nebulous time in the past, between world wars more than likely. In front of you is documents the you of this world had been collecting on the treasure of Gidhinth, which seems to be some kind of Dragon/Fertility God from some fictitious Mediterranean island named Vinnaess. Its treasure was vast and legendary, and you could only assume why the game generated a treasure based on a fertility god. There could be some interesting dual wish fulfillment there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like you were a quick phone call away from packing your bags and heading off to Vinnaess in search of her treasure... but in your hand you had just scrawled down a note to call a number to go on a hunt for the fountain of youth. The world was starting you off on your choice of adventure, and both had their perks. The fountain of youth was far more recognizable and eternal youth was always a fantasy that would be fun to play out, but the treasures of Gidhinth seem tailored to you.

A shiver passes through the blank expanse that you are stuck in just before the void before you unfolds like origami. You have to instantly screw your eyes shut as the light is painfully bright. Thoroughly blinded now, you also notice that you feel oddly cold and wet. It takes quite a while, but eventually you are able to barely open your eyes without feeling like daggers are being stabbed into your skull, though you can\u2019t make much out, and everything looks really odd. It takes you even longer \u2013 during which your eyes further adjust to the light allowing you to see better still \u2013 to realize that it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re looking through a lens. Moving your hand up reveals that you are within a clear tube of some sort, though the motion also releases a stream of bubbles that slowly float up, drawing your gaze to watch them go. It takes a few moments for the pieces to fit together once you see that, but you do eventually realize that you seem to be floating in a jar of almost clear fluid. Beating on the \u201cglass\u201d to try and get out, though in your haste to escape you completely miss how you seem to have been breathing this liquid just fine anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gurgling hiss, the tube splits apart, releasing the fluid and dragging you along too. You end up slamming face first into the floor, lying in a slowly spreading puddle of the liquid. You can feel the coolness of the metal floor pressing into your cheek as well as the texture of the flooring, leaving you momentarily stunned at how real this simulation feels. Taking a deep breath proves to be a mistake, as it just causes you to hack and cough till it feels like your insides might spill out; and while your organs don\u2019t actually get ejected, you do end up letting out quite a shocking amount of that fluid from your lungs; again shocking you with how you can feel this ooze shooting up out of your body with each retching cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoroughly drained, you lie there for who knows how long, barely remaining conscious more by luck than willpower. Breathing starts to get a bit easier, though the air carries an antiseptic smell that irritates your nose. Sometime later, you feel a tremor passing through the floor, and it\u2019s strong enough to send you shivering across the ground, even if it is helped with lubrication from the liquid from the tank. Struggling to hands and knees, you glance around, and see matte metal everywhere, as well as a number of other tanks arrayed along the wall, though all of the other ones are unoccupied and dry looking to your quick glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing a hand on the wall, you manage to get to your feet, only to nearly end up dropping back to the ground when a voice comes from everywhere and nowhere at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings Patient 526117,\u201d it says with a soothing feminine tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour throat is quiet sore, and your voice is barely a rasp, but you manage to croak out, \u201cAre you speaking to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAffirmative,\u201d the voice responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2026where am I? What was I doing in this\u2026tube thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are located in the intensive care unit of the New Horizon\u2019s medical facility. You have just been released from one of the regeneration pods where you were being treated for life threatening injuries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about how the voice sounds makes you it think it might not be from a human, though if your desire for something futuristic was made properly, it might very well not be human you suppose. Shifting gears, you are also left wondering what exactly the voice meant by \u201clife threatening injuries\u201d, other than your throat feeling rough from the coughing spell, you don\u2019t feel like you are death\u2019s door or anything. You are broken from your line of thought by another tremor passing through; you can feel it through the soles of your feet as well as your shoulder against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that, an earthquake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, an earthquake would not be possible at this facility. This facility is under attack by a hostile group. Most staff and patients have already been evacuated. Due to this, your treatment had to be terminated before completion. Recommend continuing treatment at another facility as soon as you are able. Someone is on their way to assist you. In the intervening time, please review your personal medical information; this information will be displayed shortly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly afterwards, a glowing panel of light appears in midair, with a few things that you can recognize like heartbeat and breathing. A large section of the \u201cpanel\u201d seems blank but a couple seconds later starts displaying something like an x-ray of bones, but much more realistic looking than that. As the bones continue to appear, you also see organs starting to get drawn in, followed by muscle; it\u2019s creating an image of your body layer by layer.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pretty soon, you're looking back at your own face. Same chin length brown hair, same blue eyes, same mole on your left upper lip. Your body looked fairly normal as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, you thought it did. However, the more you looked at the scan, the more you notice small things out of place. The first, and perhaps most glaring thing, is a large scar on your face. It started on your right cheek bone, running long and deep across your lips before terminating on the left side of your chin. It was an absolute beast of a thing, and looked like nothing so much as a sword blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second scar on your neck drew your gaze next. It ran horizontally across your wind pipe, and you shuddered as you absentmindedly wondered whether a noose or a knife could have caused that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your gaze went down to your body, you saw that you were now fairly well built. Not body builder jacked, but rather a lean, hard, athletic build. What extraneous flesh had existed on your body seemed to have been excised at some point. In the real world, you certainly hadn't been fat, but you were a little soft, with plump thighs, the beginnings of some belly rolls, and a bit more meat on your booty then you were comfortable with. One of William's key arguments against kids, in fact, was his expectation that you'd blimp up rather massively once you got pregnant. Of course, if things actually progressed the way he made it sound, you'd be an immobile blob before you were forty, eating entire buffets as a light snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if the universe lost all sense and such things could potentially occur, they certainly didn't seem likely to happen to this body. Your thighs and calves were thick with hard muscle, and while your booty was still a little more generous then anticipated, it looked more firm then soft. A faint hint of abs could be seen on your torso, and you could easily make out the biceps on your arms. Frankly, you looked like someone who could kick <b>a lot</b> of ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, even your torso had its fair share of scars. Old bullet wounds were side-by-side with patches of burned skin and stitches. Your body was an absolute mess, and you felt ill as you contemplated the damage. <i>\"It looks like someone opened fire at point blank with automatic kinetic and energy weapons,\"</i> you thought, nervously trying to remind yourself it was just a simulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, even with your worries regarding your shockingly extensive injuries, you couldn't fail to notice your tits. Now, you'd been pretty well endowed in the real world, either a high C or a low D, depending on where you bought your bras. That was honestly impressive enough (and had been a bit of an ego boost when you'd been feeling down regarding your former plumpness), but these had broached a whole 'nother category. You were left to guess as their size wasn't listed, but these monsters had to be at least an F, and if you were told an H cup or more, it wouldn't have been remotely surprising. <i>\"These things are friggin' ridiculous! Why are they so big!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't given much time to contemplate the expanded new scale of your massive mammaries, as clicking on part of the holographic panel highlighted several parts of your body. Clicking on each highlight in turn generated a long list of augments - carbon fiber skeletal supports, muscular enhancements, mechanical lungs, mechanical hearts (<i>\"Plural?\"</i>), ocular implants, auditory implants...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, the list kept going on and on, showing no signs of reaching its end anytime soon. It seemed the only parts of your body that hadn't been replaced or augmented in some way were your skin and your brain. As you looked over the list of procedures, you couldn't make out the dating system in use, but a lot of them occurred at the same time stamp. <i>\"Why do I have this really disturbing suspicion its tied to all these wounds...?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt cold despite the warmth in the room. It was really, really hard to remember this was not real. <i>\"What in God's name happened to me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother shudder passed through the structure, this one clearly from an explosion of some kind. The time to read and worry was clearly over. You slammed your hand down on the \"Close Panel\" button and started to move away. The panel remained open, buzzing slightly, as you made your way down the room. You leaned against the wall for support, legs wobbling, though you could slowly feel their strength returning. A stiffness in your body made sure you were aware of how many stitches were currently holding you together, and you knew this would hamper your mobility a good deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sign off on your medical report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now,\" you said, at last making it to the lockers. Thankfully, none of them were locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sign off on your medical report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of busy over here!\" Three of the four lockers were empty, and you cursed under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sign off on your medical report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked your lucky stars as you opened the fourth locker and saw it was full of clothes. You quickly donned the white tank top and panties, wincing in pain as you bent over to pull on the provided socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sign off on your medical report.\" The hologram began floating towards you as another explosion rocked the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my fucking God, would you shut up!?\" Undergarments on, you began pulling on the uniform in the locker. It was a black one piece, and seemed to be made of spandex or leather of some kind. Initially, it seemed like it wouldn't fit. The material turned out to be very stretchy, however, and it managed to make it around your newly engorged assets with only a slight bit of difficulty. That said, it was skin tight, and left shockingly little to the imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sign off on your medical report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ, FINE!\" You placed your left hand in the provided slot, allowing it to scan your prints. The red light on the hologram flashed yellow for three or four beats, then turned green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Identification Accepted. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever,\" you said, so happy that was over. You found a denim jacket in the bottom of the locker. Pulling it on to help hide your body a little better then this skin-tight sleeve, you were a little annoyed that your tits were far too large for the coat, only allowing you to do up the bottom three buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"God, I must look like an anime fanservice girl,\"</i> you thought as you looked at the coat. There was a large badge pinned to the left breast pocket. It read: PGPD - NSF41 - 526117 - Enf<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, I have no clue what that means,\"</i> you thought as you pulled on the reinforced gloves in the locker. There was a pair of combat boots as well, though there appeared no means to tie them. However, as you slid them on your feet, they automatically tightened until they were comfortably snug. <i>\"Now that's convenient. Wish the tread was a little more aggressive, though? Wonder how I get them off?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding this was a problem to worry about after you got out of this alive, you found a dual hip holster in the locker, sans guns. Grumbling at the lack of a weapon at what seemed a REALLY good time to have one, you donned the holster anyway, hoping to find something to fill it soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you emptied the locker, you heard the hiss of hydraulics as the door behind you opened. You whipped around far faster then you'd have thought possible, holding a dirk in your hand you didn't even remember drawing from your boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man who'd opened the door flinched as you spun. He was dressed in a bright orange jump suit with safety stripes. \"Custodial\" was written in big, bold letters across his sleeve, and his name tag stated his name was Gary. He was graying a little at the temples, and was about 12 kg overweight. No weapons, concealed or otherwise. Fear in his eyes indicative of a civilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked a little. <i>\"How the hell do I know all this?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gary realized who was in front of him, his look changed a little, though he was still quite frightened. He was...</span></div></div>",

You never said she was an Enforcer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine answered apologetically. \"Apologies, but I detected a 94.327% chance of your refusal of aid if her proper profession was known to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' A right I'da said NO! I ain't riskin' me hide for one o'them murderous bastards!\" Gary seemed to suddenly remember who was in the room with him, and his eyes shot to you fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, not fearful. He's absolutely terrified of me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly slid the dirk back into its boot holster. Holding your hands up, you said, \"Calm down. I mean you no harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary seemed about to snort in derision, but thought better of it. He looked at the computer again. \"What's she doin' here anyway? The PD has their own facilities, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feminine voice replied, \"Officer 526117's injuries were too severe. She would not have survived the journey to a proper police facility, so she was re-routed to the nearest site capable of treating her wounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still right here,\" you answered, a little annoyed at being ignored. Still, their conversation was at least somewhat enlightening. <i>\"So, apparently I'm a cop in this VR world. 526-whatever is my badge number. Enf must mean Enforcer, which is my rank or title. And whatever that means, its enough to have this guy damn near shitting himself in fear.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you eye the look of fear and hate Gary has for you, you can't help but think, <i>\"Nice to know cops are just as popular here as they are in reality.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary looked slant eyed at the terminal. \"She doesn't look twelve, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fudged the numbers a little,\" the computer answered logically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time it took Gary to blink, you were all but an inch from his face. He gasped in surprise, unable to move from your one hand at the back of his head, and the knife in your other against his throat. You snarled in a barely suppressed, primal rage. \"Still. Right. <b>Here.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary trembled, eyes wide and lips quivering. Already sweating nervously, the musk of fear started wafting off him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could smell it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could <i>taste</i> it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou savored it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLORIOUS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It would be so easy. So very easy. Just a little pressure and his throat would be open. Gloriously open. A torrent of blood from the jugular. Death in a handful of seconds. So very quick. He angered you. He brought it on himself. He <b>deserved</b> it. That coppery smell mixed with voided bowels. Perfection. Where is my next target?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WHERE!?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStop yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has a ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's married!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden gasp came from your lips as you swallowed a mouthful of air. Forcing yourself away from him, your knees trembled as you leaned against the terminal. Gary stumbled back, hand against his throat, his terrified gaze locked on your blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd never been so angry in your entire life. So unnaturally furious over such a small thing. The thought of killing him had been so easy. So terrifyingly easy. You fought to get your thundering heartbeat under control. Gasping out between trembling breaths, you stuttered, \"What... the hell... was that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the question may have been rhetorical, the computer did not take it as such. \"All Enforcer Organic Units receive aggression enhancers as a standard upgrade. In the event of extreme injury, the Enforcer unit will endeavor to eliminate any and all threats to its existence until such time as all threats are eliminated or it ceases to function. The degree of Officer 526117's injuries had likely severely limited her natural ability to override her aggressive response, necessitating her disarmament and an experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary, who had been distracted looking at the pin drop of blood on his hand, immediately fixed a look of rage at the hospital AI. \"You used me to test if she was still fuckin' blood hungry!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmotionless, it responded. \"Correct. My algorithms calculated that the Custodial Unit known as Gary White was the most expendable employee in the hospital. As well, the current terrorist attack would give an excellent cover regarding your cause of death in the event of your murder by a police Enforcer unit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned. \"How could you just throw a human life away like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry, but I am only a machine. I can only proceed according to my programming. You are important. Gary is not. His death would have had minimal consequences. As you have now been deemed safe, I shall return your weapons to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA drawer on the terminal opened, revealing a pair of handguns and a couple speed loaders. One was an energy pistol, with the words \"Law Giver\" crudely carved in the side. The revolver, which honestly had more in common with a cannon, bore the words, \"Law Maker.\" You picked up the weapons with shaking hands, instinctively checking their condition and readiness to fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would the police need a monster like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Enforce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold finality of the computer's response sent a shiver down your spine. You leaned your head against the wall, eyes closed. \"I wish to see a full list of all my 'enhancements'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but your medical records have been deleted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head shot up, eyes opened and locked on the terminal. \"What!? What for!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The key to a good filing system is knowing what to keep and what to get rid of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medical records are wasted space?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a hospital!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. Would you like to fill out a survey about your exper-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary didn't question it when you put 5 rounds into the computer terminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ten kinetic rounds and a clip of energy left. Terrific.\"</i> Destroying the hospital AI might have felt good in the moment, but it had left your already lacking resources rather strained. As you re-tightened the strap on your one glove, you asked aloud, \"What is our situation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary took a moment to answer, though you fully understood why. Beyond the events earlier, he had just watched you put five rounds into a terminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen rip it apart with your bare hands, giggling maniacally as you did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really needed to get this under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped, and answered, \"Don't rightly know, meself. These guys in black stormed the place, gunning down everyone they saw. Ain't trying to take hostages or anything. Security's trying to hold them off, but they got some serious ordinance. They can't stop'em for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifty or a hundred? I don't know. They evacuated everybody else, but the comp called me, said a little girl was still in her room, and I was the only one close enough to get 'er out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we both know how that turned out. The attackers didn't try to stop the escape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Shot at us a bit, but once we were off the grounds, they didn't care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" They clearly weren't here for any of the staff, then. They had no qualms about murdering the staff, but only when needed. <i>\"Fear is a good motivator when you want people to vacate a building. Why do I have the feeling I'm the target?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know a way out of here without going past the terrorists?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary paused for a moment, then nodded nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Take it and go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned. \"You're not coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" You smiled, unaware at how nervous your predatory smirk made the janitor. \"I'm going to say Hi.\"</span></div></div>",

You stand in mute shock looking up at what was supposed to be information about you, but instead shows that\u2026creature. A worried thought crosses your mind and you raise your hand, and nearly slump to the floor in shock as you see the scales that the image shows. Forcing yourself further upright, you find that the image on the \u201cscreen\u201d does indeed match yourself, you\u2019ve be granted a new body in this virtual world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther information starts to appear on the panel floating in midair, things that look like heart rate, breathing, and other things you only vague recognize, but you continue to focus in on the image of your new body. Tall, leggy, and with a shapely figure, it stirs an odd feeling of envy in you, made even odder in that you are envious of yourself. The almost swimsuit looking \u201cclothing\u201d you are wearing hugs the curves, cupping breasts that put your real ones to shame, and pulled tight around hips that are each nearly as wide as your original waist. Tentatively, you reach up and heft your assets, finding them very realistic to the touch, and sensitive enough to send a slight shiver down your spin\u2026and out along your tail, that part is going to take some getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tremor passing through the walls and floor causes you to tumble forwards into the panel, but rather than hitting it, you pass clean through, scattering the light briefly before you come out the other side. Looking back, you see the panel reform as if you hadn\u2019t disturbed it, as well as the curves of your wings and the long spade-tipped tail, all moving around slightly without any conscious thought. Seemingly realizing that you are on the other side now, the panel quickly redraws so that it is facing you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cock your head as you hear a distant, but still loud whirring groan. As the groan winds down, so do the lights, plunging everything into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, are you still there?\u201d you call out, your throat feeling somewhat better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t get an answer, leaving you alone in the dark in this room that you didn\u2019t even get a chance to explore before the lights went out. You groan a bit, putting your hand out to touch the wall and slowly feeling your way along. Before you get too far, the room is filled with a dim red light; <i>emergency lighting, maybe</i> you suppose. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s enough to let you see the hand in front of your face, and not run into everything. Spying a door set into one wall, you make your way over to it, your steps becoming more fluid and stable even in just that short time. As you reach the door though, you realize that there doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to open it; there\u2019s no knob, handle, or hole. There is a small panel set to one side, but it\u2019s dark and doesn\u2019t respond to your touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you start to look for another way to get out, but turn back when you hear a creak and a groan coming from the door. A gap soon appears down the center of the door, and fingers are jammed into the opening, slowly forcing it wider. With a shout of effort, the door opens wide enough that someone might just be able to squeeze through sideways, but a loud crunching noise signals that it\u2019s reached its limits. In the dim light, you just make out an oddly featureless face peaking through the partially opened door. You wonder if this is supposed to be the \u201csomeone\u201d that the voice said would be coming to assist you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank the maker, you\u2019re already awake. I was afraid that this power outage happened at the wrong time,\u201d it says in a voice with an oddly metallic overtone. \u201cHere, I picked up some spare armor from the guard post, put it on, quickly now. Can\u2019t have you getting hurt <i>again</i> while getting out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure squeezes through the opening, and now you see that the \u201cfeatureless\u201d face is actually a helmet, all metal plates except for two small lenses where the eyes should be. The rest of the body is similarly covered in thick plates that hide the body beneath, leaving you no clue whether the wearer is male or female. You think it\u2019s human, but then you see that the hands are much longer and thinner than should be, as well as only having three fingers and a thumb each. Pulling a molded plastic looking case from its back, the armored figure starts tossing out small sections of metal, certainly not enough to cover your body. You stand there looking a little dumbfounded after the figure apparently finishes, then turns to the gap in the door, looking up and down the hall outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems to be aware that you aren\u2019t putting the armor on, as it looks back over one rounded shoulder and barks out, \u201cWell, what are you waiting for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m not sure\u2026what I\u2019m supposed to be doing,\u201d you admit, recoiling a bit from the venom in the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growling hiss issues forth from the helmet, before saying \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be getting armored up, like I just said.\u201d You pick up one of the pieces, trying to figure it out, but the figure interrupts, the voice a bit more concerned now, \u201cYou have no idea, do you? Gorram, I thought every one of you people past adolescence knew how to put on at least basic armor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy people?\u201d you ask, wondering just what they meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, humans. You really got messed up didn\u2019t you?\u201d even without being able to see the face, you are able to tell there\u2019s more than a little frustration present. They start tapping on the armor plate on their forearm, a small holographic screen popping into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuman?\u201d you ask, looking down at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, <i>altered human</i>, I forgot that some are really particular in the word\u2026ing\u2026\u201d the voice trailing off as information starts scrolling across the screen. You can\u2019t make any of it out, but when the person next speaks, their tone has softened slightly, \u201cBy the maker, I didn\u2019t realize the injuries were that bad, here, let me help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to ask about the \u201caltered human\u201d bit as well as the injuries that you keep getting told about, but there\u2019s another tremor, though this time you can hear the rumble of what sounds like an explosion accompanying the feeling. With a flick of the arm, the display vanishes, and the armored figure then starts picking up one of the pieces and holding it up to your chest. Suddenly the formerly small plate of metal starts telescoping out and extending around you, surprising you enough that you are left holding your tongue. You see that it is forming something more resembling armor around you, and you briefly wonder how it\u2019s going to handle your wings, but that seems to have been considered, the armor extending out along them till they\u2019re covered in smaller plates that slider over and under each other, allowing your wings full range of motion\u2026if only you could control them. The other portions of the plates work in much the same way, till you\u2019re covered in armor plates that somewhat resemble the other\u2019s. They quickly show you where the helmet control is, and you press it, feeling the helmet closing around your head, giving you a brief feeling of claustrophobia from being sealed with darkness pressing in around you, then light starts leaking in as the helmet apparently kicks in, with little icons overlaying the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other gives a quick nod as you get used to the armor, before moving back to the door way and peeking down both directions, grabbing a boxy shape off of the hip. This shape quickly telescopes out, and soon resembles a rifle of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this gives you an idea, \u201cHey, if this place is still under attack, shouldn\u2019t I have a weapon\u2026to defend myself with, cover your back and all that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other\u2019s helmet looks back, but doesn\u2019t say anything; with the face hidden, you can\u2019t get a feel for the expression or what it might be thinking, but you think it must be weighing the risks of giving you \u2013 an inexperienced person with apparently little to no memories \u2013 a weapon, whether you might shoot them in the back accidentally or on purpose.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One of the major advantages of having realistic virtual reality was the possibility to train soldiers and police in ways that would be otherwise impossible in the real world.  Even the best in simunition and acting could only go so far to simulate real danger without putting the participant in actual danger, whereas in the virtual world you could put your trainees into as much danger as you like without any real risk.  You could give them pain as accurate as the real wound and excerpt them until they dropped of exhaustion and still they would come out as physically fresh faced as when they'd been put in, but with greater knowledge than any other form of training would alloy.<br>\r\nVirtual reality training also allowed the testers to place the subjects into situations that would be impossible to recreate in the real world without incurring substantial costs and requiring monumental coordination and prep time on the part of the testers.  You had personally experienced many of these tests in your training to be a law enforcement operative (LEO for short), racking up hundreds of hours in training in an array of situations that tested everything from your pattern recognition skills, to your reaction time, and even your ability to make lucky guesses.  In the modern world where even petty thugs can get their hands on cybernetic upgrades to double his strength and any old meth dealer can be packing a chip to boost their reaction time the police have evolved into LEO, a government run organization with agents like you designed to deal with any and every possible scenario no matter how outlandish.<br>\r\nCurrently you were in a simulation designed to test out your ability to avoid distractions and stay focused.  Somewhere in the simulation their was a killer on the loose, a stock villain of the virtual training program known as \"Fiona\" and you had to stop her as fast as possible with as few civilian casualties as possible and of course without getting butchered yourself.  This woman was physically rather attractive if you were to look past the retractable blades in her wrists and blood red eyes, with a toned body and tight features all topped off with sweetest looking doll face you could imagine and hair as crimson as the setting sun.<br>\r\nNormally finding a woman like this would be a no brainer; look for the gal with blood on her hands who won't take off her sunglasses and bingo, you have your perp.  The problem was the setting.  You currently stood in the midst of a lovely beach, a soothing midday sun beating down from on high and warming you to a delightful degree.  The breeze softly lapped over the whole of your body in a loving embrace of serenity and brought forth the delightful scent of the ocean.<br>\r\nOh yeah, and you were surrounded by beautiful naked sunbathing models on an entirely female nude beach.  That was also a distraction worth pointing out.  Row after row, all of them demanding your attention; some asked to be oiled up, others for a massage, and others still lacked the subtlety of their peers and just asked for a straight up fuck.  One woman in particular caught your eye, or rather her ass did.  Plump tan and elevated just slightly off her towel with heels slowly kicking off of them like a drum.  The woman could tell from your lingering shadow that you were admiring her.  She laughed coyly and said \"Enjoying the view are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes ma'am.\"  You say, her inquiry catching you off guard.  Realizing what you had just said you stammer \"I mean no ma'am.  WAIT, I MEAN-\"<br>\r\nShe cut off your nervous reply with a giggle and responded \"Relax officer, you don't have to be so nervous around little old me!  Besides, I'm a little glad you're here.  So far only other women have come to the beach, and while I do enjoy a good woman every now and then I really feel that the more stern hands of a man would be better to get sun tan lotion onto my back.  If you're not to busy officer, would you care to give me a hand?\"</span></div></div>",

With the new update, the site is now capable of retroactively mocking up VR simulations of almost any video in its archive. There are limits of course - it can only simulate within the confines of the recorded footage, and there's not a great deal of room for interaction due to the constraints of the AI. But for simply <i>experiencing</i> something, there really is nothing like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing to keep in mind is exiting the videos. Each simulation came with an exit, usually in the guise of a doorway, distinct enough to be noticable but not too glaring as to distract from the content of the \"video\". If at any point you want to leave a video, all you have to do is step through the doorway. Simples!</span></div></div>",

While not itself a bad sign, you know from experience that the five minute mark means something has gone wrong. You grip your hands on the steering wheel of the car: a rust-red junker with four torn leather seats and a big trunk. Your foot hovers above the accelerator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in the corner of your eye, you see them. Two hooded figures are climbing out of a busted window, and each one is holding a large burlap sack in each hand. They sprint over to you, tossing the sacks in the trunk and lurching into the back seat, where a change of clothing is waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slammed the accelerator and speeded out of the courtyard of Imaginetech Industries. Driving up to the security gate, you again slide an employee badge through the receiver. The metal gates swing open silently, and down the road you and your two partners go, illuminated only by the milky-yellow streetlights from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rusty car pulled into a quiet and dilapidated neighborhood of foreclosed homes. A few turns through a cul-de-sac brought the three of you to an old and poorly kept house. Weeds were growing in disarray in the front yard, and tall grasses stuck out from cracks in the driveway. The lights were out and all windows were covered by thick curtains. As you pulled up to the house, you guided the car up a brick ramp leading to a large wooden gate with latches on it. A fourth figure, a young woman, unlatched the gate and pulled it inward, allowing you to maneuver the car into the side yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving turned off the car lights, the scene was as quiet as one can imagine. It was like a dark phantom gliding into and out of sight for a moment. You parked the car and everyone got out with the sacks of stolen goods. The four of you then cast a large tarp over the car, covering it from plain sight, and then closed the gate. Finally, you all entered the house from the back door, which was less than a door and more like a gaping hole where a door should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly hell, what took you guys so long?\u201d The young woman asked, brushing hair out of her eyes and watching the three of you with marked annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me Ames, they were three minutes late for the drop.\u201d You responded, pointing an accusatory finger at your partners. \u201cThree minutes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChill the fuck out Jake, we made it out safely.\u201d Said the older of the two, Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and you should look at all the stuff we snagged too! It was a huge success!\u201d Piped up the younger of the two, Bernie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, let\u2019s see what you got and then cheese it. Time is a valuable thing too.\u201d Replied the young woman, Amie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou retrieved some flashlights and candles from a cupboard and lit up the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Jake Watson. 19 years old, messy blond hair, thin, and lean. You became part of this group of idlers when you were 17. The others were, and continue to be, your only friends. Although you\u2019ve never been good at anything that mattered, such as grades, sports, girls, or jobs, you did find a calling in petty crime and general lawlessness. Your friends were very much the same, and you all more or less dropped out of high school and nobody cared. You wore a hooded sweatshirt to the heist. Now you\u2019ve dressed down into better fitting clothing: a blue tank top, a pair of tattered camo shorts, and beach sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Alex Skinner, age 21. Held back a year in school, he had been in a lot of your classes as well as detentions. Tall, muscular, and extensive tattoos on his forearms and legs. He doesn\u2019t speak all that much to others outside the group, and one might say he isn\u2019t the sharpest tool in the shed. But of you four he is the largest and bluntest, one that you could count on to swing hard at someone else when the time called for it. He had dressed out of the heist gear (which consisted of the classic ski mask, long-sleeved black shirt, and gloves) and into a leather jacket, stained white undershirt, blue jeans with a skull belt buckle, and sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of the gang also was Bernie Skinner, Alex\u2019s younger brother, age 17. One couldn\u2019t tell that they were related at first, as they were nearly perfect opposites of each other. While Alex is stolid and indifferent, Bernie is a short fuse, a live wire, highly opinionated. He talks more than anyone else in the group, and most of the time you wish he didn\u2019t. But occasionally he has some brilliant ideas in the sea of prattling, so he can be an indispensable member of the group. He was now dressed in a green t-shirt with a screen pressed face of Che Guevara on the front, grey sweatpants, and no shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was Amie \u201cAmes\u201d Dallah, age 19. A so-called \u201clipstick\u201d lesbian, finding a suitable social group in high school proved to be difficult for her. Of you four, she has the most ambition, the greatest ability to lead, and often is the one planning the next job. She actually finished high school and is the only person in the group working at a salaried position. This is mostly to cover funds for gear, food, water, rent, and whatever else the group needs to execute its next crime. When you three arrived at the house, she was wearing a buttoned-up cardigan over a matching pink tank top, faded skinny jeans, and Converse shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, the four of you were inside an old and abandoned house. The owner of the house died years ago and apparently left nobody to claim the property. Bernie discovered the place one year ago, and it has since been the location of your group planning and debriefing after crimes. Sure, there was no electricity or running water, but that hasn\u2019t stopped you before. The neighborhood didn\u2019t have a homeowner\u2019s association; as long as you squatted there without attracting suspicion, the ownerless house didn\u2019t raise any eyebrows. The beat-up car used to belong to the owner as well. You four get along as best you can, with what you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stretched yourself out on a leather couch, while Bernie paced around the room excitedly like a hyena fresh from a kill. Alex stood silently by the door looking outside. Ames folded her arms and stared daggers at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes anybody else think that heist was awesome?!\u201d Bernie laughed. \u201cI totally thought we would get busted by the police, but those fascist pigs were nowhere to be seen! I said to myself, \u2018we could run into some trouble here\u2019, or \u2018I might have to go back to juvie for this\u2019, but it was way easy! You know guys, we should really\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you hushed him. \u201cShut up! Do you want to wake up the whole neighborhood?\u201d Alex cuffed him in the back of the head. \u201cKeep your voice down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just gonna say \u2018we should really go there again, you know, because it was so easy.\u201d Bernie whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 how did it happen exactly?\u201d Amie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex shrugged his beefy shoulders. Bernie spoke up again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Jake drove up to the security gates of Imaginetech. Since you gave us that girl\u2019s employee badge, he checked it into the gate and opened it. Jake pulled up to the front dropoff point, that place with those large granite balls next to the entrance. Anyway, Alex and me walked through the fucking front door! The elevators weren\u2019t working, but we used the stairs to get up to the R&amp;D floor. The diagram of the place you gave us was excellent by the way, Ames, nice job. We thought the most valuable scratch was in R&amp;D, so we cased the floor and then snatched the best-looking shit. Enough to fill these large burlap sacks anyways. We tried exiting the place using the southeast stairwell, but somebody (maintenance perhaps) manually locked the door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat should not have happened.\u201d Amie interrupted softly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you retrace your steps and leave the way you came?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernie raised his hands gently. \u201cHey\u2026 Alex said he thought he saw a shorter exit. We were already behind schedule because it took longer than we thought to break into one of the display screens. Anyway, we climbed out a window and then ran back to the car. We tossed in the sacks, got in the backseat and changed out of our heist gear. Jake drove us back here and that\u2019s the story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex nodded. That was his way of confirming the story of the heist. When Alex nods, nothing more needs to be said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one part that confused you, however. \u201cIf Imaginetech specializes in high-tech products and supplies other businesses with security devices, how was it so easy for you guys to break in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmie already had an answer to that question. She replied, \u201cBecause that was my part. You remember that intern I was dating recently? Olivia Lawrence? She works\u2026 <i>worked</i>\u2026 at Imaginetech. After sleeping with her one night, I had her around my little finger. Asking for her employee badge was like taking candy from a baby. The real problem was getting her to de-encrypt and nullify the security system before leaving work one day. But\u2026\u201d Amie\u2019s voice trailed off, as she bit her lip and smiled coyly. \u201cI persuaded her to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, what if she squeals about you, Ames?\u201d Alex grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I get found out? Won\u2019t happen.\u201d She answered, having contemplated this herself. \u201cMy dear Olivia won\u2019t talk about me unless she\u2019s willing to reveal her relationship with me. She comes from a proud, Christian family; she\u2019ll keep herself closeted for quite some time, and being fired from her job is probably a lesser punishment in her family\u2019s eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I take it you won\u2019t be seeing her anymore.\u201d You added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was nice, but I\u2019ve had better.\u201d Amie stated indifferently. \u201cShe served her purpose just like each of us did. Let\u2019s change the subject\u2026 what did you guys nab?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though it was pitch black inside, a candlelight cast a flickering glow over the room. Most of the items were standard things one would expect from robbing a research facility. Scattered on the floor were office supplies, tin cases of parts, wires, medical supplies, blueprints and schematics of machines, a few thumb drives, bricks of shiny metals, laboratory equipment, and one bag even contained a thick wad of cash!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice haul, boys.\u201d Amie smiled, sifting through the stolen goods. \u201cI\u2019ll find a buyer for some of these things and \u2013 who took these bags of fucking potato chips?\u201d She picked up a dozen small bags of chips and set them aside. Alex chuckled, his deep voice booming, \u201cWhat? There was a vending machine. I was hungry.\u201d \u201cWho steals potato chips at a laboratory?\u201d Amie cracked a smile, shaking her head in amused disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s that?\u201d Bernie asked, pointing to a large metal box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was the thing in the display case.\u201d Alex answered, grabbing it and bringing it closer. \u201cIt looked important, so I took it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metal box had no labels, inscriptions, tags, or anything that could describe the thing it held inside. It was a luminescent white helmet. The helmet seemed to glow by itself in the dark room, giving off an effervescent shine the moment Alex took it out of the metallic box. It had a glass visor extending over the front, a few plugins in the back, metal plating surrounding the exterior, and looked like something out of a cheesy 1980s futuristic film. Included in the box were plastic cables, spare plates, electric wiring, and a small paperback manual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck that!\u201d Bernie exclaimed, tossing the manual aside and holding the helmet in his outstretched arms. \u201cOh my god, is this the VirtuSim 3000?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat thing the news was talking about?\u201d Alex mumbled, his neanderthallic eyes lighting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still in the prototype stage,\u201d Bernie explained to your group. \u201cNot scheduled for a commercial release for another 5 years at least. The Virtual Reality Simulator, or VirtuSim, is a technological breakthrough. It\u2019s like how the computer was forty years ago. It will change everything!\u201d He proclaimed dramatically. You all hushed him again, and Alex cuffed him in the back of the head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe added that the helmet would allow the wearer to experience reality from a different perspective. Although the exact working of the device was lost on a bunch of high school dropout thieves, Amie skimmed through the manual and understood it best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" She said, adjusting her flashlight to flip through the pages of the manual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow what?\" Bernie asked impatiently. \"How much shit is this worth? I'm guessing thousands, we'll be rich!\" You rolled your eyes, but nevertheless hoped that the stolen items would more than compensate the group for taking that risky heist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it work?\" Alex cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know yet.\" Amie replied, setting down the manual and picking up the helmet. Rotating it in her hands, she added, \"The manual only instructs on how to plug it in, establish a connection, and moderate its power usage. There's nothing here indicating how to use the helmet once you're wearing it. That's why the VirtuSim 3000 is still in the experimental stage. Still just a prototype.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are we waiting for?\" Bernie said. \"Somebody try it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex cuffed Bernie on the head again. You sighed, \"We're in a shithole of a house with no electricity. We can't leave with the helmet without risking somebody seeing us. And since the heist just literally happened, we need to lie low for a while. Technology like this isn't missed for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Jake.\" Amie said. \"Let's stash the helmet under the floorboards of this house, then pick it up a week later and move it to someone's place. Not my own, just in case Olivia decides to interfere and fuck things up.\" She explained, while the boys silently agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" Bernie relented. \"One week. We meet back here. Then the fun starts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

During the daytime, and on nights when you aren't planning or executing crimes, you four don't see each other much. Amie has her secretary job, you do menial work and short-term projects that you find on Craigslist, Alex hangs out at the public library, and Bernie is... Bernie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your satisfaction, the morning news caught wind of last night's heist:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Early this morning, the Imaginetech research facility, located on 13th and Barstrode Place, was raided. Julia Sanchez is reporting live at the scene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Marcus. Broken windows, lost supplies, and many questions leave authorities searching for clues. At 12:34 am this morning, security cameras picked up footage of two hooded figures entering the research facility and leaving just 6 minutes afterwards, with bags full of Imaginetech items. The company has declined to provide details as to the items in question, but corporate spokesperson Jessica Keene is remaining positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anything, this crime reminds us to be on the lookout, both inside and outside our organization.\" Keene said to PRFZ news this morning. \"Imaginetech produces some of the most innovative and advanced security systems in the world. We have reason to believe that these criminals had received help from one of our employees in getting into the facility. We are currently investigating the issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Composite rendering from security camera footage suggests that the two criminals are most likely young men, between the ages of 16 and 24. If you have any information that could help authorities resolve this case, please call your silent witness program immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNews of the heist also hit newspapers, but thankfully it was buried beneath larger, more controversial stories. It was a hot news cycle, which meant that the public was distracted on other things. Law enforcement was another matter, but you felt confident in your group's safety for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the following few weeks, Amie managed to sell off most of the pieces of junk and items for a nice profit. Anything that bore the Imaginetech logo was melted down; Alex converted all metallic items into bars and alloys, to be sold to contractors and industrial parks looking for cheap scrap with no questions asked. This was the procedure, and the four of you had become efficient in both dispersing and disbursing. It paid the bills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing bothering you was Olivia, Amie's ex-girlfriend. You hadn't heard any updates since the initial news coverage, so whatever happened next was kept pretty quiet. Doubtless, a security company suffering from a security breach would want to sweep a story like this under the rug, no matter how they could spin it. Why were they producing a reality-changing helmet? Why was it so easy to break in to their facility that night? What if Amie's assessment of Olivia was wrong, and she turns you all in? These questions nagged at your brain for each of the next seven days, but there wasn't much you could do about it. Time passed slowly, yet the same questions remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week drew to a close, you had heard nothing from your comrades and were beginning to feel paranoid. You had also begun to experience very weird dreams, which partially fueled the paranoia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery night, the dreams were the same. In a fog, you recall waking up in a bright, sanitized room. It wasn't a hospital, but it looked like... the inside of the Imaginetech facility. You recall feeling very weak and your head feeling heavy in the dream, with shadowy visions of people looming above you, mumbling in and out of earshot. Every night, this dream began the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was the end of the week. Time to regroup with your buddies and find out more about the news, the heist, the helmet, and anything else you had missed.<br>\r\nYou glanced around yourself at the empty street before you; it was night time again, and the milk-yellow streetlights showed nobody else around. You entered the abandoned house and were greeted by Amie, Bernie, and Alex, who were already there and retrieving the helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jake. How was your week?\" Amie asked nonchalantly, taking out a wad of cash and extending it out to you. You took the bills and replied, \"Lousy. Wondered if you all were alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright? I'm better than alright!\" Bernie exclaimed, turning around to reveal a brand new smartphone in his hand. \"I don't normally approve of consumerism, but I had to splurge. This thing is sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that phone can track your location, right?\" You said. \"What's the matter with you? Do you want the police to come snooping around here, catching us in the dark with our pants down like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's paranoid.\" Alex said simply, holding the shiny helmet in his brutish hands. \"Don't worry about it, Jake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not paranoid!\" You retorted. \"Can we please get out of here and go somewhere low-key? How about your flat, Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" He answered. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alex's flat, like Alex himself, was of a simple and Spartan design. There was a table, two beds (one for Bernie), a refrigerator, and the bathroom. That was it. If you asked Bernie, he's say nothing more was needed. Alex would agree, albeit for entirely different reasons. Their flat was located about 10 minutes away by car, the same rusted junkpile you used for the heist in fact. After parking in the lot, Alex and Bernie examined their surroundings before giving you and Amie the go-ahead to bring in the Imaginetech materials. Amie carried the wires, plugs, and electric cables in a small cardboard box; you carried the VirtuSim 3000 helmet in its metallic case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up the stairs to Alex's flat, you laid the case down on the bed and sat down. There was a question you had been meaning to ask the two burglars, which was bothering you lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bernie, Alex, can I ask you guys a quick question?\" You said, while Amie was unwrapping the cables and inserting them into the VirtuSim 3000. \"Alex, when you were breaking into the display case holding the VirtuSim 3000, did you notice a bright room anywhere on the floor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex rubbed his beard for a moment. \"Yeah, there was a room like that. It was --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next to a framed poster showing a world map?\" You interrupted him. Bernie spun around. Even Amie took her eyes off the helmet and raised her eyebrows at the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there was a map. How did you know?\" Bernie answered quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did the map say, 'Future Locations of Imaginetech, 2035?' And was there a water cooler on the opposite side of the map, inside the bright room?\" You continued, a chill running down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck,\" Bernie muttered. \"I-I-I don't know. Maybe there was a water cooler. I honestly can't remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the deal, Jake?\" Amie said, her voice emitting equal parts curiosity and concern. \"How are you --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't explain,\" You interrupted again. \"Somehow, the dream that I have been experiencing all week is giving me insight into the layout of the Imaginetech facility. I don't know how this started, or why. But I'm certain that if I go to sleep again tonight, I'll have the same dream again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause filled the room with silence. Alex shrugged his immense shoulders. \"You're just feeling paranoid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Bernie agreed, \"I mean, every office has a water cooler, right? It's probably just a coincidence. The map thing could be your overactive imagination. It's nothing to stress about, Jake. Just shut your damn mouth and don't lose your head over the heist. That's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well said.\" Amie nodded conclusively, although you weren't sure that she sounded as confident as Bernie or Alex. \"In the meantime, I've got this VirtuSim 3000 powered up and working. I know how to work the controls. Who wants to go first? I mean, who wants to try out the helmet first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you can Ames.\" Alex said. \"You know how to use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but I get to use it second! What do you plan on simulating for yourself, Ames? I'm going to be, like, a movie star or a political revolutionary! Or a motherfuckin' astronaut, with lasers and...\" Bernie prattled away, Alex telling him to shut up all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...\" Amie glanced downward, her eyes deep in concentration. \"I think... I want to be a boy. Just for the simulation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A boy?\" Bernie squawked. \"A boy! That's a dumb idea. Guys are awesome, don't get me wrong, but this is the VirtuSim 3000 here. Think outside the box a little! You could try out all kinds of things, like ......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernie's voice trailed off as he saw the finality in Amie's eyes. This was something more than a gag for her; all her life Amie had imagined what being a boy was like. Now, with this device, a simulated reality like that could be possible. If the helmet delivered on its promises, it could give Amie an opportunity that good looks and a cunning mastermind brain could not give her. Bernie saw this, and despite being a low-life criminal thug, he respected her wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I got next turn.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you go third, and I'll go next?\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Aww, fine, I'll go third.\" Bernie folded his arms petulantly. \"If this thing works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amie tucked in her hair, lowered the helmet over her head, and laid down on the bed. The glass visor slid over her face and she closed her eyes. For a long while, she laid still on the bed, her chest rising and falling slowly with each breath taken. The only sound was the low humming of the machine, its many cords and cables sticking out the back of the helmet and leading into the electrical socket on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Bernie, and Alex took turns looking out the window, patrolling the apartment complex, and generally staving off the impending sense of boredom. There was no way to communicate with Amie while she was experiencing the simulation, which meant there was no way to know if she was doing well or not. In fact, the manual did not describe how to operate the simulation itself, just how to set up the conditions to start the simulation. You were unsure how long a simulation was supposed to last. Would Amie remain there, lying paralyzed on the bed, for hours? Days? Longer than that? There was no way to know for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, you had fallen asleep. The dream you had was much like the others this week. It began with a bright, sanitized room. Your head felt heavy and groggy, and unidentifiable figures hovered over you. They mumbled to themselves. You think you saw an outline of a clipboard at one point. Against the wall was that water cooler, and somehow you knew that outside the room was that framed map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a dream where sensory perceptions were all foggy and distorted, yet you could remember them even after waking up. It was like seeing and not seeing at the same time. Hearing and not hearing. Shadows, ghosts of the dream lingering with you beyond waking up from that dream. It was surreal, even though it was only a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up, shielding your hands from the blinding sunlight pouring in through the windows. It was daytime, and Alex and Bernie were awake as well. They had gotten sleep last night too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmie was lying still as a statue on the bed, nothing but her breathing indicating that she was still alive. The helmet continued humming to itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you guys think we should unplug the helmet?\" Bernie mumbled. \"I mean, she's been laying there for the last eleven hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked dumbly at the bed and shrugged. You replied, \"I think we should let her continue the simulation. Who knows what could happen if we cut it off too soon? We could damage the helmet, and Ames too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou three agreed on a hard limit of 2 more hours before pulling the plug. So you all waited some more, eating a light snack in lieu of breakfast. Soon, the 2 hours approached. It was now close to mid-morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gotta do this sometime.\" Alex said. He reached his gargantuan arms out toward the helmet, when suddenly Amie's body rose to life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped up the visor and took off the helmet. The helmet stopped humming and ceased to shine so brightly, returning to a normal, silver-white hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmie glanced around the room for a second, looking down at her body, squeezing her hands, her breasts, her thighs. Something was definitely wrong, but what?<br>\r\nAmie looked up at you, her eyes wide with alarm. \"What the fuck is going on?\" She said in a deeper voice than usual. \"Where's my dick? The hell am I in a chick's body for?\" She scrambled up from the bed, took a few steps, and stumbled over herself and almost fell over. You rushed forward to catch her, holding her tightly while Alex and Bernie rushed to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember who you are?\" Bernie asked incredulously. \"You're Amie Dallah, you're 19 years old and work as a secretary. You're a lesbian, granted, but you've been this way your whole life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmie gasped, her body shivering in your embrace. After a few seconds, she calmed down. \"I am... I... I remember now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you breathed a big sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really thought I was the boy in the simulation for a second.\" Amie smiled weakly, as you let her go and she paced around the room, recollecting her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I knew it, I knew it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmie gulped down a glass of water, adjusted her top, and sat down on the bed. You, Bernie, and Alex stood by, awaiting the full story about Amie's experience with the simulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first thing that happened after I put on the helmet was I immediately blacked out.\" Amie explained. \"Like the way a computer reboots if you restart it. Then, a few options came on my visual screen, they just faded in from the black. I don't know how the VirtuSim 3000 knew what I wanted, but it interacted at the same speed that I was thinking. As I discarded some choices in my mind, they vanished just as quickly from the screen. I narrowed down my options until I got to what I wanted: reliving my high school years as a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I subconsciously made this decision, I found myself in a new home, with new parents, in a new location, in a school I had never heard of. I'm not sure if it exists in real life, but it seemed real to me, in that simulation. Anyway, I was in a boy's body, with memories and preferences to match throughout that identity's life. I also had my own personality and memories, so it was something of a balancing act to maintain both as I went through high school. That's right, I experienced four years of high school in about 13 hours. It's just like being in that Leonardo DiCaprio movie, remember that? I made new friends, did new activities, played sports, and had a great time. I even had a girlfriend, with the added benefit of being the man in the relationship... let's leave it at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As time went on, I became more accustomed to my new identity. I found it harder and harder to recall the 'old' me, the real me. I tried recording my thoughts and personality in a diary, but by that time most of my old life was overridden by the new life. By the time I graduated from high school, I had forgotten most of my identity as Amie Dallah. The simulation became my reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was, until I started having weird dreams. Night after night, I had recurring images of lying on a bed in an apartment. I didn't know what it meant, but I sensed that there were others in the room as well. I could pick up sharply on some details but not others. I couldn't control what I was dreaming about, and this upset me -- my simulated identity. Then, I went to sleep one night and woke up here, back in Alex's flat with you three. As I awakened, my memories returned to me like being struck by an ocean wave, inundated with reality. And that's my story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what a tale!\" Bernie laughed. \"We thought you were in a fucking coma or something. We were just about to pull the plugs, too! Glad to hear that everything worked out okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm not sure if I'd do a simulation again.\" Amie said, glancing back at the helmet. \"You know, the aftereffect is a lot like smoking salvia. It can fuck you up, but the trip is unforgettable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were focused on a different part of Amie's story, however. \"Ames, how real did your dreams seem to you? Because that's strikingly similar to what I've been experiencing lately...\" Your voice trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's really strange.\" Amie said. \"Jake, there is one way to test what you're thinking. And I think it's the only way you'll know for sure.\" She picked up the helmet and handed it to you. \"Try the simulation for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you decide?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It emitted a mesmerizing silvery shine, thanks to the early morning sunlight pouring through the bedroom window. Although the VirtuSim 3000 was just a prototype, its potential could be incredible. The ability to simulate reality, any reality, has been sought after by scientists for ages. For the longest time, its powers never made it beyond books, movies, academic discussions, or blueprints. If the helmet actually worked, it might be worth more than money can buy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what if it didn't work? Amie ended her simulation by falling asleep one day, but nothing that she said indicated she chose to break it off at that particular time. She had laid inert on the bed for 13 straight hours and covered 4 years of time in between. Would that rate be the same for you? What if you cannot wake up from the simulation, or you forget who you are like Amie temporarily did? What if the police raid Alex's flat during your simulation? Using Imaginetech's research would be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the theft committed just the week before. You don't know if you can rely on your friends to rescue you from the simulation in time. They could bail out and leave you alone with the cops. They could unplug the helmet during the simulation; you hesitate to think about how that would affect your mind. While the upside potential for the VirtuSim 3000 is great, so are the risks and consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well are you gonna do it or not?\" Bernie folded his arms. \"Man up and fucking put it on. Alex and me didn't steal it for nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Here goes nothing!\" You snapped, lowering the helmet over your head. You gazed at the glass visor covering your eyes and obscuring your vision. A low humming began and rumbled within your ears. Then, you blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision began to return. From a blur, you started to recognize a bright, white room, almost like that of a hospital. A hand holding a clipboard floated above you. There were hushed voices and the sound of shoes scuffling against the floor, intermixed with the beeping from electronic devices and the decompressing of a respirator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glass visor retracted upward. You blinked, trying to move your arms and legs but feeling bound tight by the extra-long bed you laid upon. Your head felt heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alpha and beta patterns remain unchanged, sir. The EEG detects no significant difference in amplitude or frequency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why isn't the reintegration process working?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blood pressure: 130 over 85.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Mark! Damn it, we kept her engaged for too long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vital signs read a positive; neural kinetics, positive; neural remapping, negative. Structural imaging of the brain detects no abnormalities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia, remove the IV's and administer a sedative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oscillatory activity is stabilizing. The process is almost complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this mean, Thomas? What do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sedative administered, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we wait.

What you assumed was the VirtuSim 3000 had been removed from your head, allowing you to rotate your neck to look around the room. The room was indeed the same as the one in your dreams. You were alone, accompanied by a low-key beeping sound and an engraved logo of the Imaginetech company attached to the opposite wall. No longer strapped down to the bedding, you try to get up but feel rather weak. Just then, a young woman dressed in a white apron entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you awake, sleepyhead?\" She chirped, a smile plastered on her face. She sat down on the bed, studying you silently. \"Can you tell me your name? Mine is Olivia Lawrence, I'm the intern here at Imaginetech. Do you remember that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jake Watson, and I ain't saying nothing.\" You said but immediately grabbed your neck and coughed, hearing a high-pitched husky tone come out of your mouth. \"What's wrong with my voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is wrong.\" Olivia replied gently. \"You need some time to remember, to get your mind re-acclimated. I'm going to fetch Mr. Rhodes, if you need anything just touch that button on the desk next to the bed.\" She stood up and turned to leave the room. Was this the same Olivia who was Amie's girlfriend? The stoolie who gave up her employee badge to allow your group to enter the Imaginetech facility? Why was she still with the company instead of being fired? Did she inform the company about everything and ruin your plans? Is that how you wound up in this bed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you contemplated how your friends could have backstabbed you and turned you in to the authorities, a well-dressed Black man entered the room. He was wearing a beige suit jacket and tie, with thick-rimmed spectacles. He looked to be in his sixties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\" He said, not looking at you directly but instead at a binder, leafing through the pages and sighing. He scratched his bald head, walked over to a cabinet, and retrieved a handheld mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may want to use this.\" He added simply, extending the mirror out to you. You reached up to take it, noticing that your arm was slender and hairless, with a bit of stretchy skin and fat where your biceps should be. Your wrist and fingers were bonier and more wrinkled than normal, with a diamond wedding ring fit taught around one finger. Your fingernails were topped with a half-inch manicure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising the handheld mirror over your face, you gasped. Staring back at you was the face of a woman. She looked to be in her forties, with signs of crow's feet and wrinkles around the face. Her eyes blinked wetly back at you and revealed brown irises and long lashes. Her lips were full but not plump, she wore earrings and had curly (at the moment frazzled) brown hair. You stuck out your tongue and watched the woman in the mirror do the same. You saw her scratch her nose in the mirror and felt your nose get scratched as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is going on!\" You bellowed, the same husky voice coming out as before. \"I'm a fuckin' woman, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grimaced at your exclamations before sighing again, seemingly lost in thought. You continued, \"Are you gonna answer me or not? Fuck! Get me out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not going to happen. Not right now, at least.\" The man replied. \"I'm Eldon Rhodes, the founder and CEO of Imaginetech. I got here as soon as I can, and I felt responsible for providing you with answers on the condition that this conversation doesn't leave this building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat chance of that asshole!\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whether or not you comply is, quite simply, outside your ability to decide.\" Eldon Rhodes continued. \"We're keeping you here for the time being. If you'll be quiet, I can give you some answers as to why you're here and what we do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your real name is Michelle Fife. You are 46 years old, live at 1560 Sanderson Drive, are married to 51-year-old Jason Fife, and have three children, Bobby, Jennifer, and Melissa. You have worked here as a secretary, at Imaginetech, for the past five years. Your family does not know about what has happened. Our legal team will inform them of our situation after they have signed full non-disclosure agreements and waived any arbitration intentions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our situation?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. While you may not believe it, this is your real life. Your identity as Jacob Watson is a simulated life. Jake Watson doesn't exist, he is nothing more than a virtual sprite we used to slot your mind into for the simulation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's bullshit,\" You retorted. \"I have entire memories of my life. My family, my history, my friends--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not exist, and they never will.\" Rhodes interrupted, his face stonelike and sober. \"Most of the environment was created by the VirtuSim 3000. Whatever remained was populated by your own memories, experiences, and knowledge. Some people, like our intern Olivia, remained in the simulation. Others, such as myself, or your two facilitators, Thomas Jackson and Mark De Berg, were not in your simulation. And other characters were either fabricated by your mind or stock sprites we use as NPCs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NPCs?\" You raised an eyebrow. \"Like in a video game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Non-player characters we insert to track and record your simulated location, thoughts, intentions, personality, and safety. Two such characters were Bernie Frederic Skinner and Amie G. Dallah. By taking a simple transformation of their names, we arrive at two topics in Psychology. B. F. Skinner was a behaviorist and early thinker of the subject; the amygdala is an emotion- and memory-retrieving structure of the brain. Since virtual reality is a subject mired in psychology, we believed those names were more than appropriate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Ames and Bernie are...\" You trailed off, not noticing the similarities until now. \"But what about Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex Skinner was a creation of your mind, not the simulation.\" Rhodes replied. \"As I said before, there were elements of both interacting together. Your last name in the simulation was Watson. I will leave that to you to discover its significance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand why this happened.\" You ignored his aside. \"If this is reality, which I'm not saying I agree with, why this simulation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhodes closed the binder and set in on the desk next to your bed. He stood up, walked to the Imaginetech engraving, and folded his arms behind his back. \"Everything you need to know is inside that binder. But the short story is this: We needed someone to test the security of our facility from burglars. It should be no surprise that Imaginetech leads the nation in innovation, in the development of groundbreaking technology. That is why we constantly receive threats from competitors, stories of attempted burglaries of our warehouses, stories of people trying to bring the company down. The VirtuSim 3000 reality helmet was designed for both commercial and security purposes. After we perfect the device, it will jettison our company into profits that the tech world has only ever dreamed of. Earnings that will make Apple, Microsoft, and other giants look like peanuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we have invested in the VirtuSim 3000 and developed one prototype. We needed to test it on someone, and we also needed to test our security at this facility. Thanks to you, Michelle, we accomplished both tasks and have much more work to do. By placing you in a simulation as a shiftless burglar, we have gathered more data on how to make our building secure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face flushed at the CEO's not-so-gracious title. \"Shiftless burglar? Fuck you too then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense taken.\" Rhodes continued, pacing the floor of the room. \"Unfortunately, and against the advice of our technicians, we left you in the simulation for too long. Your mind and the mind of 'Jake Watson' overlapped. You forgot who you were. This is a terrible circumstance and one that leaves the company with a lot of uncertainty. You already know too much, and with the personality of 'Jake Watson' overriding the personality of 'Michelle Fife', we cannot know how much we can trust you. And for that, I apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You apologize?\" You shrieked, your tone sounding far more bitchy than intended. \"I've just had my life stolen from me, placed in an older woman's body, and I'm the one who can't be trusted? This can't be real! Just give me back the VirtuSim 3000 and I'll wake up again to my real life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but that is out of the question.\" Rhodes answered tersely. \"We have stored the helmet in a secure location. Thanks to the simulation, we are confident that you will be unable to access it. Such is the precaution we must take against thieves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do I do now?\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though you were enjoying the brilliant sunshine along with the slightly cooling breeze that swept off of the sea, you were in a sour mood, due to the anniversary. It was two years ago today when you were trapped in here, this damn virtual world. And if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, your \u201ccaptor\u201d decided to have the last laugh and trap you in an anthro cow body. Truth be told, you had gotten a bit used to the whole thing with the little horns, floppy ears, long whip like tail, and silky black and white fur. The fact that you were so incredibly fat and had breasts more than twice as large as your head as well as hips that were each wider than most people\u2019s outstretched arms were \u2013 in combination \u2013 an issue, but it was far from the worst thing about your situation. No, that was reserved for the fact that you were enormously pregnant, and the frosting on that particular cake was that this seemed to be a permanent situation considering that you had been pregnant since you were trapped here those two years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to be sure since you didn\u2019t choose this body, nor could you access the personal information \u2013 no, that part was sealed away as well by the person who left you in here \u2013 but it felt like you were forever \u201cblessed\u201d with at least seven unborn children, and they seemed to want you to be uncomfortable as much as possible: whether they were kicking your bladder or other organs, choosing to be as active as possible when you were trying to rest, or the lot of them just stretching out and further straining your already overtaxed skin. And then there was other times where you would sit back and lovingly caress your swollen stomach with a maternal smile etched across your chubby face, likely another twist perpetrated by whoever trapped you here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with your body the way it was, you kept reminding yourself it could always be worse. At least you were only trapped in the Chatroom, you could have been trapped in one of the hardcore sex programs or an ultra dangerous fantasy or sci-fi world or something. At least here, you could have a semblance of a normal life, plus you still had some of the bonus control over the simulation that you had given yourself, though you were still unsure if that was planned by whoever left you in here, or your programming had been good enough to leave some trace behind. In either case, using your control over the simulation granted you limitless funds for use within the program, as well as a lavish home in one of the best regions of this digital world: the weather was always pleasant with only occasional light showers, the views were incredible, the food and drinks were simply divine, parties were almost always going on somewhere in the area, and almost any desire could be satisfied at a moment\u2019s whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stiff breeze swept from across the water, making the trees shiver and ruffling your fur. Hooking your arms behind your head, you leaned all the way back into your lounge chair, blocking the view of the sea with your immense curves. A lone fluffy cloud drifted across the sky, briefly blotting out the sun. You closed your eyes as the cloud continued on its way, letting the sunlight fall on you again, but another shadow soon fell across you, one that was much closer in origin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d a voice called from right next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes to get a look at who was addressing you.</span></div></div>",

The one standing over you \u2013 Vanessa \u2013 was one of your living anthro servants, a busty snow leopard in her particular case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Excuse me\u2019 what?\u201d you prompted, a bit of annoyance evident in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa\u2019s eyes widened before she bowed her head, blurting out, \u201cMy deepest apologies, mistress. Excuse me, <i>mistress</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d letting the slight edge to your voice fade away. You were still going to punish her later for that slip of her tongue, and you suspected that she had done it intentionally in order to get that result. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner is ready, my lady, as you requested,\u201d lifting her head slightly and turning those azure eyes your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, grabbing your now empty drink glass, and motioning for her to help you up. There was a brief look of excitement running across Vanessa\u2019s face before she hid it away, then grabbed a hold of your arms and helped pull you to your feet. The fact that she \u201cslipped\u201d and fell against your body momentarily didn\u2019t go unmissed, but you let it slide for now, knowing that the leopardess was one of your servants most likely to push the limits of what she could do knowing exactly what would come of doing so. Following the long fluffy tail before you, she moved just ahead of you, heading for the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, you looked over the small number of other people seated at the table, a table more suited for a grand feast, rather than the small group of people clustered at the one end. Truth be told, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for most of your servants to not be online at the same time, it was just an effect of them having lives outside the simulation as well as the ability to leave it. However, every last one of them had agreed that whenever they were online, they were yours to do with as you wished, and you made use of that promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of leaving the simulation made you briefly think about what must have happened to your body after your imprisonment. You shuddered as you forced that thought away, unable to face it. Instead, you focused on the smiling faces looking your way. They were soon joined by the trio that made up your current kitchen staff, each pushing a cart loaded with a mouthwatering pile of food and drinks. Since you were never sure how many would be online at meal time, you told the kitchen staff to always make sure there was more than enough for whoever was present when they started, just in case someone else showed up in the meantime. It almost never happened, so there was often too much for everyone present. The surplus never went to waste though, some of your servants tempting you with much of it, though a few of them were often left to overeat themselves, padding their bodies, none of them had ended up anywhere near your size though. This time was no different, though you ended up with the lion\u2019s share of the meal; your stomach expanding further out with all of the food packed away alongside the unborn children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the last spoonful of buttery mashed potatoes was slowly sent down your throat, you requested a belly rub to ease the digestion. Most of your servants \u2013 except for those that were already on their way back to the kitchen with the used dishes \u2013 jumped at the request. Soon, there were more than six pairs of hands tenderly rubbing some portion of your globular stomach, causing more than a couple unladylike belches to escape your mouth. You stopped Vanessa before she could get started though, instead telling her to instead lick your hands and the area around your mouth clean. A short-lived look of regret crossed her face \u2013 almost certainly due to not being able to help with the massage \u2013 but it was quickly replace with one of bliss as she snuggled up close to you and started the oral cleaning. Her tail waved back and forth in lazy curls as she finished with your hands and climbed atop the mountainous swell of your breasts to reach your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet again, she pushed the limits of what you had told her to do, almost kissing you multiple times. It was one thing when you kissed your willing servants, but it was another when one of them started doing it of their own volition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing your arms behind her, you held the leopardess tight against your body, and said with a sharp edge, \u201cLooks like someone\u2019s being a naughty kitty, just like earlier when you forgot to call me mistress, and now this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wriggled in your grasp and cried out, \u201cI went too far this time, I admit, but I apologized for not saying that earlier, mistress!\u201d though it was half-hearted at best, mostly confirming that she was again \u201csecretly\u201d wanting your standard response to such a situation.</span></div></div>",

If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, your longtime rival also decided to completely alter your digital avatar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone was the unassuming and rather anonymous standard human figure. In its place was a form that was already attracting plenty of attention. Enormous breasts that would have been backbreakers in the real world were front and center. While down below, you now possessed wide hips and a round rump that almost demanded to be used and abused. You had a hint of muscle and toning, but it was all but hidden under the numerous curves that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in the more extreme erotic sides of the internet. Wrapped around these curves were tiny scales each looking like a shard of obsidian polished to a permanent shine.

Her blouse had the first several buttons undone, exposing much of a pair of breasts that were almost but not quite a match for yours. While the low riding and hip hugging shorts showed that her hips and rump did beat yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t seen you around here before, and trust me, I would remember you,\u201d she said with a sultry purr that managed to overcome the music pulsing through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bovine beauty fluttered her eyelashes, and even in the dim light within Temptation, you could see that her eyes were as gorgeous as the rest of her. A quick shake of your head, and you managed to get your brain back in gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst time, heard from a friend that this was the place to go,\u201d you said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded in agreement before sliding onto a seat next to you. As she did so, you noticed that she lacked the distinctive collar worn by those that came to the club only wanting to be dominated. Speaking off\u2026there went one of them: looking a bit like Raven from the Teen Titans getting paraded around on all fours by her master, and her without even a stitch of clothing except for the collar and the leash leading to his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a quick glance out the side of your eye to see how the cow was reacting to the scene. To your surprise, she didn\u2019t seem interested in the least, unlike most of the other club patrons. In fact, she seemed rather disgusted with the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention was called back to the bar by the arrival of your drink. The bovine ordered a Sidecar from the Hoenheim bartender as well, so he returned to his work. Sipping your drink, you thought about what you should do about the beautiful bovine.</span></div></div>",

It seemed like this cow was looking better and better with every passing moment. Turning your gaze back, you saw the submissive Raven lying down at her master\u2019s feet as he got up close and personal with a She-Hulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about you?\u201d she asked out of the blue, making you return your attention to her luminous eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head to get back in gear, \u201cHow about me what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you prefer complete and utter submission like a dog rolling over for a belly rub, or would you rather your \u2018pet\u2019 fight back a bit instead?\u201d As she spoke, she leaned forward, resting her chin in her hand. The way she did it meant that she was all but thrusting her cleavage under your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite yourself, you gulped loud enough that you were sure she could hear it. You could feel a blush spreading up your neck as well. You hoped that she wouldn\u2019t be able to see it due to the lighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to keep your voice steady, you answered, \u201cOh, a bit of fight is always nice, at first at least. It makes the prize all the sweeter when you have to work for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, you\u2019re a girl after my own heart. And you\u2019re right about it being sweeter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer drink arrived, putting a hold on any further insight into her mind. Rather than sipping, she gulped down almost half of the glass in a single go. While you watched in awe, you let your mind drift again. Bringing her low and pinning her beneath your thumb would be wonderful and oh so sweet. Now, it was just a matter of how\u2026</span></div></div>",

But there can be only one master in this relationship, so again: how do you suppose we solve this little impasse?\u201d She stared right into your eyes, swirling the rest of her drink around the glass with a casual grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel your blush blazing ever brighter across your neck and cheeks. Without taking her eyes off of yours, she upended her glass and drained the other half as fast as the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could make it a game,\u201d you suggested, matching her steady gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow snorted, \u201cWhat, Monopoly or something? That\u2019s how you want to decide which of us becomes the slave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your turn to shake your head. \u201cNot exactly. I was thinking of something more like\u2026maybe whichever of the two of us was better at guessing personal info about the other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cocked her head, still swirling her drink. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea, I suppose. But are you sure that you want to risk yourself on something like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and responded with a bit of wit. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have some fun either way,\u201d grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned the grin with a sly twist, \u201cYou aren\u2019t wrong there. All right, if you\u2019re sure.\u201d She gulped down the rest of her drink, setting the glass down on the bar. \u201cThis place even provides something that I think will work just fine\u2026\u201d she said, swiping a finger across the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon a digital panel appeared from thin air. Looking it over, you saw that it was a form contract, one dealing with setting the terms for a master-slave relationship. The bovine slipped her finger down across the panel and new text appeared, filling gaps in the contract. Soon, there was only one blank left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long do you want this little wager to be good for?\u201d she asked, turning her gaze back up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned away, as if you were thinking about it, even though you already knew for sure what you wanted. You spent several moments watching the petplay Raven, her master, and the She-Hulk al retreated towards the private rooms in the back of the club. The She-Hulk was already acting subservient to him, looking to be well on her way to being another conquest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trio left the main room, you turned back to the bovine. \u201cHow about we make it permanent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes went wide for a moment, \u201cAre you sure\u2026absolutely sure that you want to do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and she rocked her head back and forth for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, now you\u2019re getting cold feed\u2026Just imagine the possibilities\u2026\u201d you whispered after leaning close and putting your mouth next to her ear. Meanwhile, you slide your hand down her back, stopping with your fingertips sneaking into the waistband of her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lip and screwed her eyes shut, then swiped her finger across the last blank so that it was filled in. You gave her one last teasing huff of breath down her neck before backing off a bit. The two of you then pressed your thumbs to the bottom of the completed contract. The panel warmed beneath your touch before chiming softly and vanishing in a flurry of bits that circled the two of you before vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, let\u2019s get this started. I have big things planed for you,\u201d she said, a bit of her bravado returning.</span></div></div>",

As the two of you made guesses, the other person would reveal each piece if it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bovine surprised you by being rather astute and made far more correct guesses than you had been expecting. She did make a few wrong guesses though, more than she knew in fact because you let her have some of them. It was simple enough to alter your data screen to show that she had been correct even if she hadn\u2019t in truth. It was just as simple to have all the information about her be displayed on a screen that only you could see and use that to make rather more educated guesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having the information at hand, you threw out some guesses you knew to be incorrect to help give her a false sense of success. It worked better than you hoped. Before long, she was all but on the edge of her seat, licking her lips in anticipation of what she was going to do with you. It was time to go for the kill and crush her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed. I never would have thought that you would be able to get my real age correct,\u201d you said while altering the data to show the number she had guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say, you\u2019re easy to read,\u201d the bovine said, sipping at another drink. You lost count of how many she had had, but it was enough that she was starting to look a bit tipsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh is that so?\u201d you said, and then adding dramatic flair, \u201cWe\u2019ll see how easy you are to read.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then propped your head in your hand, drumming your fingers on your chin, staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell come on with it,\u201d she said after a few seconds, a frown curling her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine,\u201d you said, consulting your hidden data screen. You then blurted out, \u201cHow\u2019s your sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was good, you had to admit that. She gave almost no sign that what you asked had hit the mark, but it wasn\u2019t enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to bluster through. \u201cOh, so sorry, I don\u2019t have a sister. That means that is your final incorrect guess, so you lo\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t help but let the corners of your mouth turn up a bit. \u201cI mean the one that became part of your family when your father remarried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight tremor of her lips and her eyes went wide for a moment. \u201cWhat? How could you\u2014?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnow that?\u201d you finished for her. \u201cYou\u2019re easy to read,\u201d echoing her words from just a little bit ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that she didn\u2019t want to be part of your life. It seems that she\u2019s doing rather well for herself in that small town even still though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face paled and her mouth dropped open. Then she looked rather like a fish with her mouth opening and closing like that. All signs of her slight intoxication fled as her gaze continued to bore into you. You kept a placid smile on your face up till the point where \u2013 without another word \u2013 she hopped to her feet and started to walk off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caught her arm and pulled her close. She struggled until you whispered \u201cNow where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAway from you,\u201d she snapped back. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you knew that, but however it was, I want nothing more to do with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s too bad. There is the little matter of our contract though.\u201d You kept a hold on her arm while extending your other hand with a flick. The contract appeared in a whorl of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026that\u2026I\u2026\u201d she started, her mouth again going like a fish gasping for breath. Then screwing her eyes shut, she muttered, \u201cShit.\u201d Taking a deep breath and holding it for a moment, she then said, \u201cFine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I hope you remember our little talk about the fight making the prize sweeter,\u201d you said, releasing her arm to sweep your hand across her stomach and up to heft one of her impressive breasts. The soft warmth yielded so deliciously to your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough her fur, you could see a blush creeping up her neck and into her cheeks. She reached up to try to push your hand away, but it was half-hearted at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten,\u201d she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d you purred back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another flick of your wrist, the contract broke into many little glowing shards. The pieces then reassembled into an intricate and well decorated metal choker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2013? How\u2026?\u201d the cow muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little secret to create something to help you remember,\u201d you responded. A flick of your finger sent the collar whirling through the air till it snapped around her lovely neck. Numb with shock, she didn\u2019t seem to respond at all as you took a tender hold on her arm and started her walking towards the door again. \u201cAs you said before \u2018I\u2019ve big things planed for you\u2019,\u201d you added with a devious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was child\u2019s play to alter the door to connect to your home for a brief time instead of the outside of the club. Stepping through with your new pet, you showed her her new home.</span></div></div>",

Your drink was sat down beside your elbow, and you took a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but\u2014yes.\u201d She huffed and balled up her fists. \u201cWhat I mean, is that we think you\u2019re exactly who we\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d arching an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on, Rose, are you sure that this is the one you want?\u201d the Starfire grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush, Suki. Don\u2019t blow this,\u201d Rose snapped back before turning to you again with a smile, though her lips were pressed into the thinnest of lines. \u201c<i>We</i>\u201d though Suki rolled her emerald eyes at that, \u201cwould like to become your slaves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your drink around without taking your eyes off of either of them. \u201cIs that so?\u201d you responded with a casual air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darker of the pair nodded with a hopeful air about her, while Suki acted much more aloof. The differences between them extended even further. Rose\u2019s digital form was taller than average with a curvy frame. Her outfit was rather fitting as well with the sleeveless leotard and hooded cloak spilling from her shoulders. Suki the Starfire on the other hand was even taller, almost as much as you were, and her body was limber with a hint of muscle showing through. Her outfit was much more typical and revealing with a tube top and microskirt. Both also wore the simple leather collars provided by the club for those that wished to be dominated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat brought you to me then? It looks like you\u2019ve got plenty of other possibilities. Look, that wolf seems to have his eye on you right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose looked back over her shoulder with narrowed eyes, \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026not really our\u2026type.\u201d Turning back to you with that same hope in her eyes, \u201cYou are though! So will you do it, please?\u201d She was all but groveling on her knees at this point. Suki looked on with a frown and wrinkled nose, though you could tell there was a hint of hopefulness about her as well. \u201cYou can do whatever you want with us. It\u2019ll be our pleasure just to be with you\u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut her off by saying, \u201cFine, I\u2019ve come to a decision.\u201d Rose looked ready to cry from joy, but it faltered as you continued. \u201cI\u2019ll accept her,\u201d pointing to Suki, \u201cbut you I\u2019m not so sure about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth started sputtering and trying to talk over each other in shock and surprise. You managed to hear Rose say, \u201cBut why!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved your hand, \u201cIt\u2019ll be entertaining to break her; she doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s totally accepting of what will soon to be her place. You on the other hand are almost putty already, and that doesn\u2019t sound fun at all.\u201d Inwardly, you were smiling at this turn of events, sure that having both of them under your thumb was going to be very pleasurable indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki was fuming, and snapped out, \u201cNo way, we\u2019re a package deal; you have to take both of us or neither of us!\u201d She was acting the part of being a fiery redhead, that was for sure. Rose looked touched that her companion was sticking up for her like that. \"And I don't even want this,\" she muttered, almost as if an afterthought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sipped your drink and made it look as if you were deep in thought. In truth, you already knew how you were going to solve this little issue. \u201cTell you what. I\u2019ll give you a little test, do that and <i>maybe</i> I\u2019ll consider taking you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, of course! I\u2019ll do anything!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay struggled to keep the car under control as it bounced through the rutted snow pack streets. The aging Tesla had come with pre-installed All Weather tires that had been more than adequate to drive it off the lot at Farmer Johne\u2019s New and Used, but were outmatched when pitted against the packed ice ruts the afternoons\u2019 traffic had turned the snow clogged streets into. According to Channel 5 this was \u2018A Snow Storm of Epic Proportions\u2019, weather that demanded a good set of snow tires to be even marginally drivable in. That, and a defroster that worked half decent. Seriously, how hard was it to design an electric that could handle a standard Canadian winter? <br>\r\n  Not that Lindsay was going to do much driving this week-end. Home was a tantalizing four blocks (but probably still a good 15 minutes) away, and once through the front door the next 72 hours would be spent in VR on a server two continents and five time zones away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Lindsay had gotten into Flight-Sim games in a big way since his first encounter with them while You Tube surfing 2 years ago. The thought of being able to use virtual reality to soar through the clouds had resonated in the imagination of the young, single, and boringly plain minimum wage drone who had always had a fascination with aircraft. Already having the basic VR node now prevalent in every modern household installed in the common room, Lindsay lost no time acquiring the proper plug ins and harness accessories needed, and then promptly lost every minute of spare time for the next three months.<br>\r\n  With the basics of flight mastered, Lindsey moved to testing those skills with other VR pilots, both AI and real. Shuttling freight with the various VR airlines quickly grew boring, so it was only natural Lindsay started looking at combat air war simulators. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo months more time lost, and then Lindsay had come across that message while viewing a favorite You Tube channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Calling All Fighter Pilots\u2019 the message had said. \u2018Scramble! Scramble! Every available man and machine is urgently needed to defend our lines and attack the enemy convoys and cities. Your job is to destroy enemy supplies, capture airfields, and move our lines forward to victory.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNovember 1942. The German 6th army\u2019s advance has the Soviet defenders with their backs against the Volga River. The Soviet counter attack, overrunning the 6th army\u2019s flanks surrounding them and cutting off their supplies. Now both sides fight a desperate struggle for to gain control and survive. <br>\r\n Tactical Air Combat Server 12 (Home of the Fighting 75th) is once again hosting its semi annual \u2018Battle for Volgograd\u2019 tournament. Based on the historic Battle of Stalingrad, the tournament is a chance to test your skills both as a pilot and a tactician against other like minded pilots in one of the most realistic air battle simulations to date. <br>\r\n Teams of up to 8 pilots will fly up to 150 missions over a 3 day period. These are not \u2018Dog-fight for Points\u2019 battles. Each mission\u2019s success or failure directly affects the mission following. Let a convoy slip through and the enemy is re-equipped. Leave a tank convoy intact and it will capture a city. You must destroy or capture all targets and enemy resistance in an area to capture that map. The game is not won until all maps are captured or time runs out. <br>\r\n As a single player the only option for Lindsay to play in the tournament lay with making an application to the various wing leaders who had posted vacancies. Lindsay had sent an application to quite a lot of them, with no results. Until today, with only eight hours before the tournament began and 2 hours into the work shift, Lindsay\u2019s phone had beeped with a message that an application had been accepted, and a pilots slot was waiting at Jagdgeschwader 127th <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Finally, after ages of white knuckle driving and more than one \u2018not safe for work\u2019 comment about the actions of the other idiots on the road, Lindsay was finally home. Grabbing a liquid meal replacement out of the fridge took less than a minute.  A quick trip to the powder room to \u2018freshen up\u2019 and don the VR harness took 5 more. Since the next 60 or so hours would be spent under VR, Lindsay made sure the maintenance program was activated, ensuring the physical body would get a rudimentary exercise and feeding. Lindsay would need a good shower afterwards, but wouldn\u2019t starve or suffer bed sores from chafing. A push of the accept button and 2.7milliseconds of mildly disorienting swirling sensations later Lindsay was standing in the virtual entrance hall of Tactical Air Combat Server 12. <br>\r\n  The hall, modeled in the fashion of a large hanger, was set up complete with a desk, flag, and large campaign map pinned to the wall. The hall was also worryingly un-occupied. As Lindsay looked around, trying to figure out how to find the entrance to JG 127, a voice came from directly behind. Lindsay turned, and a short man wearing the uniform of an army corporal saluted, saying simply \u201cIf you will follow me.\u201d, before turning and walking out one of the doors set into the big hanger door at the front of the building.<br>\r\n  Lindsay followed the corporal outside to the sights and sounds of a busy, and air base. Trucks and jeeps roared past, hurrying men and materials to mysterious destinations. Planes flew past overhead. Marching feet and commands echoed in the distance. All the sounds any skilled Foley artist would keep in a folder marked \u2018Air Force Base Noises\u2019 for just such an occasion.<br>\r\n  A jeep waited just outside the door, and it was a brief drive across to another hanger where Lindsay was deposited in front of the office bearing the sign \u2018Jagdgeschwader 127th (Die Wutenden Kuhe)\u2019<br>\r\nJust below that someone had penciled in \u2018Snappy uniforms. Good Beer. Cute Accents.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Passing through the doorway produced the familiar swirling sensation that indicated Lindsay was being transported to yet another section of the server, this one specific to hosting the parts of the program the 127th would be participating in. This time however, when the swirling ended Lindsay was left feeling more disoriented than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed larger, brighter, and the colours seemed more defined than normal. Putting a hand against the wall for balance, Lindsay started to take a deep, steadying breath, which turned into a gasp of surprise at the woman standing directly across the room in front of her. The woman, wearing a blue-grey German duty uniform, seemed startled as well, mirroring Lindsay\u2019s movements and putting a hand to her mouth. In that moment Lindsay memorized this vision of beauty. She was a petite little slip of a girl, maybe 160 to 170 cm tall at the most,. Shapely legs showed below the hem of her calf length skirt. Her long blond hair flowed from under the blue-grey Luftwaffe peak cap in two braids that fell one over each shoulder, reaching half way down the chest. A chest that was putting a severe strain on the buttons of the duty blouse visible under the open jacket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The sound of a chair being pushed back drew Lindsay\u2019s attention. Behind the desk was another woman also dressed in Luftwaffe uniform, this one with insignia that Lindsey guessed indicated she was the flight commander. When the woman came around the desk Lindsay realized who she looked like. The woman\u2019s avatar bore an uncanny resemblance to Heidi Klum.<br>\r\n \u201cFirst Lieutenant Lindsay Anderson, I presume\u201d The woman said crisply extending a hand.<br>\r\n Lindsay\u2019s \u201cYes\u201d  came out as an oddly pitched squeak, possibly attributable to the weird affects from the portal. Fortunately the woman continued as if she hadn\u2019t notice. <br>\r\n\u201cColonel Leslie Von Helgameire, commanding officer. Welcome to the 127th\u201d.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nStruck by her looks, and well aware of the status of women in Nazi Germany, Lindsay stumbled over the response, blurting out \u201cI certainly wasn\u2019t expecting\u2026\u201d and trailed off, not sure how to put the statement without sounding sexist. True,woman pilots were rare on the German side, let alone as commanding officers. But this was a virtual reality game, so things like the gender bias of the Third Reich didn\u2019t really apply.  <br>\r\n  \u201cYes, I know. I don\u2019t think the guy who programmed these avatars has had a date in his life\u201d Colonel Helgameire smiled, completely misinterpreted the cause of Lindsay\u2019s confusion and taking the conversation in a different direction. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure his inspiration comes from commercials for German beer and keying \u2018Fraulein\u2019 into wikapedia\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay turned back towards the other woman and got a shock. Standing across from the door was not another woman but instead was a full length mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As if in a trance, Lindsay realized it was HER reflection that was visible. Open mouthed, Lindsay stared, thinking only that there had to be some mistake. Without any conscious thought her hands crept up and cupped her breasts, bouncing them a couple of times, getting a feel for just how large they were.<br>\r\n  \u201cHoly crap\u201d, she said, not meaning to say it out loud.<br>\r\nShe looked up and saw the Colonel looking back at her, a bemused expression on her face.<br>\r\n  \"I take it you\u2019re not used to such, shall we say, ample assets\"?<br>\r\n \u201cYou got that right\u201d Lindsay replied, unable to take her eyes off her reflection. \u201cFor Gods sake, I was a man before this\u201d!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean\u201d, the colonel said with a wry smile, \u201cI\u2019ll admit. I wasn\u2019t much to look at myself. Like I said. The kid\u2019s probably never had a date in his life. Don\u2019t worry too much about it. Once you're in your flight suit the girls will be no problem at all\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about\u201d Lindsay meant to say, but before she could get a word out the colonel started towards a door at the back of the office.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on\u201d she called back over her shoulder as she left the room, \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you to the rest of the flight\u201d.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Most of the hanger space was taken up by a Heinkel HE-111, the open access panels and scattered tools surrounding the twin engine bomber indicating some sort of maintenance work was in progress. The colonel lead Lindsay passed the aircraft nose to a group of five women lounging in the chairs scattered in front of an operations map. As the colonel approached one of the women noticed them and snapped to attention with a crisp \u201cHerr Colonel\u201d and a salute. The rest of the women copied the actions with varying degrees of enthusiasm, most getting immediately to their feet and giving a somewhat sloppy salute of their own, although one woman declined to get up, electing instead to give a lazy wave from her chair that could maybe pass as a salute if you were feeling generous. The colonel seemingly took no notice of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies, listen up. I\u2019d like to meet our latest recruit. This is First Lieutenant Lindsay Anderson\u201d.  The colonel turned to each of the women as she introduced them. \u201cLindsay, meet Captain Beverly Opperman, Captain Colleen Landsdown, Captain Linda Bray-Lewis, Captain Lorraine Peterson, and lastly the lazy ass over there is Major Lana-Raye Modsley, your squadron leader\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Each girl in turn acknowledged her introduction with the same varying style salute they had greeted the arrival of the colonel with. As they were introduced Lindsay was struck by how similar in appearance they all were. All were wearing the same duty uniform as Lindsay, although given the game was supposed to replicate the feel of an air force squadron that was to be expected. What wasn\u2019t expected was that all the women had the same slim build Lindsay had just seen in the office mirror. All had their strawberry blond hair done up in pigtails of varying lengths and styles. All had the same pale creamy skin and bright blue eyes. And all had the same need for double re-enforced blouse buttons. There were just enough variations in height and facial features that Lindsay felt that, given time, she might be able to keep track of out just who was who. For now though, the name tag on the uniform jacket was the biggest help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The whole squad was unmistakably female. Lindsay wondered if this had anything to do with her current situation, and also wondered just how she could broach the subject. <br>\r\n\u201cColonel, she started slowly, \u201cI, ah, noticed that the squad seems to be, ah, well\u2026\u201d Dam\u2019d. Lindsay had never been good at awkward situations, and was having trouble trying to formulate the question of how she had wound up here in an all female squad. Unfortunately, the colonel suddenly looked at her watch and cut her off in mid sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cSorry Lindsay, it looks as though our last pilot is on her way here. I\u2019ll let you get to know the others while I go I fetch her\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The woman wearing the name tag of \u2018Opperman\u2019 came over to where Lindsay stood with her mouth still open, the interrupted question on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cSo I bet you were going to say how we all looked the same, right\u201d? Beverley asked. Without waiting for Lindsay to reply she continued \u201cIt\u2019s the avatar base models. The127th  was only created a couple of weeks back, and the programmer only managed to get two base models in before the application deadline. The Colonel got the Heidi one because she\u2019s in charge. The rest of us, well. As you can see\u201d.  She gestured around to the rest of the squad. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just like twins. They may look the same at first but after a while you can tell them apart\u201d.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  \u201cOr Chinese people\u201d the woman with the Tag \u2018Landsdown\u2019 added without being asked. \u201cThey\u2019re just as hard to tell apart\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cThank you Colleen\u201d Beverly said irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cAnd Japanese. Never can tell one from another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Beverly rolled her eyes, seemingly far more irritated that the simple remark warranted. \u201cYes Colleen\u201d, she sniped \u201cThank you for also adding that timely and completely non-racist observation to our conversation\u201d.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  \u201cYou know me\u201d, the woman addressed as Colleen returned as if nothing was amiss \u201cI call it like I see it\u201d.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  \u201cThen you should try calling it a little less offensive next time\u201d. Beverly snapped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cOoohh\u201d Colleen teased \u2019A little touchy today, aren\u2019t we. This wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with your recent sensitivity training, would it\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cThat has nothing to do with this\u201d Beverly replied, more angrily than Lindsay thought the situation warranted \u201cI\u2019m just asking you to show a little respect\u201d! With this Beverly stalked off and threw herself angrily into one of the folding chairs at the far end of the room. The chair creaked alarmingly but thankfully didn\u2019t collapse<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cGod\u201d, Colleen snickered, \u201cShe is so easy to get a rise out of\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t tease her about that\u201d The woman wearing the tag \u2018Modsley\u2019 lectured sternly. \u201cYou know how upset she is about the whole thing\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Colleen rolled her eyes. \u201cShe needs to grow a thicker skin. I\u2019m just trying to help with that\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s teasing and then there\u2019s this shit. This event is supposed to be fun and here we are not even half an hour in to it and you\u2019ve already got her bawling her eyes out\u201d.<br>\r\n  \u201cShe\u2019s not crying\u201d Colleen protested, looking over to where Beverly sat with her face buried in her hands. \u201cWell, not that much\u201d She continued uncertainly, seeing Beverly\u2019s shoulders shaking with sobs. \u201cOh shit\u201d Colleen was quiet for a couple of moments, then softly spoke \u201cOkay. Maybe you\u2019re right and I crossed a line. Or two. I\u2019ll.. I\u2019ll talk to her\u201d. With that she stood and walked softly over to where Beverly was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cWhat was that about\u201d? Lindsay asked as she watched he walk away. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n  At the far end of the row of chairs Colleen was trying to put a comforting hand on a shoulder whose owner wanted nothing to do with her. Lana-Raye watched the interplay for a couple of moments before explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cIn real life Bev works in customer service. Crappy job but it\u2019s all she has for now. And in spite of all the shit she has to deal with she never let it get to her. Until now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSo what happened\u201d? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  At the end of the row of chairs was Colleen was kneeling, finally having got Beverly to stop pushing her hand away every time she put it on Beverly\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cA month ago some customer wanted to do something that wasn\u2019t allowed and when Bev wouldn\u2019t help they played the race card on her. Typical knee jerk management jumped and sent her for a mandatory two weeks of cultural sensitivity training. Since it was the result of a complaint it was deemed an \u2018unpaid necessary absence\u2019. They actually threatened to fire her over it if she didn\u2019t go. Never mind that she\u2019s a minority herself and one of the nicest, knowledgeable, and most helpful people you\u2019ll ever meet, and that she was following their own bloody written procedure.  As for Colleen, well, she likes to take a tease too far. She\u2019s a nice enough person, but her brain sometimes forgets to pay attention to her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  At the far end of the chairs the two women were hugging at this point, so Lindsay decided it was as good a time as any to try and get answers to her own situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cSo\u201d, Lindsay began, gesturing to the rest of the women in the room. \u201cI take it this is an all female squadron\u201d.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  \u201cYep\u201d Lana-raye said casually, deciding that the passing crises had been a minor one and flopping back down in her own. \u201cColonel Helgameire\u2019s idea actually. She had a bad experience with her last group and figured she could do better in a less misogynistic environment\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, if that\u2019s the case I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here. I\u2019m not\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cHerr Colonel\u201d! came a shout from one of the other girls.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n The colonel had returned, triggering another round of sloppy salutes. She was followed closely by an unsurprisingly pony tailed woman in a pilot\u2019s uniform.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cGirls. I\u2019d like to introduce to you the last recruit for our squad. This is First lieutenant Addison Garlander. Addison, this is Captain Linda Bray-Lewis, Captain Lorraine Peterson, First lieutenant Lindsay Anderson, The weepy one over there is Captain Beverly Opperman, the damp one with her arm around her is Captain Colleen Landsdown, and that unmovable lump in the chair there is Major Lana-Raye Modsley. She\u2019ll be your squadron leader, if she ever get\u2019s around to moving her butt out of that chair.<br>\r\nOnce again each girl gave the new arrival the same salute as earlier; even Beverly managed a weak if somewhat soggy smile and flip of the hand. Lindsay was surprised to see Addison return each salute with a snappy, well executed salute of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The colonel clapped her hands for attention. \u201cAlright people. Lecture time. Game starts in 20 minutes so have a seat and listen up\u201d. <br>\r\nThe room filled with rumbles, squeaks, and groans as chairs were rearranged and occupied. After the noise settled the colonel began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The colonel stood in front of the operations map where all the chairs could see her. <br>\r\n  \u201cAs you know\u201d she said in a clear voice that would be at home in a lecture theatre, \u201cThis is the sixth tournament that Combat Server 12 has hosted. I\u2019m sure you all read the tournament rules, but I want to go over a few of the major points just to make sure we\u2019re all on the same page. That and there are also a few last minute announcements to pass on\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cAnnouncement One: Because of the number of registrants for the tournament, server administration has adjusted some of the settings. Game time to Real time ratio is now set to 24:1. The battle map has been increased to a 50 x 50 grid. A decisive victory is now set at first to reach 97% possession, or 75% plus by tournaments end. Marginal victory is set at 66% plus, and a stalemate is set at 60%. Real time kill notifications and mission results are off but will be updated along with the rest of player stats on the squadron leader board before the start of the next mission\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cAnnouncement Two: As a result of a complaints investigation, the 47th Grizzly Rider Squadron has had its permission to participate in tournament play revoked, pending appeal. All squadrons are reminded that artificial targeting systems, navigation aids, and other game modifications not approved by the tournament organizers are not allowed and will be dealt with in a similar fashion\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cNow. First order of business:. We have a registered strength of eight pilots. That is the bare minimum for an active squadron so we cannot afford to have anybody drop out for any reason. I have a couple of relief pilots in the works but nothing certain, and definitely nothing before tomorrow, real time. That\u2019s about 2 weeks down the road game time. I know this might seem tough, but I am confident we can handle this\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cPlanes are allocated by unit strength. The 127th qualifies for two of the Henklel bombers for being a squadron, plus one plane per registered pilot, plus one back-up plane per pilot. We\u2019ll start off in BF109s, F4 variant, After mission 5 we\u2019ll start seeing the G2\u2019s, if we can afford them. By the end of mission 20 we\u2019ll get the FW190s.  If anyone wants to try their hand in a Stuka they\u2019ll be available starting mission 15. Your back-up planes will always be the F4s, no matter what\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSecond order of Business, and I want you to pay very careful attention to this: Server 12 is not a Dog Fight server. They have tried very hard to make this tournament as close to a realistic air campaign as possible. What this means to you is that your virtual life and your virtual plane are your most precious resource. Yes Lorraine, I\u2019m looking at you. If you die up there you are out for the rest of that mission. If you lose a plane it is gone. If you are one of those who are used to the \u2018Engage at will and fight to the deck with the last bullet\u2019 style of combat you will need to adjust to the new reality.  Your stats only count if you are not killed or captured. And I\u2019m still looking at you Lorraine\u201d.<br>\r\n  \u201cSometimes this will mean electing not to engage the enemy if the odds are not right, or disengaging when the advantage is no longer on our side. Listen to your leader and if they say disengage, do it\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cThird order of business: If at all possible try to bring your machine back. As long as you can land at a friendly air base you can get repaired and get back in the mission. This does NOT mean you risk your life in a burning crate. If you have to bail, you bail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cNow for your flight orders. Our first mission will be to fly top cover for the 83rd, who are bombing a train yard in quadrant 306. This should be fairly easy as we\u2019ll be above the flak for the most part and there are no enemy patrols anticipated in that area. It\u2019s a good mission to start with. That does not mean we can sleep though it. I expect everyone to look sharp. If the 83rd looses a plane I don\u2019t want anyone saying it\u2019s because of lack of effort on our part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s it. If there are no questions I suggest you all head to your quarters and get ready. I want you all on the line at Oh Nine Hundred. That\u2019s fifteen minutes. Dismissed\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the hanger filled with noise as the squad got to their feet and gathered up their belongings. As the rest of them wandered out the doors Lindsay held back, still wanting an answer as to how she had ended up in an all female fighter wing as a female pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the others had left, Lindsay approached the colonel, clearing her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, Anderson. What is it\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cExcuse me Colonel, but I\u2019m not really sure why I\u2019m here. I \u2018m not\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYes, Colonel, but the truth of it is, I...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment the air was pierced by the blast of an air raid siren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the Sam Hell\u201d?!? The colonel swore, then moved quickly but with a still dignified pace into her office, leaving Lindsay alone to fend for herself. After a moment of wondering just what was going on, she realized an air raid siren was probably a warning of something dire, and raced out the door the rest of the squad had taken, hoping to catch up with them. Halfway across the field the mysterious siren abruptly shut off, leaving the roar of the airfield seeming quiet in comparison.<br>\r\n  By the time she\u2019d located the barracks the rest of the girls were almost fully changed. Locating a locker with her name on it, she quickly pulled off her duty uniform and climbed into the beige coverall flight suit, stuffed her feet into the fur lined boots then grabbed a black leather jacket off the cot next to the locker. Only one helmet was still on the shelf by the door as she passed, so she grabbed it and put it on, stuffing her ponytail up into it as best as she could as she ran to catch up with the rest of the squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The ground crew were just pushing the Messerschmitts out of the hangers as the group arrived The sun had been up for almost an hour but had done little to relieve the cold of the mid November morning. Lindsey hadn\u2019t noticed the cold on her way to the barracks earlier, likely because she was distracted by the urgent need to change. Now, standing with the thin Russian wind whistling around her while they waited for the aircraft to be positioned, she was glad of the well padded flight suit she was wearing, both for it\u2019s warmth and it\u2019s bulkiness. With their exaggerated curves wrapped in the beige padding the group lost the blond bombshell appearance and now looked like any typical batch of pilots, waiting for the ground crew to get the aircraft in position.<br>\r\n  The Messerschmitts were brand new, judging by the way the paint gleamed in the early morning sun. Climbing into the cockpit confirmed this. The knobs shone bright and colourfully, the polished glass on the gauges glittered, the painted surfaces were smooth and free of the chips and scratches that a working plane developed so quickly. The leather padding of the seats and gunstock were still without cracks or marks. Lindsay felt a shiver of excitement run through her body as she sat in the pilot\u2019s seat and inhaled deeply. Even the smells were new, like climbing into a new car for the first time, but without the cheap cologne smell from the sales guy.<br>\r\n  The rapture of the moment was broken by the lead handler signaling for engine start, so Lindsay busied herself with the complex task; Magneto, throttle, prop, fuel. A litany of adjustments that, if she had to list out loud would have taken her forever, all quickly set by muscle memory trained by months of practice. Less than 30 seconds later Lindsay pressed the Ignite switch, and the big V12 coughed and rumbled to life. <br>\r\nWhile she waited for the engine to warm up she checked the controls, like any pilot would, making sure they were all working. And working they were, fully functional and oh, so smooth. Lindsay again felt that shiver inside her as she played with the rudder and stabilizer controls, feeling how smoothly the cables and levers responded to her touch, the stick between her legs seeming to glide up and back with hardly any effort at all. A glance at the oil temperature gauge brought her back to reality, or at least back to this reality. 40 Degrees C. Time to go. Brakes off, a burst of throttle, and the aircraft began to trundle up the taxiway towards the runway where the flight was forming up. A touch of the toe brakes swung her in position behind and to the right of the forth plane where she stopped, locked the brakes and ran the engine RPMs up and back. Everything was functioning smoothly, so she dropped the engine back to idle and waited for the stragglers to form up behind her, passing the time playing by with the controls and marveling again at how smooth they worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the last aircraft in the group pulled into position the flight leader radioed for take off, and began to move down the runway, slowly picking up speed. As a group the second, third, and forth planes immediately followed. Lindsay hit the throttle to stay in position and suddenly realized that, for all her hours of practice, she\u2019d never taken off in formation. It was a lot more nerve racking than she\u2019d expected. As she picked up speed she had to be careful not to run into the aircraft ahead of her, and also not to change speed so abruptly that the aircraft behind would run into her. It was the most nerve-racking maneuver she\u2019d tried so far; The plane bounced and bucked over the hard pavement, forcing her to make rapid small adjustment to the rudder to keep in line with the plane ahead and away from the plane to here immediate right. Sweat was trickling down the side of her goggles by the time the tail came up level and the plane really started to pick up speed. Someone cursed over the radio, but Lindsay was too busy to spare the time to wonder who. Finally the speed indicator showed 180 and she pulled the stick back. The ride immediately became a lot smoother as the wheels left the pavement and the plane floated upward, into it\u2019s natural environment at last. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That has to be the sloppiest group takeoff I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cSloppy or not, at least we all made it in the air\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cLorrane almost didn\u2019t. My God girl, I came this close to shredding you\u201d.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  \u201cSo I noticed. What did you think you were you doing\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cI didn\u2019t see you. Do you know how bloody hard it is to see over the nose of this thing with the tail down\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cWell, keep your distance next time\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cI don\u2019t think there should be a next time\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cI\u2019m with you. Let\u2019s not do this again\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cWho\u2019s stupid idea was it to take off in formation anyway\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cThat would be the Colonel\u2019s\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cI beg your pardon\u201d. The colonel\u2019s voice finally broke in on the chatter, indignantly dripping ice from every word. \u201c<i>I</i> said no such thing\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cWell, you gave the take-off signal, and we thought that\u2019s what you wanted\u201d.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  \u201cYou thought so, did you\u201d? The cold tone in the colonel\u2019s voice came clearly through the radio. \u201cWell as of this moment there will be no thinking in this unit unless I give the order\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  A voice came back with \u201cYou got it, chief\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u2018That\u2019s Colonel to you, Bray-Lewis. Keep it in mind or I\u2019ll put you on KP duty when we get back\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Lindsay wasn\u2019t sure how the Colonel could tell who was who over the radio, all the voices sounded the same to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Someone said \u201cThe game has that\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The Colonel (Okay, Lindsay definitely could tell ONE voice apart from the others) came back hard with a snapped \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t I\u2019ll find something equally as unpleasant. Now can the chatter girls and listen up\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cModsley, take Landsdown, Peterson, and Anderson. You\u2019re going to be Red Flight today, use the even number call signs. Bray-Lewis,  Opperman, Garlander, you\u2019re with me. We\u2019re Blue Flight, and we\u2019ll take the odd number call signs\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  One of the aircraft pulled up and slightly away from the milling group and waggled its wings.  \u201cOkay girls. Red leader to Red Flight, fall into position and check in\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  At this two other aircraft pulled into position to each side and slightly behind the lone aircraft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cRed uhh, what, Red one here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cWrong Colleen. You\u2019re Red Two. Even numbers, remember\u201d.  <br>\r\n  \u201cOkey dokey Red leader\u201d. Colleen\u2019s ever chipper voice came back. \u201cRed Two checking in\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cRed, mmm, that would be Four, right\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cYes Lorrane, you would be Four\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Lindsay was maneuvering into line behind the left hand plane. Whether it was Red Two or Red Four she wasn\u2019t certain. \u201cRed Six here, she said\u201d as soon as she was in position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cRed Six\u201d? Lana-Raye asked, obviously not hearing her. \u201cCome in Red Six\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cRed Six Here\u201d Lindsay said, a louder this time.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  \u201cRed Six? Lindsay, you need to press your mike button when you talk if you want us to hear you\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Lindsay groaned, realizing her rookie mistake. Pressing the button at her throat she tried a third time \u201cSorry. Six here\u201d hoping that her embarrassment wouldn\u2019t show in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cThat\u2019s Red Six. Don\u2019t forget the colour. Red flight all present and accounted for\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cBlue leader to Blue Fight. Form up and check in\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As if to prove their superiority, the blue pilots executed their maneuvers quickly and without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cBlue Three, here\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cBlue Five, present\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cBlue Seven here\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cModsley, your group will be flying escort. Take Red Flight to 7,000 and rendezvoused with the 83rd. Blue Flight will climb to 10,000 and fly top cover from there.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  \u201cRoger that, Les\u201d.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  \u201cIt\u2019s Colonel to you as well, Modsley, unless you want to join Bray-Lewis on KP\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cAh, Roger that, Colonel. Red Flight, turn to 130, speed 280. Let\u2019s get out of here before we\u2019re <i>ALL</i> peeling potatoes\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Lindsay found flying formation a lot harder that she expected. Sure she\u2019d practiced, but the AI flying the wing man position seemed to have no problem keeping up.  Lindsay, on the other hand, was out of position almost as soon as the flight started to climb. When she leveled out at 7,000 she found the rest of the flight was nowhere to be seen. She was just starting to feel dread at being lost and alone when the other three planes appeared, pulling up from behind. The relief she felt at seeing them was short lived though, quickly banished by the realization that she hadn\u2019t spotted them until they pulled into position. And these were friendly aircraft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Either because they had decided to go easy on her, which she doubted, or because they hadn\u2019t noticed her panic, the flight continued towards the rendezvous coordinates without anyone saying anything, for which Lindsay was grateful. It was a little easier to keep formation now that they were in level flight, although more than once Lana-Raye was on the radio telling her to get back into position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Flying formation with the dozen bombers that made up the 83rd was even easier, although that may have been just because she\u2019d gotten better at it by the time they made the rendezvous. The lumbering Henkel 111\u2019s were slower and easier to keep pace with, and any drifting could be excused as \u2018Just maneuvering to get a clearer look around\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Keeping formation was the most exciting thing that happened during the mission. Only twice did an enemy patrol appear, only to turn tail and run before they could be chased off. <br>\r\n  Over the target Red Flight hung back at 4500 while the 83rd went down into the flak to drop their loads, then came back up to regroup remarkably enough completely unscathed. From there it was an even less eventful trip back into friendly territory and then to base for both groups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay was half afraid that, along with everything else she\u2019d done wrong, she\u2019d cap it off with a botched landing, but to everyone\u2019s surprise Lindsay\u2019s touchdown was right out of the textbook, on first approach and not even a single bounce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebriefing was in the main hanger, where the Colonel discussed a few of the problems encountered, mainly Lindsay\u2019s inability to maintain formation, and told them how they would be resolved.  The major would take Lindsay and Addison up again for a few hours practice, with Colleen filling in as a forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few groans, mostly from Colleen, but no serious objection. Actually, Lindsay was looking forward to taking her machine up again; even if it wasn\u2019t purely for fun at least it wasn\u2019t going to be as stressful as a true patrol would have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When they headed out after lunch they were surprised to see that this time unit markings had been painted on the fuselage behind the cockpit of each plane, with the pilot\u2019s name and rank painted along the sill of the cockpit side window. Lindsay found she was now permanently assigned as JG-127-06<br>\r\n  In addition to the unit markings, a picture of a cartoon biplane being piloted by a cow had been painted onto the engine cowling.  Drawn as a caricature, the cow\u2019s big pink nose protruded forward halfway over top the machine gun mounted on the biplanes\u2019 nose, the cow\u2019s mouth was wide open and the tongue was flapping backwards in the wind. The hide was the black and white pattern classic to the Jersey breed, although any horns it may have sported were hidden underneath the leather flying helmet and goggle. <br>\r\n  In all, the artist had done a very good job at creating a cartoon image that was unmistakably that of a cow flying a biplane. <br>\r\n  The afternoon\u2019s two hour practice went well, and wound up stretching late into the afternoon, ending only when the radio reminded them that the mess hall would only be serving dinner for another hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Dinner was served in the traditional mess hall manner, the surly looking cook slopping a variety of questionable looking items into the compartments of an olive drab tin tray. <br>\r\n   Traditional military lore claimed that the army had designed the multi-compartment tray system (Winco mess tray, compartmentalized, style B) so that various items would not combine and detonate prematurely. Lore also stated that, while biologically the human body needed 48 hours to turn food into excrement, a trained army chef could do it in 45 minutes. Maybe it was because the mess hall was air force instead of army, but Lindsay found that, while the presentation may have lacked a certain something, the food itself was excellent. She had just polished off the entire tray and was thinking about how she could get away with seconds when Colleen plopped herself down across the table from her. <br>\r\n  \u201cPretty good grub eh\u201d? She asked, seeing Lindsay trying to scrape the last oh so tasty morsels of food out of the edges of the cups.<br>\r\n   With a small sigh of regret Lindsay pushed aside her empty tray. \u201cI always thought military food was supposed to be 2 steps below airline quality, but that was amazing\u201d!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cYeah, it is\u201d. Colleen grinned \u201cThe game has us living in war time conditions, but there\u2019s no need to go overboard. We are supposed to be doing this for fun, after all\u201d. She stood up again \u201cCome on\u201d she said \u201cIf you\u2019re finished the rest of us are going over to the bar\u201d.<br>\r\n  Lindsay put her tray on the dish rack and hurried after Colleen \u201cWe have a bar on base\u201d?<br>\r\n  \u201cSure\u201d Colleen called back, \u201cWhere else do you think we get drinks\u201d? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Colleen led Lindsay across the compound to another drab tent, one with a wooden sign \u2018Die Wutenden Kuhe Gasthaus\u2019 over the door.<br>\r\n  The bar tent was smaller than the mess hall, but still big enough for a long table with bench seats down the middle and a couple of smaller round tables with miss matched stools jammed against one wall. Along the opposite wall was a set of cupboards book-ended by a large ice chest on one end and a jukebox, currently playing some 1945 swing blues, on the other. The top of the cupboard was lined with bottles and glasses, and obviously served as the self serve bar. Over the cupboard hung the obligatory 2 blade aircraft propeller standard as decoration in any air force bar, and above that hung a copy of the same cartoon cow that decorated the nose of the squadron aircraft.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Colleen continued as if nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirlz, look Vo I haft vound\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She took a seat on one side of the table, gesturing for Lindsay to take another. A couple of the girls were already sitting, beers of their own in front of them.<br>\r\n   \u201cHey Lindsay\u201d, Lorraine greeted them as they sat down \u201cColleen, what have I said about your Hollywood German\u201d? <br>\r\n  \u201cHollywood German\u201d?  Lindsay felt compelled to ask<br>\r\n  \u201cIn the movies bad guys always spoke English with a bad German accent\u201d Lorraine explained.  <br>\r\n  \u201cBut zeest time ve are ze goot guys, ya\u201d?<br>\r\n  \u201cYeah, Colleen takes that bad accent and mangles it beyond recognition\u201d added Linda, settling down beside Lindsay with a beer of her own. <br>\r\n  \u201cJuzt getting into ze karakter\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cWell your character still sounds like some B grade movie director couldn\u2019t decide if their villain was a Nazi or a Vampire\u201d said Lorraine with a roll of her eyes. \u201cPlease don\u2019t\u201d.<br>\r\n   Colleen\u2019s response was to give a mock stiff armed salute \u201c\u201cVe fly for Ze Glorious Fatherland, En ze finest of movie traditions, ve should all use ze accent to reflect zat\u201d.<br>\r\nA couple more girls had grabbed beers and joined the table, voicing various, but unanimously negative, opinions on Colleen\u2019s accent<br>\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s doesn\u2019t even sound German, it\u2019s more French.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cNien\u201d protested Colleen, \u201cZounds verry German to me.

Stop it\u201d.<br>\r\n  \u201cOh, for pete\u2019s sake\u201d, Lana-Raye scolded, obviously the only one that was on Colleen\u2019s side \u201clet her have her fun\u201d. <br>\r\n  \u201cI\u2019d like to point out that, if we were really speaking German we wouldn\u2019t notice the accent\u201d. Addison added, eager to be a part of the conversation\u201d. <br>\r\n  \u201cAnd I\u2019ll point out that Lorraine is being a kill joy\u201d said Lana-Raye, pressing her point.<br>\r\n  \u201cNien, nien,\u201d Colleen said, waving her hands to emphasize her words. \u201cIs merely jellies bekause ov mine mastery of Ze German aksent\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Lorraine leaned back with an exasperated sigh. \u201cNo\u201d, she said \u201cI am just tired of trying to figure out what you are saying. Tell you what, how is this for a fun compromise? If you promise to pretend you are speaking English with a German accent, I promise to pretend to listen in German with an English accent, okay\u201d?<br>\r\n  Colleen twisted her mouth sideways and up as she mocked thinking about it, one finger pressed to her pursed lips. She looked so comical Lindsay almost burst out laughing when Colleen grinned and said \u201cJa, Zat Zounds goot to me\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Having extracted the promise that there would be no more attempts at speaking with a German accent, at least until someone conveniently forgot, the conversation turned to the hundred other little topics that women discuss while sitting around a table drinking beer. Lindsay half listening to the other women gossip, a little afraid to join in for fear of slipping up and giving herself away. Instead she nursed her beer and let the words wash around her while she studied the cartoon of the squadron\u2019s mascot. There was something, well, off about it. Maybe it was the way the tongue had a little twist at the end. Maybe it was the cartoon eyes pointing in different directions. Or it could have been the drops of spittle trailing down the bi-plane fuselage. These little details added a deeper meaning to the overall picture. A meaning that said \u2018Back away slowly and don\u2019t make eye contact\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cEarth to Lindsay, are you there\u201d?<br>\r\n   Lindsay realized that Lorraine had been asking her something \u201cWhat? Sorry, I wasn\u2019t paying attention\u201d.<br>\r\n  \u201cI\u2019ll say. I\u2019ve been talking to you for a couple of minutes. Did you hear anything I said\u201d?<br>\r\n  \u201cNo\u201d, Lindsay apologized \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I spaced out there for a bit\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cNo kidding\u201d! Lorraine braced her chin on her folded hands and leaned in closer, a impish look of interest on her face. \u201cSo just how good looking is he\u201d?<br>\r\n  \u201cWho\u2019s good looking\u201d? piped up Colleen, interested enough to turn away from her conversation on prop pitch controls she had been having with Lana-Raye.<br>\r\n  \u201cThis guy Lindsay\u2019s been thinking about\u201d. Lorraine responded. <br>\r\n  \u201cWhat guy\u201d? Lindsay asked, still clueless as to which direction the conversation had turned. <br>\r\n  \u201cThe one you\u2019ve been thinking about for the last 5 minutes\u201d.<br>\r\n  Lindsay stared at the circle of faces looking at her, confused. A few moments later her brain processed what her ears had heard, flushing them a bright pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lindsay protested over the teasing babble of girls all talking at her at the same time. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking about men at all\u201d Realizing that statement didn\u2019t exactly get her free of teasing territory, she hastily added \u201cI was thinking about that picture\u201d! And with her free hand she gestured at the caricature on the wall.<br>\r\n  \u201cOh, that\u201d. Lorraine said, obviously disappointed that men, or possibly women, singly and in groups, were not going to be the current topic of conversation. \u201cLana-Raye here drew it as an art project for school. Leslie saw it, added the slogan, and co-opted it as our squadron mascot. Pretty good huh\u201d? <br>\r\n  \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to puzzle out what the slogan means\u201d.<br>\r\n  \u201cYou haven\u2019t figured it out yet\u201d?<br>\r\n  \u201cI don\u2019t know a lot of German, other than what\u2019s on the instrument panel\u201d, Lindsay admitted, \u201cI know that \u2018Die\u2019 doesn\u2019t refer to death but instead means \u2018The\u2019, but that\u2019s about it\u201d.<br>\r\n  \u201cNot even a guess?\u201d Lorraine pressed. <br>\r\nSilence had fallen on the tent and Lindsay was uncomfortably aware that every eye in the place was on her, watching expectantly. <br>\r\n  \u201cWell\u201d Lindsay reasoned slowly, out loud, \u201cthe word \u2018Kuhe\u2019 probably means cow, since it sounds like it, and there is a cow in the picture. Wutenden probably means, what? Wonderful? Or maybe flying? \u2018The Wonderful Flying Cow\u2019\u201d?<br>\r\n  Lorraine grinned \u201cNot even close. Kuhe is German plural for cow, so that part was close, Wutenden is a phrase that means \u2018not quite right in the head\u2019, if you get what I mean\u201d.<br>\r\n  Not right in the head? Stupid? Crazy? Insane? Lindsay went through the list of all the synonyms she could think of that fit the definition, stopping suddenly she realized just what word fit perfectly with the cow\u2019s expression. <br>\r\n  \u201cOh my God\u201d, she groaned, as the watching group erupted in laughter at her expression. \u201cI\u2019ve joined \u2018The Mad Cows\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lorraine said, holding up her own identical glass \u201cits tradition. Cheers\u201d!

She gasped when she finally managed to catch her breath through the fumes.<br>\r\n\u201cJagermeister\u201d Lorraine said, grinning as she watched Lindsay gasping. <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s awful\u201d!

The real stuff couldn\u2019t possibly taste that bad\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cSadly, it does. I used to drink it in school. And before you ask why, it\u2019s the only thing the boys would bring to parties\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah\u201d, Colleen added \u201cThe official drink of pimply faced little boys trying to prove they\u2019re not little boys anymore\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Linda said, sliding her water glass across the table to her, \u201cuse this to wash the taste out of your mouth\u201d.<br>\r\nWhat ever part of Lindsay\u2019s brain that was still taking things at face value got another nasty shock, and once again Lindsay found herself gasping for breath through a cloud of Alcohol fumes.<br>\r\n\u201cGood Russian Vodka\u201d said Linda as Lindsay managed to find her breath. \u201cProbably made not 10 minutes away from here. Let me know if you\u2019re just going to spit it out it next time. Oh, and you owe me 5 bucks\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat for\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cThe round of course. New girl buys the first shots. It\u2019s an old squadron tradition\u201d.<br>\r\n Lindsay suddenly thought of something. \u201cHey, wait a minute, I thought the squadron has only been around a couple of weeks. How can there be old traditions\u201d?<br>\r\n  Lorraine jumped in with \u201cWhat she means is that it\u2019s an old \u2018New Squadron\u2019 tradition\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cIs that five bucks each or five total\u201d? asked Addison, waving a ten spot.<br>\r\n\u201cTwo rounds, so five each\u201d, said Linda, helping herself to the offered cash and tossing it into the cigar box. \u201cYou\u2019re covering the next round as well\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cLinda\u201d Lana-Raye scolded, \u201cStop taking advantage of the newbies\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d. Addison said eagerly, \u201cI don\u2019t mind. I got money\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s loaded and willing to buy\u201d laughed Lorraine, sliding herself onto the bench between Linda and Addison, putting her arms around both \u201cThat\u2019s what I want in a wing man. Can I have her\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cI saw her first. Besides, you\u2019ve already got Bev. Don\u2019t break her heart\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat ever\u201d Lorraine shrugged her shoulders \u201cBesides, she\u2019ll get over it\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d, Linda responded knowingly \u201cprobably right after another \u2018friendly fire\u2019 incident\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u201d Bev protested \u201cThat was proven to be a legitimate accident\u201d.<br>\r\n   The three girls started a passionate debate about when you might expect to get away with shooting down a superior officer, with Addison eagerly listening to every word. Lana-Raye took the opportunity to change seats so she was now sitting next to Lindsay. \u201cHow was your first day\u201d? She asked. <br>\r\n\u201cOkay I guess\u201d confessed Lindsay. \u201cNot as exiting as I expected. I didn\u2019t even get to shoot anything\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cFirst day is usually slow. It\u2019ll start to pick up tomorrow. I take it this is your first TAC tournament\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t even know they existed until a couple of months ago. Are they always like this\u201d? <br>\r\n\u201cPretty much\u201d. Lana-Raye took a pull from her beer \u201cBy the end you\u2019ll wonder what the hell you were thinking when you signed up. Then before you know it you\u2019ll be signing up for the next one\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cI take it you\u2019ve done this before\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh. Five times so far\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys have been doing this for five years\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cNot all of us\u201d. Lana-Raye gestured around the room \u201cSome of us have played together on and off with different groups. But never all on the same team until Leslie put together the 127th\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of Leslie\u201d, Lindsay looked around, \u201cI don\u2019t see her.  Does she eat at the officer\u2019s club\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cOfficers club? Na! She usually joins us. She\u2019s probably still over at command discussing the game plan for the next few days. Besides, this <i>is</i> the officer\u2019s club\u201d.  <br>\r\n\u201cI thought maybe she had her own mess, being the commanding officer\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cShe set up the group, so she gets to be the commander. She pretends to be in charge, and we play along and pretend to follow her orders\u201d. <br>\r\nLana-Raye took a long swallow before going on \u201cActually a group acts better as a unit if they all agree who\u2019s in charge and follow along. There are a couple of rules she\u2019s a stickler on, but other than that she\u2019s as much in it for the fun as the rest of us\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat rules\u201d? Truth be told, Lindsay had hurried through that part of the information package and had just checked \u2018Yes\u2019 without bothering to read it too deeply. She felt a sudden sinking feeling and hoped her lack of diligence wasn\u2019t about to screw her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana-Raye ticked the rules off on her fingers as she recited them.<br>\r\n\u201cFirst rule is that you agree to follow the tournament rules\u201d.<br>\r\nThat was okay; she planned on following them anyway.<br>\r\n\u201cSecond rule is that you follow agree to follow the squadron rules unless they conflict with the first rule\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cThird rule, don\u2019t lie about something. Or anyone. If you screw up admit it. Don\u2019t try passing the blame off on some-one else\u201d. Lana-Raye leaned forward and stage whispered \u201cI think that\u2019s something from her management back ground\u201d.<br>\r\nOkay, thought Lindsay, she wasn\u2019t habitually a liar, but it was still good to keep in mind.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd lastly, but most importantly, No males allowed on base\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cNo men\u201d? Lindsay gasped at this. <br>\r\n\u201cNope\u201d! Lana-Raye shook her head \u201cThe 129th is strictly a hen party\u2019. She noted Lindsay reaction at this last bit of information \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u201d, she said soothingly \u201c If you find you need some action just hang around with Lorraine. She usually manages to find the good party spots by the end of the first week\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay wanted to press for more information on the no men rule, but Lana-Raye had decided to see what music the Jukebox had been loaded with and left her sitting at the table. Left to herself and another opportunity missed, Lindsay grabbed another beer and drank it as she listened to the flood of conversation around her. It was very different than she was used to. With a group of men in a similar situation the talk would be all about sports or women, bragging about accomplishments and conquests in both (whether real and imagined). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d never realized before that men viewed tavern talk as a competitive sport, while women treated it as an opportunity to share everything they knew about everyone you might also know, and at a rate that put broadband internet to shame. The girls chattered away about everything and anything, bouncing from one topic to the next like a group of puppies playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting there behind her growing pile of empty beer cans it seemed Lindsay learned more in an hour about the women of the 129th than she knew about anyone and everyone else she\u2019d ever known. Bev, shy and sensitive, was working her way through school and training to be a paramedic. Colleen was an irreverent and fanatical practical joker. Lorraine would flirt with anything wearing pants, but was actually very choosy and had high standards. Linda was gay but nobody cared. Leslie had gone through a very messy break up that she hated to talk about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay also found out a few things about the base, like that there was a big red button on a pedestal half way between the colonel\u2019s office and the barracks that set off the air raid siren. And that anyone pushing it when there wasn\u2019t a real air raid going on would be forced to jog the perimeter of the base with full combat packs, thanks to Colleen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t by listening, but by trying to stand up, that she found out virtual beer was every bit as sneakily intoxicating as real beer. And, just like the real stuff, you never bought it, you just rented it. A growing pressure in her bladder, an organ that she hadn\u2019t noticed before now, was insisting it was time to return the rental, and, judging from the pile of empties in front of her, see if there was a damage deposit involved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quiet \u2018excuse me\u2019 that nobody really noticed, she got up and after a couple of miss starts, found the door and headed outside.  Usually she would just slip quietly around the corner around to the back of the tent, out of sight, but tonight the cold air sobered her up just enough to realize that, what with the recent rearrangement of her plumbing, the old piss in a dark corner trick was not going to work now. Instead, she put the rarely used plan \u2018B\u2019 into action, and set off unsteadily down the row of tents, looking for a bathroom. After a couple of minutes, and purely by accident, she managed to stagger around a parked jeep and blunder into a sign proclaiming the tent behind it to be \u2018Die Abzienhende Latrine\u2019. Her addled brain jumped to the obvious conclusion as it focused on the word \u2018Latrine\u2019 and she pushed open the door and staggered in, hoping she wasn\u2019t wrong. The pressure in her bladder was getting intense and she wasn\u2019t exactly sure how long she had before she couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, her guess was correct and the door opened into a small wood floored tent with a couple of sinks and a row of stalls at the back. Taking the first stall she found she hiked up the skirt, pulled down her underwear and sat. Even though this was her first time alone with her new parts she was too far into the nights drinking to really pay much attention to anything other than trying to figure out what muscles to relax. For a minute she couldn\u2019t get anything going, until she just stopped thinking about it and her body took over from there. Everything just sort of happened at that point so she just closed her eyes and went with the flow, so to speak. The plumbing may have been hooked up different, but the immense feeling of relief was still the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As things slowed to a trickle she groggily opened her eyes. The stall was just like any other she\u2019d sat in, only without the crude graffiti marring the paintwork. An odd container mounted on the partition caught Lindsay\u2019s blurred attention. It reminded her of a skinny mailbox, the kind most people had mounted on the front of their house so the post man had a place to put the parcel delivery notices. Fuzzily, her brain wondered about what kind of letter, or parcel notice, someone would get in a toilet stall. She was totally unable to think of an answer but found she didn\u2019t care. She tipped sideways a little and found her own use for the narrow mailbox; the cool metal felt soothing to her forehead as she leaned against it and wished that who ever was spinning the tent around would stop before she was sick.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some indeterminate time later, after the tent spinner grew tired of the game and went to bother someone else, Lindsay felt like she could get to her feet again. The attempt was a disaster. For some odd reason she miss judged the point at which she reached vertical and pitched too far forward. Fortunately the door to the cubical was there to catch her and lower her gently to the floor. She lay there and giggled a bit for some reason, then politely thanked the door for its help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you would have thought the door would have responded with an equally polite \u2018You\u2019re welcome\u2019, or perhaps \u2018No problem at all, happy to be of help\u2019. This door had a hidden sadistic side, and when she tried to use its support to get to her feet again it suddenly swung and threw her bodily to the floor. Then, when she pushed herself up onto her hands and knees, followed that treachery with a vicious blow to the back of her head, and then another into the small of her back as she tried to rise. Pitching forward again onto her stomach, this time she belly crawled her way out of the door\u2019s treacherous reach, regrouping beside the sink while she checked out the damage and weighed her options to counter attack. From her position of cover she could see the stall door watching her smugly, swinging slowly, mockingly, back and forth. Taunting her.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on\u201d, squeaked the hinges. \u201cI\u2019m ready if you want to lose round two,\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sink at least, seemed to be on her side, at least for now, helping her get to her feet again, and also trying to talk some sense at her, \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it\u201d the sink insisted wetly. Sage advice, even coming as it was from a chipped enamel bowel, so Lindsay reluctantly turned, washed her hands, then lurched towards the exit. Only to have her feet yanked savagely out from underneath her, throwing her once again flat on the floor. Stars exploded in her vision as her head bounced off the smelly pine boards. She rolled to the side, trying to protect herself and wondering which of the treacherous latrine fixtures was after her this time. As she tried to rise into a defensive crouch she discovered that this time the culprit was her own underwear, still wrapped around her ankles from her exertions on the toilet earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Fortunately the sink, still loyally on her side, was there to give her the support she needed as she levered herself back upright. When once again more or less vertical she tried to pull her wayward unmentionables back where they belonged, a task made extremely difficult by the refusal of the local gravity to stop shifting and pulling her in different directions as she tried to bend over. Finally, her stomach decided that it had had enough upping and downing, and projected what still remained of the night\u2019s festivities all over her only loyal supporter in the whole nights affair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding herself on her knees yet again, weakly clutching a now slippery sink, Lindsay came up with an absolutely brilliant alternative solution to her problem. If they won\u2019t go up, maybe they\u2019ll go down. The tangled cloth fought and clutched tight to her ankles and shoes, making it difficult to step out of the tangled fabric, but Lindsay persevered, kicking off her shoes and digging with her toes until at last she staggered barefoot from the battle scene, both shoe and underwear less, but decidedly victorious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she thought. Anyone who\u2019s survived in battle will tell you constant vigilance should be your watch word. That the time to be wary of an attack is when you least expect it. And that, just as you are sure the enemy is vanquished and the battle won, he will regroup to surprise you with a counter attack. Lindsay opened the latrine door to step back out into the night. The latrine door was just that, a door. It was also the reinforcements Lindsay hadn\u2019t expected. Joining in solidarity with the other doors, it proceeded to pitch Lindsay bodily both out into the night and into the hard right side of that now rather inconveniently parked jeep. As a stunned Lindsay slid down the icy metal and flopped onto her back, the mutinous aperture gleefully slammed shut and delivered one last shot. A coup de grace of sorts, in the form of a large patch of snow that it had been gathering on the roof all evening for just such an occasion. Dislodged by the slamming of the door, the soggy mass slid slowly and wetly down the roof and over the edge to land in Lindsay face just as she was struggling to get up off her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer squad mates found her a few minutes later, shivering and soaking wet. Concerned by her absence they had just started looking for her when they had heard a cry and the sounds of a door slamming. Finding her half buried in the snow and barely conscious, they carried her into the mess tent, and once they saw her in better lighting from there to that remote corner of the same tent that doubled as their emergency medical center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as they bandaged her up, they tried to find out what had happened, how she had gotten all those scrapes on her legs, and the bruises on her face. And that bloody lump on the back of her head. Lindsay had a hard time making any sense, what with all that alcohol in her system. Her recollection of the events in the latrine was fuzzy, and her retelling slurred and even fuzzier. Something about a letter and a parcel, and getting into a fight in the toilet. And that she needed to apologize to somebody named \u2018Zink\u2019, who had rescued her and whom she\u2019d thrown up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colonel ordered a patrol sweep to make sure who ever had attacked Lindsay was not still in the area. When the sweep turned up empty they set up a watch rotation and agreed to let her sleep it off and find out more in the morning. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay woke the next morning with someone shaking her shoulder. Her head was pounding and it tasted like someone\u2019s dirty socks had been in her mouth. Her stomach gave little dry heaves when she pushed herself upright, blinking in the intense light shining through the barracks window. <br>\r\nWay too much detail in this game, she thought, not for the last time. Someone had put a cup of coffee and two aspirin on the locker beside her bed. Although her stomach heaved at the thought of putting anything in it, she dutifully swallowed the pills and washed them down. The coffee was black and barely lukewarm. Surprisingly she felt a little better afterwards. Her stomach settled and the light didn\u2019t bother her quite so much.<br>\r\n  \u201cAbout time you woke up\u201d. said Lana-Raye from the foot of her bed. \u201cColonel wants to see you in her office in 30 minutes. If you hurry you\u2019ll have time for a shower\u201d.<br>\r\n  Half an hour seemed like more than enough time for a shower, she was thinking as she dug around her locker for her kit. Until she realized, while it was plenty of time for a man, as a woman she had no idea how long the process took. Quickly she grabbed her kit and ran to the showers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana-Raye had been right. Even though she\u2019d hurried through the shower as quickly as she could, she arrived at the colonel\u2019s office door barely in time, still desperately running a comb through her damp hair. Still, she figured it had been worth it. With the shower added to the aspirin and cup of coffee, she felt almost human again.  <br>\r\n  Two gentlemen in black leather trench coats were already there, talking to the colonel when she entered. At the sound of her Their shiny boots, peaked military style hats, and red arm bands practically screamed out one word.  <br>\r\n\u201cGestapo!\u201d Lindsay gasped, stopping in her tracks.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we\u2019re worse than that.\u201d Chuckled one of the officers dryly, giving Lindsay a slow apprising look. \u201cSystem Admin.\u201d<br>\r\nLooking closer, Lindsay could see the silver initials on the crisp collar patches indeed read SyS, and not SS as she\u2019d first thought.<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re here because of what happened last night.\u201d The colonel said. \u201cThey would like to hear about it.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cAccording to our report,\u201d said the first Gestapo officer (Lindsay couldn\u2019t help think of them as anything else), looking at the clip board he was carrying, \u201cYou were found in a snow bank, badly beaten and semi conscious. Perhaps you would care to tell us how this came to be?\u201d <br>\r\n  Lindsay flushed and averted her gaze. The feeling of peace and well being that the combination of pills, coffee, and shower had bestowed upon her was over ridden by a  growing feeling of dread that grew in the pit of her stomach. She started to feel sick again. <br>\r\n  \u201cI, uh, ran into a door\u201d? She mumbled. As soon as she said it she felt her stomach sink further as she realized with certainty the Gestapo would not accept that as an explanation.<br>\r\n  \u201cHighly unusual amount of injuries for running into a single door\u201d, one of them said. <br>\r\n  If he meant it sarcastically Lindsay failed to notice. \u201cThere were two of them.\u201d she said, then realized that made the explanation even less believable.<br>\r\nThe Gestapo officer with the clip board gave her a level look that managed to convey \u201cdon\u2019t waste my time, then flipped a page and read \u201cIt also says here that you were found naked from the waist down\u201d. He looked up at her with his head tilted and an unreadable expression on his face. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cLindsay\u201d, the Colonel said softly, \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to protect someone\u201d\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The last thing Lindsay wanted to do was relate her miss-adventures in the toilet. But without lying she couldn\u2019t see any clear way out of the situation that would allow her to save face. Pretending that the Colonel was right, that Lindsay had a lover that she didn\u2019t want to get into trouble might get her to back off, but now the SyS was involved this would more than likely blow up in her face later on. Thinking up a sly lie might be a marginally better bet, but Lindsay was no good at thinking on her feet, and knew any lie she came up with on the spur of the moment would make things even worse than the mystery boyfriend story.<br>\r\nIt\u2019s hard to admit to something you did, especially when it makes you look foolish, but in the end that was the course Lindsay chose. She described what had happened as best as she could remember which, now that she was sober, was surprisingly very detailed.<br>\r\n  She described how she had gotten very drunk and needed to pee, how she\u2019d lost her balance in the toilet stall and had fallen against the door. How the latch on the door had sprung open when she\u2019d leaned on it and she\u2019d fallen, and how the door had bounced off the wall and swung back just as she had tried to get up. Her face burned a bit as she described how she\u2019d gotten tripped up in her tangled panties, and how taking them off had seemed like such a good idea at the time in her drunken state. After all, she had known (she maybe told a slight little miss-truth here) that there were no men around to worry about. And that she hadn\u2019t known the latrine door swung out as well as in when she\u2019d leaned against it while opening the latch, which is how she\u2019d wound up sitting in the snow.<br>\r\n  As she spoke the officer with the clip board jotted notes while the other one stood and stared at her, unnervingly still as he listened to her story. When she\u2019d finished the two looked at her for several uncomfortable moments, then simultaneously shook their heads and started to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell,\u201d the one with the clip board said, putting his pencil away \u201cHer story pretty much synchronizes with what the video feed shows.\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cYou have video feed of this?\u201d the colonel asked. A dark look crossed her face.<br>\r\nOh yes, the second SyS said. We just needed to verify what it shows against what your pilot says happened.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cThere are videos of me running around with no pants on?\u201d Lindsay was aghast at the thought.<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! The feed only shows up to the point where you enter the latrine, and then again when you exit it. Nothing from the inside\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you have cameras on our latrine?\u201d The colonel demanded.<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n The colonel was looking quite angry at this point, and slammed her fist onto her desk.<br>\r\n\u201cFirst you say you have video feed, now you say you don\u2019t! Which is it? And why are you spying on my girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Clipboard looked shocked, and held up his hands in denial \u201cI didn\u2019t say we have cameras. I said we have video feed.\u201d Seeing that The Colonel didn\u2019t look any happier about this he continued.  \u201cLook, this whole world is a digital construct. And the digital imagery generated can be viewed from any local point. That\u2019s how you can record your dog fights from camera angles outside your aircraft. Any local point can also act as a video feed.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Leslie leaned across her desk, \u201ceverything that happens is recorded and can be played back any time?\u201d<br>\r\nYes, and no! Because of server limits the data is available only during the game and for a short period after. And nothing is saved unless specifically requested. As much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t save every game indefinitely.\u201d <br>\r\n  \u201cFurther more, because of various privacy and decency laws, all areas with expectations of privacy, such as the showers and barracks, video feed is available only when specifically requested by all authorized occupants of those rooms at the time involved..<br>\r\n\u201cWhich means\u201d the other officer said, turning to Lindsay \u201conly you will be able to request a copy of the video of yourself in a fight with the toilet. And I would suggest you do so within the next couple of hours, before you forget.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I want that on video?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding\u201d? The SyS Officer asked incredulously, \u201cThat is the stuff YouTube gold is made of.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would want to watch it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at what people want videos of, especially in VR\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay remained unconvinced. \u201cBut it\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d A thought suddenly occurred to her. \u201cHey, if you had video, why did you need me to embarrass myself anyways.\u201d<br>\r\nOfficer Clipboard looked up sharply. \u201cThe word is \u2018Anyway\u2019! There is no \u2018s\u2019 on the end of it. And yes, we had video, but only of you entering the latrine, and then falling out the door a few minutes later. Nothing of anyone else entering or leaving<br>\r\nThe second SyS officer continued \u201cWe wanted to make sure there wasn\u2019t someone else in there, Some one the video feed didn\u2019t detect.\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cYou think something is effecting the videos?\u201d Lindsay asked, seeing if she was understanding what the SyS were looking for.<br>\r\n\u201cAffecting!\u201d officer Clipboard said sharply, pointing the eraser end of his pencil at Lindsay .<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe word is affecting! Affecting is something that makes something happen. Effect is something that happens\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u201d said Lindsay, taken aback a bit by the sharpness of the reply, but decided to soldier on, \u201cBut irregardless of that, why would you think there is someone running around who doesn\u2019t show up on video?\u201d she asked, hoping for clarification.<br>\r\n\u201cRegardless!\u201d The SyS officer actually snapped his pencil in half in irritation. \u201cThe word is regardless! There is no such word as irregardless!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHans\u201d, the other SyS officer said warningly, \u201cDon\u2019t\u201d!<br>\r\nThe SyS officer identified as Hans held his tongue, but with obvious difficulty.<br>\r\n\u201cBut in answer to your question\u201d the other officer broke in, deflecting the conversation back to it\u2019s original course. \u201cThere are rumors of a group of hackers trying to develop a way to do this, so any time we get a report where this may have happened, we check them out. All of them have turn out to be false so far, but we have to investigate each one just in case\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI can understand that.\u201d said Lindsay. \u201cAfter all, better safe then sorry.\u201d<br>\r\nHans\u2019 eyes bulged. <br>\r\n\u201cTHAN!\u201d Hans shouted \u201cIt is better safe THAN sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat is enough Hans, let it go.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for that,\u201d the first officer apologized, \u201cHans can\u2019t help himself and tends to want to correct people over any little improper use of language. But you are correct. So far all reports that could be of cloaked attackers have turned out false, but we do have to check out each one to make sure.\u201d<br>\r\nHe picked up his briefcase and motioned Hans to do the same.<br>\r\n\u201cSince it all seems to be okay, we can close the case.<br>\r\nThank you for being straight up with us. The truth saves us a lot of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this the SyS officer started to leave. When they reached the door he stopped, turned, and said \u201cI would appreciate it if you don\u2019t talk about the real reason behind our visit. Rumors like this take on a life of their own. Your cooperation is thusly appreciated.<br>\r\nHans stopped in his tracks and glared at his partner. \u201cNot you, too!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The other SyS officer asked, an innocent look on his face.<br>\r\nAs the two headed into the hall the girls could hear Hans starting to rant.  \u201cThus is already an adverb! There is absolutely no reason to add \u2013ly to the end of it. It serves no purpose. You are essentially trying to turn an adverb into an adverb!\u201d<br>\r\nThe Sys officer paused with his hand on the door knob, then turned and gave them a wink as he closed the door behind him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was nerves, or some residual effect from the hangover she no longer had, but Lindsay couldn\u2019t get the start sequence correct for some reason and twice flooded the engine. As she waited for the excess fuel to clear from the cylinders the Colonel, waiting impatiently at the end of the runway,  radioed her that if it didn\u2019t start this time she could push the plane back into the hanger by herself and spend the rest of the day scrubbing pots in the mess tent.<br>\r\nWhether it was Leslie\u2019s tone of voice or the old \u2018Third time is the charm\u2019 at work, this time the engine sputtered to life when she flipped the starter switch. Lindsay hurried through the warm up and taxied out to join up with Leslie. As impatient as the Colonel was, she still insisted Lindsay go through the run-up sequence, and then again when she skipped a couple of steps. The last chance to catch any issue that might cause problems during the flight, she said. Lindsay grudgingly ran through the sequence again, thinking all the while that the Colonel was just being a dick about the whole thing. After all, those NPC\u2019s in greasy overalls running around were supposedly there to provide them with an aircraft 100% ready to fly each morning. <br>\r\nStill, following orders to the letter was the price you pay in order to spend some quality time with your CO, even if your CO takes the game way too seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another fairly simple mission. Since the rest of the wing was escorting a bombing party that was already half way to its target, Leslie and Lindsay did a hunting patrol, looking for targets of opportunity along the front lines. Lindsay mostly followed the Colonel around watching her back, although she did manage to score a couple of trucks and a tank. She also managed to get a nice line of holes stitched up her right wing, courtesy of an unnoticed machine gun nest protecting a fuel dump they found and strafed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay was actually kind of proud of the holes. It showed she\u2019s been in actual combat. Like little badges of honor decorating her until now completely unscathed machine. She kept smiling at the thought of them, right up until the point where she tried to land. That was when she discovered that the right tire, having spent the entire flight tucked up into the wing and not incidentally right in line with three of the holes, collapsed on landing. The 109 pitched forward and almost flipped as it slid and skidded down the runway, finally coming to a stop nose down in a snow bank. Steam rose in a cloud around a twisted propeller that looked more like a pretzel than a piece of airplane. As Lindsay hung from her flight harness and struggled to open the canopy she saw the entire squadron running towards her. Either to help or to laugh, she wasn\u2019t sure which. Everyone, that is, except for the Colonel, who was just standing there beside her own airplane, looking towards Lindsay for several long moments before shaking her head sadly and walking, not towards the gathering crowd, but towards her office. Or perhaps, and more likely, towards the bar tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Leslie had been in the bar, she\u2019d left by the time Lindsay got there. All the other girls seem to be having a good time, but Lindsay was still a bit depressed by how the day had gone. Her truck and tank kills seemed pale in the light of Lorraine\u2019s 2 fighters and Beverly\u2019s bomber. And no one else had crashed their plane on landing. While everyone else drank beer and chattered away Lindsay decided to turn in early.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It started out great, as any day does that starts out with the Gestapo not waiting for you in the Colonels office when you wake up. That, and her newly repaired plane started on the first try. <br>\r\nRed flight did another hunting patrol, and Lindsay added to her growing list of downed flying machines four more trucks, a train, a tank, a gas station, and some sort of wagon thing. She was just starting to wonder where she might be able to find a couple of balloons and a zeppelin when she heard Lana-Raye\u2019s voice in her headset.<br>\r\n\u201cRed six. Two bandits, 6 o\u2019clock high\u201d. Lindsay looked and sure enough two Russians where angling in on her tail. Too late now to climb away from danger, so she pushed the throttle into the emergency position and began what her Grampa used to call \u2018Contour Chasing\u2019. That\u2019s where you fly low and fast, hugging the ground as you sped along. And speed she did, with the bandits giving chase, the first dropping down low behind her in hopes of getting close enough for a shot, the second staying high to catch her if she tried to climb away. Lindsay knew that the Russians had the edge in speed, that if she kept this up of they would eventually catch her, but she wasn\u2019t worried. Well, maybe a little worried, but not too much, having seen the other three of her flight dropping in behind the bandits. Lindsay figured the best thing she could do now was to act as bait and keep the bandits distracted long enough for her team mates to get in behind them and start shooting. <br>\r\nThe plan was proceeding perfectly, right up to the point where Lindsay lingered a bit too long looking out her rear window, marveling at how well her team mates were maneuvering into position, only to look forward to find that the quiet tree lined valley she was currently hurtling down came to an abrupt end. A box canyon would be how it was described in the old westerns. Lindsay hauled back on the stick and climbed. In her minds eye she could see the Russian pilots practically salivating as she rose up into their gun sights, and prayed that her teammates were also closing in on the distracted enemy. Who would fire first was anyone\u2019s guess.<br>\r\n Lindsay crested the hill with inches to spare, a little amazed at how free of bullet holes her plane still was. It was as she started down the other side that she saw it. It was the most amazing cathedral she had ever seen. Even bombed out there was still an architectural beauty in the Gothic facade, facing east to catch the rising sun as it came over the hill. Beauty in the spires still rising into the sky. Beauty in the big stained-glass window currently approaching at over 500km per hour. Lindsay barely had time to wonder how the big, beautiful stained glass front had survived the bombing relatively intact when suddenly it wasn\u2019t so intact any longer, having acquired a BF109 shaped hole in the middle of it. <br>\r\nThe murals on the back wall became punctuated in the same fashion, although Lindsay didn\u2019t remember hitting them. She only found out about that part the next night when she got back from being dead and discovered the girls had set up what looked like a 16mm film projector pointed at the back wall of the bar tent. Colleen had copied the imagery of the crash from several different angles and had spliced together a \u2018Greatest Hit\u2019 reel. Of course the girls could have watched it at any time earlier but had waited for Lindsay to re-spawn so she could join them and they could all watched it together. There was even Popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Lindsay\u2019s kills didn\u2019t count because she hadn\u2019t survived the mission, but the rest of the girls had rung up an impressive tally, including the two Russians that had been chasing Lindsay, although it had been tough keeping it together after Lindsay\u2019s spectacular distraction. Fortunately, for the German side at least, the Russians seemed to have had an equally tough time and had been easy pickings. At least they had probably died laughing was how Colleen put it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After missing the day as a penalty for being killed, she didn\u2019t feel like watching and laughing over what the others had accomplished. She didn\u2019t feel like much like joining in anything. She just felt like being alone for a bit.

Hardly any alcohol.\u201d Bev sat for a couple of minutes, then broke the silence \u201cSo what\u2019s bothering you.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay wasn\u2019t going to say anything, then she sighed. Maybe talking would help.<br>\r\n \u201cI don\u2019t think Leslie likes me\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u201d, Bev shrugged. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like a lot of people. It\u2019s not the end\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s so unfair\u2019 whined Lindsay, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve done anything, not really.\u201d<br>\r\nBev tossed back another shot, then poured one for Lindsay and slid it across the table.<br>\r\n\u201cThen why do you think she doesn\u2019t like you. Did she say so\u201d?<br>\r\nLindsay tossed back the shot before answering \u201cNo, not as such\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do you know\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she doesn\u2019t seem too happy with me lately\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, because you crashed a couple of planes\u201d? Bev snorted, then motioned for the shot glass again \u201cShe\u2019ll get over it. Crashing is a traditional part of being in the Luftwaffe. It\u2019s inevitable. You know why?\u201d <br>\r\nWithout really pausing for an answer she kept going \u201cThere are maybe a dozen things you need to do in sequence to get a BF109 airborne, and then you need to undo most of them once you are. And if you forgot something you either have to fix it fast or you crash\u201d.<br>\r\nLindsay matched Bev\u2019s shot with one of her own. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s right\u201d.<br>\r\nBev shrugged \u201cCount them some day\u201d she said \u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised. That\u2019s why real life pilots have a checklist they use for everything. Want to guess who invented the check list\u201d?<br>\r\nLindsay didn\u2019t have a clue. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Some German guy\u201d? she guessed.<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, the ultra perfect ever precise master race. Well, you\u2019re wrong. The Germans did everything by memory. That\u2019s why their pilots were so good. The bad ones never graduated. And that mentality of flying appalled the British, who were very much fond of doing things by the book. All about neat little columns of numbers and checkmarks they were, so they came up with the idea of the check list. It didn\u2019t matter how bad a pilot you were, if you followed the check list you could get your machine up in the air. Another checklist and you were back down again. Ultimately, their ability to get more people into the air won them the war\u201d.<br>\r\nLindsay shook her head \u201cI thought it was the bravery of their pilots\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, maybe it was\u201d, Bev conceded \u201cI don\u2019t really know. The point is, every one is going to crash once in a while; don\u2019t let it get to you\u201d.<br>\r\nBy this time they had done away with the shot glass and were taking swallows right from the bottle they passed it back and forth as they talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay wasn\u2019t about to quit her self pity party so easily though.<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like I keep letting her down. No matter what I do, I always seem to screw it up\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cLet me ask you this then. Bev said, pressing her steepled fingers to her lips as she leaned her elbows on the table and looked hard at Lindsay. \u201cWhy is it so important to you that Leslie likes you\u201d?<br>\r\nWell I, umm, of course, ahh, it\u2019s, well\u2026 I, don\u2019t know, really. It just seems that she should\u201d.<br>\r\nBev shook her head sadly. \u201cI think that\u2019s about the stupidest thing I\u2019ve heard you say so far. Do you like her\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, do you like he enough to be her friend\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cOf course\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Tell me why\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cSure, it, well. I mean, I think I do. I, I guess I don\u2019t know\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you know\u201d?<br>\r\nLindsay was floundering under the questioning \u201cI, well, I guess I don\u2019t know her well enough\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Said Bev, pointing a finger at Lindsay \u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t know you either\u201d. Leslie doesn\u2019t form snap judgments. Once she gets to know you she\u2019ll like you for who you are or she won\u2019t, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. You can\u2019t make someone be your friend. And I\u2019ll tell you something else. She doesn\u2019t have to like you. She doesn\u2019t need to be your BFF or even your BF de\u2019jure. As long as she knows she can trust you things will work out\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this Bev got up from the table, but she wasn\u2019t quite done dispensing advise. She leaned in towards Lindsay. \u201cSo far you\u2019ve spent just about every night moaning about how Leslie doesn\u2019t like you\u201d. She said firmly \u201cThere\u2019re six other girls here. If you\u2019re going to spend the entire game moping about someone not liking you, pretty soon nobody\u2019s going to want to hang out with you. And that will really wreck any enjoyment you could have gotten out of the game\u201d.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay remained seated, taking sips from the bottle of tasty syrup Bev had left as she mulled over what had been said. <br>\r\nBev was right, of course. Righter than she knew. Lindsay was doing the same thing in game that she did in real life. Instead of embracing all the good things about the game she had been focused on one little negative aspect to the point of ruining everything, not only for her but the others as well. And in spite of being handed complete freedom to reinvent herself, to become the new and improved person she\u2019d always wanted to be, she\u2019d practically squandered it by sticking with old habits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to stop missing the good stuff, she decided. She was literally a new person, so it was time for some new habits. The change starts now, she decided, chugging the rest of the bottle down, then getting up and moving over to the main table where the others were sitting. Before she sat she stopped and gave a small salute to the 127th\u2019s mural on the wall above the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, look what the crash recovery team dragged in\u201d. Lorraine said as she watched her sit down \u201cDecided to join us, have you\u201d?<br>\r\nLindsay glanced back at the mural before answering.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, she said. \u201cI guess I did\u201d. And she meant it. As of now she was going to give being a part of the \u2018Mad Cows\u2019 her best shot.<br>\r\n\u201cNice salute. We should adopt that as a ritual\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cSeemed appropriate some how, although now I\u2019m wondering where the name came from, actually\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cJagdgeschwader? It\u2019s German for \u2018Hunting Wing\u2019. Kind of self explanatory when you see the translation. It usually refers to a fighter squadron\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I was referring to the \u2018Mad Cows\u2019 part. What made you decide to choose that as a name\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that. That was Lana-Raye\u2019s idea. Her and Leslie had a disagreement over a point of order or something with the last gaming group they were with. One of the boys trotted out the old \u2018They only call it \u2018PMS\u2019 because \u2018Mad Cow\u2019 was already taken\u2019 chestnut. Lana-Raye suggested that maybe the \u2018Mad Cows\u2019 should start their own group\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did the picture come from\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cLana-Raye has a niece that was studying graphic arts who did up a banner. Looks good up there doesn\u2019t it\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cI like it. It\u2019s kind of silly yet meaningful. We should put up some of her other pictures. Make it a little more cheery in here\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ca planning\u201d? piped in Colleen. \u201cGoing to pull an \u2018Allison Victoria\u2019 on us\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cProbably not\u201d, replied Lindsay, \u201cas I have no idea who you\u2019re talking about\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously? She hosted that reno show \u2018Kitchen Crashers\u2019 for years. And the spinoffs, Kitchen Crashers Vegas, Extreme Kitchen Crashers, Remember\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Crashers. hah hah hah! Funny\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u201d retorted Colleen, \u201cIt was a lot funnier before I had to explain it\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cColleen\u201d, Lorraine broke in \u201cRemember what we said about working a joke to death\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying Lindsay crashing into a church wasn\u2019t funny\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m saying to give it a rest\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cAww. I was just going so suggest that we get Lindsay her own show.  We can call it Cathedral Crashers\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cJoke is officially on life support now. Don\u2019t make us pull the plug\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cFine. But I want to be her wing man so I have a front row seat next time we go strafing trenches\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s pronounced Strah-fing\u201d. Addison piped up, eagerly wanting to be part of the conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s a German word meaning punish. The Germans used to say Gott Strafe Englund\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, Colleen rejoined \u201cAnd the British used to say \u2018I\u2019ll stay-rafe you bloody Huns back to the bloody stone age\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cActually\u201d, Lana-Raye put in \u201cI think either pronunciation is correct. I\u2019ve heard it both ways\u201d.<br>\r\nThe conversation bounced off in the direction of pronunciation, and how people kept mixing the soft and hard \u2018J\u2019s when sight reading German, then ricocheted into favorite foods, moved on to drinks, then skidded around a corner into fashion. Twenty minutes later they were back at fashion for the third time and discussing having a period authentic bathing suit contest when Lindsay\u2019s head thudding on the table brought the conversation to a stop.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lindsay. We\u2019re only joking. Don\u2019t go getting all over-dramatic on us\u201d.  <br>\r\n\u201cWha\u201d? Lindsay barely lifted her hear. \u201cNo, \u2019s okay. Jes a lot drunker than I sh\u2019be on beers\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cOh Wonderful\u201d. Lorraine said sarcastically. \u201cThe game has you pegged as a light weight. Too bad. You can get up to some serious drinking in these SIMs. Good parties too\u201d.<br>\r\nColleen grinned and stood up, spreading her arms wide, and with the voice of a Catholic Priest at high mass began to intone \u2018And lo, it came to pass, the lord Lorraine spake, and sayeth  \u2018Begone, for surely thou art a lightweight and unworthy of my sight\u2019 \u201c<br>\r\nLorraine rolled her eyes and buried her face in her hands, shaking her head. Heedless, Colleen continued.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then did she raise on high the Holy Fifth of Glenfidich, saying, \u2018Bless this, O Lord, that with it thou mayst become intoxicated, in thy mercy.\u2019 And the people did rejoice and did drinketh the bar dry of the scotches and beers and rums and brandies and whiskeys and lemony fruit coolers\u201d.<br>\r\nLana-Raye peevishly broke in \u201cYou about done, Colleen\u201d?<br>\r\nColleen continued, ignoring the tone of Lana-Raye\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd the holy barkeep spake, saying, \u2018Thy drink minimum shalt be three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number of the drinks thy shalt order, and the number of thy drinks shalt be three. Four shalt thou order if thy so desireth, but never shalt thou order two, excepting that thou then proceed immediately to ordereth thy a third. Five is right out, umm. I mean five is all right. Shoot. Lost it there\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess\u201d. Said Addison \u201cYou\u2019re a Monty Python fan, right\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cHow could you tell\u201d?  Was Lorraine\u2019s sarcastic aside.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know. I was thinking we could rename the bar\u201d said Colleen, half seriously \u201cAfter the Rabbit of Caerbannog\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think Lindsay\u201d? Colleen asked her semi conscious seat mate.<br>\r\n\u201cI think I enjoy dental surgery\u201d was what the mumbled response seemed to sound like. Colleen pulled Lindsay\u2019s head up so she wasn\u2019t talking into the table.<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t quite catch your transmission there, Crash. Can you repeat\u201d. <br>\r\nLindsay\u2019s mouth gaped for a moment. Then her eyes focused \u201cWhat\u201d? she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cDang girl, how much have you had to drink\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cDunno\u201d. Lindsay\u2019s forehead crinkled in concentration. \u201cThree, maybe four\u201d. She gestured weekly at the bottles in front of her.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget the shots of\u2026\u201d Bev started to say, then spotted the empty Schnapps bottle sitting on the small table \u201cHey, did you drink that entire bottle\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. S\u2019okay though. No alcohol, y\u2019 said\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cI said there was no alcohol taste. That stuff\u2019s 40 proof\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh\u201d. Colleen grinned \u201cShe may be a light weight but she drinks way above her weight class\u201d.  <br>\r\n\u201cI think that\u2019s enough for you\u201d. Lana-Raye advised. \u201cColleen, take her back to the barracks and put her to bed. And stick around to make sure she isn\u2019t attacked by the latrine again\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cBut that would derive the rest of you of my keen wit and hilarious sense of humor\u201d Colleen protested.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really\u201d? Lana-Raye said \u201cGee, I hadn\u2019t thought of that. Still, I think that\u2019s a sacrifice we\u2019re all willing to make if it gets Lindsay safely to bed\u201d.<br>\r\nWhen the other girls voiced similar sentiments Colleen dramatically rolled her eyes, picked Lindsay up and slid an arm around her shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on you\u201d. She said, half carrying, half dragging her along. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home\u201d.<br>\r\nOn the way they did stop at the latrine, which was blessedly peaceful and well behaved that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo women, and a bed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t make the Colonel Mad\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Actually, in her currect condition it could be broad daylight with a sign saying look here, and Lindsay would miss it.<br>\r\n\u201cDid anyone tell you about her earrings? The little diamond ones wears that she calls her family jewels\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cFamily jewels\u201d. Lindsay giggled at the phrase. \u201c \u2019S funny, cause family jewels is a eupfin... a youphan... a wahatchacall it name for\u2026um\u2026 ya know\u2026 um\u2026\u201d Lindsay faltered, Even extremely drunk she had a hard time talking about things that had always been a taboo subjects in mixed company.<br>\r\n \u201cA man\u2019s balls\u201d? Colleen said, obviously not as constrained by the same strict upbringing as Lindsay. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re talking about here\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a story behind them, but I probably shouldn\u2019t tell it.<br>\r\n\u201cAww. Come on, tell me a story.\u201d Lindsay giggled again.<br>\r\nSure thing sweety. You just curl up and make yourself comfortable, and Auntie Colleen will tell you a nice bed time story\u201d.<br>\r\nColleen sat against the head of the bed, and Lindsay curled up under her arm as requested. Both of them were giggling at this point, the image of Lindsay being told a bed time story like a little girl seemed particularly funny, if in completely different ways, to each of them.<br>\r\n\u201cIt starts with a Danish company. You know, the one that turns cremation ash into diamonds\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDin\u2019t know \u2018bout that\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cSimple process really, there\u2019s companies been doing it for years. Take carbon, heat, and high pressure. Presto. Tiny industrial diamonds for saw blades and drill bits\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh\u201d. Lindsay said softly, eyes half closed.<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, this Danish place figured out a way to get the larger jewelry grade ones. \u2018Course the diamond lobby freaked out and tried to shut \u2018em down. They tried to claim the artificial diamond were worthless so nobody would buy the product. Company was going bust until someone marketed the bright idea to cremate your beloved pet and memorialize them by turning them into a fine jewelry. Demand soared, and once they got the technique down it wasn\u2019t long before people moved from pets to turning the earthly remains of dear aunt Ethel into the center stone of the family heirloom.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay\u2019s eyes popped open. \u201cShesh got a dead people in \u2018er earlobes? \u2018S creepy.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIt get\u2019s creepier. And it\u2019s not just people. It\u2019s her fianc\u00e9. Bits of him, anyway.<br>\r\n \u201cEh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTurns out he was a cheating bastard with three other girlfriends.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, really?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYep. They were on holiday when she found out. He denied it at first, then turned it around and tried to make like it was her fault.<br>\r\nLong story short he wound up in hospital with a higher voice and what they called unspecified injuries, and she came home with a brand new pair of earrings\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSho th\u2019 diamonds\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cMore like diamond chips, actually\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre her ex\u2019s, umm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe word you\u2019re looking for is balls. Testicles. Stones. Reece\u2019s Pieces. Gonads. Whatever you want to call it, any chance for him to pass his DNA on to the next generation is now dangling from her earlobes\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. The Colonel is really a wonderful person, with just a few trust issues now\u201d. <br>\r\nSlowly, the implications of what she was hearing soaked into Lindsay\u2019s alcohol fogged mind. \u201cOh crap\u201d! She thought. \u201cAnd this is the woman I piss off every day\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cWould she really do that? Cut off a man\u2019s balls for lying to her\u201d.<br>\r\nLindsay hadn\u2019t realized she was thinking out loud until Colleen answered.<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely. And not just the balls. I suspect she\u2019d want the whole package and go for a matching necklace this time\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cOh God\u201d! Lindsay groaned<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019re fine. Us women she\u2019ll forgive for a lot of things. And we don\u2019t have the bits she\u2019s interested in anyway. But, like I said. You\u2019ll know if she was really mad at you\u201d.<br>\r\nIf she expected this last bit to comfort Lindsay, it didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Almost forgot. And all the girls lived happily ever after, the end\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWha\u201d? <br>\r\n\u201cGotta end a story with a \u2018Happily Ever After\u2019, even if it doesn\u2019t apply to everyone.

Night night\u201d!<br>\r\nAt this Colleen gave her a peck on the forehead, then turned out the light and crawled into her own bunk. Soon the soft sounds of her snores where all Lindsay could hear. That, and the muffled disjointed screams of her own foggy thoughts. Just what had she gotten herself into?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course all the stalls would be occupied by the time she got there, so she trotted over to the latrine. By the time she was finished there a stall had opened up and she was able to grab a shower before heading to the mess tent to join up with the rest of the squadron.<br>\r\nBreakfast was soft scrambled eggs with bacon, hash browns, 3 kinds of fruit, and a soft custardy cake like crepe layered with a thick topping of caramelized apples that Allison said was called a German Apple Pancake. Whether it was really German was a good question. Whether it tasted good was beyond doubt. Like all the food, it was absolutely fantastic. It was with no little reluctance some 20 minutes later that Lindsay finally pushed her plate away. If this was real life all the delicious food would have her really packing on weight. Maybe she\u2019d go for a run later and work off all the extra calories, like that girl she knew in high school. That girl could eat anything and yet never put on any excess weight.<br>\r\nDumping her plate at the wash station, she grabbed a fresh cup of coffee and sat with the others as they sat chit chatting around the stove. She didn\u2019t really paying attention to what was being said, just let the idle chatter wash over her in waves like a soothing bath of noise. Before they knew it, it was time for flight duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf anyone\u2019s interested \u201cColleen radioed as they escorted the 87th north \u201cThe church of Lindsay is directly below us.\u201d<br>\r\nColleen was Lindsay\u2019s wing man for the flight. Lindsay was grateful, even with the reasons Colleen freely admitted. At least with her watching her back maybe she could score more than the pitiful 2 trucks and a tank that her score card currently boasted, although boasted was probably the wrong word. <br>\r\n\u201cInteresting way point Colleen\u201d. Came the Colonel\u2019s voice \u201cGood code word for a rendezvous point as well. That\u2019s, what, 20 minutes due north\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201c22 minutes, 10 seconds exactly\u201d.<br>\r\nThe squadron was escorting the 87th on a mission to take out a munitions factory, with a secondary target of a rail depot. Both targets were hit with the fighters meeting little opposition, so once the big planes were safely home the 127th split up and spent the rest of the day hunting for targets of opportunity. Blue flight got lucky and strayed across a Russian bombing run; the Colonel and Linda each bagged a PE-2 from that, and everybody got a YAK or two from the escort, with Lorraine hogging the lions share with three. Even Addison scored her first dogfight kill, finishing off a YAK that wouldn\u2019t give up, after Lorraine had crippled it. Mistaking Addison for an easier target, the YAK had swung back and tried to get behind her. Addison drew him into a nice simple powered loop and then pounced on him when he stalled out. <br>\r\nNobody came near Red flight, so Lana-Raye and Lorraine took off to strafe an airfield or two, while Lindsay and Colleen amused themselves by chasing down convoy trucks. They each managed to bag several, including a group just as they were about to head home for the day. A line of five came trundling over a bridge, then obligingly stayed in a straight line as Colleen swooped down on them, so she was able to strafe the line of them, as well as take out the bridge, one pass. Lindsay did a follow up pass when she spotted that one of the damaged trucks was somehow still mobile and limping away from the rest of the burning column. As Lindsay came in low the driver abandoned the truck and ran. Like an idiot, he ran away from the truck straight in line with Lindsay\u2019s strafing. All she needed to do was hold the trigger a second longer and he was a dead man, killed by his own stupidity. At the last second the driver threw himself to the ground and put his arms uselessly up to cover his head. A twitch of the rudder and the deadly line of bullets veered harmlessly to one side of the prone victim. Then she was up and away, not even bothering to look back at the driver, who was very much astonished to find that, against all odds he was still alive. When he looked back at his foot prints, and the machine gun churned path of earth that followed them before veering off at the last second, he knew why. Maybe not why, exactly, but the how. <br>\r\nAs for the why, even Lindsay couldn\u2019t really say, so she tried not to think about it as she climbed back up and joined Colleen. \u201cOne more truck for the tally\u201d, was Colleen\u2019s only comment as the two headed for home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next two weeks Lindsay got quite good at ground kills, which was probably a blessing as that was all she seemed to get. The colonel, using the excuse of letting the girls get used to each other\u2019s flying styles, mixed up the flights quite regularly using some complicated roster that paired you up with a different wing man every second day. It certainly kept you on your toes, but Lindsay looked at her record and began to suspected a darker reason. It could have just been a statistical anomaly, but it seemed that no matter what flight Lindsay was on, it was the other flight who found and shot down the Russian planes. Almost as if the game was programmed to keep aircraft off her score card.<br>\r\n  She continued to add trucks, and jeeps, and tanks, and a couple more of those weird wagon things, and a goat (purely by accident). Never individual soldiers though. A machine gun nest she had no trouble with, they were firing back after all. And buildings with snipers. But to target a single soldier, or two, running or not, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to pull the trigger. But that was okay, there were plenty of other ground based targets, including parked aircraft, for her to blast away at. Not that she spent all her time hugging the ground. She did get into a couple of dog fights that resulted in battle damage on both sides. Yet an actual honest to goodness in-flight aircraft kill remained stubbornly absent from her score card.<br>\r\nOn the plus side, she also hadn\u2019t been shot down yet, so at least in that regard she was leading her group. That, and crashing on landing.<br>\r\nIt seemed like every second landing she was either ground looping or planting the nose and wrecking her machine. The first couple of times she\u2019d freaked out, until she reminded herself that she had decided she wasn\u2019t going to worry about what the Colonel said, not about the planes. And oddly enough the Colonel herself had also backed off, not freaking out every time Lindsay put her plane out of commission.  Of course, when both her main and back-up planes were out she did make her fly the gull winged JU-87 dive bomber. But Lindsay kind of enjoyed that. She was doing nothing but ground kills anyway, so the Stuka just made her all the better at it. <br>\r\nIt was Lana-Raye that came up with the idea of what she called \u2018Aversion Therapy\u2019 or making the penalty for damaging your plane by screwing up your landing something unpleasant enough that the offender would go out of their way to avoid having to ever do it again. Something slightly demeaning. Something like serving drinks at the Gasthaus while dressed in traditional Oktoberfest garb. And by traditional not the modest Dirndl with it\u2019s full skirt and high neckline, but the more popular (among men at least) Dirnlkjoler that would be worn by the more adventurous party girls and waitresses who\u2019s living depended on the size of tips they got. The blouse still had the puffed sleeves of the traditional costume, but was cut to allow bare shoulders and a deep neckline. Couple that with the laced up bodice and a push up bra, and the girls of the 127th sported cleavage that, if actually worn during the time period the game was set in, would be banned in all but the most progressive of US states. Fortunately they were both not actually in that time period, or the United States. Which was good, because Lorraine added an even racier  aspect to the costume by pinning up gussets in the laced edging of the mid thigh length skirt, giving a tantalizing glimpse of the chiffon underskirt, and garter belt holding the white stockings in place. Personally, Lindsay had her doubts about the authenticity claimed, even though Loraine swore up and down that every part of the outfit was authentic, right down to the traditional lace thong. <br>\r\nAnd all of it was really quite silly, really. Due to the \u2018No Men\u2019 policy enforced at \u2018Die Wutenden Kuhe Gasthaus\u2019 the only patron who might truly have appreciated the look was Linda, whom Lindsay wondered if wasn\u2019t somehow involved in the outfit selection. What ever the reason, by the third (consecutive) night, the aversion punishment had taken on the feeling of good natured hazing. To Lindsay it became just another outfit, nothing particularly special. Even when Colleen stuffed a couple of wet bills down her blouse as a tip Lindsay just rolled her eyes and took it in stride. And gave them all back (one at a time) the next night when Colleen overshot the runway and tore off a wing on the radio hut. Of course Lana-Raye got it worse when it was her turn. But again, worse was a relative term when nobody really went overboard. Everything that went on happened in the spirit of good fun. Perhaps because of this the punishment was tolerated and actually helped develop a deepening respect for each other amongst the squadron. Because you trusted that the person on the other end could be expected to behave in a reasonable fashion. And in return they trusted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, it was good to take a night off from drinking every once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her BF109 danced to her slightest whim. And it was barely good enough. No matter what she did, no matter how she dodged, the YAK on her tail grew relentlessly closer. What she really needed was back up, a wing man to jump in and break up the battle and give her a chance, but she hadn\u2019t seen or heard from her wingman, or any of her flight for that matter, since the squadron of YAKs had jumped the bomber wing they had been escorting. The 127th had scattered, chasing and being chased. Fortunately only one of the YAKs seemed interested in Lindsay. Unfortunately, he was very interested. He was also very persistent. Lindsay tried every trick she could think to shake him while he clung to her tail with the tenacity of a bull dog. And, in spite of the desperateness of the situation, Lindsay was enjoying the fight immensely. This was the kind of flying she had envisioned when she first saw the ad copy. Man and machine against man and machine. They were turning and twisting around each other at just over 1,000 meters, with the low altitude superiority of the YAK very much in evidence. In spite of her skills it was all Lindsay could do to keep out of the gun sights the YAK was trying to bring to bear on her. The YAK didn\u2019t carry a lot of ammunition, but it wouldn\u2019t take many hits from the 7.62mm machine guns and that 20mm cannon to turn Lindsay and her plane into shredded tinfoil. <br>\r\nLindsay flew with all skill and precision she\u2019d possessed, and yet it was all she could do to stay alive. Sooner or later the YAK would be in position, then he\u2019d fire and it would be all over. The YAK\u2019s pilot was better at turning. His plane was better at climbing at this altitude. And faster in a dive. He was just that much more maneuverable than she was. Or was he? Chance time baby, she thought grimly, and she put her plane into a shallow right bank, dropping her flaps a notch to give a touch more lift and slowing herself down slightly. As expected, the YAK turned with her, maneuvering to get her into the center of his sights. When she saw this she tightened the turn and cut her throttle slightly, not enough that he would detect, but still enough to slow down. Then she dropped the nose towards the ground to throw off his aim just as he fired. <br>\r\nThe tracers passed harmlessly but still way too close as the YAK overshot her position, Lindsay flipped her plane over and turned hard left, opening the throttle and pushing her machine to its limits as she swung the nose around, trying to center her opponent in her gun sights and squeeze off a few shots of her own. The YAK rolled out of the way, and she rolled right along with it. Now the two planes were doing a simultaneous barrel roll around each other, upside down and directly above relative to the other as they jockeyed for position. Lindsay looked up and with a shock realized she could see the other pilot looking up at her, a wild crazy grin splitting his face. A grin that she realized mirrored the one on her. Unable to resist, she brought up her right hand and saluted her opponent. To her amazement, the salute was returned. Quickly taking advantage of the fact her opponent now only had one hand on the controls she broke out of the barrel roll and went into a shallow dive. Moments later the YAK did the same behind her. Once again, he tried to get into a position where he could fire. Lindsay banked into a tight right turn, watching the YAK carefully. The timing would be tight for what she was going to try, if it was off even by a little she\u2019d likely be ripped to shreds by cannon fire. Wait for it, she thought, focusing all her attention on the Yak, judging its position. Lindsay held the turn for several long nerve wracking seconds, then at the last possible second flipped her plane 180 degrees and banked hard left. For a brief moment, the most dangerous moment, she tracked square across her pursuer\u2019s gun sights and should have been an easy target. But the element of luck was with her, and by the time the YAK reacted and pulled the trigger she was across and away with just a few holes in her tail, the rest of the tracers falling harmlessly below her. Moments later the YAK also flipped and banked to the left, following her. He was still on her tail, but now the two aircraft were following the same path as they inscribed a great circle in the sky, the YAK moving just a little faster and slowly catching up. Lindsay was not about to let the YAK do that though. She pulled a lever and deployed the slats. The BF109 lurched and slowed slightly, but more importantly the tight turn she was making grew even tighter, smaller that the one the YAK was following. Now, although he was slightly faster, he was also traveling a lot further. She was pulling away from the line of his guns. If they kept this up eventually it would be her guns coming to bear on him. It didn\u2019t take long for the YAK pilot to figure this out, and once he did he broke away. When Lindsay broke out of the turn behind him she was slightly too far back for her guns to be truly effective. She let of a burst anyway, just to let him know she was there, and was pleased to see the YAK dive away in response. For her part she was just as quick to begin climbing up to where her good friend altitude was. They were done playing for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why weren\u2019t they answering the radio? And where had all that broken cloud cover come from? It hadn\u2019t been there when they were escorting the bombers. Surely someone would have mentioned it. Come to think of it, The Colonel had mentioned a possibility of bad weather during the mission briefing. Stubbornly, Lindsay continued to circle, trying the radio at various intervals, hoping for contact with anyone of the 127th.  <br>\r\n When nobody answered she tried the frequency for the 104th, and finally the 42nd. The only thing that answered her was just static, so after about half an hour of endless circling and watching the clouds build up, she decided to give up and head for home on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she flew towards base the clouds grew thicker, the breaks between them growing less and less frequent until you were hard pressed to see any holes at all. Lindsay wasn\u2019t worried. Not too much. She knew where she was, approximately, and although she couldn\u2019t see the ground she figured that if she flew due south for 30 minutes she would be close enough to the airfield that she should be able to spot it even if the clouds was only 1,000 meters above the deck. She figured this was a great plan, until she spotted a group of 30 or so aircraft way ahead in the distance, flying a ragged V formation in a sort of figure 8 pattern hunting pattern. Too far away for Lindsay to positively identify as Russian, but their behavior was odd enough that she decided not to take any chances. She dropped down into the clouds to hide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her 109 was not equipped with the radio directional compass that would have made it a snap to locate her home base, it did have enough other instrumentation that allowed the 109 to operate \u2018flying blind\u2019. The artificial horizon to keep her wings level. The gyro compass to keep her heading steady. A magnetic compass to correct the gyro when it wandered. An altimeter so she could tell how high she was. Vertical climb indicator so she could tell if she was climbing or sinking. Instrumentation that was needed, as the swirling cloud outside the window could play tricks on your mind. She knew that from the introduction to instrument flight tutorial she\u2019d taken when she was learning to fly DC-3s. The human mind is wired to seek patterns, and will try to form them even when none exists. There is a reason native folklore is rich with tales of beast and beings that lurk in the clouds. The result of a mind trying to make sense of the swirling mist. It would see patterns where there were none. Patterns that could get you killed in mid air. The way around it was to focus on your instruments. Cloud says you\u2019re falling, but your altimeter and vertical show no change? Trust your instruments. Cloud tells you the plane is turning but the compass and horizon are steady? Trust your instruments. Your instruments will feed you information you can trust. Lindsay focused on her instruments as she descended into the swirling grey mist, using small corrections to bring them back when they strayed too far from where they should be reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She would still be over enemy territory, and having no idea how far down the cloud bank went, she didn\u2019t want to drop out into clear air only to find herself in reach of the anti aircraft fire from the ground. She decided to stay at 7,000 and feel her way home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, she added the clock to the multitude of instruments she was watching. Time was another measured quantity that stretched oddly inside the cloud. The minute hand seemingly took an hour to travel a tense 10 minutes. And then not 5 subjective minutes later it was telling her 20 minutes had gone by. The swirling gray played with her mind. screaming that she\u2019d been in there forever, but she trusted her instruments and held steady at 7,000 until the full 30 minutes had passed. By now, as she reckoned, she should be over German occupied territory. It was time to figure out where she was, so she began once again slowly feeling her way down out of the cloud. Although she had become acclimatized to flying through cloud over the last half hour when she finally broke through at 5,000 she let out a small sigh of relief, then glanced downward. What she saw made her pull quickly back up into the cloud again. Right below her, maybe 500 meters or so on the same heading, were three Russian bombers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy the Russians hadn\u2019t fired on her as she broke out of the cloud she couldn\u2019t say. They certainly had the opportunity. Unless she was mistaken and they were not Russians. After a full minute (watching the clock again) she slowly descended. Not completely out of the cloud, but low enough that the cloud thinned a little and she could see through gaps in it.<br>\r\nThe aircraft were Russians all right. There was no mistaking the red star decorating each wing, even if they hadn\u2019t had the distinctive silhouette of the Peska Pe-2 model 87 twin engine bombers. In addition to the three model 87\u2019s that she had first spotted, there was a model 110 that must have been right underneath her when she\u2019d first broke cover. Thankfully, they hadn\u2019t seen her. That much was obvious by the way the turret guns, the ones that by rights should have been tracking her and preparing to rip her to shreds, were still stowed in travel position. The bombers even had their navigation lights for crying out loud. It was either a trap or a particularly dumb AI flight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She pulled up in a loop at the last second, almost too late, having tried to maximize the few seconds she\u2019d had to fire on her target. Her 109 staggered and clawed its way back up into the gray mists above, disappearing once more into the cloud. Not having the time to build up enough real airspeed to be gracefully aerobatic, Lindsay staggered over the top of the inverted loop solely on by virtue of the sheer horsepower behind her prop.  When she came out of the cloud again she was pointed straight down and, while not exactly where she thought she\u2019d be, close enough that she was able to correct and fire a burst into the trailing Peska, shredding the cockpit just ahead of those bunny ears that were the 110\u2019s most distinguishing characteristic.  The 110 lurched and flopped over into a spinning dive as she roared past. The remaining two bombers veered off, banking in opposite directions as Lindsay pulled out of her dive, and since the one on the right was closest she went after it, catching up quickly and firing a long burst that she held until the bomber caught fire and a wing came off.<br>\r\nThen she turned her attention to the forth bomber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dumping its bombs, evidently hoping to lighten the load and gain the speed and maneuverability it need to escape. An escape that an adrenaline hyped Lindsay wasn\u2019t about to let happen easily.<br>\r\n The crew had either been sleeping or had their attention otherwise distracted when she first attacked. Which ever it was, the survivors were giving her their full attention now. As she drew near the defensive guns swiveled in her direction and firing, warning her off. She fired back, a long shot that was more for her moral than inflicting any damage, both aircraft were too far away from each other for either guns to be effective. Following at a safe distance for a few moments, she studied the bomber, getting an idea of its heading and speed. Then, with a wry grin, she climbed back up into the cloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Carefully watching the clock and gyro compass, she did the math in her head. The bomber looked to be doing about 300k, she was currently doing 350. If she estimated the position correctly, she would be over top of him in slightly less than 90 seconds.<br>\r\n84 seconds later she dove out of the cloud. Too far off to the left and almost right along side, too badly positioned to get a good shot so she swooped back up and back into the concealing mist as tracer fire from the turret gunner started flicking her way. Tight left turn, hold for 20 seconds until she did a complete 360, then drop down again. This time she was in a much better position. She centered the sights and got of a 3 second burst that might of hit something or not, she didn\u2019t stick around to find out as once more tracer fire started flicking her way and she ducked back up into the cloud. Four more times she did this, managing twice to be in position to squeeze of a quick burst before being chased off by tracers. On the fifth she decided to change it up a little. This time she flew a straight heading that would take her over the bomber, Holding her course for a good 2 minutes before doing split S turn, coming out of the cloud cover head on in front of the bomber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shouldn\u2019t have worked. All the pilot had had to do was change his heading by 15 or 20 degrees and she would have come out too far away to get an effective shot. And although he had changed course slightly, it wasn\u2019t enough. Lindsay made him pay for that error with a short burst that left him with a tattered and smoking engine as she roared past. An Immelman turn brought Lindsay back up into the cloud cover again as tracer licked at her tail. If it worked once is should again, right?  Wrong. AI or human, the pilot wasn\u2019t stupid enough to fall for the same trick twice. This time when she dropped down she found that he had changed course and she was facing in the wrong direction when she came out. Tracer fire flicked around her once again, so up she went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they were playing a game of cat and mouse, with her trying to guess which way he\u2019d run, and him trying to guess where she\u2019d come out of the clouds at. They kept this up for several minutes, long enough that Lindsay was beginning to hope the defensive gunners would run out of ammunition before she did, until she popped down and discovered a swarm of Russian fighters making a beeline for their position. The Russian cavalry had finally arrived, so she pulled the stick back and climbed back into the swirling gray that was currently her best friend. In the thick mist she altered course, picking an angle that took her not towards the fighter, or directly back into friendly territory, but one that took her at an oblique and hopefully unpredictable angle away from both. Either it worked, or the Russians were not about to climb into the clouds after her, because the next time she dropped out of the cloud again she was alone. Once again she began the task of trying to identify where she was in relation to home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s nothing like looking for your base as the clouds grow darker and lower, and the ground gets more and more monochrome. You thought you knew where you were, but the landmarks aren\u2019t there, and you are rapidly running out of time.<br>\r\nLindsay felt the desperation threatening to crush her spirit. It couldn\u2019t end like this, could it? It was so unfair. Then she spotted a familiar object. It was a cathedral. The big one that was special to her. The one with the airplane silhouetted in the big stained glass. The battle with the bomber had dragged her a lot further north that she expected, but at least she knew where she was now. With a feeling of relief she turned nose south and headed home as the darkening clouds slowly pushed lower. By the time she cleared the outer marker on final approach there was only about 500 meters of ceiling left, but by then it didn\u2019t matter. She was home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her first aerial kill, and she couldn\u2019t wait to tell everyone. <br>\r\nToo early for dinner, she figured everyone would be hanging out at the Gasthaus. Walking at a quick pace, almost running, she hurried over. She\u2019d play it cool, she decided, sort of casually bring it up in conversation. Something along the lines of \u2018So how was your day? Mine, oh, nothing special. Dog fight with a yak, shot down a bomber or two. How was yours\u2019? <br>\r\nSure enough, Linda and Colleen were at the bar when she entered, Addison, Beverly, and Lorraine were seated around the small table, bottles already in front of them stating how they had planned to spend the rest of the afternoon. All conversation stopped as she walked in, then broke into excited babbling.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere you been girl\"? Colleen said, rushing over and hugging her. \u201cLast we saw of you was when the Russians hit us. We thought maybe you\u2019d been shot down\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost\u201d, Lindsay replied, thoughts of playing it casual evaporating as soon as she walked through the door. She began to eagerly relate the events of the day. <br>\r\n\u201cI got tangled up with a YAK that wouldn\u2019t quit. We must have fought for an hour. When I finally got rid of him nobody would answer the radio. You guys aren\u2019t going to believe what happened on the way home.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess\u201d, Lorraine broke in with a voice like a wet blanket. \u201cYou ran into a squadron of fighters? Yeah, we saw them. Too many of them so we left them alone. And we wanted to get home before the clouds closed the airport down. Speaking of which, you should let the colonel know your back\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, You didn\u2019t try to tangle with them did you\u201d? Bev asked, looking worried.<br>\r\n\u201cDo I look stupid\u201d? Lindsay replied, \u201cNo, I went down into the clouds to sneak passed them. But this is the really wild part. You\u2019ll never guess what I found hiding under the clouds\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cA wardrobe\u201d? Asked Lorraine lazily, \u201cWith a secret passage to a magical land of rainbows and unicorns\u201d? <br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can see you\u2019re not really interested\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cIf it\u2019s another truck story you\u2019re probably right\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cWell\u201d, A voice came from behind her, \u201cI, for one, would love to hear what you\u2019ve been up to, Ms Anderson\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No doubt Leslie was going to take her to task for failing to come straight home.<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Colonel, uh, sir\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cCare to relate why you didn\u2019t come home with the rest of the flight\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cI got separated from the flight. Couldn\u2019t find them so I came home\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cThat much I figured\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cI tried to radio. Really, I did. Nobody answered\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cNot surprising, seeing as the radio has a hole in it\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cIt does\u201d? Lindsay asked, shocked, trying to remember when she\u2019d actually been hit.<br>\r\n\u201cWe were just over at the hanger. From the condition of your plane it looks like you saw a bit of action today\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cAt least you didn\u2019t crash on landing for a change. I believe for that at least you are owed some congratulations\u201d.<br>\r\n \u201cUm, thank you, sir\u201d? Lindsay said, not sure if that was a compliment or not\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cNow I believe you were about to tell us all what you found so interesting under the clouds that made you late to return\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cUm, sure\u201d. <br>\r\nLindsay had always had a problem speaking in front of any one she considered an authority figure, and the Colonel certainly qualified as authority at the moment.<br>\r\nGone was the giddy excitement she first felt when walking into the place. <br>\r\n\u201cWell\u201d, she said nervously, \u201cWhen I came out of the clouds there were four Peshkas right below me\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u201d, Exclaimed Colleen \u201cYou\u2019re kidding\u201d!<br>\r\n\u201cNo, really\u201d.  <br>\r\nNow all the girls started chattering excitedly for details talking over each other and asking questions, mainly along the lines of  \u201cWhat did you do\u201d and \u201cDid you get any of them\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cI got shots on all four\u201d. Lindsay exclaimed, the giddy excitement start to return now that she started to relate the tale of the encounter. \u201cNot sure what happened to the first one but the third one exploded, so I know I killed him for sure. Fairly sure I got the second. Tried to get the forth, but couldn\u2019t get enough good shots to knock him down.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo way\u201d. Said Lorraine, still being the buzz kill she started the evening as, \u201cYou finally got a kill? I find that hard to believe\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind her\u201d. Bev put in \u201cShe\u2019s just pissed off because some hot shot from the 104th stole two of her kills today\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t count. I damage them, and while I maneuver into position to finish them along comes bone head and steals the kill\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cBe that as it may\u201d Bev continued airily, \u201cI for one am glad Lindsay finally got her first.  <br>\r\n\u201cMaybe even two\u201d. Lindsay grinned.<br>\r\n\u201cActually\u201d, the Colonel broke in, shaking her head, \u201cI\u2019m afraid Lindsay is slightly mistaken about her kills today\u201d. A slight smile playing at the corner of her lips. <br>\r\n\u201cNot two\u201d? Lindsay was dismayed. \u201cI thought for sure I might have got a second\u201d.<br>\r\n The colonel still shook her head. <br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least I got one\u201d. Lindsay said, then felt her heart sinking as the Colonel just shook her head again. \u201cI know I got one. They\u2019re not taking that away are they? They can\u2019t. I saw it explode\u201d!<br>\r\n\u201cThey can\u2019t take any of them away\u201d. The colonel said, breaking into a wide grin. \u201cYou officially got all four\u201d!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Someone said \u201cI gotta see this for myself\u201d, and the squad rushed to the hanger attached to Leslies office where the leader board was mounted.<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d, they heard Leslie shout after them, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to what your CO says\u201d.<br>\r\nThe leader board in the main hanger confirmed what the Colonel had said. After weeks of logging nothing but ground kills Lindsay was finally on the board with four bomber aircraft. For a few minutes they compared their scores against each other, and while Lindsay hadn\u2019t yet caught up with the rest of the group, she wasn\u2019t that far back. Colleen excused herself, then she and Lana-Raye took off to the radio hut. <br>\r\nAs the rest of the group walked back to the Gasthaus to celebrate, there was much laughing and ribbing, which Lindsay both took and gave, once again feeling the giddiness that she had felt after landing return.. <br>\r\nWhen they got back to the Gasthaus they were startled to find Leslie behind the bar wearing her own version of the Dirnlkjole.<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u201d, she said by way of explanation \u201cSeeing as none of you crashed today, I figured it was my turn\u201d.<br>\r\nAn hour and a half later Colleen and Lana-Raye came in, ready to thread the fruits of their labor into the projector. Whatever Colleen did on real life must have given her a cinematographic back ground, her spliced together \u2018Best Of\u2019 reels were always really good, and she out did herself that night, splicing together a reel showing the unsuspecting bombers and Lindsay\u2019s attack, set to the JAWS sound track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie in particular was impressed by Lindsay\u2019s use of the cloud as cover, saying most people would just use it to duck and hide, and that her ability to judge where she was and launch an attack was quite impressive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Colonel was confusing. Lindsay had thought that she would be all stand offish and authoritarian, but watching her taking part in the drinking party that had become the official nightly ritual of the 127th you would think she was just another one of the girls.<br>\r\nAnd tonight she\u2019d willingly put on her own Dirnlkjoler, one that was tailored specifically to emphasize her size and shape, so different from the rest of the squad. Lead by example, she\u2019d said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she\u2019d exhibited a playful side that Lindsay didn\u2019t recall ever seeing before, the way she\u2019d teased her, leading her on about the number of kills she\u2019d made today.<br>\r\nTonight, she watched Leslie, really noticing her for the first time as a person instead of a commanding officer. She\u2019d never noticed before the butterfly barrettes that Leslie used to hold her braids together. Of course the butterflies had little iron crosses in the middle of each wing. But that\u2019s what you\u2019d expect of a German officer, right?<br>\r\nNow, watching her tend the bar and wisecrack with the rest of the group, she was seeing a human side of Leslie she\u2019d never noticed before, and that was confusing her. And then, as the truth hit her, it wasn\u2019t so confusing anymore. All this time she\u2019d been seeing Leslie was a superior officer, and her mind had automatically lumped Leslie in with all the other people in that category. The boss in charge of the outfit, The person of authority whose mission in life was to make sure you didn\u2019t have any fun. Now she realized, this wasn\u2019t her boss. Leslie was just another player. Someone who was in the game specifically to have fun. She was having fun playing the officer, and the rest were having fun letting her be in charge. Lindsay should have realized this weeks ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept the diamond chips glinting in Leslie\u2019s ear lobes reminded Lindsay of a darker side of the Colonel. One she didn\u2019t want to see.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was one of those rare times when she was feeling like she could do no wrong. <br>\r\n\u201cI missed how you got separated from the flight earlier today\u201d Leslie said conversationally.<br>\r\nLindsay smart mouthed her reply. \u201cThat, I\u2019m afraid, is a tale long in the telling. And the kind that makes a person rather thirsty while telling, if you get where I\u2019m coming from\u201d.<br>\r\nLeslie gave her the kind of look librarians studied years to master. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you could consider it a debriefing for your commanding officer, if you get where I\u2019m coming from\u201d. She replied in a dangerously level tone. <br>\r\nLindsay\u2019s confidence took a nose dive, she gulped and started to stammer an apology, but before she could get two words out Leslie smiled and put a beer on the bar in front of her. <br>\r\n\u201cSo, what happened\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cIt was when the YAKs first jumped us\u201d, Lindsay said \u201cColleen went after one, and his wingman went after Colleen, so I went after the wing man. I was just getting a bead on him when suddenly I was getting fire from someone on my 6, so I broke off and tried to lose him. Unfortunately he was very persistent. I don\u2019t think he got a good hit on me, but it was darned close a couple of times\u201d.<br>\r\nThe rest of the room drifted closer, listening as Lindsay described the various techniques she\u2019d tried to break away, until they were all standing in rapt attention as she reached the part of how the two had wound up staring at each other during the barrel roll, then broke into laughter when she told them how she\u2019d used the salute as a distraction to try and gain position.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then, it happened\u201d! she said, taking a large drink of her beer for dramatic effect.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened\u201d? ask Addison, elbows on the table as she listened enraptured, \u201cFinish the story. What happened\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cThen I tricked him into overshooting my position, turned the advantage, and chased him away\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t shoot him down\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cNot today\u201d, Lindsay said\u201d, lowering her voice, then turning and looking off into the distance, \u201cBut you\u2019re still out there somewhere, my friend. And someday, somewhere, we will meet again\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd in the category of best melodramatic performance in an insignificant supporting role, if I may have the envelope please\u201d! Said Lorraine, somewhat sarcastically.<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s not a bad idea\u201d, Colleen added. \u201cI kind of wish you\u2019d spoken up earlier, I could have added it to your best of reel.

She had no doubt that Colleen, drunk as she was, would be back in a couple of hours with a new reel that included the added dog fight footage. <br>\r\n  She didn\u2019t return that night. When an artist gets inspired they lose themselves in their work, and it was over a year before Lindsay saw the result posted on Colleen\u2019s YouTubeToo channel. A short, sappy, and slightly humorous video revolving around a young pilot torn between tracking down the enemy ace responsible for the death of her husband, and finding a hair style that worked for her. The dog fight and subsequent bar soliloquy scene was cut and mixed with dialog lifted from several drinking sessions, all stitched together to form a fairly cohesive tale of obsession, respect, admiration, and changing hairstyles that sounded as if it was scripted by a romance novelist. It actually won some prestigious award in a category of art form that she\u2019d never heard of. Not for the acting, however.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBut that was in the future. Currently most of the squad was still drinking the evening away. Lindsay shifted her stool a little closer to the bar so she could rest her elbows on the bar top more comfortably.<br>\r\n \u201cHey Colonel\u201d, she said, suddenly feeling apologetic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. About earlier today, I mean. I didn\u2019t want to worry you\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay\u201d, Leslie replied. \u201cNot your fault really. Nothing to worry about. I was a little shocked when your leader board status started totaling up points like crazy though\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I guess after not seeing any movement to see it jump like that was a bit of a shock\u201d.<br>\r\nThere was a minute\u2019s pause while Lindsay cast about, trying to think of something else to talk about. The leader board and the way it calculated points was a topic that had been talked about practically every night over the course of the game, and most of the girls, including Lindsay, where heartily sick of it. Even with her new points Lindsay was reluctant to continue using it as the topic of conversation, so she changed it to one that was standing right in front of her.<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u201d, she said suddenly \u201cI like what you\u2019ve done with your dress. It\u2019s a little different from ours\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u201d. Leslie smiled \u201cI had the supply guys tailor one to fit me. And I had it styled to be more befitting of an officer. Of course the shoes don\u2019t really go with it, but they\u2019re all I have for now. Maybe I\u2019ll see if I can pick some up in Voroshilovgrad\u201d.<br>\r\nThe Russian city was a three hour flight away. Lindsay thought that was a long way to go just to shop for shoes and said so. <br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a long way to go for a pair of shoes. Why don\u2019t you just have the quartermaster issue a pair\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously? And miss the opportunity to go shoe shopping? What woman does that\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cOne that thinks it\u2019s too long trip for shoes? It just doesn\u2019t sound like fun\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cFor real\u201d? the Leslie asked.<br>\r\nLorraine had come up to the bar for a refill in time to hear the Colonel\u2019s question. \u201cWhat\u2019s for real?<br>\r\n\u201cTurns out Lindsay here doesn\u2019t like shopping\u201d.<br>\r\nIt was one of those quiet moments that happen every so often in busy places. The juke box was changing songs, so the room was quiet enough that everyone heard the Colonel\u2019s comment. Uh oh, Lindsay thought, seeing every head in the place looking her direction. Women were supposed to love shopping, so not liking it was suspicious.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that\u201d. Lindsay protested, trying to think of a plausible explanation that wouldn\u2019t give her away. What the heck, she decided. She was who she was, at least for the time being. <br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe I did say that\u201d. She admitted \u201cWhat I meant is I, well, I like to look and all that, but I also like to know what I\u2019m looking at. I\u2019m not all that crazy about shopping for shoes, and Voroshilovgrad is in occupied Russia so everything will be in a language I don\u2019t understand, so even more difficult, and it just doesn\u2019t sound like a fun time to me\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cI know the feeling.\u201d Lana-Raye said. \u201cI feel the same why when I\u2019m looking at Vitamins\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on Lindsay\u201d Lorraine said, taking the Colonels side, \u201cWhere\u2019s your sense of adventure\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cShot down over St Petersburg? No, seriously. I like to shop, but I also like to know what I\u2019m looking at. How am I supposed to know if a 15 ruble shoe is a good sale if I don\u2019t know what the real price is? We\u2019re the occupying force. They could be charging us triple just to get back at us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Voroshilovgrad all right\u201d. The Colonel admitted. \u201cBut I checked. They\u2019re only charging us double\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cSee. I knew it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u201d the Colonel said, handing Lorraine her drink and putting another beer in front of Lindsay, \u201cI take it you\u2019re not interested in the escort job tomorrow\u201d.<br>\r\nLorraine had been about to return to the table, but stopped and turned back. \u201cThe escort what now\u201d?<br>\r\nThe Colonel grinned. \u201cSurprise advance notice of tomorrow\u2019s job. The 127th gets the VIP Escort scenario\u201d.<br>\r\nNow the whole bar was listening. Most of the veteran players knew the VIP scenario was a chance to get away from the fighting and do some R &amp; R.<br>\r\nThe Colonel saw the blank look on Lindsay\u2019s face and explained.<br>\r\nSome big wig VIP has been touring the front lines, and our job is to make sure he gets back to Voroshilovgrad safely. If we do we get to stay over two days before heading back\u201d. <br>\r\nWhat\u2019s so great about that\u201d? Lindsay asked, still not seeing what the excitement was.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a Holiday\u201d. Lorraine explained. \u201cWe fly in. Head into town. And party\u201d.<br>\r\nMaybe Lindsay was just dense, but she wasn\u2019t getting it. \u201cHow\u2019s that different from what we do now\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a city\u201d! Lorraine said excitedly. <br>\r\n\u201cRoad Trip\u201d! shouted Addison, somewhat inaccurately<br>\r\n\u201cShopping\u201d. Added Leslie \u201cNew shoes\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cMen\u201d added Lorraine.<br>\r\n\u201cBars\u201d added Lana-Raye.<br>\r\n\u201cMore men\u201d added Lorraine with growing enthusiasm.<br>\r\n\u201cClothes\u201d added Beverly.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd men\u201d re-iterated Lorraine.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already mentioned men\u201d Lana-Raye pointed out.<br>\r\n\u201cGotta focus on what\u2019s important\u201d Lorraine said, grinning.<br>\r\nLinda shook her head and rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat did you expect\u201d? she said \u201cIt\u2019s Lorraine\u201d.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning the squad enjoyed yet another sumptuous breakfast, loaded with virtual waist threatening calories, then headed to the hanger for the mission briefing. As they passed the hanger apron they saw that their eight duty aircraft were joined by two JU-52 Tri-Motor transports as well as a couple of the newly released FW190 fighters, so new that the morning sun gleamed off the factory fresh paint, and the normal unit markings and insignias had yet to be painted on. The Focke-Wolfs were faster and deadlier than the BF109s the 128th was currently flying, and Lindsay was quite looking forward to next week when their eight allotted fighters were scheduled to be delivered, provided the 127th could score the points required, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u201d, Colonel Helgameire said, unrolling a map on the wall once the creaking of the wooden chairs died down as the group settled into place. \u201cToday\u2019s job is to see that the visiting VIP\u2019s make the trip back to Voroshilovgrad safely. Voroshilovgrad is just over 700 kilometers to the west of us. The trip will take us a little over 4 and a half hours given the cruising speed of those two \u2018Iron Annie\u2019s\u2019 you saw on the way over here. And those two Fockers belong to the pilots joining us as the VIP\u2019s personal escort fighters. I want to work them into the rotation and have you each fly wing with them, just to see what the new machines are capable of. Since none of the VIP pilots felt the need to join us for briefing I guess I\u2019ll just issue the positions now and inform them of their assignments once we get into the air. Colleen, you will fly wing man for who ever is in the left hand fighter. Lindsay, you take the right. Lana-Ray and Lorraine fly escort for the left Annie, Linda and I will take the right Annie. Bev, you and Addison will be flying bird dog. We\u2019ll rotate partners every hour so you\u2019ll each get a chance to buddy with a 190. Most of the flight will be over occupied territory, so we shouldn\u2019t run into too much trouble once we\u2019re away from the front, but keep a sharp eye out. The Russians seem to be getting bolder and putting a lot more planes in the air lately so don\u2019t let your guard down. Once we reach Voroshilovgrad we lay over for 36 hours then return. The time between when we touch down and the return flight is your own, so pack an overnight kit with shopping in mind. Any questions? No? Right, grab your gear. I want wheels up in 20 minutes. Let\u2019s get this mission started. <br>\r\nLindsay followed the rest of the girls out of the hanger in a slight state of panic as they headed to the barracks to pack. What did you take on an overnight shopping trip? All she could think to grab was a change of underwear, blouse, and jacket. That didn\u2019t seem like enough, so after a little hurried deliberation she grabbed a pair of comfortable shoes. Tossing them into her carry all she hesitated. 36 hours was two days worth of clothes, right? She added another pair of underwear, blouse, and a pair of slacks, then tossed in a sweater and a scarf she\u2019d seen in her locker but hadn\u2019t worn before. Hoping that would be enough, she buckled the canvas carry-all closed and headed to the latrine for the \u2018Safety Pee\u2019 that had become the pre-flight ritual for most of the squadron.<br>\r\nAfterwards, carefully wiping herself dry of the inevitable spray residue, she found herself again marveling at the detail and complexity of the SIM programming. Who really needed to feel a droplet of urine trickling down their leg, she wondered.<br>\r\n  She was slightly startled at the size of the bags the other girls were carrying when she rejoined them on the runway, wondering briefly if she had miss-heard and the colonel had actually said they were lying over for a week. seeing the expressions on a few of their faces when they\u2019d caught sight of the size of the bag Lindsay was carrying, she hastily stuffed it into the cargo pod and climbed into the cockpit. Thankfully, nobody pressed any awkward questions, and soon the entire squad was coaxing their machines into position for take-off.<br>\r\nOnce in the air they took up their assigned positions. The FW190 pilots grumbled a bit, but for the most part accepted the Colonel\u2019s group assignment. Not so with one of the transport pilots. He\u2019d had a bad breakup with a former girlfriend and absolutely refused to have any one named Linda anywhere near him, and raised such a fuss that the Colonel finally rotated her with Addison, which seemed to settle him down. With everybody happy, or at least not bitterly complaining, the flight turned westward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  It was almost half an hour before the Russians found them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She radioed back. \u201cToo far away to make a positive ID, but definitely headed our way\u201d. She kept an eye on the three aircraft as they steadily drew closer. <br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re Russian\u201d Linda\u2019s voice announced through the radio speaker. \u201cLooks like three LaGGs from here.

A cosmos that was decidedly not going to make an exception for Lindsay and her new wingman<br>\r\n  Needless to say the melee did not go well. The FW150\u2019s may have been technically advanced, but their pilots flew them like it was their first time in combat. The \u2018four on three cakewalk\u2019 turned into a \u2018three on one drubbing\u2019, with Lindsay in trouble from the moment they engaged the enemy. For some reason all three of the enemy decided that Lindsay was the prime target, and with her hopeless wingman unable to provide any assistance, took it in turns to get of several bursts on her. By the time the rest of the squad arrived to drive the Russians off she\u2019d been shot up by each of the enemy fighters at least once, and it was only through shear luck she hadn\u2019t been killed multiple times. <br>\r\nOf course her wingman fared much better, emerging from the fray without so much as a scratch on his shiny paint job. Lindsay, on the other hand, was leaking fluid from every system the plane had.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You on the other hand\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI would have gotten there\u201d Not-Franz replied defensively \u201cAnd besides, the other pilots helped her out. I wasn\u2019t needed\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cThe other pilots shouldn\u2019t have had to jump in\u201d the Colonel shot back \u201cYou were her wing man, it was your responsibility to help\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for her.

If you don\u2019t like taking orders feel free to head home by yourself\u201d.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNot Franz\u2019s response was to open his throttle full. Pushing his plane\u2019s engine to full power and accelerating away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching him for a couple of moments to see if he was actually going to do it, the Colonel turned her attention back to Lindsay and her smoking aircraft.<br>\r\n\u201cLindsay? Are you okay\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m fine\u201d. Lindsay radioed back \u201cBut my plane\u2019s shot. Oil, Coolent, Fuel, Hydraulic fluid. You name it and I\u2019m probably leaking it. Forget the mission. I may not make it back to base\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone else take damage\u201d? The Colonel asked.<br>\r\nLinda spoke up. \u201cA few holes here and there. A possible coolant leak. Nothing serious\u201d.<br>\r\nNobody else seemed to have been, at least noticeably, damaged, in the fight. <br>\r\n\u201cOkay, listen up\u201d The Colonel said \u201cLinda, you escort Lindsay back to base. You two are officially scrubbed on this mission\u201d.<br>\r\n \u201cColonel, I protest\u201d. One of the transport pilots broke in. \u201cThe mission is to escort these transports and the visiting VIPs. Every plane is vital to see we get back to base safely\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up Fritz\u201d was the Colonels sharp reply. \u201cThanks to one of YOUR so called pilots, one of my planes is out of commission with a second one damaged.  I\u2019m sending them both home so as to not compromise the fighting ability of my remaining aircraft\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if you do that you won\u2019t have enough planes to provide adequate coverage\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cThe six of us are more than enough coverage for two transports. What I don\u2019t have is enough planes to baby sit a crippled machine on top of two transports and an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squad heard the transport pilot key the mike as if to reply, but what ever he was going to say he must have had second thoughts about it, because the radio clicked off a second later. After a couple of last minute instructions, Lindsay turned away from the flight, Linda following and taking up position on her left wing. <br>\r\nTogether, the two headed west towards base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now a minor rattle that had started a few minutes ago grew alarmingly louder. A rattle that, in spite of Lindsay\u2019s determined interest in peering at the few still functioning engine gauges, refused to identify its source. <br>\r\n  She keyed her mike. \u201cHow far away do you think we are\u201d? she asked, trying to keep her voice calm, lest it betray how worried she was. She was having to rely on Linda for course information. Normally the information would be almost second nature to her, but that was when she\u2019d known things like how fast she\u2019d been going and what time it was. Unfortunately, among other things both her clock and speed indicator were gone, casualties of a 23mm calling card from one of the LaGGs. The brass shell had punched a hole just below the throttle lever, leaving a crease of torn metal and smashed glass diagonally across her instrument panel. How it had missed the throttle cable and her left knee she had no idea, but she was thankful it had, needing both of those to help maneuver with what little control surfaces she still had functioning.<br>\r\n  Unusual movement caught her attention. The oil pressure gauge was twitching oddly, so she picked a scrap of white cloth that was stuck in the broken glass face out of the way so she could see it better. Then she paused, staring at the cloth held in her fingers intently. It looked like silk, but why would there be scraps of silk blowing around her plane, swirling in the draught from the multitude of shell holes surrounding her. And so many of them. She was staring at a not so small pile caught in the eddy below her left foot, thinking there must be something important she was missing, when Linda radioed \u201cLooks like about fifteen minutes yet. Everything okay over there\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d Lindsay replied, worry creeping into her voice. \u201cI may not be able to hold together that long. What do we have for alternates\u201d? <br>\r\n\u201c \u2019Fraid the only field closer is the 104th, they\u2019re about 2 minutes South by south east of us.  But I haven\u2019t heard good things about their commander. From what I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s a bit of a dick. Probably better to give it up and hit the silk if it comes to that\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there it was. An reasonable explination of all the scraps of cloth being whipped around the cockpit. \u201cSorry Linda\u201d, she radioed back \u201cbut I don\u2019t think bailing out is going to be an option for me\u201d.  Before she could elaborate there was a crunching bang from the engine, which began to stutter and lope alarmingly as the manifold pressure plummeted. \u201cLooks like I\u2019m out of the other options as well\u201d she yelled over the engine\u2019s death rattle. Out of options she turned towards the 104th and its faint offer of safe landing.<br>\r\nAs if Lindsay didn\u2019t already have her hands full, the stuttering engine was belching black smoke and oil, partially obscuring all vision forward. Thankfully Linda didn\u2019t ask questions or try to argue. Instead she took up position behind the crippled plane and began to call out the information she knew Lindsay wasn\u2019t able to get from her ruined instruments. <br>\r\n\u201cSwing just a couple of degrees to your left now. That\u2019s it. We should be on track now. A little high for the glide slope but that might be a good thing. Stand by while I radio in a distress call\u201d.<br>\r\n The tortured engine decided it had put up with enough already, gave one last airframe shaking crunch, and quit. The resulting silence was almost deafening in itself, even though it wasn\u2019t really that quiet, being filled with the whistle of wind passing bullet holes and shattered glass. <br>\r\n Lindsay struggled not only with the plane now, but also to fight down the rising panic she felt. With oil smeared across the windshield and no instruments she was almost flying blind. \u201cLevel out Lindsay\u201d, Leslie was saying. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to turn again. Get your wings level\u201d! <br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t. I need to see! I can\u2019t see a dam\u2019d thing!\u201d<br>\r\nShe needed to see. Fumbling at the cockpit cover release she tried to wrench the cover open, intending to jettison it and lean out, only to discover it wouldn\u2019t open. The frame was twisted and jammed. In desperation she punched and pounded at the cracked side glass. Thankfully the 23mm shell hole had weakened the glass enough that it shattered and fell away, allowing her to at least see the horizon out over her left wing. Encouraged, she did the same to the glass to her right with the same result. <br>\r\n\u201cI can see the sides, but I can\u2019t see shit in front of me\u201d she said into her mike. You\u2019ll have to watch and call out the numbers for me. I\u2019m dead stick, so we only get one chance at this\u201d. <br>\r\nThe last bit was completely unnecessary. Both of them knew that coming in \u2018Dead Stick\u2019 left no option to abort the landing and go around again. <br>\r\nLinda kept her voice calm and dry as she counted off the numbers, guiding Lindsay down.  <br>\r\n\u201cOkay Lindsay, we\u2019re on course at about 500 meters and 350kph. Knew that extra altitude would be handy. Deploy landing gear.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cGear down and locked.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. Speed 270. Still a little fast. Bring your nose up a touch. Speed 250.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOkay, speed 250, 10 degree flap.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSpeed 220. Nose down Lindsay, your rising. That\u2019s good. Decent rate 20. Speed 200\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cRoger 200. Going full flap.\u201d <br>\r\n\"Looking good. We\u2019re crossing the threshold. Decent 15, 50 meters.\u201d<br>\r\n\"Dam\u2019d. I can see both sides of the runway. Nice navigating\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBring the nose up a touch Lindsay. Good. Flare out. Flare out!\u201d<br>\r\n The wheels touched earlier than she expected, and the plane bounced up into the air again. Pushing the stick forward to bring it back down and she bounced again, hard. The tail came up. Way, way up. Far enough up that the nose skimmed the runway and the propeller would have struck had it been turning. Then the tail came down and slammed onto the runway and she was rolling down the runway, slowing, until eventually she stopped. <br>\r\nA crash truck came roaring up behind her, slewing to a stop. The men piling out were dragging fire extinguishers and aiming hoses all around, ready for the usual fiery crash landing result, but it seemed they were late to the party and all the excitement was over. Unless you count the cursing and prying as they tried to get the lid open and get Lindsay out.<br>\r\nAlthough the way the men acted when they finally pried the cover off and got a look at who they were rescuing you\u2019d have though the excitement was just starting.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All the men enthusiastically pitched in to help pull Lindsay from the wreckage. In fact, there were so many hands helping that some of the men were having trouble finding parts of her to hold on to. More than one, purely by accident she was sure, grabbed her in places she really wished they hadn\u2019t.  The men also seemed quite worried that the wrecked plane might spontaneously explode with hither to unknown great force, so they made sure they had carried her an extra safe distance away, then picking her up again and carrying her even further before setting her down again. They also seemed quite concerned she may have been hurt in the crash and they all wanted to make sure she was okay after enduring such a traumatic event. A couple of the men, fresh from basic first aid training, even insisted on checking her for broken bones, in spite of her protesting that she was fine. Fortunately, the base medic arrived and chased them off before they could start the full body search they were so enthusiastically insisting she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u201d said the Medic, holding her face and temporarily blinding her with a flash light, no doubt to check if she was mentally alert enough to realize she couldn\u2019t see. \u201cHave a little bit of a crash?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d She replied, blinking rapidly \u201cI just had a nice big one, thanks anyway. Probably more than I need at the moment.\u201d <br>\r\nNow it was his turn to blink as he turned her reply over in his mind. <br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said shortly, suppressing a smile. \u201cWe certainly wouldn\u2019t want to over indulge in such things. It\u2019s not healthy and we can\u2019t have that now, can we.\u201d<br>\r\nFortunately he proceeded to dig a pair of rubber gloves out of his kit without waiting for her answer, for which Lindsay was grateful, having borrowed heavily against all her witty post-crash repartee and having nothing good to come back with.  <br>\r\n  Of course the medic himself did the same basic evaluation the crash truck boys wanted to do, but in a decidedly more sedate and professional manner, gently squeezing parts of her limbs slowly while asking her if anything hurt. Not finding any injuries more serious then that long bruise across her back, likely from whatever had turned her parachute into silk confetti, he was helping her to her feet when another jeep pulled up, this one containing Linda along with another officer.<br>\r\n\u201cLindsay!\u201d squealed Linda, running up and giving her a hug that blatantly disregarded  any potential injury she may have suffered. \u201cYou\u2019re okay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the doctor here says,\u201d Lindsay replied, gently disentangling herself \u201cRight doc?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJudging from the number of holes in that crate she was flying,\u201d the medic said, gesturing towards Lindsay\u2019s distant plane as he packed up his med kit. \u201cShe\u2019s in a whole lot better shape than she has the right to be. Just a couple of minor cuts and scratches.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to hear that!\u201d said a voice behind them. Lindsay suddenly remembered the officer that had arrived with Linda. She turned and saw that the man standing there was an officer, and a major at that. \u201cOops, sorry sir,\u201d Lindsay said, snapping off a salute, \u201cDidn\u2019t see you there.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem\u201d The major said, returning her salute. \u201cObviously you had other things on your mind. Major Eric Kinsman, second in command of the 104th\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cFirst Lieutenant Lindsay Anderson, Jagdgeschwader 127th\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes. Colonel Helgameire\u2019s outfit. How is that old Battle Axe these days?\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay faltered at this, not knowing how to respond. She looked at Linda, hoping for guidance, but Linda looked as bemused as she was. The Major laughed when he saw the look on the two women\u2019s faces.  <br>\r\n\u201cLeslie and I go way back\u201d he said with a grin \u201cBefore her \u2018I hate all men\u2019 phase we were actually good friends. So is she still making life miserable for all the men in her unit?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cActually\u201d Linda said \u201cThe Colonel set it up so it\u2019s a women only squadron. There are no men in the 127th. <br>\r\nNow it was the Major\u2019s turn to look nonplussed. \u201cWell do tell. All women eh? Sounds like something she\u2019d do. I'd love to hear all about it. Tell you what. From the looks of your plane you\u2019re going to be a while. Let\u2019s get you over to the hanger and introduce you to the Commander.\"<br>\r\nThe Major climbed into the drivers seat, starting the engine as Lindsay and Linda clambered in after him. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what he says about your plane\u201d he shouted over the rattle of exhaust from the rotted out muffler of the little 4 cylinder\u2019s engine. \u201cIf he gives the okay you can tell the boys in maintenance to get started on repairs, and then join me in the mess hall for dinner.\u201d <br>\r\nAnd with a grind of gears they sped off towards the hanger the 104th was using as it\u2019s headquarters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She always thought the bulletin board they used at the 104th was excessively large, but the sheer massiveness of this one looked like someone had been given the budget of James Cameron and told to buy office supplies. The sheer amount of notices and charts pinned to it would have caused a severe pushpin shortage in any country smaller than Liechtenstein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive, isn\u2019t it?\u201d The major said when he saw Lindsay\u2019s reaction. \u201cFrom that board the Colonel and I can get just about any statistic you want on the 104th. How we\u2019re doing, where we stand in the game. Individual player\u2019s stats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur board just tracks kills and points.\u201d Lindsay said, \u201cOh, and flight hours. I didn\u2019t know there was anything else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe major grinned. \u201cThe Colonels adjutant does data analysis in real life, so he\u2019s used to digging up data on anything. The Colonel\u2019s got him graphing pretty much every aspect of the game for us. You\u2019d probably be running a default version of the basic leader board set-up, so most of this stuff isn\u2019t available to you. Check this chart here\u201d The Major pointed to a sheet of foolscap pinned pretty much in the middle of the board, \u201cThis one shows the standings and points of all 36 members of the 104th\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne entry at the bottom of the list caught Linda\u2019s eye. \u201cHow come the one on the bottom is written in red?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Major turned and called over to a group of airmen seated scribbling away at some reports at a bunch of desks in one corner. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Eugene.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the men looked up from the report he was scribbling on. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe lady wants to know why your score is in red.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of annoyance crossed the man\u2019s face.<br>\r\n\u201cFuck off Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch the language Captain! Remember we have company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change much. \u201cSorry. I meant fuck off Major Kinsman, Sir!\u201d Then he made an obvious show of returning to his paperwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better!\u201d The major looked unfazed by the captain\u2019s insolence and filled in a little background on the story. \u201cEugene there has a tendency to shoot at the wrong targets. So far he\u2019s shot down two of our own transports and strafed a couple of machine gun positions of ours.\u201d Then he sighed dramatically \u201cAnd there was that supply convoy.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHey. I made a couple of mistakes, okay?\u201d The captain was obviously still listening. \u201cWay back at the beginning. And it takes a lot of enemy kills to offset the penalty points.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s still working on it. Although the Colonel doesn\u2019t let him go up alone anymore. Always makes him take someone along with better eyesight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver his paperwork Eugene gave the Major a dirty look, so more to change the subject than because she was interested Lindsay turned back to the board. \u201cThere sure are a lot of charts up there.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d the Major replied, leaving the Captain alone for now. \u201cFuel usage, Ammo usage, types of aircraft encountered, Types shot down. You name it. Pretty sure there\u2019s a chart up there showing how much urine every member of the squad has passed and when.\u201d He finished with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda let out an expression of disgust. \u201cEeww. Why would you want to know that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d the Major said as if stating a matter of fact, \u201cGreat way to call out someone for bragging they weren\u2019t scared. You could look at the sheet and prove otherwise.\u201d Then he saw the look on Lindsay\u2019s face, belatedly realizing he had just picked her up from a crash landing. \u201cJust kidding.\u201d He back pedaled, just in case he might have said something to offend her.  \u201cBut I\u2019m sure if I wanted that information, it\u2019s there somewhere,\u201d the major finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay hadn\u2019t really had time to be scared during the landing, of course. Everything had happened so quickly. But even if she had, of all the times she\u2019d brought in an aircraft leaking fluids, urine had not been one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Major lowered his voice and confided \u201cFrankly, I really only ever look at the points and accrued flight hours myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that chart?\u201d Lindsay asked, changing the subject again by pointing to a large four column chart off to one side. \u201cThe one with all the funny letter codes.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Name. Rank. Position in group. And a code for current status.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs an example here\u201d the Major ran his finger down the coded letters in the last column.<br>\r\nCTS. That stands for currently on station, like Cal and Eugene there. A fancy term for hanging around the base and goofing off.  <br>\r\nI\u2019m CTS as well, see. With a small \u2018m\u2019 showing that I\u2019m liaisoning at the moment, so I\u2019m not goofing off. I\u2019m being important and giving a tour of the base. Let\u2019s see what else we have COP is currently on patrol, and, oh. The Colonel is COP, guess there\u2019s no point knocking on his door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda pointed to another set of code letters. \u201cWhat\u2019s MIA?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat means missing in action. It usually means we\u2019ve been shot down and survived, and are sneaking around trying to make it back to base without being captured or killed. You get more points that way.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know they haven\u2019t been captured?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy.\u201d The Major said confidently. \u201cCaptured prisoners are flagged as CAP the moment they arrive at a POW camp.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPOW camp?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrisoner Of War. Special camps where the prisoners are kept so they don\u2019t get mistaken for enemy troops and accidentally targeted.\u201d The major laughed and glanced in Eugene\u2019s direction. \u201cNow that would add some serious negative number to your score\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay ran her finger down the list, mentally adding up the figures. \u201cYou seem to have a lot of MIA\u2019s!\u201d she said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d The Major seemed genuinely puzzled. I didn\u2019t noticed.\u201d He looked over the columns of numbers himself, \u201cProbably because our men are skillful at avoiding capture.\u201d He declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so good at finding their way home again, so it appears.\u201d Linda observed. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t help when they can\u2019t get back to fly missions against the enemy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPilots get shot down all the time.\u201d The Major waved off \u201cMost of them show up again in a day or two. Likely we\u2019ll see some of them tonight in the officers club lying about their exploits behind enemy lines.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of the officers club reminds me.\u201d The Major said, changing topics smoothly, \u201cIt\u2019s almost 13 hundred. Since the Colonel is out, it\u2019s up to me to authorize your repairs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think they can repair my plane?\u201d Lindsay asked. \u201cIt was pretty shot up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat it was,\u201d The Major agreed \u201cBut the airframe was still intact, and it doesn\u2019t look like you bent anything too badly when you landed. Probably take overnight but the maintenance guys are good, so you should be able to fly out of here in the morning. Talk to the corporal in charge of the maintenance hanger. Tell him I\u2019ve authorized any repairs necessary, then you two can join me for lunch in the mess. My treat, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good.\u201d Linda replied, and the girls left to find the maintenance hanger.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yeah, a lot more creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe lieutenant\u201d Linda said, stressing Lindsay\u2019s rank \u201cmade an emergency landing and needs to have some repairs done to her aircraft.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem babe.\u201d he said, fumbling under the counter for a clip board while managing not to take his eyes off them \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Oil pressure not reading right?\u201d He slid the clip board across the counter with a leer that made Lindsay want to surreptitiously check to make sure her flight suit was zipped all the way up. \u201cOr did you just forget to fill up on gas?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe had lots of fuel when we left.\u201d Lina said flatly, \u201cbut I think most of it leaked out from all those bullet holes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, Got yourself a couple of bullet holes. I can see where that might cause you girls problems. We\u2019ll see about getting that fixed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need to replace the engine as well,\u201d Lindsay started to say \u201cI\u2019m afraid it was\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaking a funny noise?\u201d the Corporal broke in. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing major. Don\u2019t you worry your pretty little head over it. I\u2019ll get the men to check for any funny little noises that might bother you girls.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, that\u2019s not exactly the problem\u201d Lindsay tried again \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he said, cutting her off again, \u201cWe\u2019re the experts here. Just let us do the job that we\u2019re qualified for.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay turned to Linda and shrugged. Linda returned it with a look that said \u2018Let him find out for himself\u2019. She had tried.<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u201d said the corporal with another less than subtle leer that found Lindsay not so surreptitiously  tugging the zipper higher on her already fully zipped jacket. \u201cI need get the paperwork started, so if you\u2019ll just fill in your vitals.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cVitals?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe basics, you know. Name, Squadron, Ident Numbers, Body Measurements.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeasurements?\u201d Lindsay asked, blinking confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStandard procedure.\u201d The corporal continued oily, \u201cFor a change of uniform. In case you need to stay overnight. Also are you good on the bottom or do you like to be on top?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m talking bunk beds, babe. Do you prefer top or bottom bunk?  Of course, we could make other sleeping arrangements, if you know what I\u2019m saying.\u201d He waggled his eyebrows suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you need to know who authorized the repairs?\u201d Linda cut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all babe, those bazookas you\u2019re carrying are all the authorization I need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Linda said, having just about had enough of Corporal sleezy. Finished with filling in only the officially required information, she slapping the pencil on top of the form and pushing the clip board back across the counter at him. \u201cHow long are the repairs going to take?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHard to say,\u201d the corporal said, still obliviously smiling oily, \u201cThe boys will need to look your plane over very carefully. Make sure there is no hidden damage, you know? Some stuff is not obvious to the untrained eye. That could take some time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Said Linda, having a very good idea where the corporal was headed. \u201cHow much time, do you think?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Corporal didn\u2019t disappoint. \u201cThat checking for hidden damage could take some time, several hours at least. Most likely overnight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so we\u2019ll likely need food and lodging, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I asked the questions Babe. Just in case, of course. There\u2019s a spare tent I can put you up in, over near my place. As for food fortunately for you I know this great little place just off the base. The chef there is a personal friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll bet he does Italian\u201d she said sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course. Brushetta and Crostini. Pesto, Antipasto, Minestrone, and Pizza, and a Cr\u00e8me Brulee so good his own mother weeps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCr\u00e8me Brulee?\u201d Linda looked at the Corporal levelly, \u201cIsn\u2019t that more French than Italian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it is,\u201d the Corporal recovered quickly, \u201cHe trained in Paris for 3 years. And he buys all of his food daily at the town market so it\u2019s fresh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda gave Lindsay with a \u2018Can you believe this?\u2019 look, then summarized what she\u2019d been hearing \u201cSo you know a Parisian trained chef making Italian food with local ingredients sourced in German occupied Russia. Sounds wonderful.\u201d Then she gave a heavy theatrical sigh \u201cIt really is a shame that we have already promised the Major we\u2019d join him and the other officers for supper, isn\u2019t it lieutenant?\u201d She said to Lindsay, stressing the word officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay picked up on the offered escape immediately \u201cYes, Captain. It sure is. They\u2019re probably already waiting for us, given how long we\u2019ve been talking to the Corporal here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda pushed the clipboard all the way across the counter to rest against the Corporal\u2019s elbow. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in the mess tent.\u201d She said with a small grin. \u201dDo be a good little soldier and let us know when we can expect the Lieutenant\u2019s plane to be ready, will you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the two women looked at each other and rolled their eyes, then turned and walked quickly towards the mess tent. They almost made it half way before they couldn\u2019t take it any more and burst out laughing. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Have a seat. Glad you decided to join us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUs?\u201d Linda asked. The bench table the Major was sitting at could comfortably seat 20, although at the moment only four of the seats further down were taken. \u201cHow many more are coming?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOne more.\u201d The major replied. \u201cTalk about timing, here he is.\u201d <br>\r\nTo the girls surprise the forth member of the group turned out to be none other than the luckless Captain Eugene, taking his lunch break. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve been formally introduced,\u201d Linda said, holding out her hand, nudging Lindsay with her other elbow. \u201cCaptain Linda Bray-Lewis, 127th\u201d <br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m Captain Conner, 104th  , as you undoubtedly guessed.\u201d Replied the Captain, removing his cap and giving the offered hand a quick shake.<br>\r\n\u201cFirst Lieutenant Lindsay Anderson. Also with the 127th\u201d said Lindsay, also holding her hand out for the Captain to shake.<br>\r\n \u201cDelighted,\u201d he said \u201cWhat brings you ladies to our humble airstrip?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d hardly call it humble\u201d replied Linda, gesturing at the milling crowd with a smile. \u201cJudging from the amount of people eating lunch right now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which\u201d The Major broke in \u201cWe should grab some food and eat so others can use the table.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOne of us should probably stay and save our spots,\u201d Lindsay suggested, eyeing the crowd still trickling in.  <br>\r\nAt this the Major had just laughed and tossed his hat on the table. \u201cThese four\u201d he said to the men sitting at the end of the table. The men nodded. \u201cPerks of being a Major\u201d he grinned, leading them to the line queuing up at the counter. <br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u201d Linda said inhaling the delicious fragrances wafting from the steam tables. \u201cSmells wonderful.\u201d <br>\r\nThe day\u2019s lunch menu was surprising heavily slanted towards Italian dishes.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes\u201d the Major said when this was pointed out. \u201cThere\u2019s a local guy who comes in twice a week to give a bit of variety. Mondays he does Italian, Fridays he does a more French Cuisine lineup. He\u2019s really quite good.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay looked at Linda, briefly wondering if she should feel guilty for some reason. But to her surprise Linda just shrugged and suggested they line up.<br>\r\nLindsay had a hard time deciding which of the myriad of dishes she wanted. Even after the five minutes they stood in line she\u2019d only narrowed it down to a choice of either a Linguini or a Fettuccine, but she was still faced with a dozen variety\u2019s to choose from when it came their turn. Grabbing almost at random, she wound up putting a bit from five different dishes onto her tray, with a small bowl of Minestrone and a spinach salad, plus a couple of Gnocchi Della Nonna\u2019s because she liked the way they looked.<br>\r\nOnce they sat down and started eating the conversation dwindled off, consisting mainly of comments about how good the food was. It was a while before anyone spoke.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u201cSo,\u201d Eugine said, about halfway done his Cannelloni, \u201cBack to my original question. What brings you two to the 104th?\u201d<br>\r\n\"Lindsay had to make an emergency landing.\u201d Linda said, answering for Lindsay when she saw she had her mouth full of Linguini Kitsilano. \u201cAnd you need to take smaller bites, dear.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u201d Lindsay said \u201cIt\u2019s just so good.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it is\u201d laughed Eugene. \u201cThat\u2019s why Italians are usually so fat.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re not all fat.\u201d Protested Linda. <br>\r\n\u201cLook at any depiction of popular culture. If there\u2019s an old Italian in it, chances are he\u2019s fat. And if it\u2019s a woman it\u2019s practically a guarantee.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s just stereotyping\u201d replied Lindsay after swallowing. <br>\r\n\u201cOr typecasting\u201d said Linda. \u201cColleen\u2019s studied that, so she\u2019d be the one to know. At least I think she\u2019s studied it.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAnd Colleen is?\u201d asked the Major<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s the unofficial videographer of our squadron.\u201d Linda explained \u201cShe takes the recordings of our fights and turns them into movies. She\u2019s quite good at it too. I think that\u2019s because she works in the industry in real life. Her best one so far is Lindsay here taking out a four ship Russian bomber squad while acting like a great white shark.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d said the Major as both men turned to look at Lindsay who was hunched down over her plate, embarrassed at the sudden attention. \u201cThat I\u2019d like to see.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, she\u2019s good.\u201d Linda continued with a wicked grin. \u201cThere\u2019s another where Lindsay and this top Russian ace spend almost 10 minutes dog fighting, trying to get a bead on each other.\u201d<br>\r\nBoth the men looked suitably impressed. <br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Linda continued \u201cwe\u2019ve also got film of her losing a fight with a toilet.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLinda!\u201d Lindsay shrieked, going bright red. \u201cNobody needs to know about that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOopsies. I guess I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. Too late now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men were obviously trying their best not to laugh at the poor girl, and just as obviously losing. \u201cWe should do the same.\u201d Eugene said. \u201cTake the recordings and make them into a movie. Greatest Moments of the 104th. I\u2019m surprised no one thought of it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak for yourself\u201d the Major said. \u201cRemind me to screen \u2018Captain Conner Verses the Supply Column\u2019 for you some day.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if it\u2019s a double bill with \u2018Major Kinsman and the Foggy Landing Strip\u2019.\u201d The Captain shot back.<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe a triple feature. I can dust off that copy of \u2018Eugene\u2019s greatest hits\u2019\u201d. was the Major\u2019s reply.<br>\r\n\u201cDo we have a copy of \u2018The Major\u2019s Mis-wired Throttle Cable of Mayhem\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYep. Right beside \u2018Who\u2019s Chute is That, Anyway\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the two men trade barbs Lindsay was struck by two realizations, the first being that the Major and the Captain were actually good friends, and the previous needling about Eugene\u2019s negative score was an extension of the good nature hazing all men engage in with their buddies. The type where neither makes too much of it, but it sounds far more serious to an outsider than it really is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second realization was that, as embarrassing as the toilet incident was, in hindsight it actually wasn\u2019t that bad. And did make for a hilarious story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo anyway\u201d the Captain said, breaking Lindsay\u2019s mental musings by bringing the topic of conversation back around to its initial heading \u201cThe major tells me you Dead Sticked a block of Swiss Cheese in earlier. So how does a pilot of your skill wind up with a ship having that many holes in it?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Colonel had us rotate wing duty with a couple Bomber Wing officers to see how the new Folker Wolfe FW190s performed. Three Russians jumped me, and the Kampfgeschwader pilot was a total Noob.<br>\r\n\u201cAh, the VIP escort scenario,\u201d Captain Eugene said knowingly \u201cYou know who was flying those 190\u2019s, don\u2019t you?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNot a clue\u201d was Lindsay\u2019s reply.<br>\r\n\u201cThe pilots were the actual VIP\u2019s you were escorting.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally? How do you figure that?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cA clever bit of classic miss-direction.\u201d The Captain ticked off the points on his fingers as he made them \u201cYou have a couple of visiting VIP\u2019s touring the front, gathering information or what ever. The enemy gets wind of it, and sends a squad out with orders to get the transports carrying the VIPs at all costs. Since their orders are to take out the transports they are going to ignore the escorts unless forced to fight them. Only what they don\u2019t know is the transports are just decoys. The real VIPs are in two of the escort planes which they automatically try to avoid\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying the idiot I had as a wingman..?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWas some high up muckity muck from Kampfgeschwader high command. A qualified pilot but with no fighter combat experience.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite a stretch\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cAdmittedly, it kind of makes sense, but how would you prove it?\u201d<br>\r\nThe Captain grinned. \u201cNo proof needed. We flew the escort mission last week. Only our group ran into a squad of 20 Russians. We lost 4 machines and both transports.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOuch\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but since we got the VIP\u2019s in their fancy fighters safely home, so technically we won the scenario. Say, are you going to eat that?\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay had pushed the last Gnocchi to the side of her plate. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She said. <br>\r\nNot that it wasn\u2019t delicious. Just something about the Captain\u2019s comment about getting fat and suddenly it didn\u2019t seem so appetizing. \u201cYou can have it if you want.\u201d<br>\r\nMaybe, she told herself, she\u2019d go for a run in the morning.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Eugene speared it with his knife, transferring it to his almost empty plate and cutting it into large pieces while continuing. Since we were successful we had two days liberty in the city of Taganrog.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOurs was supposed to be in Voroshilovgrad, not that I know anything about it. Other than it\u2019s a seven hour flight to get there.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTaganrog\u2019s about the same distance. I believe it is a little further south. It\u2019s a port on the Sea of Azov.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA seaport? Sounds wonderfully romantic\u201d Lindsay said without thinking. Now where had that come from?<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Eugene said, \u201cI spent most of my liberty seeing how many bars I could hit.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo shopping?\u201d asked Linda.<br>\r\n\u201cWomen and their shopping.\u201d The major exclaimed \u201cGive them a few days off and I swear all they\u2019d do is look at shoes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d Lindsay <br>\r\n\u201cOh really? And what were you planning on doing in Voroshilovgrad?\u201d Eugene asked.<br>\r\n\u201cLook at shoes,\u201d Lindsay blurted before she could stop herself. <br>\r\n\u201cThe Major\u2019s point, exactly.\u201d Eugene said, stuffing the last half of the Gnocchi into his mouth as a single bite. <br>\r\n \u201cWell, I mean, sure. But that\u2019s not the only thing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMmm?\u201d Eugene raised one eyebrow questioningly, his mouth still full of Gnocchi.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, umm\u2026\u201d Lindsay said, floundering \u201cWe were also, umm, going to do some, I don\u2019t know. Other stuff?\u201d she looked pleadingly at Linda.<br>\r\n \u201cI have no idea what Voroshilovgrad is like.\" Linda said \"I\u2019m sure there are museums and theaters and night clubs and stuff, but neither Lindsay or I have been there, so we were just going to follow the rest of the girls around. .\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFrankly\u201d said Eugene, swallowing, \u201cIf it\u2019s anything like Taganrog it\u2019s just another war ravaged Russian city without much to look at. The bars are probably your best shot.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all rather academic now,\u201d Linda pointed out. \u201cI\u2019m sure the rest of the squad will tell us what it was like when they get back to the base.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of bases,\u201d The Major said, getting to his feet, \u201cI\u2019m due over at the 77th for a strategy meeting so I need to head out.\u201d He gave each of the woman a small handshake  \u201cThank you for your company ladies. Any time you\u2019re in the area please feel free to drop in.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for your hospitality Major.\u201d Linda replied as she returned the handshake. \u201cAnd for lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime.\u201d He replied in turn, then made his way through the thinning crowd towards the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe I\u2019ll get lucky and get enough points to be back in the black again.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be bothered as much by your score as you seemed earlier.\u201d Linda observed.<br>\r\nEugene shrugged, wearing a good natured smile \u201cThat was when Eric and I are ribbing each other. Doesn\u2019t bother me that much, really. And I\u2019m getting better at telling Friend from Foe.\u201d <br>\r\nHe stood up and liked around the mess tent, frowning slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s odd.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s odd?\u201d asked Lindsay.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, usually this place is so crowded at lunch time it\u2019s hard to find a seat. Not today though.\u201d Then he shrugged \u201cProbably just the game adjusting the crowd so we can talk easier.\u201d He concluded. \u201cI\u2019d say about ninety 90 percent of the crowd still here are NPC\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Lindsay asked \u201cHow can you tell?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the way they move. NPC\u2019s tend to repeat the same gestures. Also their eyes don\u2019t follow you as closely as a player\u2019s do.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I hadn\u2019t noticed. Of course, I never looked that closely. I\u2019ve never needed to. There\u2019s only the eight of us at the 127th, so I just automatically assume anyone else I see on base is an NPC.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s over a hundred of us at the 104th. I don\u2019t know everyone by sight, so I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at picking out players among the crowd. There\u2019s only 4 other real players here eating lunch today. If you watch carefully you can pick them out. Anyway. I really should get going. The flight hates it when someone\u2019s late.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell good luck, and thanks again for lunch.\u201d Said Lindsay, shaking the offered hand. <br>\r\n\u201cThank the major for that. But if you\u2019re still around this evening look me up and I can buy you dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Lindsay said with a smile \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay watched Eugene thread his way through the computer generated throng. As soon as he was out of earshot Linda cocked her head. \u201cOohh. Looks like someone has a date tonight.\u201d She teased.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about.\u201d Lindsay asked, slightly flustered at being caught staring.<br>\r\n\u201cThe handsome Captain Eugene.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe did say he would buy you dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUs. He said he would buy us dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe was looking at you when he said it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut he was talking to both of us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want to bet he brings the Major along as his wingman.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would he need a wingman?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo he doesn\u2019t get shot down.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a patrol.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not\u201d Linda said, grinning \u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a date!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to tell yourself that, go right ahead.\u201d Linda stood up. \u201cYou want more coffee?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMight as well.\u201d Lindsay said, sliding her empty cup across the table. <br>\r\nWhen Linda returned with fresh cups she sat beside her at the table. To her relief Linda didn\u2019t bring up the date thing again, but instead joined her in watching the crowd. Sipping their coffee and comparing notes they quickly realized spotting NPCs wasn\u2019t as easy as the Captain said. Still, it was a way to pass the time.<br>\r\nThe sounds of aircraft warming up and taxiing had been a part of the back ground noise to their conversation, largely unnoticed. Until one engine caught their attention. It was louder and closer than the others, coming from the maintenance hanger. With nothing better to do the two girls put their coffee mugs on the dish rack and headed over to investigate.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs they walked towards the maintenance hanger they saw one of the maintenance crew climbing down out of Linda\u2019s plane, leaving it sitting outside the hanger with its engine running. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Which one of you broads is signing for number three?\u201d<br>\r\nLinda spoke up, \u201cThat would be me\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cThought so, Captain.\u201d he said with a thin smile and that odd emphasis on her title. \u201cHere you are.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Linda asked, looking at the sheet of paper the Corporal handed her.<br>\r\n\u201cYour invoice. The Major authorized repairs, that don\u2019t mean the 104th is paying for them. One replaced the radiator hose and your plane\u2019s warmed up and ready to go. Have your commanding officer authorize payment on this as soon as you get back to base.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Lieutenant,\u201d the Corporals thin smile turned up a little more in the corner of his mouth \u201cHere is your invoice.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done the repairs all ready?\u201d Lindsay asked, amazed and delighted that the work would had been completed so soon.<br>\r\n\u201cRepairs? Who said anything about repairs?\u201d The smile on the Corporal\u2019s face was that of someone who loved the taste of crushed dreams, and has been eagerly anticipating his next sampling. \u201cThis is rental on the bulldozer we used to push your wreck off the runway.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay blinked, not quite following what he was saying. \u201cThe what to do what now?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t a parking lot, doll. That runway is to be kept clear at all times. Since it weren\u2019t safe to roll your wreck out of the way we had ta\u2019 push it.\u201d <br>\r\nWith a sinking feeling Lindsay walked numbly over to the edge of the runway to where she could see the spot where she left her plane, stopping in shock as soon as she saw the sight that greeted her.  Off to one side sat what had been a badly damaged, yet still salvageable aircraft; turned into a twisted pile of scrap metal that looked as if it had been run over by a tank.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah\u201d, the Corporal continued at the look on her face. \u201cWe may have run over it once or twice. Sorry about that\u201d. He somehow managed to sound convincingly not sorry at all. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you crushed it\u201d? Lindsay managed to squeak out, still trying to come to terms with what she was seeing.<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t have bits sticking up where they could hook a wing, so yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou wrecked my plane?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNope. You wrecked it when you crashed it.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cBut the Major said it was still fixable.\u201d She protested.<br>\r\n\u201cUnderlying structural damage!\u201d the Corporal said, stressing each syllable as if talking to a small child, \u201cNot repairable in my opinion, and I\u2019m the expert here so that\u2019s the only one that counts.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut that was my plane!\u201d  She cried. <br>\r\n\u201cNo. That was a heap of junk you piled up on my runway and left me to deal with. So I dealt with it. You want to make an issue of it, have your CO call my CO. Meanwhile, you have 5 minutes to get the hell off this base.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSay what?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYou got a base pass?\u201d The Corporal asked, knowing full well what the answer would be.<br>\r\n\u201cA base pass. Well, no. But\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou two ain\u2019t part of this squadron, toots,\u201d the Corporal interrupted \u201cSo ya got no business being on this base. Maybe you can wave those Bazonga\u2019s at the Major and get a free dinner, but that don\u2019t mean a hill-o-beans to me, and unless you\u2019ve got a base pass you\u2019re trespassing.\u201d As he spoke a jeep with two MPs pulled up to a stop along side of them. <br>\r\n\u201cYou need to show some respect here, mister.\u201d Linda said \u201cYou know we\u2019re here because of an emergency landing\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhich has been handled with repairs.\u201d The Corporal came back \u201cCompleted and invoiced for. Also a crash team response and rescue for Lieutenant Hooters over there, along with disposal of her wrecked plane. Which are also complete and invoiced for. End of emergency, doll face.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t expect us to just leave.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect anything, other than maybe enjoying the sight of you two being frog marched off the base by those MPs there in five minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d Linda said hotly.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see in four minutes and forty seconds, toots.\u201d The Corporal said, smugly setting the timer on a very large and elaborate wrist watch.<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to realize we both out rank you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t seem to realize that only works when you have authorization to be here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just how do you expect us to leave?\u201d Linda asked, possibly in a last ditch effort to appeal to the Corporals good side.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u201d The corporal sneered, indifferent, and apparently not having a good side. \u201cCan fly. If Lieutenant Udders there can squeeze into the cockpit with you, all the better. Otherwise it looks like she\u2019s walking. Unless she can sweet talk the Major into authorizing someone to give her a ride.\u201d Then he smiled smugly again \u201cBut since I saw the Major\u2019s crate take off earlier I guess that ain\u2019t an option.\u201d His smile managed to grow even more smug. \u201cCome to think of it, it looks like anybody else who can authorize a ride seems to have left on patrol.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou insolent little piece of shit.\u201d Linda spat \u201cYou know two people can\u2019t fit in a 109.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t care,\u201d he sneered, \u201cAs long as what ever you do about it is done in the next four and a half minutes. After that you can deal with the MPs here.\u201d<br>\r\nFrom the way the burly MPs had just sat there during the exchange it was obvious the two were NPCs, and Linda had no doubt they would do exactly whatever Corporal Sleezebag told them.<br>\r\n\u201cYou little shit.\u201d Linda snarled at the smug little Corporals face. \u201cYour commander will definitely hear about this!\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cYeah, yeah, yeah,\u201d The Corporal said \u201cLike I care. Four minutes!\u201d<br>\r\nLinda glared at the Corporal, who matched the glare with a self satisfied smug grin. At this point the presence of the two MPs the corporal was the only reason the corporal was not playing craps using his own teeth. As it was all Linda could do was glare at him, before turning and storming towards her idling aircraft, Lindsay in tow.<br>\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard the last of this, she yelled over her shoulder.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know. We\u2019ll borrow a Stuka. That seats two.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFrom who? Corporal Dickhead?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh God no, are you kidding? If I thought that was possible I\u2019d just borrow you another aircraft. No, I was going to grab one of ours and fly back.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then what?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYour right. Dickhead will probably deny me landing privileges. I wouldn\u2019t put it past him. Tell you what. You start walking.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019ll take me hours\u201d Lindsay cried<br>\r\n\u201cNo it won\u2019t. As soon as I get back to the 127th I\u2019ll grab a jeep from the motor pool. If you stick to the main road I\u2019ll be back to pick you up in about an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to walk.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you walking, but I don\u2019t see an alternative. Have you got your gun?\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay nodded. \u201cGood. Be careful.\u201d With that Linda climbed the ladder into the cockpit of her fighter and settled herself in.<br>\r\n\u201cRemember,\u201d she shouted as she reached up and grabbed the hatch handle \u201cStick to the main road so I can find you.\u201d<br>\r\nThen she gunned the engine and began to pull away. <br>\r\nLindsay stood in the propwash until it died away, Clutching her coat around her, feeling very much alone and abandoned. <br>\r\nBut not for long. The little Corporal\u2019s eyes were no doubt glued to his watch, marking the minutes were rapidly ticking away, so she couldn\u2019t afford herself the luxury dwelling in depression. There would be plenty of time for self pity when she was off the base and on the road.<br>\r\nShe was only about half way to the guard house when a jeep pulled up on her left, brakes screeching in that way brakes do when they\u2019ve reached the end of their service life. The lone MP behind the wheel leaned across the seat to her \u201cGet in, he said.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cI\u2019m like, a minute away from the entrance.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the MP replied \u201cAnd your about one minute and six hours away from home. So unless you\u2019re really looking forward to walking the whole way I suggest you get in and let me give you a lift.\u201d <br>\r\nLindsay looked at the MP, torn between puzzlement and suspicion. This must have shown on her face, because the MP grinned. \u201cOh, right\u201d he said. \u201cDaddy probably told you to never take rides from strangers.\u201d He removed his helmet and held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m First Lieutenant Darryl Mackentyre, communications specialist, mediocre pilot, and part time policeman.\u201d <br>\r\nLindsay hesitated for a moment before deciding the guy was legit. Nobody else would describe them selves as mediocre, would they? \u201cFirst Lieutenant Lindsay Anderson.\u201d She said, accepting the handshake. \u201cUhh, I fly fighters for the 127th.\u201d <br>\r\nThe MP held onto her hand and helped her into the Jeep. \u201cI know. I was in the com tent when you were doing the tour. I heard you needed a lift and came to offer you one.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay froze half seated \u201cCorporal Dickhead sent you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDickhead?\u201d The lieutenant threw back his head and laughed \u201cYeah, that pretty much describes Gary alright. And no, I\u2019m the last person he\u2019d send. I overheard him talking about ordering you off base and decided I\u2019d throw a wrench into his plan.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWell, I must say that\u2019s mighty nice of you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say, I\u2019m a nice guy.\u201d Darryl put the Jeep in gear and headed towards the guardhouse down the road. \u201cBesides,\u201d he said as they waved to the MP at the gate, \u201cAs a police man finding an un-escorted soldier wandering the base it\u2019s my duty to confront, apprehended and / or safely remove said soldier from the premises.\u201d He looked at the gate house receding rapidly in the rear view mirror. \u201cI think we can say that part of the job is done.\u201d He looked at Lindsay, so she nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s not safe for anyone, especially a woman, to walk these roads alone. So it\u2019s sort of my job to see you safely home. As long as I\u2019m back by 19 hundred I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d<br>\r\nLinda\u2019s 109 roared past overhead, then swung up and around as Lindsay waved.<br>\r\n\u201cYour friend up there seems concerned\u201d Darryl said, watching the fighter circle around for another pass.<br>\r\n\u201cProbably just making sure I\u2019m okay.\u201d <br>\r\nThis time as Linda came up on them Lindsay stood up, gripping the windshield to steady herself as she turned to face the fighter, and gave her a \u2018thumbs up\u2019. It was kind of hard to tell, as the 109 roared past at better than 200kph, but Lindsay could have sworn Linda was grinning widely, returning her thumb gesture with a wink and the okay sign. What the hell was that all about?<br>\r\n\u201cGood to have a friend up there looking out for you.\u201d Darryl said as the noise of the fighter faded into the distance.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Lindsay replied \u201cI guess it is.\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cWell I do appreciate the ride.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said, not a problem. Sorry the corporal went full out dickhead on you back there.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his problem anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGary? He suffers from Little Man\u2019s Syndrome in a big way. Nobody likes him and everyone out ranks him, so he tends to abuse any little bit of authority he gets.\u201d<br>\r\nDarryl maneuvered the jeep smoothly around a shell hole in the roadway, continuing to talk over the noise of the engine and gravel \u201cHe\u2019ll probably be pissed when he finds out I offered you a ride. But I don\u2019t care, and even a first lieutenant out ranks him, so he can\u2019t do anything official about it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a very likable person, is he? I think if he was in my squad I would probably shoot him down myself.\u201d<br>\r\nDarryl was grinning like a small boy with a secret. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t tell you this, and you have to promise not to tell the Major.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot to tell the Major what?\u201d asked Lindsay.<br>\r\n\u201cMost of the guys have been doing that.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cDoing what?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShooting him down.\u201d Darryl confessed \u201cAccidentally, of course, or so we make it look. We\u2019ve turned it into sort of a game.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay looked at him in shock \u201cYou shoot him down as part of a game?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. Carl started it all.\u201d Darryl furrowed his brow in thought. \u201cWe were returning from probably our second or third mission, and Gary was being particularly obnoxious. Kept saying inappropriate things about Carl\u2019s girl, and this after Carl had repeatedly told him to shut up. Finally Carl had enough and let him have it with every shell left from his mission allotment. Last we saw of Gary that day was him spiraling into the Volga River. Then the Major gave a little speech about cooperation and appropriate behavior, which didn\u2019t stop Gary from talking, he just made sure he didn\u2019t say anything in front of the Major. Three days later he did the same thing to Trevor, with the same results. That time the Colonel gave the same speech, busted Gary a rank to Corporal, and threatened to ground him if he caught him talking crap again. He also said he\u2019d do the same to anyone caught shooting Gary down. <br>\r\nOf course, that didn\u2019t stop Gary. He acts like a little suck up whenever the Colonel or Major are around, then crap talks behind their backs. Everyone else knows this, but he never does it where the Colonel or the Major see him, and always denies it if someone complains. So he gets shot down occasionally as a moral booster.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay was incredulous. \u201cSurely they know something is up?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Darryl admitted \u201cOne of the rules we have is that it can\u2019t look deliberate, since nobody wants to be grounded. Since you can\u2019t just outright shoot him you have to arrange it so he happens to be in the line of fire. It\u2019s tricky, but someone still manages it about once a week.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIs that why Eugene\u2019s score is so low?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEugene?\u201d Darryl shook his head. \u201cNa, his numbers are in the negative because he shot down two of our troop transports. That and a couple of other things the Major won\u2019t let him forget. No, Eugene and the Colonel are about the only ones in the squad who haven\u2019t had a shot.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay thought about this, frowning. \u201cAre you saying even the Major took a turn?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t say for sure. It was either a legitimate accident or very well played by the Major. He even hauled Gary\u2019s ass to the office and gave him a severe dressing down for getting in the way. Highlight event of the week, and put the Major on the board with a full 10 points. Two points ahead of me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPoints?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we assign points. How else do you keep score?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd they say women make things complicated. I\u2019d just shoot him and be done with it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSuit yourself. But, hey, could you do me a favor?\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay looked warily at Darryl. \u201cDepends on what you need.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Gary usually flies a plane with unit marking JG104-52.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if a returning patrol happens to buzz your compound, it would be perfectly understandable if you panicked and mistook a friendly fly by for an attack. And somebody might get shot down in the confusion.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSomebody who happens to be flying with JG104-52 on their aircraft?\u201d Lindsay said with a conspiratorial grin.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should we have all the fun? Plus that would get me an easy 4 bonus points.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Communications specialist, remember? I do data mining for a living, so creating the Colonel\u2019s reports comes naturally to me. He does go a bit overboard, I\u2019ll admit.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOverboard isn\u2019t the word for it.\u201d Lindsay said as they pulled up to the guardhouse and presented their papers \u201cI don\u2019t think the people running the game look at that much data.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOh, I think you\u2019d be surprised at the amount \u2018they\u2019 look at.\u201d Darryl said, continuing the conversation while they waited for the guard to do his thing. \u201cThey have a team of data miners and report writers. I actually applied for a job there once. Didn\u2019t get hired, but I did get to tour their control room. It\u2019s like something you\u2019d expect to see at NASA or the Pentagon But then again,\u201d he shrugged \u201cThey\u2019re looking at keeping the whole game running, not just one squadron.\u201d <br>\r\nThe guard finished his cursory check of their papers and waved them through. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat does the Colonel do with all that data?\u201d Lindsay asked.<br>\r\n\u201cHe says it\u2019s to keep tabs on what is happening. Personally, I think he just likes to kill trees and watch numbers dance. Anyway,\u201d He said as he brought the Jeep to a stop in front of the hanger office of the 127th, \u201cHere we are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for the lift, Lieutenant.\u201d Lindsay said as, like a true gentleman, he hurried around to her side and helped her climb out of the jeep. \u201cWould you care for a cup of coffee or something to eat before you head back?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lindsay watched him head back down the road. The Lieutenant seemed all eager to incorporate the 127th in their vendetta against the unpopular little corporal, but as she watched the taillights of the jeep disappear around the bend of the guardhouse road she was having serious second thoughts about the whole thing. Although she had sort of agreed to the plan during the drive, the more she thought about it the less inclined she was to go through with it. Shooting the man down in the heat of an argument would maybe make her feel better, at least for a little while. But this, plotting to shoot him down in cold blood, had too much of a cold, calculating feel to it that she didn\u2019t like. No, she decided as she walked to the barrack room she shared with Addison and Beverly, it just felt wrong. <br>\r\nShe changed out of her flight suit and went looking for Linda, not sure if she should share the Lieutenant\u2019s plan or not.

I didn\u2019t expect to see you for another hour or so.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWe made good time\u201d Lindsay said, stirring her coffee. \u201cI\u2019ve been back for almost 15 minutes.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI know, I heard the jeep. I just thought maybe you\u2019d be a little longer. You know,\u201d She arched one eyebrow, \u201cThanking him for the lift.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWell of course I said thank you, what do you think I would say. wait\u201d she said,catching the look in Linda\u2019s eyes \u201cwhat are you referring to?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe two of you. Alone on the open road. A good looking man. A woman wanting to show her gratitude. You know?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLinda!\u201d Lindsay gasped, colouring as she caught on to what Linda was alluding to.<br>\r\n\u201cRelax.\u201d Linda burst out laughing \u201cI\u2019m only teasing. Although I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you did. That man is sure easy on the eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat he is.\u201d Lindsay joined in with her own laugh. \u201cGuess I missed an opportunity there.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Linda reassured her \u201cThere will be others. At least until Lorraine gets back. But tell me you at least got his number\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Lindsay admitted. \u201cBut he is going to call me.\u201d Her face betrayed that she wasn\u2019t all that happy with the prospect.<br>\r\nLinda shook her head mockingly \u201cThat\u2019s what men always say.\u201d Then she caught the look on Lindsay\u2019s face. \u201cAlthough you don\u2019t seem as happy about that as you should be. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Well\u2026\u201d Lindsay stumbled over the words, not so sure of how to begin. She knew she was desperate to talk about it, and Linda had given her the perfect opening, but evidentially the subject she was about to bring up bothered her a lot more than she cared to admit. She took a deep breath, and then rushed headlong into the explanation, counting on sheer momentum to get the words out before she could choke up.<br>\r\n\u201cIt turns out the 104 is taking turns shooting that creepy little Corporal and now Darryl thinks I should take a turn and at first I was thinking it sounded like a good idea but now I don\u2019t know \u2018cause it doesn\u2019t feel right only I\u2019m pretty sure he thinks I\u2019m onboard with the whole idea and I\u2019m not sure how to tell him I\u2019ve changed my mind and don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d The words came rushing out.<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, there girl\u201d Linda said, when Lindsay took a breath. She held up her hands like she was trying to stop a runaway truck \u201cSlow down. If you don\u2019t want to do it just tell him that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut do you think Darryl will be okay with that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. If you don\u2019t want to do something you don\u2019t. The opinion of some guy you just met an hour ago doesn\u2019t matter, no matter how good looking he is.\u201d Linda looked at Lindsay speculatively \u201cThat\u2019s the same talk I have to keep giving my kids. How old are you, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTwenty six.\u201d Lindsay said meekly.<br>\r\n\u2018Humph\u201d Linda snorted. \u201cYour old enough to know you don\u2019t need some stranger\u2019s approval not to do something. You haven\u2019t had much experience with men, have you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lindsay admitted. \u201cNot really.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFigures.\u201d Linda rolled her eyes. \u201cJust remember. Nobody should talk you into doing anything you don\u2019t want to do. Speaking of which, what do you plan to do this afternoon?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know. I kind of wanted to hang around until we heard from the squad to make sure they made it to Voroshilovgrad okay. But after that I have no idea.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\u201d Linda grinned, \u201cI got a message from the Colonel a few minutes before you got here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shoe shopping. Umm, heels I guess. I hope they know my size.\u201d<br>\r\nLinda gave her a level look. When Lindsay didn\u2019t catch on she pointed out \u201cYou bunk with 5 women who are the same size and shape. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right.\u201d Lindsay\u2019s ears turned slightly pink \u201cI keep forgetting. Guess that\u2019s one advantage of being a clone.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d agreed Linda \u201cThat and you can see what styles don\u2019t work on you. You know,\u201d she mused, tapping her finger on the table thoughtfully \u201cit\u2019s too bad all the clothes we have are Luftwaffe issue. The six of us could have the ultimate mix and match wardrobe. Maybe I\u2019ll get them to see about picking up a few cute skirts as well.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAnd when are we going to wear them?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWho cares? That\u2019s the real reason you buy clothes anyway, so that you have them just in case you suddenly have some place to wear them. And so the others can borrow them. Then you get to fight over your favorites.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWho would fight over clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cYou would, of course. Didn\u2019t your sister ever steal your favorite skirt?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I only had brothers, and they wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in a skirt.\u201d That much was true. \u201cAlthough\u201d Lindsay said, suddenly remembering a fight between two of them \u201cmy brother did lose a tooth over an Eminem hoodie.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSee. My sisters swapped outfits so often they\u2019d sew their names in their favorite\u2019s so there was a chance they\u2019d get them back. It\u2019s too bad we\u2019re stuck here. I would totally blow my pay packet on skirts and blouses. Maybe a nice purse to go with the shoes I\u2019m borrowing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Lindsay said, as the conversation tapered off and the two women fell silent, thinking about the missed opportunity. As much as she hated shopping, Linda\u2019s enthusiasm had actually made Lindsay regret she wasn\u2019t in the city with the rest of the squad.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of silent coffee drinking, Lindsay asked the question that lingered in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about you,\u201d Linda answered lazily \u201cBut I\u2019m just going to relax and read for a bit. How about you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a big reader. Maybe I\u2019ll wander over to the hanger and see what\u2019s up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing happening at the hanger. Literally. The only planes there were the two rarely used HE-111 bombers the squad had been issued at the beginning, and Linda\u2019s 109. The two Stukas were undergoing maintenance, so their engines were mostly in bits around the maintenance hanger. Of the maintenance staff there was no sign, probably taking the day off, as supposedly there was no officers around.<br>\r\nWithout a plane the chances of flying were off the table, so Lindsay wandered over to the Gasthaus and sat at the bar, helping herself to a beer. After a while the silence of the empty room became annoying, so she plugged a handful of change into the juke box and punched a bunch of buttons at random. <br>\r\n4 hours later Lindsay was staring blurrily at the drawing of the 127th mascot hanging over the bar, slowly coming to the realization that, as a recreational activity, drinking alone sucked. She really missed the company of others. It was not the same without all the rest of them around. Tipping her head back, she drained the last of her latest beer, getting a goodly portion of it in her mouth, and staggered back to the barracks to crawl into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came, and with it the all too familiar pounding head from too much to drink the night before. Staring at the raw pine rafters of the barrack roof Lindsay decided that, while there was probably some obscure definition of enjoyment that could be used to describe how her day off was starting, she\u2019d be better served with the aspirin, shower, and coffee that formed the miraculous instant cure she\u2019d adopted as her normal routine. <br>\r\nIt was later, as she was drying her hair, that she remembered the idle promise of taking a run that she\u2019d made herself over lunch the day before.  Before her brain could talk her out of it she dug through her locker until she found a pair of pants and a warm looking shirt that were soft and loose enough to suffice as workout gear. Since all she could find for running shoes were a pair of combat boots she laced them up and headed for the maintenance track that circled the base. <br>\r\n45 minutes later she found herself slumped against the generator shed, sweating and gasping for breath. After a few minutes her breath started to sound more like someone just breathing hard and less like someone drowning in mid air.<br>\r\nStill, she felt good about the exercise, and had discovered several undeniable truths about jogging at the 127th. The first was that the pothole filled dirt track around the perimeter of the base may be great for vehicles with four wheel drive, and not so great for navigating on foot.<br>\r\nThe taxiways along the runway however, were beautifully smooth and straight. Another important truth was that, even as a digitally simulated person, she was a little out of shape.<br>\r\nThe crunch of gravel under boots made her look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, he had managed to get his hands on a pair of running shoes instead of being forced to wear boots. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, jogging to a stop alongside her.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she gasped \u201cI\u2019m okay. Just catching my breath.\u201d She became conscious of just how much her chest was still heaving as she gulped air into her lungs, and this was after her breathing had calmed down. Good thing he wasn\u2019t here earlier, she thought. It must have been quite the show.<br>\r\nThe new arrival unclipped a canteen from his belt and drank thirstily before offering it to Lindsay. Gratefully, she accepted, passing it back after a few swallows. She hadn\u2019t thought to bring her own, and it really seemed to help.<br>\r\nHe poured a bit of water into his hand and splashed his face before screwing the cap back on and fixing the canteen back to his belt.<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you out here before,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I sort of just started.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell good for you. I find it\u2019s a great way to get rid of stress and focus. I\u2019ve been doing it for weeks now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not stress I\u2019m worried about,\u201d She replied \u201cI just thought I\u2019d try and get back into shape.\u201d<br>\r\nAs soon as she said this the guy cocked his head and quite obviously looked her over. She could almost hear the unspoken \u2018If that\u2019s what you look like when you\u2019re not in shape\u2026\u2019 but instead he asked \u201cDo you mind a piece of advise?\u201d<br>\r\nWhen Lindsay didn\u2019t say no he continued \u201cBoots are all right for everyday combat, but for running you\u2019ll want to get a proper pair of shoes. The Quartermaster might be able to get you a pair, but they don\u2019t keep them as stock and you\u2019ll have to hound him to do it. I finally had to get a friend pick a pair up for me last time he was on liberty.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. I\u2019ll get the Colonel to pick a pair up for me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, and looked at her oddly. Lindsay wondered why, then realized she wasn\u2019t wearing any rank insignias on her outfit. The poor guy was probably wondering who he was talking to, who had a Colonel to run errands for her.<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d he stammered \u201cAnd stay away from the perimeter road, unless you like having a twisted ankle. It\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d She said, having already come to that conclusion herself.<br>\r\nShe stood up and arched her back, stretching. She could feel his eyes following her every move, so she added a couple of gratuitous twists and side stretches, just to see his reaction. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat would you recommend as a good route?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\nWith some effort he tore his eyes off her and looked her in the face. \u201cMe? I usually just follow the edge of the taxiway. Twice around is about 5k. That\u2019s my usual distance.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSounds too much for me.\u201d She said \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just do once around. Are you out tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh Yeah.\u201d He said eagerly \u201cEvery morning at oh eight hundred, usually. I\u2019m late today.\u201d He added.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of glad for that.\u201d She said with a smile. \u201cGave us a chance to meet. Maybe if I have someone to jog with I\u2019ll actually stick to it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah.\u201d He agreed. \u201cAll exercise regimes recommend you have a partner or group to encourage you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI can understand that. What say I meet you here at oh eight hundred tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMake it quarter after. I usually start my run at the far end. Lieutenant Frank Maddigan, 83rd Kampfgeschwader, by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFirst Lieutenant Lindsay Anderson, 127 Jagdgeschwader. You\u2019re part of the ground pounders that take up all the south part of the compound.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s us.\u201d Frank said with a grin \u201cAnd you\u2019re one of the mad cows that fly out of the hangers by runway 10.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAt your service,\u201d Lindsay said, returning his grin with one of her own. \u201cSo, oh eight fifteen it is. See you tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\nWith a little wave of her fingers, Lindsay turned then started an easy jog north towards the barracks of the 127th.<br>\r\nA few meters later she looked back and saw Frank still standing where she\u2019d left him, watching her. As soon as he saw her looking he turned and started jogging the other way. Lindsay grinned. Maybe she was getting more comfortable with her body. She was certainly having fun seeing the various reactions she could get out of men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for Breakfast<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, in the Shower.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So much had happened. But what had happened, or didn\u2019t happen as it turned out, wasn\u2019t what she considered to be a date, and she said so.<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a date.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust because you didn\u2019t go doesn\u2019t make it not count.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFor the last time that wasn\u2019t a date, and this isn\u2019t either.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGirl, you\u2019re meeting a man at a specific time to do something. That\u2019s pretty much the definition of a date to me.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going jogging. It\u2019s not a date.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Linda continued \u201cLorraine has only been gone a day and you\u2019re already turning into the camp party girl.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Lindsay protested \u201cBecause I met someone while jogging?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I can\u2019t turn my back and you\u2019re meeting men everywhere you turn.<br>\r\nSo far there\u2019s been a Major and a Captain and a couple of lieutenants. Heck, there\u2019s even that dick of a Corporal. I mean, and who have I met?\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay suddenly noticed the undertone to Linda\u2019s words that she hadn\u2019t been aware of until now. Beneath the teasing was more than a slight touch of jealousy.<br>\r\n\u201cLinda?\u201d she asked carefully \u201cYou\u2019re not jealous, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No. Why would you think I was jealous?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that you sound jealous.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not.\u201d Linda said defensively, savagely spearing a sausage.<br>\r\n\u201cI think you are.\u201d Lindsay said, thoughtfully. After a couple of silent moments she added. \u201cTell you what. I\u2019ll skip tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Linda said, looking up from her plate. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not right.\u201d She put her fork down and sat back, sighing. \u201cListen, I\u2019m only teasing about the date thing. Don\u2019t skip it because of me.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay looked at her, watching her reaction \u201cBut you\u2019re obviously upset about it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Linda said, an obvious lie. After a moment she seemed to realize this. \u201cWell, okay. Maybe I am, just a bit. You\u2019re right and I am a little jealous.\u201d She grudgingly admitted. <br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Lindsay wanted to know \u201cBelieve me, I never asked for any of this.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that makes it worse.\u201d Linda said with a grimace<br>\r\n\u201cWorse? How could that be worse?<br>\r\n\u201cLook,\u201d Linda said thoughtfully. \u201cI think what bothers me about it is just, well, we\u2019re identical. Like twins. Yet the men are drooling all over you and ignoring me. And that, well, that bothers me because it brings up all sorts of issues.\u201d <br>\r\nLindsay wasn\u2019t sure what to say, so she just waited.<br>\r\nSure enough, after a moment Linda continued. \u201cLook, growing up I was never that popular. As a result I\u2019ve always been a jealous of people who make friends easily. Like the other girls I grew up with. For the longest time I told myself it was because they were prettier than I was. Or funnier. When I got married all of a sudden I didn\u2019t have to worry about it so much. Then the divorce happened and suddenly I was alone and struggling to meet people all over again. And here you are meeting people and not even trying.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLinda,\u201d Lindsay protested, \u201cEugene and Eric were talking to you just as much as they talked to me. As for that little Corporal you should be glad he ignored you. And you can\u2019t count Lieutenant Mackentyre. That was a direct result of the little sleezeball\u2019s actions.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut you still met him, which is the point.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you want to look at points, you\u2019ve met Eugene and Eric, which gives you two points.\u201d Lindsay said, holding up her hand and ticking the points off on her fingers. \u201cI\u2019ve also met them, plus Darryl and Frank, which gives me four points, and that Corporal, which probably counts as a negative five, which puts you way ahead of me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a contest.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that is my point.\u201d Lindsay said, pointing the finger she was using to tick the points off at Linda to emphasize what she was saying. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a sample of five people over two days and deciding I\u2019m more popular than you, which is utter nonsense.\u201d<br>\r\nLinda looked like she was considering what Lindsay was saying for the first time, which she probably was.<br>\r\n\u201cI am being silly about it, aren\u2019t I.\u201d she concluded at last \u201cI suppose you can go jogging any time you want.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGee, thanks mom\u201d Lindsay said, slightly sarcastically. <br>\r\n\u201cIt such a silly thing, really.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPersonal issues are never silly. Just remember I\u2019m here if you need to talk.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Linda said with a small smile \u201cI appreciate that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you should come jogging too.\u201d Lindsay said, pressing her advantage \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you to Frank.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t that put me even further ahead of you on points?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLike you said, it\u2019s not a contest. And he probably has all sorts of buddies at the 83rd he can introduce us to.\u201d<br>\r\nLinda gave her that level stare that really needed a pair of librarian glasses to pull off correctly. Eventually, Lindsay said \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\nLinda made a wry face \u201cFor a moment I thought Lorraine was back.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, then I remembered she probably already knows all the guys over there. You want more coffee?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOh Good\u201d Linda said, as she started gathering up the dirty dishes on the table. \u201cWhile you\u2019re up would you mind filling mine as well? Two cream one sugar.\u201d<br>\r\n Lindsay got up to get herself more coffee. As she walked up to the massive silver urns at the front of the mess tent she spotted the book Linda had been reading still on the table they\u2019d sat at the day before. She picked it up on the way back to the table and idly glanced over the cover while she waited for Linda to get back from clearing the dishes.<br>\r\n<b><i>\u2018Belinda Blinked, by Rocky Flintstone.</i>\u2019</b><br>\r\nThinking it was some trashy romance novel, and with nothing better to do, she nonchalantly flipped it open, stopping as her eye caught a descriptive sentence.<br>\r\n<i>\u2018The Duchess stood up and stretched her cramped body.\u2019</i> The sentence read.<i> \u2018Her nipples hardened with her feeling and they were now as large as the three-inch rivets which held the hull of the fateful Titanic together\u2019.</i><br>\r\n\u201cDa-Fug did I just read?\u201d Lindsay said, not realizing she\u2019d spoke out loud. <br>\r\n \u201cThat was my reaction too.\u201d Linda said from behind her. <br>\r\nLindsay dropped the book like a hot potato and spun around.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can read it if you want,\u201d Linda continued as she collected her coffee cup and sat down, seemingly not the least bit perturbed that Lindsay had been reading her book. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t bother. It is a truly awful piece of tripe that barely deserves the generous one star rating the reviews have given it. I honestly only picked it up because of the podcast.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, no thanks\u201d Lindsay decided. \u201cI think I\u2019ll pass.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSmart girl. My estimation of your intelligence just keeps going up and up.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of smart, I should get the Colonel to pick up us some running shoes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be better if I ask Lana-Raye to do it. Leslie might be offended if a mere First Lieutenant started asking her to run errands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once again the sound of gravel caught Lindsay\u2019s attention. This time however, it was the sound of many pairs of feet crunching their way up the gravel taxiway. Seven pairs, in fact. She looked up to see that Frank was accompanied by six other men, all dressed for jogging.<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Linda said as she watched them approach. \u201cWhen you said you were meeting someone you never mentioned it was the whole squad!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know!\u201d Lindsay said honestly. Frank hadn\u2019t mentioned that he was bringing company, let alone what looked to be half a side for football. <br>\r\n\u201cI think someone has finally one-upped Lorraine.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, really!\u201d Lindsay protested. \u201cI thought it would just be Frank.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing I came out today or you\u2019d be way ahead of me on points.\u201d Linda said with a grin.<br>\r\n\u201cHey there!\u201d Frank greeted them as the group came up. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d He said addressing Linda with an apologetic tone. \u201cI sort of mentioned that you were joining me today and suddenly everyone wanted to come.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Linda said with a mischievous grin and deliberately not correcting him. \u201cThe more the merrier.\u201d She looked over the group \u201cDo all you guys fly with the 83rd?\u201d she asked, in spite of the obvious.<br>\r\n\u201cSure do ma\u2019am\u201d, said one barrel chested man with a handlebar moustache. \u201cCaptain Rhett Jackson, at your service.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain Robert Stone.\u201d said the man next to him. Of the group it was clear he would be most to benefit from regular exercise, given his shorter and more portly frame.<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain Andrew Kelly\u201d was next, followed by an unremarkable Lieutenant Fred Murphy and a very Brazilian looking Captain Anthony Jervis. <br>\r\nLast to introduce himself was the big black guy who was hanging around the back of the group. \u201cFirst Lieutenant Arichikuruku Yakamura\u201d he said, bowing slightly as he did.<br>\r\nLinda couldn\u2019t help but raise her eyebrows at this. The group burst into snickers, and the big guy grinned. \u2018I lost a bet.\u201d He said. \u201cEveryone calls me Archie.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPleased to meet you Archie. I\u2019m Captain Linda Bray-Lewis, and my running partner and the one who talked me into doing this over there is First Lieutenant Lindsay Anderson\u201d Linda said, waving her hand in Lindsay\u2019s direction.<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d Frank said, noticing for the first time the rank insignia on the girls shirt sleeves and realizing his mistake.<br>\r\nHe started to apologize, but Lindsay waved him off, enjoying Linda\u2019s little joke. The look on his face just now had been worth it.<br>\r\n\u201cLindsay and Linda?\u201d asked a slightly confused looking Anthony. \u201cI thought one of you was named Lorraine\u201d<br>\r\nLinda laughed \u201cShe\u2019d be our evil twin.\u201d She said, \u201cexcept there\u2019s more than two of us. And it\u2019s Lindsay\u2019s turn to be the evil one.\u201d<br>\r\nAnthony didn\u2019t look a whole lot less confused by Linda\u2019s explanation, so she elaborated.<br>\r\n\u201cLook, there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of choices for avatars when we joined up. If it helps, think of us as Sextuplets.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t sextuplets mean six\u201d Lindsay asked \u201cThere\u2019s seven of us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh God,\u201d groaned Frank. \u201cI hope you at least wear nametags.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNope!\u201d grinned Linda. \u201cWe like to keep people guessing. Shall we go?\u201d<br>\r\nWith that the group set off at an easy pace, Frank in the lead. After about a kilometer Lindsay noticed something peculiar. The group stayed together, letting the girls set the pace. Two men would always be in the lead, with Lindsay and Linda following, the rest close behind. Occasionally one of the men would drop back and another would move forward to take his place. They were halfway around the taxiway when Lindsay developed a sneaking suspicion they were doing it on purpose. Frank leading and the rest taking turns dropping behind, probably staring at their butts. Try as she might though, she couldn\u2019t catch anyone being obvious about it, although she did catch a few guilty looking grins when she glanced back. After a while, she decided it didn\u2019t really bother her that much anyway. There was that growing part of her that found the attention flattering, and she decided to let them have their fun. At least they were being discrete about it.<br>\r\nThe group continued in this fashion until they had made a full circuit. Stopping when they returned to the generator shed a water break and brief rest. They were all gasping for breath at this point, all except for Frank, who was just breathing slightly hard.<br>\r\nAll was good until Lindsay tried to pour a small amount of water on her forehead to cool off and misjudged how quickly water would gush out of the canteen. <br>\r\nThe result was a disaster. Or not, depending on your point of view. Her shirt was immediately soaked, and the chill mid morning air, which was fine when they were running, immediately played havoc with her nipples. Brief thoughts about the hull of the Titanic flashed though her mind for some reason as she stood there gasping.<br>\r\nThere was nothing discreet about the attention she was suddenly getting. The air was filled with wolf whistles and appreciative comments. <br>\r\nFrank and Rhett, quick on the uptake and obviously both raised as gentlemen, stepped forward and offered their shirts when they saw the problem. As Lindsay quickly covered herself she glared around the group, now seeing eyes pointedly look in directions other than hers, for which she was grateful, although she was sure she saw several of them sneak a few lingering glances when they thought she wasn\u2019t looking. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t a bad smell, just honest sweat with a touch of shaving cr\u00e8me. And maybe a hint of musk. Since they were done the run anyhow, or at least the portion the girls were up for, Lindsay headed to the barracks to change, promising to return the shirt that afternoon in spite of Franks protests that he had several and she could keep it if she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was clever\u201d Linda said as they headed back to the barracks<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was?\u201d Lindsay asked, practically swimming inside her borrowed shirt. It was not a whole lot warmer.<br>\r\n\u201cDrenching your shirt like that. Talk about attention getting.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was an accident.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure it was. I think Lorraine has finally got some competition.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh please.\u201d Lindsay rolled her eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cNice move on Frank\u2019s part, though.\u201d Linda continued, declining to notice Lindsay\u2019s expression.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it was nice of him to lend me his shirt.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI think it was more of \u2018You showed me yours, so I\u2019ll show you mine.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNow who\u2019s trying to one up Lorraine?\u201d<br>\r\nThat got a laugh and another eye roll, because they both knew they were just kidding around. Innuendo seemed to be an occupational hazard of rooming with Colleen.<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously though,\u201d Lindsay said \u201cDid you notice the boys were watching us the whole time?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed they were watching you. Especially towards the end there.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe shirt thing really was an accident.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI mean before, while you were running. That extra little wiggle you put into your step.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI did no such thing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGirl, I was watching you. Trust me, you did.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay was silent for a moment \u201cDid I really?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh! If I didn\u2019t know better I\u2019d say you were enjoying the attention.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe a little.\u201d Lindsay admitted. Knowing the boys were watching had made her feel special.<br>\r\n\u201cNothing wrong with that. People like others to pay attention to them. Just try not to go overboard.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOverboard?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLike the shirt.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut that was an accident.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it was.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut it was!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later Lindsay pulled the jeep to a stop in front of the 83rd mess hall, figuring that there should be someone there who could let her know where Frank was. To their surprise, the mess tent was being used as a mission briefing room by the base commander, who looked a little less than pleased at the interruption when they walked in.<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, Hi.\u201d was all Lindsay could think to say as the Colonel\u2019s glare turned to the two intruders standing in the doorway. Anything else she could have said would have been drowned out by the sudden burst of whistles and cat calls as the crowd of airmen noticed who was in the doorway.<br>\r\nThe Colonel cleared his throat and the room fell silent again.<br>\r\n \u201cSorry.\u201d Lindsay stammered and the catcalls died down. \u201cI was, ummm, just wanting to return Frank\u2019s shirt. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt\u201d<br>\r\nThis got a synchronized \u2018Oooh\u2019 from the assembled crowd. The Colonel himself didn\u2019t say anything, although his arched eyebrows indicated what he was thinking as he swiveled his glare towards Frank, seated the middle of the group of airmen. <br>\r\nSurprisingly, Frank seemed indifferent to the Colonels look, waving nonchalantly in their direction.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Colonel,\u201d Frank said. \u201cLinda there is with the 127th. The Lieutenant had a wardrobe malfunction earlier today during morning exercises so I loaned her a shirt. I told her not to bother, but it looks like she insists on returning it\u201d<br>\r\nThe Colonel looked back at Lindsay. \u201cI thought her name was Lorraine?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLorraine\u2019s the girl that comes over to play pool. Linda there joined us for the morning jog.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cActually, I\u2019m Lindsay. That\u2019s Linda.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u201d the Colonel harrumphed \u201cReturning borrowed property is all well and good, and I\u2019m glad you managed to convince these slug-abouts to get out of bed early for a change, but we\u2019re smack daub in the middle of a strategy meeting right now, and that doesn\u2019t involve input from the fighter escort of the 127th, so unless you\u2019ve had experience as a bombardier I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re kind of busy at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\nThe comment was an obvious dismissal as the Colonel turned back to his flip chart.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh, Lindsay has experience\u201d Linda volunteered before Lindsay had a chance to say anything. \u201cShe\u2019s actually pretty good.\u201d<br>\r\nThat was true. During that first week of combat the Colonel had insisted that they try crewing the HE-111\u2019s the squadron had been assigned, on the premise that they had two of them so they might as well see what they were like. Although no one had crashed, none of them had showed any proficiency behind the controls, and they had overwhelmingly decided that, given a choice, they would prefer a machine where you were the pilot, gunner, and bomber (when equipped) combined, instead of being assigned one position through the entire mission.<br>\r\nAlthough she didn\u2019t like to brag about it, Lindsay seemed to have a gift for thinking in three dimensions, and this innate ability had carried over when she was operating the bombsight, allowing her to score more targets than all the rest combined. Trust Linda to bring it up.<br>\r\n\u201cIs that true?\u201d The Colonel asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about the pretty good part,\u201d Lindsay stammered \u201cI mean, I only hit five out of six targets.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFive out of six you say?\u201d The Colonel thought about that for a moment.\u201dAnd what about your partner there?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d Linda said \u201cI\u2019m nowhere near as good. I only hit two, although I almost got a third.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo two out of six?\u201d<br>\r\nThe Colonel looked speculatively at the two women standing in the doorway.<br>\r\nHis face a little less sour all of a sudden. More speculative. <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s as good as our boys here are doing. What would your commander say if I was to borrow you for a couple of missions?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d Linda admitted \u201cShe\u2019s in Voroshilovgrad at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cToo bad.\u201d The Colonel said, his face turning sour again. \u201cOur problem is I have too many targets and not enough that can hit them. I could have really used a couple more Bombardiers on this mission, but with Colonel Helgamiere in Voroshilovgrad by the time I she gives me permission to requisition you it will be too late.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if we volunteer?\u201d Linda asked<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lindsay said<br>\r\n\u201cLook, we\u2019re both bored out of our skulls. It\u2019s either this or we go back to playing poker and I\u2019m frankly getting sick of cards.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? We don\u2019t play poker!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cVolunteer?\u201d The Colonel asked, focusing on what, to him, was important. \u201cYes, I suppose I could make that would work.\u201d He fussed his way though the implications. \u201cYou\u2019d need your CO\u2019s permission for that, but I could assume you have that already. Of course, you\u2019d be listed on the flight manifest as an observer, since you\u2019re not officially part of the squadron.\u201d His face broke out into, what for him, passed as a grin. \u201cYes, we could make that work. If you\u2019d be willing to go.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d said Linda. \u201cWe\u2019re officially on leave anyway, even though we\u2019re stuck on base. Might as well be doing something for fun.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRight then\u201d said the Colonel, rubbing his hands. \u201cJervis, you\u2019re back at the helm of your bomber, that young lady there just volunteered to be your bombardier. Jackson, the other young lady there is yours. That puts us back up to 12 aircraft for this raid. Pilots, fill your bombardiers in on the targets and get ready for takeoff at thirteen hundred.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that is how the two pilots from the 127th wound up flying as crew on a bombing raid with the 83rd.<br>\r\nThe Colonel in charge of the 83rd was happy enough, it gave him two more bomber crews.<br>\r\nRhett and Tony were also happy, they were flying instead of targeting, something none of the pilots really liked, but tolerated because the alternative was to use an AI, and with only a 12 percent success rate that alternative sucked. With the girls manning the sights this time they had a much better chance at success. Of course, it didn\u2019t hurt matters that, under all that bulky flight gear, the two were gorgeous. <br>\r\nThe bombardier in a Henkle 111 didn\u2019t have a seat so much as a bench that he could kneel on as gunner, or lay flat on as bombardier. Lindsay settled in as gunner as the flight bounced it\u2019s way across the runway and up into the sky. Once airborne she re-checked the 20mm MG that would serve as her weapon. Normally it would protrude through an opening in the bubble nose of the craft, although in a pinch it could be picked up and pointed through any available opening, something she had seen done in training films. Satisfied that it was fully operational she settled in and watched the scenery scroll past underneath them. The glass nose of the Henkle was often described as \u2018like flying a green house, offering an unobstructed view in all directions forward for both the pilot and nose gunner, something Lindsay rarely got to experience flying her 109, what with the big engine in front of her. Plus today she had the rare luxury of being a passenger while someone else was doing all the dirty work of flying. For several minutes she just luxuriated in the passing scenery until radio traffic broke through on the headphones. <br>\r\n\u201cKeep an eye out\u201d the voice of the lead pilot crackled \u201cWe should be seeing our escort out there pretty quick.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay turned her attention to the sky around them, forgoing the beauty of the scenery below to search the delightfully clear blue skies around her. Soon enough, a flight of BF109s merged with their group.<br>\r\nWith a mild shock, Lindsay saw the markings of their escort. It was the 104th<br>\r\nFor the most part, the greeting between the two squads was routine. Identification, confirmation of target and flight orders, etc. Then the conversation got more casual. And a little more personal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It started with one of the pilots saying \u201cHey, you guys fly out of the same field the 127th does, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s correct.\u201d replied the flight leader. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the north end of the compound. Why do you ask?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe had a couple of their pilots at the base yesterday. A couple of real good lookers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like the 127th alright.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThought maybe you\u2019d know them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCouple of women doesn\u2019t narrow it down too much. The 127th is all women, didn\u2019t you know? \u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d know these two if you saw them. Twins, about five foot six, blue eyes, long blond hair, Built like Victoria Secret models. Sound familiar?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need to get more specific. That describes about 90 percent of the 127th.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously? A squadron of twin lingerie models?\u201d<br>\r\nSeveral other voices broke into the conversation \u201cMan you guys got it lucky.\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cHow do I get transferred to your squadron?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo they really all look like that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI have it on good authority they do. I\u2019ve only met a couple of them personally.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay looked back at Rhett. He had his goggles pushed up onto his helmet and she could see he was grinning, hugely amused by the conversation. Probably getting a kick knowing that one of the topic of conversation was kneeling on the gunners bench in front of him being described as a Victoria secret model. With her flight suit on that comparison required a highly imaginative imagination.<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d the pilot from the 104th was saying. \u201cI\u2019d have thought you guys would be all over them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTheir CO has banned us from their part of the base.\u201d Was the matter of fact reply.<br>\r\n\u201cBanned?\u201d That voice sounded astonished. \u201cWhat did you guys do?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. She just likes their privacy.\u201d <br>\r\nAll true, when you thought about it. Although it was also partly the attitude the flyboys were demonstrating.<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s one that visits us fairly regular, but other than that I\u2019ve only met a couple others.\u201d Lindsay thought maybe this was Frank that was talking, although she couldn\u2019t say for sure. The distortion of the radio made identification of the voices difficult. <br>\r\n\u201cToo bad. If the rest look anything like the two that visited us, Friday night parties would be something else.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMan, you got that right,\u201d a voice that no amount of static distortion could disguise said. A voice Lindsay had hoped to never hear again. \u201cThose two were some delicious looking pieces of ass.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for sharing that observation Gary.\u201d This voice too was familiar, although Lindsay currently wasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind to identify it. \u201cThere\u2019s more to a woman than what their ass looks like, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou got that right,\u201d the voice of Gary continued \u201cThose tits of theirs were something else, too. Mighty firm and fine. Sure felt nice in my hands. Did I tell you I got to hold them?\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay\u2019s eyes got hard as she glared out the bubble in the front of the plane. In spite of what she had told Linda yesterday, about not forgiving and just forgetting, she found her finger poised over the trigger. If she could only pick out the little runt\u2019s plane.<br>\r\n\u201cGet real! You never touched them\u201d someone else was saying. <br>\r\n\u201cSure I did\u201d bragged Gary \u201cThe little one was all upset over her plane being wrecked, so being the soul of understanding that I am, I had to comfort her. One thing leads to another, if you know what I mean. You\u2019d be amazed what they feel like pressed against you. Mighty fine, indeed.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGive it up\u201d someone else radioed \u201cIt never happened.\u201d<br>\r\nBut Gary must have felt he was on a roll, because he kept going \u201cI tell you, she was the nicest piece I\u2019ve had in a long time. Natural blond too. I tell you, that chick was a wild one too, once she got her freak on. The things she did with her mouth. Man, if I\u2019d known being upset turned her crank like that I\u2019d have wrecked her plane myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did it. Lindsay flipped the safety off the 20mm and began looking over their escort, searching for a plane with JG104-52 on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she even started looking there was a sudden yelling over the radio.<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u201d Gary was shouting \u201cWatch what you\u2019re doing. You almost hit me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOoops, sorry about that\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell happened there Mackentyre\u201d came a new voice, one Lindsay hadn\u2019t heard yet.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Colonel,\u201d Darryl radioed back \u201cHe got me distracted while I was checking my guns. I accidentally hit the trigger with the safety off.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cColonel!\u201d The little Corporal protested \u201cHe tried to shoot me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDid you try to shoot him, Mackentyre?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWith all respect, sir, if I really tried to shoot him do you think he\u2019d still be here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood point. Be more careful how you check your guns next time Mackentyre.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut Colonel,\u201d the corporal whined \u201cYou\u2019re not going to let him get away with that, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cO\u2019Brian, shut up. If he says it was an accident, it was an accident.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut Sir. That\u2019s the second time he\u2019s had an accident and almost hit me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSave it O\u2019Brian. I don\u2019t want to hear another word. But I\u2019ll tell you one last thing. I know the CO of the 127th. If you touched one of her pilots in way she would consider inappropriate, she\u2019ll make you think getting shot down was the best thing to happen to you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs for the rest of you, talk about women all you want when we\u2019re back on the ground, for now shut up and concentrate on doing your job.\u201d<br>\r\nWith these words the two groups settled down to business, the only radio chatter being status and position updates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the flak started, and the Russians came up to play.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201c5 Minutes to target\u201d Came the flight leader\u2019s voice over the radio. \u201cAll bombardiers to your stations.\u201d <br>\r\nLindsay had already been hunched over her station for several minutes, checking and rechecking the settings. Current altitude. Heading. Wind direction both aloft and on the ground. Making small adjustments as she noted discrepancies between the posted reports she was reading and what she could see through the bombsite.<br>\r\nWhen the call to man stations came in she glanced back at Rhett, who nodded. The work of controlling the bomber was now divided between them. For the next five minutes Rhett\u2019s job was to keep the bomber as straight and level as possible. Lindsay would make the small corrections to their heading that would put them over target. Once the target had been reached and the bombs released Rhett would then once again be in charge of the whole aircraft.<br>\r\nA successful bombing run, when you thought about it, it was simply a matter of mathematics. A bomber moved forward at a velocity of X, along an altitude of Y. Bombs fell at a constantly accelerating rate until they hit maximum speed, or terminal velocity. Therefore, if you knew how high you were, you could figure out Z, how long it took for a bomb to reach the ground when you dropped it. Factor in your speed and you knew how far back you had to be when you dropped it so it reached the ground when you wanted it to. It was all very simple and straight forward, and in no way involved quadratic equations. <br>\r\nThe Russians, of course, had their own math to work out as well. They had a target moving at a velocity of X, along an altitude of Y. Flak guns shot shells with timed fuses with a delay of Z and were station along the path of X. Factor in the enemy\u2019s speed, position, and heading, and you knew where to point your gun and when to fire. It was all very simple and straight forward, and suddenly math became far more exciting and deadlier than the man with the tweed jacket standing in front of your middle school chalkboard had ever made it out to be. <br>\r\nCurrently both sides were doing their best to make sure the other couldn\u2019t solve for X.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay watched the ground waiting, for the target to swim into the eyepiece through the sudden clouds of smoke that kept appearing. Anti Aircraft fire from the guns protecting the factories below. A swarm of YAKs and IL2s boiled up from airstrips dotted here and there, driving upward to break though the fighter escort that was protecting the bombers. The fighters diving down to meet them midway, doing their best to keep them there. And through it all, the Bomber droned on. Straight and level. Lindsay making small corrections as the cross hairs inched slowly toward their destination. Lindsay was zoned. She had no control over what the enemy fighters were doing, so she trusted the escort to do their job. She had no control over the Flak, so she trusted that to chance. She had no real control over what the bomber was doing, so she trusted in Rhett and his skill. Around her she could hear the sounds of combat. The radio squawking with status updates. Reports of being hit, requests for help, expletives of pilots desperate for help, or now beyond help. And occasional cheers of victory. Defensive machine gun fire rattled the floor, and occasionally the airframe around her shuddered. All of this she felt as mere background noise. Her world was the sighting scope. That she could control. And when at last the target was firmly centered in the cross hairs and she pushed the button, the airframe bucked and shuddered as the load released, completing that part of the job they trusted her to do. <br>\r\nWidening the field of view, she racked the scope back, keeping it centered on the target, waiting the long seconds until grey plumes of bombs detonating precisely where she had aimed them appeared. Grey plumes that hung briefly in the warm afternoon air, to be quickly obscured by smoke and flames and further explosions as the target munitions factory obliterated itself. Only then did she give the pilot a \u2018thumbs up\u2019, before leaning back and allowing herself to feel a sense of satisfaction. <br>\r\nA sense of satisfaction and well being lasted for almost 5 minutes. Long enough for the flight to form up for the trip home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She went to look out the window and was shocked to discover several panes in the glass nose were missing. When had that happened? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe radio chatter was mostly group updates. They hadn\u2019t come out of the raid unscathed. Two bombers were missing and five fighters were unaccounted for, but on the whole the raid was a success.<br>\r\n\u201cEcho Two,\u201d came the voice Lindsay thought likely belonged to Colonel Seiler, commander of the 104th  \u201cThis is Eagle Leader. That was one nice pattern you laid there.\u201d<br>\r\nRhett pushed the button on his throat mic. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t feel like making another run through that mess, so I thought I\u2019d make the first one count.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think that one counted for sure, Echo Two. Might as well pack up and go home boys, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s two bricks left stuck together down there. Good job Echo Two.\u201d<br>\r\nRhett keyed the mic again. \u201cThanks Eagle One. But I\u2019m just flying this thing. All the credit goes to my bombardier.\u201d <br>\r\n \u201cThat it does Echo Two. Tell Yancy it\u2019s good to see him back on his game.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI would if he was here, Eagle Leader. He\u2019s still MIA. We picked up a couple of subs for today. From the 127th.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c127th? You mean the Mad Cows? Helgamiere\u2019s squad? The fighter pilots?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes Sir. We had First Lieutenant Anderson on lead dropping the eggs today.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnderson you say? There was a Lieutenant Anderson who dead sticked a plane into my runway yesterday. Same one?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know about that. Tell you what, why don\u2019t you ask her yourself.\u201d<br>\r\nMotioning Lindsay closer, Rhett pulled his headset cord out of the radio and replaced it with hers.<br>\r\n\u201cUmm. Hiya Colonel, Sir\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cYeah, that was my plane.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou left a hell of a mess by my runway, kid.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry sir. I didn\u2019t mean to. I was kind of shot up and didn\u2019t have much choice.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI could see that. I\u2019m still thinking of sending you a bill for the clean up.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut, I already got one from the Corporal.\u201d Lindsay protested.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh hell, I was just kidding about that. O\u2019Brian, did you give the young lady a bill?\u201d<br>\r\nThere was no answer.<br>\r\n\u201cO\u2019Brian?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s here sir.\u201d Some one responded.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he got himself shot down again.\u201d Someone else added.<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess. Another Accident?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo Sir\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was Flak sir,\u201d Someone else chimed in. \u201cI can testify to that. Happened right in front of me. A direct hit. Completely obliterated him. Nothing left but a couple of wing tips fluttering to the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo Flak got O\u2019Brian today then. Well then, I guess that means no points to any of you.\u201d<br>\r\nThere was a pregnant pause before someone answered.<br>\r\n\u201cUh, points, sir?\u201d<br>\r\nYou know what I\u2019m talking about. Negative points for accidentally shooting down a friendly.<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Ah, right. Yeah, no points against any of us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAfter all,\u201d the Colonel continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not like someone was keeping a spread sheet of how many times O\u2019Brian kept getting in the way of the guns from his own unit.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh, right sir. No spread sheet.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd of course they\u2019re also not posting it on the bulletin board, and maybe assigning point values, just so you could see who\u2019s got the worst luck with him getting in the way and all.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cToo bad. I\u2019m thinking that would be a good idea. Mackentyre, make it happen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing Sir. Sounds like a good idea.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it is Mackentyre. It\u2019s mine. See to it as soon as we get back to base. I want a report within an hour of touchdown.\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cYes sir.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just so we all understand each other. What I said still holds. If I catch any of you intentionally shooting that man down, I\u2019ll bust a rank and ground you for a week.<br>\r\nAnd I look very much forward to reading the latest version of that spread sheet you haven\u2019t been making when you post it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Closest field was the 104th, so I headed there. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, as I lined up the approach the engine quit. But I managed to stretch the glide to hit the runway. It wasn\u2019t a crash, it was a landing. Scraped the prop, sure, but I stopped sitting on the gear.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh Yeah,\u201d said Linda, currently the only other female in the room. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the oil on the window.

Half the bloody panel was blown to shit. Anything that was working was giving me shit for information. The only thing I could rely on was the compass. Punched the side windows out so I could see my wingtips and keep level.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d Mr. Instrument Pilot said. \u201cSo you expect us to believe you lined up and landed on a runway you couldn\u2019t see.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMike,\u201d said one of the other men, \u201cJust shut up and let the pretty lady finish her story.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank the other pretty lady for that\u201d Lindsay waved to Linda \u201cShe got me lined up and talked me down.

Nothing else.\u201d<br>\r\nLinda reached over and took a hold of her chin, pulling her face around until Lindsay was looking directly at her. \u201cJust drinking and telling stories now. What about in a couple of hours when you\u2019re really smashed? What if they decide they want a little different type of entertainment? Then what?\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay stared at Linda trying to figure out what she was talking about. Slowly the thought of what could happen penetrated the fuzzy wool around her brain. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t.\u201d she said, aghast.<br>\r\n\u201cYou think not?\u201d Linda said, releasing her hold on Lindsay\u2019s chin. \u201cMaybe not all of them, but enough of them would.\u201d She held Lindsay in place with the shear force of her gaze \u201cAnd if they decided they would, what then? What kind of chance do you think you\u2019d stand?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut. But.\u201d Lindsay stuttered in protest \u201cLorraine does this all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLorraine knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d Linda said with a hard edge in her voice \u201cShe\u2019s been doing it for years. And she doesn\u2019t start off by getting half wasted. You, on the other hand, haven\u2019t a clue what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d Lindsay said, belligerently refusing to admit the obvious.<br>\r\n\u201cRight. Girls who say that usually wind up as mothers. Or worse.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo way. That wouldn\u2019t happen to me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou just keep telling yourself that. Let me know how it works out for you.\u201d Linda was quiet for a moment. Then she said \u201cI\u2019m going inside and read a bit before dinner. You decide what you want to do.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that she got out of the jeep, leaving Lindsay to sit there alone, thinking. Linda was probably right. But part of her really wanted to head back and continue the party. Surely there was a way to pull it off so that she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about things getting ugly. <br>\r\nHow would Lorraine pull it off?<br>\r\nBe Sensible about it<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sighing, Lindsay got unsteadily out of the Jeep and went inside to change. The flight suit she was wearing smelled of sweat and grease with a touch of bar smoke, and was a bit sticky in spots. Holding onto her locker for support she eventually stripped the suit off and tossed it into the corner. Maybe a shower too, she thought. Get cleaned up a bit before she went back. She had just intended to sit on the edge of her cot for a minute while she decided what to wear, but it felt so comfortable she lay back. Just rest for a minute, she thought, while part of her brain tried to figure out a way she could get back to the party.<br>\r\nAnother part of her brain, thinking surprisingly sober thoughts given her current condition, realized the truth of what Linda was saying. Being a woman and getting drunk with a crowd of strange men was just asking for trouble. <br>\r\nMoments later it seemed, the barracks door opened and Linda poked her head in.<br>\r\n\u201cMess hall is closing in an hour.\u201d She said \u201cBetter get over there now if you want something to eat.\u201d <br>\r\nLindsay looked at her watch, wondering what happened to the last four hours. She must have dozed off for a bit. Grabbing her duty uniform she quickly dressed and headed over to the mess hall.<br>\r\n\u201cDecided to join me, did you?\u201d Linda asked, not even looking up.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Lindsay replied. \u201cGuess I was sort of hungry.\u201d<br>\r\nLinda had obviously finished eating not too long before, judging by the dirty tray and utensils on the table. Now, she was sitting at the table reading what appeared to be, at least from the cover design, yet another Romance Novel, something called \u2018<i>My Immortal</i>\u2019. Whatever it was about had Linda\u2019s complete attention, for which Lindsay was grateful. She didn\u2019t really feel like talking just yet. As Linda sat reading Lindsay set to devouring the evening meal, Jaeger Schnitzel and Szegediner Gulasch. The breaded veal and mashed potatoes were done to the perfection she\u2019d come to expect from the unit\u2019s kitchen. As was the stew.<br>\r\nShe was just about done when Linda suddenly looked up and asked \u201cPlanning on heading back to the 83rd tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking about it earlier,\u201d Lindsay admitted, tearing a chunk of bread off a loaf and dipping it into the spicy stew that had accompanied the veal. \u201cNow I\u2019m not so sure. You\u2019re probably right about being drunk with a crowd of drunken flyboys.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cProbably right?\u201d Linda managed the trick of raising one eyebrow as she looked across the table.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Lindsay admitted \u201cDefinitely right.\u201d She sighed, knowing that Linda was due an apology, but not relishing it. Still, it was better said than not.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She said, \u201cI was stupid, and you likely saved my ass by pulling me out of there. Thanks for that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI would say naive more than stupid. And it\u2019s okay. That\u2019s what a wingman is for. Bailing you out of trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEven so, thanks for getting me out of there when you did. I owe you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime. Want to go back tomorrow?\u201d Linda asked.<br>\r\nLindsay looked at her. \u201cDo you really thing that is a good idea.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure. You need to learn how to handle the boys if you\u2019re going to keep this up. This will be good practice. Just keep the drinking under control and we\u2019ll both be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. The rest of the squad\u2019s due back tomorrow. What would they say?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\u201d said Linda, pulling a folded sheet of paper she\u2019d been using as a bookmark out of the novel and sliding it across the table to her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019ll be back for another day or two.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay looked at the paper. It was a telegram. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">From Col. Helgamier Stop.<br>\r\nVoroshilovgrad Stop.<br>\r\nTo 127th Jaggswinder Stop.<br>\r\nAll flights grounded Voloshilovgad due to storm stop.<br>\r\nExpected to last two days stop.<br>\r\nTwo man or less missions expressly forbidden stop.<br>\r\nAmuse yourselves otherwise stop.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like they ran into a storm front and are stuck for another day or two.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo what does she expect us to do?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRelax and take it easy I guess.\u201d Linda shrugged \u201cColonel doesn\u2019t want us running two man patrols for some reason. She specifically said that. Not that there is much available for two man missions, anyway. And you don\u2019t have a plane, unless you want to take the Stuka up, and that would be an even worse idea. We might as well lend the 83rd a hand, unless you can think of something else you\u2019d rather be doing.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay couldn\u2019t think of anything else to do, so it was decided they would head over to the 83rd again in the morning. With that decided, both girls fell quiet. Neither of them were much for conversationalists. Lindsay was very much in the habit of letting others start the conversation, and just adding to it when she could. Linda was very much the same, although she preferred to pick up a book and read when not talking. This made for what Lindsay felt were awkward silences between them, which sort of blended together into another relatively quiet and relaxing night for both. As Lindsay would say later, they just kicked back and relaxed, played a bit of cribbage, tossed a few darts, randomized the jukebox, and the odd snippets of awkward conversation while drinking beer. Eventually it was late enough that they could justify heading to bed. <br>\r\nEarly morning was joining the 83rd for another jog around the base, much like the previous day. Only without Lindsay soaking her shirt this time around, much to the disappointment of guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the guys were still happy enough to have them join the 83rd for another mission. This time take off took them straight north, so Lindsay spent the first 25 minutes of the flight sneaking peeks through the bombing scope at the land below them.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Rhett finally asked her curiously.<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, really.\u201d Lindsay replied. \u201cJust seeing if I could spot an old church.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t be hard.\u201d Rhett said. \u201cThe place is lousy with them. Seems like every fifth building has a spire on it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s an exaggeration!\u201d Lindsay said \u201cBesides, this church is kind of special to me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPlanning on getting married in it are you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, heaven forbid that should happen. No, when I said special I meant that it brings back memories. I crashed into it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh. I see.\u201d Rhett grinned as he started inventing an imaginative back story to her statement. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you were badly injured in that crash, weren\u2019t you? Pulled from the mangled wreckage and nursed back to health by the priest in charge of the church, who turned out to be a handsome young man who had just taken his vows of celibacy. Forbidden by faith, you both knew you could never be together, so you had no choice but to fall deeply and madly in love with each other. You knew it was wrong, but daily your feelings grew until one night the young priest had no choice but to sent you away for your own protection. Now you spend your days heart broken, living only for the moments when chance brings your course near his church, and you can only hope for a glimpse of your loves face as you speed past.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay stared open mouthed at Rhett\u2019s grinning face. \u201cYou\u2019re weird, you know that?\u201d she said finally, shaking her head in disbelief. .\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo you weren\u2019t nursed back to health by a kindly handsome priest?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not. I was killed on impact. I just like to check up on the place every now and then.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou are looking for the place you died in?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s the one grave I have that I know precisely where it is.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m the weird one?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou fly bombers for fun. I think that kind of answers the question.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t knock it if you\u2019ve never flown one.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I have, didn\u2019t you know? First week we were here, there was an HE-111 parked in our hanger so the Colonel said we might as well take it out for a spin.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo what don\u2019t you like about it? Too many controls for you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t it. I flew cargo planes before joining up. Some of them were way more complicated. The Heinkle is a piece of cake compared to a 707. I just could never get the hang of keeping the machine flying straight.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see.\u201d Rhett gestured with a free hand \u201cCome up here for a minute.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay moved as close to Rhett as the cockpit allowed. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, gesturing over his shoulder towards the sliding door that separated the cockpit from the main body of the bomber, where the gunners and radio operator would be stationed.  \u201cStand behind me.\u201d Lindsay stood behind Rhett, pressed against the cabin door. From here she could see over his shoulder towards the front of the bomber. A thought suddenly occurred to her; If the radio operator was to come forward without warning, when the door was slid open she\u2019d fall back into the center compartment. And if that happened she\u2019d likely cripple the belly gunner when she landed on him. To prevent that she wrapped her hand around a support strut as she leaned over Rhett.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet you point the nose of the plane exactly where you want it to go.\u201d He was saying.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut that never works. The plane tends to crab to port.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTypical of fighter pilots.\u201d Rhett said \u201cYou\u2019re used to using the point of the nose as your focus, and with all that glass up here, the only thing you can focus on is the gun port. That port is in the point of the nose, sure, but it\u2019s offset from the center line, see?\u201d Now that it was pointed out, Lindsay could see how the bubble nose was shifted slightly to the right, putting the gun port directly in front of the gunner. \u201cThat\u2019s so the gunner can work and not block the pilot\u2019s line of sight. I\u2019ll show you a little secret.\u201d He reached forward and twanged a support cable that ran down from the cockpit roof into the floor in front of him. \u201cThis,\u201d he said \u201cIs your center line.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cThe roof support cable?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a support cable\u201d Rhett said. \u201cIn fact, this cable has no real purpose at all except to give the pilot something to focus on as a center line.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t in the manual.\u201d Lindsay said, slightly miffed that the answer to something she had so much difficulty with was something so simple<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tell you what. On the way back maybe I\u2019ll let you take the controls for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Lindsay answered. \u201cI\u2019m good. Besides, there\u2019s only one set of controls, so wouldn\u2019t that mean I have to sit in your lap for that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you want to.\u201d Rhett grinned \u201cOtherwise we\u2019ll just switch places. Bomber pilots do it all the time if they needed a break. Or are too wounded to fly, which happens more often that you\u2019d expect.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the target was much the same as the previous day. There wasn\u2019t as much enemy aircraft, but the flak was far heavier. This time they lost only one Bomber on the raid. The token fighter patrol defending the target was no match for the German side.  It might have been different if the enemy had managed to put more fighters in the air, but this time the escort had no trouble keeping them at bay.<br>\r\nThey were about 15 minutes from base when Rhett\u2019s voice came over the aircraft intercom into her headset.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you say\u201d He asked \u201cWant to try your hand at landing this thing?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks\u201d Lindsay said \u201cI\u2019m more of a fighter pilot. I\u2019ll leave the big toys to you big boys\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSuits me,\u201d Rhett said \u201cThe view is much better from here anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSame thing you fly over every day.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cToday it has your butt in front of it.\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cWhat?\u201d Lindsay shrieked as she spun around to look at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just teasing.\u201d Rhett said with a grin \u201cCan\u2019t see much through those bulky overalls anyway.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay sat up and glared at him \u201cIs that what you\u2019ve been doing? Spending most of the mission staring at my butt.\u201d<br>\r\nRhett realized his attempt at humor had backfired, and hastily backtracked.<br>\r\n\u201cI promise I wasn\u2019t staring. I don\u2019t have time anyway, I\u2019m too busy flying the plane.\u201d Lindsay kept up the glare, which prompted Rhett to keep going with his attempt at an apology.<br>\r\n\u201cKeeping this thing flying straight and level doesn\u2019t give me time to do much more that a passing glance every now and then. Besides, with the flight suit on your butt looks pretty much like anyone else\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo you look at the guy\u2019s butts too?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou just said that in a flight suit my butt looks like everyone else\u2019s, so you practically admitted you\u2019ve been checking out guys as well?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh hell no.\u201d Rhett said, a little too defensively \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant at all. Stop putting words in my mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell maybe you should tell me what you did mean, then.\u201d Lindsay said, arms folded across her chest as she glared back at the pilot.<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I tell you what I mean when you just twist the words around?\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay kept up with the glare, even though she was beginning to realize she had possibly over reacted. Still, a part of her stubbornly refused to back down now. <br>\r\nBack at the controls Rhett chose his next words with care. This was a classic \u2018no win scenario\u2019 but maybe if he played it straight he just might survive until touchdown. \u201cAll right.\u201d He admitted \u201cI won\u2019t lie and say I didn\u2019t look, it was right there after all. But I don\u2019t stare. I meant what I said about how I was too busy keeping the plane straight and level to do more than a passing glance every now and then. And the remark about the flight suit just means that there\u2019s not much to see anyway. With it on your butt looks pretty much like anyone else\u2019s would.\u201d<br>\r\nRhett stopped for a moment, watching her for a reaction.<br>\r\n \u201cIs that you\u2019re way of apologizing?\u201d she finally asked.<br>\r\n \u201cNo.\u201d Rhett let out a deep sigh \u201cThis is. I\u2019m sorry. I was trying to make a joke and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d<br>\r\nWhen Lindsay didn\u2019t say anything he continued. \u201cLook, It\u2019s really nice to finally get a bombardier on my plane that knows how to do the job. That she also happens to be drop dead gorgeous is great, but I\u2019m more impressed by the way that twice now you\u2019ve dropped the entire payload on target with pinpoint accuracy. Most of the crews who will take on the bombardier position are either pilots who are too pig headed about someone else flying the plane, or gunners who are used to just spraying the target and hoping something hits.  So far not one of them has managed to hit a target twice in a row except for Yancy, and we haven\u2019t seen him since he went MIA 2 weeks ago.\u201d <br>\r\nRhett paused again to see how Lindsay reacted, then continued. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if my saying I was staring at your butt made you uncomfortable and upset you. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it.\u201d<br>\r\n Lindsay didn\u2019t say anything, just turned back towards the nose, watching the ground moving beneath the window. Behind her she heard Rhett mutter, quite clearly because he had forgotten his hand was still on the mike switch, \u201cWho\u2019d have thought flying through Flak would be the easiest part of this mission?\u201d<br>\r\nStaring through the bubble Lindsay was trying to get her thoughts to settle down. She wasn\u2019t sure why she\u2019d made such a big deal out of the comment. Sure, maybe Rhett been a little out of line. But she could completely understand where he was coming from. Hell, if she was in his shoes she\u2019d probably be doing the same thing. Still, she was both flattered and offended at the same time, and didn\u2019t know what to make of it. It wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d ever envisioned needing to know how to handle. She really needed to talk to someone about this, but who? <br>\r\nShe sat there trying to sort her thoughts out until the wheels touched and the big bomber taxied to a stop with the rest of the group in front of the hangers. <br>\r\nShe still hadn\u2019t come to terms with her swirling thoughts, but decided the big guy had suffered enough, so when they had climbed out of the plane she went over to him. \u201cBuy me a beer and I\u2019ll consider it apology accepted.\u201d she said as she gave him a light punch on the shoulder.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One thing she had not anticipated though, was just how hard it was to get the men to not buy her drinks. It seemed that none of the boys really knew of any other way to get a girls attention. Lindsay felt a little sad every time she had to say no. At first it sort of felt like she was personally insulting them each time she turned one down. Then it just got annoying.<br>\r\nFortunately she was not alone, Linda was getting the same treatment. It was Linda who finally snapped at the group after the 7th offer in as many minutes. She\u2019d stood up on her chair and shouted to the crowd to stop it, they had all they wanted for now, and if she wanted another drink, which it didn\u2019t look very likely at this point, she would dammed well buy it herself. The crowd seemed to back off a little after that.<br>\r\nOf course, there are always those that don\u2019t discourage easily, and figure \u2018No\u2019 means 'Try a slightly different tactic'. One of the men, a man she hadn\u2019t met before, had sidled up and insisted on telling the girls \u2018The Worlds Funniest Joke\u2019. <br>\r\n\u201cSo this English Colonel is asked if one of their well renown pilots would be willing to speak at a fancy dinner,\u201d he was saying \u201cAnd the Colonel, having no choice, of course said yes. Now knowing that the pilot had a rather colorful way of speaking, he gave this famous pilot a very stern warning to be on his best behavior and also sent along his adjutant to keep an eye on things and hopefully smooth over any miss-understandings.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the man said, lowering his voice \u201chalf way through dinner the daughter of the host asks the pilot how he got his purple heart, and the pilot, being just a little drunk, starts telling the harrowing story of an epic air battle.\u201d At this point the man\u2019s attempt to speak in an English accent was horrific and only succeeded in making him sound drunker than he likely was \u201c \u2018E says, reaching the end of \u2018is \u2018arrowing tale, roight when we thought we was done with \u2018em, these five Folkers came screaming down on us, straight down out of the sun. At this point the adjutant, realizing the possibility of the audiences misunderstanding the pilot, spoke up and explained that Folker was the name of a German manufacture who made fighter planes, like the BF109.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAye, the pilot said, the BF109 is a very fine machine and no mistake about that, but these Folkers were flying Messerschmitts!\u201d<br>\r\nThere was a silent pause for a few seconds, then Linda spoke up. \u201cActually, I prefer the Messerschmitt myself. Better power to weight.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Lindsay added, quickly catching onto what Linda was doing. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to fly one myself, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s any better than the Focke Wulf I\u2019m flying now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, didn\u2019t you hear?\u201d Linda asked \u201cWe\u2019re getting the 190\u2019s next week.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Lindsay asked. \u201cIt\u2019s about time. I really need a new plane.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd these are like, totally new, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe joke is the word Folker.\u201d Was the exasperated reply from the man who had been chatting them up. <br>\r\nLinda just looked at him blankly, then frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s pronounced Focke.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt's his accent. That\u2019s what the adjutant thought he was trying to say.That's the joke.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait, are you saying the Focke Wulfs we fly are a joke, then?\u201d<br>\r\nGiving up in disgust, the guy made his way back to where his buddies were standing, undoubtedly laughing at him, on the other side of the room.<br>\r\nAs soon as he was out of earshot the girls started giggling.<br>\r\n\u201cLike, Totally New? Seriously?\u201d Lindsay criticized.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Linda grinned \u201cGot a bit carried away with the airhead act.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t very nice.\u201d Archie scolded.<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on,\u201d Linda said when she got a hold of herself. \u201cIt was hilarious. Besides, I could tell that joke far better than he was.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd really,\u201d Lindsay said \u201cWe\u2019re Germans, right? If he\u2019s going to tell jokes, they should be good German jokes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGerman jokes?\u201d Rhett shook his head disbelievingly. \u201cGermans don\u2019t have a sense of humor.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure they do\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d put in Linda \u201cLike, Knock, Knock.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Lindsay said, grinning.<br>\r\n\u201cGuest Tapo.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cGuest Tapo who?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOpen zee door now!\u201d Linda said, her voice flat and humorless \u201cUnd I\u2019m afraid ve vill need to zee your papers.\u201d<br>\r\nArchie snorted, not quite a laugh, but close.<br>\r\n\u201cOr how about this one?\u201d Lindsay said,\u201d My Vife iz zo fat.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow fat is she?\u201d Linda responded, classically.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m azking zee questions here.\u201d<br>\r\nThis got another snort and a head shake from Archie, and a face palm from Rhett.<br>\r\n \u201cOy, Mien Gott!\u201d He declared, getting to his feet. \u201cWhat say we play some pool.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s getting better, but there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done. The first night was a disaster and we had to abort early in. Tonight was a bit better.

Lana-Raye had let them know, in no uncertain terms, about what she thought of the idiots who got up that early to make themselves sweat. Lorraine wasn\u2019t thrilled about the sweating part but hey, the boys from the 83rd would be involved, so she was in. <br>\r\nOh Eight Fifteen the next morning found Lindsay leading the girls through their warm ups beside the generator shed that had become their default meet up place for the ad hoc jogging group.<br>\r\n\u201cMorning ladies.\u201d Called Frank as the group from the 83rd up the taxiway.<br>\r\nUnlike the group from the 127th, who\u2019s ranks had swelled considerably, the 83rd has down a couple of members.

Actually, I\u2019m Captain Lorraine Peterson.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAlso,\u201d she continued, turning to each of the group in turn, \u201cYou\u2019re Lieutenant Frank Maddigan, that\u2019s Lieutenant Fredrick Murphy, the big guy there is First Lieutenant Archie Yakamura, and the beefcake that Lindsay is mooning over is Captain Rhett Jackson.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Lindsay protested. Before she could say anything else Lorraine continued.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t guessed, that\u2019s Lindsay.\u201d She waved a hand in the general direction of the others. \u201cThat\u2019s Beverly, Addison, and Linda over there.\u201d<br>\r\nLorraine seemed to think this was adequate for introductions. Completely ignoring Frank and the sheepish look on his face she turned her attention to the big First Lieutenant. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, \u201cHow have you been, Archie?\u201d The two of them fell into conversation and ignored the rest of the group.<br>\r\nFrank shook his head and turned towards Lindsay. \u201cI really wish you\u2019d wear name tags.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd miss out on all this fun?\u201d Lindsay said with a laugh. \u201cBesides, you figured out who I was quick enough.\u201d<br>\r\nOh, that was simple enough.\u201d Frank said with a shrug. \u201cThere are only two lieutenants, and I don\u2019t remember you bouncing around like a puppy.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not bouncing.\u201d Lindsay said, looking over at where Linda and Addison stood talking to Sam. At least Linda stood there. Addison was sort of hopping on one foot as she stretched her calf muscles. \u201cOkay,\u201d Lindsay grudgingly admitted. \u201cShe does bounce just a little.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for any of you to bounce just a little.\u201d Said Fred with a grin as he wandered passed, tucking his shirt into is waist band.<br>\r\n\u201cJust for that remark you\u2019re on point.\u201d Said Frank.<br>\r\n\u201cFine with me.\u201d Said Fred, seemingly unperturbed by being put in the lead position.<br>\r\n\u201cAlright ladies\u201d he said, deliberately nodding to the rest of the 83rd as he did so \u201cIf you and the girls are finished warming up, lets get this show on the road.\u201d<br>\r\nWith this the group set off down the gravel taxiway into the pre-dawn morning.<br>\r\nThis morning there was no set pattern to the jog, people moved in and out of position at random. At one point, maybe by accident, Lindsay found herself running in step beside Rhett. \u201cHey,\u201d she said. Not the wittiest thing to say, she would admit, but she couldn\u2019t really think of anything better. \u201cHey yourself\u201d was Rhett\u2019s reply, obviously having just as much difficulty coming up with topics for small talk. Or more likely, Lindsay thought, he\u2019s still holding a grudge. If he was, she wanted desperately to clear the air.<br>\r\n\u201cAbout last night,\u201d she said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how sorry I am for what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rhett reassured her, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. If anything it was mine.\u201d<br>\r\nHow do you figure that?<br>\r\n\u201cI work with horses. I know better than to come up behind one and startle it. A pool cue\u2019s nothing compared to what a hoof feels like.\u201d <br>\r\nLindsay visibly winced at the thought.<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, no lasting damage.\u201d Rhett continued. \u201cOne of the emergency med kit bandages and a bit of salve, everything\u2019s right as rain.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not mad at me?\u201d Lindsay said, relived to hear him say it<br>\r\n\u201cMad at you? Why would you think that.\u201d Rhett managed to sound offended that she would even think that way. \u201cI\u2019m only sorry we didn\u2019t get a chance to finish the game. What\u2019s the chance we can have a rematch?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Lindsay said, deciding to toy with him a little, payback for the anguish he had put her through. Well, that she\u2019d put herself though, but it was still the same thing, right?<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Rhett asked, \u201cI\u2019ll try not to startle you this time.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Lindsay said coyly \u201cSeeing as how it sounds like you just compared me to a horse\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I was saying I should know better than to startle one.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo you do think I\u2019m a horse.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I said. Well, maybe it sounded that way, but that\u2019s not what I meant. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNow I suppose you\u2019ll buy me a beer as an apology.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf that will work, sure.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo now you\u2019re planning on getting me drunk?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Rhett sounded confused \u201cNo. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing at all.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Lindsay continued matter of factually \u201cSounds like a workable strategy. Accidentally insult a girl then buy her a beer as an apology sounds like a move in a game of getting her drunk and taking advantage.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNow just a minute here.\u201d Rhett protested hotly \u201cYou\u2019re the one who suggested the beer.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay realized maybe she\u2019d gone too far. \u201cHey, relax, I\u2019m teasing you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you could have fooled me.\u201d Rhett said, an angry tone to his voice \u201cIt sounded like you were serious accusing me of planning to take advantage of you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHonest, I was just joking around.\u201d Lindsay back tracked \u201cI wasn\u2019t seriously thinking that was your plan.\u201d <br>\r\nJust great, she thought. She\u2019d just been trying to be silly because men like that sort of thing, and wound up screwing up everything.<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Rhett was silent for a moment before asking \u201cWas all this just you taking your turn as the evil twin?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe evil what?\u201d Now it was Lindsay\u2019s turn to be confused.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know? When we first met you said one of you was the evil twin, and you took turns to keep people from figuring out which one it was.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI did?\u201d Lindsay tried to remember if that\u2019s what she had actually said. <br>\r\n\u201cYep. Then you referred to all seven of you as sextuplets.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that would have been Linda.\u201d Lindsay said firmly \u201cSextuplets means six, and there are seven of us. That\u2019s not the kind of mistake I would make.\u201d<br>\r\nRhett started to opened his mouth as if to comment, but then closed it, letting whatever remark he might have been about to make go unspoken. Instead he returned to the original topic of conversation.<br>\r\n\u201cSo how about that game of pool we never got to finish? When do you want to play the rematch?\u201d<br>\r\nNot if, Lindsay noticed, but when. A subtle but important change. Maybe she hadn\u2019t screwed this up after all.<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, pretending to think about it. \u201cI\u2019d kind of like to play a game. And I do sort of owe you one. How about tomorrow night? I should be free, unless something comes up.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure! That sounds great.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I promise this time I\u2019ll treat it as a non contact sport.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEven better. It\u2019s a date then.\u201d<br>\r\nThese words brought the realization home. There was no getting around it, she admitted to herself. She\u2019 had just agreed to go on an actual date. When Linda had teased her in the past about dating she\u2019d gotten defensive about it, yet strangely today it didn\u2019t bother her at all. It was just a date. With a boy.<br>\r\n Oh no! She suddenly thought, What was she going to wear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay did a quick scan of her airspace, checking for hostile aircraft, then turned her attention back to the column of smoke that marked where the YAK that had been giving her so much trouble was spiraling earthward. No chute, she noted, putting her plane into a shallow dive and following it down. That meant her opponent was likely dead at the controls. Or maybe wounded and unconscious. Or, she thought with an involuntary shudder, trapped with a canopy that wouldn\u2019t open. She watched the YAK spiral downward until the reason why didn\u2019t matter anymore. This last guy had the skills, and it was only a bit of luck that kept her airborne while her opponent became a part of the landscape. <br>\r\nNow that he was out of the picture, she turned her attention to finding out where the heck the rest of her squadron was.  It was a few minutes before anyone responded to her transmitting, the answering call was weak and full of static.<br>\r\n\u201cRed 6,\u201d Came Leslies\u2019 voice, while understandable, crackled heavily. \u201cThis is Red leader. Where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRed Leader, this is Red 6. I\u2019m just south of the river. Right over where that bomber went down, I think.\u201d The whole mess had started when the bomber flight they\u2019d been escorting had run into a Russian patrol. Fortunately for the 83rd the 127th had managed to drive most of them off, loosing only one bomber this time. In the category of making the best of a bad situation, the burning wreck made for a heck of a navigational beacon.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Red 6, That puts you, what, holy crap. You\u2019re a good 40 kilometers north of us. How the hell did you get that far away?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat stupid Yak I drew wouldn\u2019t give up. I kept trying to disengage but he kept coming after me. I guess I got lost while I was trying to get away.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI managed to drag him up to 4500. He ran out of bullets and died.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNice one Red 6. Let\u2019s bring our stray bird back to the flock. Red flight, turn 360, speed 200, Red 6 Turn to heading umm, 220. Follow the river and you should see us in a few minutes.\u201d <br>\r\nLindsay dutifully acknowledged and turned to the requested heading. The river was clear and free of traffic as she flew over it, although she noted several barges tied up along the south bank that may make viable targets. She made a note to mention them to the Colonel once she was joined back up with the rest of the 123rd. 10 minutes later, just as she was beginning to worry that she\u2019d somehow missed the group, the radio crackled to life again, this time with the signal much stronger. <br>\r\n \u201cRed 6, this is Blue 5, I\u2019m bird dogging and I can see you from up here. Change to 240 for intercept. You should be home in about five minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRoger that Blue Five, changing to intercept\u201d Lindsay transmitted as she banked the aircraft to the right, settling in on the new course. She wasn\u2019t out of the woods yet, but she was getting there. <br>\r\n\u201cRed six, this is bird dog. Bandits! 6 o\u2019clock high.<br>\r\n\u201cAgain?\u201d Lindsay pushed the stick forward and opened the throttle, pushing the engine passed maximum into emergency power, trying to get as much speed into her plane as she could. Peering hastily back over her shoulder she couldn\u2019t see the enemy, but if Bev said they were there she wasn\u2019t going to waste time looking for them. They would make them selves known soon enough. <br>\r\nAnd sure enough, then she could see them. Three small dots behind and above her that sprouted wings even as she watched. \u2018Crap, they\u2019re moving fast\u2019 she thought. The dive they were in must be pushing their planes right to the limit of their airframes. Unfortunately, it also meant that they were moving much faster than Lindsay, even with her engine wide open. If she\u2019d been smart earlier she would have climbed back up to 3500 where her aircraft performed better, instead of sticking to 1500 and sight seeing. It was a mistake she hoped she would live to regret.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay pulled the throttle back, out of the emergency setting, allowing her airspeed to fall. Not that she wanted to, just the opposite in fact, but any longer and the engine would be badly damaged, maybe destroyed. Now all she could do was watch her pursuers as they fanned out behind her, closing in. She counted 5 winged dots now. One either side, one directly behind, one above him. The fifth following behind as back up in case one of the others overshot her position. \u201cWhat did I do to become so popular\u201d she said to herself, squinting into the low sun as she raced towards the remote safety of the rest of the flight. Logic told her she wasn\u2019t going to make it. Only a minute had passed, there were still four more to go and the enemy was almost on her. Still, last minute rescues were a common theme of cheesy movies and video games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny time you\u2019re ready guys. I could use the help!\u201d she radioed. Witty battle banter was also a must have.<br>\r\n\u201cHang in there Lindsay, the cavalry is coming.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be too long.\u201d She replied. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to be late to the party.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cStall them if you have to, but don\u2019t start the party without us.\u201d <br>\r\nOkay, She thought, we now have the witty clich\u00e9 movie banter. <br>\r\nLindsay looked back at the rapidly closing enemy almost upon her, weighing her options. Dive and she could gain a bit of distance, but then they would catch her at a low altitude. Climb and she\u2019d loose speed and they would catch her all that much sooner. Stay as she was and they would catch her anyway. For long moments she agonized over the choices, unable to make a decision, until the options were no longer available to her. The enemy had closed the gap and were almost in range. <br>\r\n\u201cOh well,\u201d she sighed. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to die, you might as well take a bastard with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she rolled her aircraft over and dove, pulling out in a split S turn that had her pointing right back the way she came, heading straight into the sights of the lead attacker. As soon as her nose came up she triggered her guns. No sense carrying unspent ammo into the great beyond.<br>\r\nIt was obvious the lead pilot wasn\u2019t expecting her to come up guns blazing, because instead of keeping his head and firing back he panicked, banking and turned away. Briefly Lindsay hoped to rake his belly with cannon fire, but before she could he was suddenly spinning away out of control, a victim of that nasty accelerated stall the La-5 was infamous for. At low altitudes that was deadlier than enemy fire, but Lindsay didn\u2019t watch to see if he\u2019d recover in time. Her attention was on the other, more level headed pilots who smoothly maneuvered out of her way and swung around in behind her, boxing her in. The fight was joined, and it was clearly one sided, that side being behind her and shooting.<br>\r\n Now she no longer had the initiative. In spite of twisting and turning, she no sooner got herself out of one set of gun sights when another opened up on her. Within minutes both her wings were in tatters, her maneuverability, at this altitude not as good as the La-5\u2019s she was fighting, dropped wildly until she was just barely able to keep control as she fought to evade her attackers.<br>\r\n And yet, in spite of the numbers of shells fired in her direction, not one of them scored a killing shot. <i>They were toying with her</i>, she realized. Like a group of cats with a mouse. Each taking a turn, seeing how badly they could hurt her without actually killing her. They don\u2019t know help is on the way, she thought. If she could keep this up, stalling for time until the 123rd showed up, she might just last long enough to get one of those overly clich\u00e9 last minute rescues. <br>\r\nJust as that glimmer of hope kindled within her, the port wing broke off and her plane began to cork screw down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a strong enough engine and the correct control moves you can land a one wing plane. There was a YouTube video from several years back where Lindsay had seen it done. A couple of times she\u2019d even wondered if she was capable of landing like that herself. This time however, she wasn\u2019t about to even try. Grabbing the canopy eject handle, she pulled upward, flinging the canopy into the air stream and away. A slap at the seat belt release and she didn\u2019t even have to climb out; the centrifugal force of the spinning plane ejecting her before she had time to change her mind about it. Something hit her leg a painful blow as the remaining wing spun past, then she was out was away from her doomed machine and hurtling earthward. Below her aircraft. For a moment it struck her as funny that she was actually falling faster that her out of control wreck of an aircraft. then she pulled the rip cord and the sky disappeared in a cloud of silk. The jolt when she hit the end of the chute cords shot a bolt of pain from her leg, no doubt courtesy of that long thin chunk of aluminum she found speared through her thigh when the blackness cleared from her vision enough that she could look around. Things weren\u2019t so funny anymore. There was a nasty gash in the leg of her flight suit as well, the fabric below soaked with bright red blood. Must be from when the wing slapped me. She thought. That\u2019s going to really start to hurt in a minute. Something about the colour bothered her, but she couldn\u2019t put her finger on it. <br>\r\nThe ground that was rushing towards her looked all wrong as well. The snow was a greenish grey, covered with a glittery pattern that moved as she looked, making it hard to focus on exactly where the ground was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she hit, plunging below the surface of the river she\u2019d bailed out over, the icy water momentarily paralyzing her in shock until her survival instincts kicked in and she fought her way to the surface, gasping as her head broke the water and she gulped in a lungfull of clean cold air. She floundered on the surface for a moment before the shroud lines coiled around her boots pulled her back under the water. Frantically she reached down and tried to free her legs, but her numb fingers couldn\u2019t get the knotted lines off. She slipped the knife clipped to her belt free, using the sharp blade to hack and saw the rubbery ropes, trying to cut her legs free. The blade caught on something and slipped from her numb fingers, but by that time she\u2019d cut deep enough that when she yanked the last few strands parted and she kick desperately towards the surface. Just as she reached the surface something grabbed her, wrapping itself around her face. She tried to use her hands to pull it free, but her arms were also being tightly held by whatever was holding her underwater. In a last moment of clarity she realized she\u2019d come up under her own parachute; the strong silk that had been her salvation was now her doom. Trapped, her lungs burning for air that wasn\u2019t coming, she sank helpless into the gloomy depths. There was only one thing she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fighting for breath, she scrabbled away on her hands and knees. Her feet tangled in something and she fell heavily forward, knocking what little breath she managed to grab out of her. Flailing about, trying to get her legs under her and right herself, she felt hands on her shoulders, grabbing at her. She twisted and slapped the grappling hands away, managing another weak scream as she did so, blocking out the sound of the distant river calling her name. Freeing herself from the clutching hands she lunged away, half falling forward, only to smash head first into the edge of something. Something very hard and unforgiving. Stars exploded behind her eyes, knocking her sprawling backwards, dazed. Before she could recover a heavy weight fell on her, pinning her backwards to the cold wood she was laying on. Too weak and dazed to struggle anymore she could only lay on her back, trapped under whatever it was that was holding her down while the watery world swam in circles around her, calling to her. \u201cLindsay\u201d It was saying frantically. \u201cLindsay, wake up!\u201d<br>\r\nThe voice sounded almost desperate. And familiar. Recognition chased the fog of panic away, and as it receded and she stopped struggling. Suddenly she knew where she was. Where she must be. No longer was the clutching silk of the treacherous parachute holding her trapped in the icy depths. What she thought was the cold waters of the river were now cold hard wood against her back. She took a deep, shaky breath. And then another. She could breath. Oh God, she could <b>BREATH!</b> She opened her eyes and saw the heavy weight holding her down had a very worried looking face. <br>\r\n\u201cLinda?\u201d she asked, hardly believing it was true. <br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay\u201d Linda asked, sitting up and peering into Lindsay\u2019s face with an expression of deep concern.<br>\r\nInstead of answering, Lindsay lunged upwards and wrapped her arms around her, hugging her fiercely. \u201cOh God\u201d she sobbed, clutching her roommate as hard as she could. \u201cOh God oh God oh God...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThere, there.\u201d Linda said softly, hugging her in return \u201cHush now. Everything\u2019s going to be alright. You\u2019re safe. Everything\u2019s going to be okay now.\u201d  Softly, Linda stroked Lindsay\u2019s back, shushing and soothing and rocking the sobbing girl as she slowly calmed down.<br>\r\nSuddenly the overhead light came on. \u201cSeriously, you two?\u201d Came Colleen\u2019s voice from the door. \u201cI know it\u2019s your room and all, but are you <i>trying</i> to wake up the entire base?\u201d<br>\r\nWithout stopping to look up Linda said calmly \u201cDo us a favor Colleen and put a sock in it. And while your at it fetch us a cup of tea from the mess. Something herbal if you can find it.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA remarkably short time later Colleen was back with a steaming pot and a handful of mugs. By this time quite a crowd had worked their way into the girls room. <br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Colleen said, passing out mugs, giving an extra to Lorraine to hold while she poured, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLindsay had a nightmare, what does it look like?\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cWell,\u201d Colleen said with a shrug, pouring tea. \u201cYou hear screaming and walk in on the camp lesbian and her naked room mate hugging the crap out of each other\u2026\u201d Colleen caught the look the others were giving her and realized that tonight no one was in the mood for her attempt at humor. \u201cSo yeah,\u201d she trailed off \u201cNightmare was my first guess...\u201d<br>\r\nBy this time Lindsay had calmed down enough that Linda felt it was safe to move her back to her bed and cover her up.<br>\r\nAt first Lindsay refused the blanket, fearing its touch would trigger a return of the nightmare she\u2019d woken from, but once it was loosely draped over her shoulders she found the warmth and slightly scratchy roughness to be actually quite soothing. The mug of tea Colleen handed her with helped, and after a bit she had calmed down enough that Bev could convince her to talk about what happened. She didn\u2019t want to, but Bev had insisted it would help. Lindsay had been skeptical at first, but now, after pouring her heart out to the sympathetic group of women while wrapped in blankets with a mug of tea, she had to admit she did feel much better.<br>\r\nAnd after assurances that she was going to be all right, the girls started to trickle away, heading back to bed to try and catch what was left of the sleep period. After they left Lindsay sat, huddled under her blanket in the middle of the bed. It felt warm and safe there. She was in the middle of her bed in the middle of the room in the middle of her friends. The illusion of safety was comforting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, she was pretty sure she was done sleeping for the night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had to force herself to step under the shower head, even though the water was warm. Instead of relaxing her she found herself tense and nervous. Then, she tried to wet her face by cupping her hands and splashing the water into her face like she usual did, water went up her nose and that was it. Shower was over. She barely took the time to towel off before she was out of the showers, still half dressed with her wet hair still wrapped in a towel. She didn\u2019t care. She would finish with the buttons and clips on her way to the mess tent, away from the running water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was staring at her coffee cup when Colleen and Bev slid onto the bench across the table from her. <br>\r\n\u201cMorning Lindsay,\u201d Bev said. \u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Lindsay said non committal. \u201cAs well as can be expected, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Colleen piped in. \u201c \u2018Cause you don\u2019t look it. Did you get any sleep after we left?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Lindsay admitted. <br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think so.\u201d Colleen said in a matter of fact voice. \u201cYou look like death warmed over.\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay shuddered at the word death. Bev noticed and put a hand over hers, patting it comfortingly.<br>\r\n\u201cI know it seems bad now, but it\u2019ll get better.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it?\u201d Lindsay sighed, closing her eyes. Then she shook her head and looked up, straight into Bev\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem so. Each time it just gets worse.\u201d<br>\r\nBev looked back, trying to smile reassuringly.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it seems that way now, but in a couple of days\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay cut her off. \u201cEvery time I get killed, the respawn gets worse.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re just imagining it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAm I? For two nights after I crashed into the church I dreamed of being chased by multi coloured goblins who kept stabbing me with glittery little knives. For three night after I was hit by Flak over Kuzmichy I dreamed I was a busted up statue while burnt and bleeding body parts danced and taunted while they stuck forks in me. <br>\r\nAnd for a week after I was shot down in flames over Pitomnik, those nights I, I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nShe paused and took a deep breath before continuing. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about those dreams,\u201d She said with a shudder. \u201cGod knows what tonight is going to bring.\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cLindsay,\u201d Bev said softly. \u201cThey are just dreams. Nothing more than your subconscious  trying to make sense of the world.<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make them seem any less real.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it won\u2019t. But talking to someone about them will help you cope. Tell you what, tonight we\u2019ll get together at the Gasthus. You, me, Colleen, who ever else wants to join. You\u2019ll buy us a couple of drinks, I\u2019ll dig out my old notes from the semester I studied Carl Jung, and we\u2019ll have a nice little introduction to group therapy session. It\u2019ll do us all good.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think it will help.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen?\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cI suppose you\u2019re. It can\u2019t hurt.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay did not have a great day. Lack of sleep, coupled with being nervous and on edge, really threw off her game. She kept making stupid mistakes and missing easy targets. On the plus side, she wasn\u2019t shot down, so the day evened out at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter supper she hemmed and hawed, putting off going to the Gasthus as long as possible. She wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, and that made her even more nervous.  She seriously contemplated just blowing the session off, getting drunk, and going to bed. Then she realized all the beer for the 123rd was in the Gasthus with the rest of the group, so she couldn\u2019t even do that. Unless, she suddenly thought, she could head over to the 83rd. But then she realized that if she did that then she\u2019d likely run into Rhett, and since she\u2019d stood him up for their date the other night that was something she wasn\u2019t really looking forward to. Although technically being dead was probably one of the better excuses, she\u2019d still felt guilty about it. Because she dreaded what his reaction would be, she decided to phone him instead of going over there in person, and when she\u2019d finally screwed up her courage to call he was unavailable. After three calls and left messages and he still hadn\u2019t returned her call, she figured that meant that he was probably mad about the whole thing. To actually confront him was something she didn\u2019t have to courage for at the time, and she worried that another call would make her seem desperate, and the more she thought about it the harder it was to actually do anything about it, so she retreated into her old habit of doing nothing and hoping the problem would resolved itself, preferably somehow where she wouldn\u2019t have to get involved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was the same sort of thing she was doing now, standing and staring at the Gasthus door, shuffling indecisively from foot to foot, putting off making an uncomfortable decision in hopes she wouldn\u2019t have to.<br>\r\n And, as if to affirm the justification of her actions, the immediate problem did in fact resolve itself without her help, in the form of Bev coming up behind her to drop a reassuring arm around her shoulder and pull her inside, saying \u201cCome on, it won\u2019t be that bad. It might even be fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Bev steered her to the larger table away from the door, where Colleen and Linda were already seated. Colleen, with a couple of beers on the go already, looked up expectantly when Lindsay sat down. \u201cJust in time to pay for the next round.\u201d She said, tipping her glass up and polishing off the last of the pre-drinking drink she\u2019d obviously ordered earlier. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be a bit more talkative than Linda there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda, in contrast to Colleen\u2019s booze fest, had a china cup and saucer of tea in front of her. And a new book she was reading. When the girls sat down she carefully folded over the corner of the page and set the book to one side. Lindsay could just make out what seemed to be a giant robotic ant carrying off a screaming buxom blonde woman while a smaller figure with a black vest and a pony tail was running up the road behind them, waving something that looked like an old remote control. The woman was obviously a scientist of some sort, judging from the safety glasses and lab coat she was wearing over the OHAS challenged (but visually obligatory) string bikini. When Lindsay looked closer she could read the title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i> \u201cNukees, The Movie\u2019</i></b><br>\r\nBelow that, the sub text proclaimed<br>\r\n<i>From the stage play by Steve Spoon with characters copyright Darren Bleuel</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay, more from the dread of starting the group session than any real interest, asked \u201cGood book?\u201d<br>\r\nLinda fluttered her eyes and blew across the surface of her tea before answering. \u201cCompared to the others I\u2019ve managed to find here, yes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d Lindsay asked, seizing the chance to delay a bit longer. <br>\r\nLinda took a small sip from her cup. Deciding it was still too hot, she set the tea to one side and settled back against the tent support behind her. \u201cIt\u2019s about the adventures of a group of nuclear science grad students at the University of Berkeley.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo they have a crazy teacher who wears dark glasses?\u201d Colleen asked.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Linda asked, completely missing the musical reference. \u201cNo. At least I don\u2019t think so. He does have a giant nuclear powered robot ant though. And a calculator that houses a Gigapet eating monster called Teri.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWas it really a movie?\u201d Lindsay asked. \u201cI don\u2019t ever remember hearing about it.\u201d<br>\r\nColleen piped up \u201cIt was actually a stage play first, written as a fan-fic of a web comic from the late 90\u2019s. It got optioned to be a direct to video release. The guy I was dating was part of the test audience and I got to sit in on a couple of the daily screenings. Not exactly an Oscar worthy effort, but still a fairly good showing for a budding director. Actually a bit better than a lot of the other movies at the time.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo how come I\u2019ve never heard of it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was never released. Turns out the executive producer had a history of stiffing authors on their royalties. Rather than fight with the exec when the advance cheques bounced the copyright holder went straight to the producer. He stopped production and threatened to can the project unless the EP cleared the funds. Of course the Executive Producer threatened to sue back if they didn\u2019t go ahead, but that was just a smoke screen to keep everyone off balance until he could drain the accounts and fold the production company. By the time the dust settled and the rights were returned the copyright holder was heartily sick of the whole game. And since the EP held onto the option nobody could touch the project anyway so the whole movie was shelved. The novelization you\u2019re holding is all that remains of that Spoon guy\u2019s dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay thought about it for several seconds \u201cSo, if I\u2019ve got this right, basically she\u2019s reading the novelization of a script for a movie that never happened, based on a stage play that was a fan-fic of a web comic?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s pretty much it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t decide if that is the coolest or the geekiest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Bev said, coming back with a rather large tray of drinks. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever said this Colleen, but you know a lot of really weird shit, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d Colleen replied, helping her self to a fresh beer off the tray \u201cI spent a semester at Berkeley in my second year. Weird shit was a required course.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo was Carl Jung,\u201d said Bev, setting the rest of the untouched tray in the middle of the table. \u201cWhich is why we\u2019re here tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d Lindsay said in a resigned tone. The moment was upon them. \u201cAnd I\u2019m getting stuck with the bar tab. Hope my pay will cover it\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThink of it as bargain rates.\u201d Colleen said. \u201cIf this was a real session the bill would be a hell of a lot higher.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Lindsay replied \u201cBut at least I\u2019d walk away with my brain all fixed up.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Lindsay.\u201d Bev said, shaking her head \u201cTherapy doesn\u2019t work that way. There\u2019s no magic patch they put on your brain that instantly heals the hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the point then?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTo let you know people care, and give you tools to help you cope.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bev admitted \u201cThere\u2019s tons more stuff. But that is the realm of your practicing professionals. I\u2019m more of your down and dirty hobbyist type.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Lindsay groaned \u201cDIY psychotherapy. Can\u2019t possibly go wrong with that.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Colleen, perhaps you\u2019d like to go first.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d Colleen asked, reaching for another beer. \u201cI thought I was just here to drink beer and offer moral support.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just think of how supportive it will be when Lindsay knows she\u2019s not the only one subject to bizarre nightmares.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have nightmares!\u201d Colleen insisted, drinking half of the next glass down. \u201cAt least, not major ones like Lindsay\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe all do,\u201d Bev said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not comfortable sharing them then you don\u2019t have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNa, I\u2019ll share.\u201d Colleen said, dismissively waving the hand not wrapped around her glass \u201cThere\u2019s one I used to have all the time. Not really very interesting, but it\u2019s one I remember. I\u2019m always trying to give some kind of presentation only when I get up on stage I realize I forgot to put clothes on.\u201d<br>\r\nBev nodded. \u201cThat one\u2019s actually quite common. Naked in public. Social anxiety, the fear of people seeing who you really are. People use clothing to construct an image of what they want people to think. You want people to think you\u2019re smart and successful, wear a suit. You want people to think you\u2019re a fun person, you dress in party clothes. Clothing is one of the biggest identifiers of social rank and status we have.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right about that.\u201d Colleen said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it that way, but I do know you need a good wardrobe tech to give your film the right look. I hadn\u2019t thought it would be like that in my dreams though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it does.\u201d Bev continued \u201cPeople are basically insecure about how they look to other people. Everyone has something about their body they don\u2019t like so they use clothes to change and enhance the way they look. Stripes for slimming. Girdles and tummy shapers to control stomach bulge, the list goes on. Imagining yourself naked in public is to strip all that concealment and coverings away and let people see the real you, without the facade you\u2019ve built up around you. It brings all your insecurities home.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLindsay was naked this morning.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI was?\u201d Lindsay asked. She hadn\u2019t noticed. Of course, she\u2019d had other things on her mind at the time.<br>\r\n\u201cLindsay was naked because she had just re-spawned, and that\u2019s the way you come back into this world. She didn\u2019t realize she was naked.\u201d Bev confirmed what Lindsay had been thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying Strippers wouldn\u2019t have these kinds of dreams then?\u201d Colleen said, straying even further off topic.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, they do. There\u2019s a big difference between finding yourself unexpectedly naked in public, and being there intentionally.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so nudists would have the same dreams too, then?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re focusing entirely on the wrong part of this conversation, Colleen. It\u2019s not about who\u2019s naked. It\u2019s about why people have nightmares about it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut there\u2019s streakers\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy nightmare is also a manifestation of insecurity,\u201d Bev said, interrupting before Colleen derailed the conversation any further. \u201cOnly in it I\u2019m sitting down to a test I have no idea what the answers are. Sometimes it\u2019s the questions don\u2019t match the answers available. Other times the writing is blurry and unreadable. Again, those are my old insecurities manifesting themselves. Writing tests in school were the one way you could prove to the world that yes, you do know what you\u2019re talking about. Not being able to write the test is your fears and insecurities manifesting themselves to say you\u2019re not really as smart as you think you are. I can accept that, because some days I know I\u2019m not. That\u2019s my most common nightmare and how I deal with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the girls turned to Lindsay who\u2019d been quietly sipping her beer while the others had been talking.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Lindsay,\u201d Bev said. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oddly enough, the fact that the other two were willing to share gave her courage. Even if Colleen seemed to be more joking around than anything, at least Bev was sympathetic, <br>\r\nShe paused and took a deep breath before continuing. \u201cAfter Pitomnik. It was, well\u2026 That night I dreamt I was in a kitchen, cooking for Thanksgiving. Or Christmas. Or something. I had on this plain cotton dress and a frilly apron. <br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Colleen just had to say \u201cI could see why that would be just awful.\u201d<br>\r\nBev shushed her, but Lindsay continued as if she hadn\u2019t heard. <br>\r\n\u201cThe table was perfectly set; Fine white china, crisp white table cloth, a covered white trivet of turnips or something. A dish of cranberries to add a dash of colour. Like the whole thing was being painted by Norman Rockwell, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cThen I opened the oven. Everything was beautiful and perfect and then I opened the oven and suddenly it wasn\u2019t a turkey in the roasting pan any more.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d Colleen asked, ignoring the warning look Bev shot at her. \u201cWhat were you cooking, then?\u201d<br>\r\nShe regretted her question the moment she saw the look in Lindsay\u2019s eyes as she answered.<br>\r\n\u201cMe. I was in the roasting pan. Trussed up and garnished and surrounded by potatoes and probably stuffed with bread crumbs and onions.\u201d Lindsay closed her eyes and shuddered. \u201cAnd all I could keep thinking was I\u2019m not ready yet. People will be here soon and the skin isn\u2019t even starting to brown.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter a moment she said, quietly \u201cI think that\u2019s the part that bothers me the most.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLindsay,\u201d Bev said softly. \u201cIt was just a dream.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWas it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it was.

It takes the information received during the day and tries to match it with what it already knows. And sometimes it doesn\u2019t quite work right.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure. The subconscious doesn\u2019t think in words, it uses symbols. Also, it doesn\u2019t have any imagination, so it relies on information already stored. It drags memories out to see if there\u2019s a match. When it finds one it thinks is close, it throws the whole mix into a pot to see what comes out.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes when you look at the different aspects of the dream you can see where they come from. For instance, you said it looked like a Norman Rockwell painting. I\u2019m going to guess you\u2019re referring to his 1942 \u2018Freedom From Want\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lindsay said, shaking her head, thinking about what she\u2019d seen in the dream. Normally she\u2018d avoided that, but right now was actually quite easy and surprisingly non stressful. \u201cIt was more like the one about Thanksgiving Dinner. Now that I think about it, there was the same dumpy looking housewife and her family in the dream. And the good clean china. I never thought about it before, but the plates were all clean, not like any thanksgiving meal I\u2019ve been involved in.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same picture, you\u2019re just thinking of the more colloquial name for it.\u201d Bev said \u201cAnd yes, the clean plates are intentionally painted that way, part of the symbolism Rockwell worked into the painting. It\u2019s one of his most iconic works, and has been parodied so often the chances are you\u2019ve seen one almost exactly like what your subconscious brought into the dream, even if you don\u2019t remember. So your subconscious is trying to put being trapped in a burning aircraft into perspective, rummages around and comes up with a roasted turkey analogy, which is linked to the parody of Rockwell\u2019s painting. This dream is just the combination of a couple of things you\u2019ve already experienced, and isn\u2019t even all that creative.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. It sure freaked me out at the time.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how do you feel about it now?\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay thought about it. By approaching the dream from an abstract, more clinical point of view instead of dealing with it surprising her in her sleep, she was able to recall the dream without it bothering her that much.<br>\r\n. \u201cOkay, I guess. Better than I thought I would. I don\u2019t see how it results from any insecurities I have though.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d Bev said. \u201cInsecurities are only one thing that can trigger a nightmare. Sometimes, like in yours, it\u2019s your subconscious not being able to understand what\u2019s going on. Talking about them helps. Dreams and nightmares can be pretty devastating, and it\u2019s tempting to stuff them into a dark closet and hope you never see them again. Much better to drag them out in the light, shake the dust and wrapping paper off, and see what they\u2019re made of..<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u201d said Colleen, exhibiting that sudden leap of logic that the inebriated are blessed with, \u201cWe\u2019re probably piling up a shitload of subconscious symbolism with this game.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. And your point is?\u201d<br>\r\nLindsay\u2019s going to have to let me know what her subconscious comes up with when her and that boyfriend of hers have their first fight.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend.\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cIt will probably something with machine guns, probably. Or getting bombed. Hey, maybe like something from a Quentin Tarantino movie.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cColleen!\u201d Said Bev sternly<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend.\u201d Insisted Lindsay.<br>\r\n\u201cNot even after your date to shoot pool the other night?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t go.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, why not.<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I was dead, remember.\u201d Lindsay said. It came out harsher than she meant it to, but she didn\u2019t want to admit that it bothered her. \u201cAnd now he won\u2019t return my calls.\u201d She said angrily.<br>\r\n\u201cLindsay,\u201d Bev said slowly \u201cHe was shot down the day before you were. And he hasn\u2019t re-spawned yet. Didn\u2019t anyone tell you? He\u2019s MIA.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In a moment she went from mad to worried. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPretty sure. Lorraine was playing pool at the 83rd the other night and that\u2019s what she heard someone saying.\u201d<br>\r\nLorraine had been passing by when she heard her name.<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I heard what now?\u201d she asked, coming over to the table.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lorraine.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI heard my name.\u201d Lorraine said, sliding a chair up and sitting \u201cDid one of your little nightmares involve me now?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI was just telling Lindsay that you heard Rhett got shot down.\u201d Bev said, shuffling her chair over to give Lorraine a bit more room. <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Nazier was saying when we were waiting for a table. He was gunner on your boyfriend\u2019s plane when they went down over Varopanovo.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, what ever. Rhett lost both engines and made a forced landing. Nazier was killed on impact. Since he\u2019s the only one to re-spawn he figured the rest survived the crash. Probably still stuck behind enemy lines trying to sneak their way back.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why I can\u2019t get a hold of him.\u201d Lindsay said \u201cAnd here I was worried he was mad at me for missing our date.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be the date where your not-boyfriend stood you up?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI think you have that backwards, I stood him up.\u201d <br>\r\nLorraine shook her head \u201cShe really has a lot to learn doesn\u2019t she?\u201d she said to the rest of the girls at the table. \u201cListen, Lindsay,\u201d she said, in the tone of someone who was pointing out the obvious to someone very clueless, \u201cHe was shot down the day before you were, right? So he would have had all the chances he needed to re-spawned the day before you did, right? And since he didn\u2019t care enough to be back here in time for the date you missed, you\u2019re the one that got stood up.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cBut if he\u2026\u201d Lindsay started to say before Lorraine cut her off.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t go making excuses for him.\u201d She said \u201cMen are always trying to get away with this kind of crap, and once you let them start they\u2019ll do it all the time.<br>\r\n\u201cStill,\u201d Bev added, \u201cBeing trapped behind enemy lines can be seen as a good excuse.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was trying to say.\u201d Lindsay added<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just because he\u2019s got a good excuse that doesn\u2019t let him off the hook.\u201d Lorraine continued. \u201cIf he wants you to forgive him he\u2019s going to have to work at it. <br>\r\n\u201cOhh,\u201d Colleen piped in \u201cLike chocolates.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s getting chocolates?\u201d Asked Addison, coming over to join them when she heard the word.<br>\r\n\u201cLindsay is.\u201d Colleen stated \u201cRhett giving them to her as an apology.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo he\u2019s not!\u201d Lindsay sputtered.<br>\r\n\u201cIf he wants you to forgive him it has got to be chocolates, at the very least.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd flowers.\u201d Addison piped in. \u201cFlowers always worked for me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd maybe a set of silk stockings.\u201d Linda added, silent up to this point but joining in on the fun.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Lorraine said \u201cThe good ones. Not those heavy Russian ones that feel like a cheap set of industrial tights. Something light and sexy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would I want with those?\u201d Lindsay asked, perpetuating the image of cluelessness her friends were picking up on.<br>\r\n\u201cTo wear, silly. To make <i>you</i> feel light and sexy!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to feel sexy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me girlfriend\u201d Lorraine said with a wink, \u201cYou do. Nothing projects confidence like a woman who knows she\u2019s wearing sexy underwear under her uniform. You wear that on your next date and Rhett will be glad he apologized.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not wearing sexy underwear on a date with Rhett.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYour loss. But flowers and chocolates are the bare minimum to start an apology with.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are crazy.\u201d Lindsay stated \u201cIn case you missed it, we\u2019re in the middle of Russia. There are no flowers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Russian girls get flowers too. Where do you think little Russians come from?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIn the middle of winter?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, he\u2019s going to have to work for it.<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to get me chocolates and flowers in the middle of a war in the middle of Russia.\u201d Lindsay stated, getting a little frustrated over this fantasy love affair the group insisted on constructing around her and Rhett.<br>\r\n\u201cIf your boyfriend truly loves you he will find a way.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t love me!\u201d Lindsay snapped, irritation making her a little louder than she intended.<br>\r\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t love you? Asked Leslie, entering the Gasthaus in time to hear the last sentence.<br>\r\n\u201cRhett doesn\u2019t.\u201d Lindsay said, exasperated. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not buying me chocolates or flowers or sexy silk stockings to make up for it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRhett? The bomber pilot from the 83rd? Now really, Lindsay.\u201d The Colonel had missed most of the conversation, coming to her own conclusion about what had gotten her First Lieutenant all riled up. \u201cYou need to learn to be reasonable. It\u2019s the middle of a war. Those things are a little hard to come by.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a lousy day for hunting. All those Russian planes that had been travelling in swarms lately seemed to have been grounded. The one patrol they had made contact with consisted of only six planes. To their surprise the Russians ignored the obvious bad odds, engaging recklessly but fighting so poorly that they had all six been shot down in a space of three minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo fill in the time they had attacked a train depot that the bombers hadn\u2019t yet taken out. Probably not the best idea, Lindsay had come away from that with major control damage, which was why she was dressed and serving tonight. She\u2019d barely made it back to the airbase as it was, so the crash landing hadn\u2019t really been her fault. Still, as Lana-Raye said, any crash landing you can walk away from still puts you behind the bar.<br>\r\nGrumbling, but mildly since they\u2019d all agreed to the rule and had stuck to it, Lindsay had donned the Dirndl Kjole and took her place behind the bar for the night. The new bar had been Bev\u2019s contribution. She\u2019d argued that if they were going to have a bartender they needed an actual bar to tend. So the big trestle table had been tossed and the counter pulled away from the wall and turned around. A snazzy front had been fashioned from the cowl of a LaGG that Addison had shot down nearby.  Someone had dug up a few stools from some where to put in front, and the cozy self serve bar had turned into a cozy bar with service. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight, it was almost closing time, and Lana-Raye had just ordered the last round when the air raid siren started its mournful howl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone playing a joke was Lindsay\u2019s first thought, looking around. Of the group, only Lorraine and Linda were absent, having left to go to the washroom earlier. Neither of them were the type to pull this kind of prank though. Addison, quicker on the uptake, went tearing out of the tent towards the airfield as the rest of them exchanged baffled looks. Then they heard the cough of engines starting up by the hangers. \u201cOh shit\u201d the Colonel said, putting a voice to what they were all coming to realize, \u201cWe\u2019re under attack\u201d! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they could hear the engines of approaching aircraft. <br>\r\nAn explosion rocked the camp as they ran out the door. As they all dived for cover as rocks and dirt rained down on them. Several more explosions quickly followed the first, further away towards the airfield. When they picked themselves up they could see several fires burning by the hangers. Two aircraft were rolling down the runway, attempting to take off even as they came under enemy fire. A third, less luckier plane lay crumpled in the middle of the runway, broken and on fire. Even as they watched it exploded, sending a ball of flame skyward. Then three Russians swooped over the compound, strafing the tents and barracks and causing the group to dive for cover again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cListen up\u201d! The Colonel yelled. \u201cEverybody grab a buddy and head for the motor pool. Take a jeep and head for the 104th\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat about our planes\u201d?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was another explosion, huge this time. One of the bombs must have hit the fuel depot.  Lindsay watched the huge fireball, so bright she could see two of the attacking aircraft illuminated by the flare of light. As she watched the flames roll upward, she started to get mad. Her long promised Folker 190 had just been delivered yesterday, and now the place her shiny new plane was parked was an inferno of burning fuel and wreckage. And it was still being bombed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging course she sprinted over to an AA gun emplacement, vaulting over the sand bags and onto the gun platform in one smooth movement.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing\u201d, screamed Bev.<br>\r\n\u201cIf those bastards want to blow up my plane, they\u2019re gonna pay the price\u201d! Lindsay shouted back. \u201cI\u2019ll be dammed if I\u2019m going to let those bastards have a free run\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cBut the Colonel said\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGo\u201d, Lindsay shouted back, \u201cYou can pick me up on the way past\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s gonna kill you, you know that\u201d! Bev yelled as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe I\u2019ll get lucky and she won\u2019t have to\u201d muttered Lindsay as she pulled the camo netting off and fed an ammo belt into the machine gun. Cocked and ready, she waited for the next group of planes to make a pass. The wait seemed both longer than it should have, and at the same took no time at all before two Russians came in low, strafing down the line of damaged but not yet burning planes. Lindsay centered the sight ahead of the lead plane and pulled the trigger, holding the gun steady. Not chasing the target, instead letting the planes fly themselves through the stream of tracer and lead. Both planes went down, one crashing into the parked planes and setting them on fire, the other cart wheeling across what was left of the runway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay hunkered down, scanning the dark sky for the planes she could hear over the roar and crackle of the flames. Something came roaring past overhead, something she couldn\u2019t see in the smoke and darkness. She could hear the scream of engines and cannon fire overhead. Moments later she saw red tracer and knew at least one of their BF109\u2019s had made it off the ground. Whoever it was faced some steep odds that were definitely not in their favor; she saw at least three groups of white tracer crisscross that same part of the sky. She swung the gun around, sighting on that patch of sky. Just as she\u2019d suspected, three dark objects came screaming out of it towards her. She let the first two roar past unmolested, not sure who was who,  targeting instead the third trailing behind which was firing the white tracer the Russians were so fond of, turning and firing upwards into the belly as it roared overhead. She was rewarded by a dark plume of smoke, almost impossible to see against the night air, and flames that burst to life along the fuselage. As the burning plane soared up and away one of the other two planes slam into the ground and exploded; the other vanished into the darkness above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever side controlled the plane that had gone down she didn\u2019t know. She could only hope it was an enemy. Then another aircraft came roaring in, strafing Lindsay\u2019s position and blowing up a fuel truck behind her. This one she barely had time to swing the gun around for, and most of the shells went wild of her target. Behind her the burning truck bathed her area with light from the flames. Still, the tracer had its effect and the plane veered off. Lindsay targeted the tail of the escaping fighter and held the trigger until the last of the belt fed through and the gun jammed.  She was out of ammo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another belt, down in the pit. Normally a second gunner would have passed the belt up to her so she could feed it into the gun and keep going. Without a second gunner she\u2019d have to climb down and fetch the belt it herself, a move that would eat up precious time. Time she didn\u2019t have. With the glare of light of the burning truck turning her position into a brightly lit defenseless target, Lindsay decided it was time for a strategic withdrawal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving the gun aside she ducked under the spinning muzzle and jumped from the gun platform, running for the cover of the darkness between the rows of tents. In the distance she could hear a jeep approaching, the driver honking the horn wildly, so she ran towards it. Another aircraft came roaring overhead just she reached the edges of the tents, and she barely had time to throw herself flat on the ground when the world exploded around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lorraine and Linda were also missing. Then Addison showed up, saying at least one of those two had gotten their plane off the ground during the attack. Maybe even both. She tried to take off herself but had been caught in the strafing and had barely escaped before her plane blew up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddison, Colleen, and Lana-Raye piled into one of the jeeps and took off, headed for the dark road away from the airfield, while Leslie and Bev took a second jeep and headed back to pick up Lindsay. They were just in time to see a Russian IL-2 race overhead being chased by one of their 109s, that was in turn being fired on by a second Russian IL-2. As the three planes passed over the line of tents red tracer rose from the ground and set the trailing Russian on fire, just as cannon fire from the 109 tore the wings of the lead aircraft. \u201cThat\u2019s Lindsay, on the ground\u201d Bev yelled and pointed, as the jeep tore across the open field back towards the compound.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The stream of tracer had caught the attention of other attacking aircraft, and they could only watch helplessly as another fighter came roaring out of the night sky, strafing the gun position. A ball of fire rose into the air, but the red tracer rising from behind the tents after the plane told them that Lindsay was still alive and still shooting. <br>\r\n\u201cShit\u201d the Colonel swore as she floored the jeep and hammered on the horn. Couldn\u2019t that girl see the tracer is making her a target? They were still about 100 meters away, and could now clearly see to see the machine gun silhouetted in the light of the burning truck behind it; the long barrel slowly rotating as it searched for it\u2019s next target. The colonel hit the horn again, letting Lindsay know her ride was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the Russian bomb hit, blowing the position to smithereens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Colonel hit the brakes, skidding the jeep to a stop while Bev grabbed a hold of the windshield and stood up. They stared at the smoking crater for a long moment in shock and disbelief. Then another fighter roared by overhead, and the Colonel let forth a long string of very passionate curses as she jammed the jeep into gear and spun the wheel, fish tailing the jeep around and speeding them to safety away from the attack. Away from the smoking crater that was all that remained of the machine gun Lindsay had occupied moments before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Colonel couldn\u2019t risk using the lights, and fought a constant battle with her foot on the accelerator, balancing the need to move as fast as possible with the need to not wreck their only means of escape. At last they made it to the road, and the ride became a lot smoother. The Colonel still refused to turn on the headlights, fearing that even with the glare shrouds covering them the light created would stand out against the pitch black night and make them an easy target for the hunting aircraft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they made it to the 104th  . The other refugees from the 83rd and 123rd  had arrived earlier, judging by the state of high alert they found the base in.<br>\r\nEventually, they found the rest of their squad, grouped around a table in the mess. Drinking coffee and staring into space, talking in low tones. The news about Lindsay wasn\u2019t a real surprise. The group had figured it out when they saw Leslie and Bev come in without her. Someone wondered when Lorraine and Linda would be joining them, but for the most part the talked about inconsequential things. Avoiding talking about anything that reminded them of just how badly the Russians had hurt them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long while Linda and Lorraine turned up, having managed to bring in their aircraft relatively unscathed. They had also managed to take out some of the enemy aircraft. Lorraine had scored two, Linda with three. Balanced against the loss of their planes on the ground, well,. Nobody felt much like talking. After a while the Colonel arranged for some temporary billets, and they went to bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The others were poking around in the smoldering wreckage, looking for anything that hadn\u2019t been wrecked or burned. Lindsay didn\u2019t bother. Everything she would have wanted had been in her office at the hanger. An office that currently consisted of two charred upright timbers and a heap of twisted smoldering metal. While the rest of them dug around to see if there was anything to salvaged, she sat and stared at the rising smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the others gave up and headed back to where the two jeeps, the sum total of the 123rd's surviving equipment, were parked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe nothing survived\u201d Leslie said. \u201cI mean, it was quite the fight, and we were taken by surprise, sure. But there weren\u2019t that many enemy aircraft. And usually there\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t get shot up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t just aircraft.\u201d Lana-Raye said \u201cThe place is covered in tire tracks and boot prints. Someone was here before we were. Several trucks worth of someones, judging from the number of prints.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, you\u2019re saying ground troops came in and finished the job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore than likely looted the place first. Stuff isn\u2019t just burnt and wrecked. A lot of it is missing. See the Gasthus?\u201d<br>\r\nWhere the Gasthus had stood was now only a flat burnt space, with bits of canvas and wood embers smoldered in the ashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Jukebox\u201d Exclaimed Colleen, realizing what Lana-Raye was telling them.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the Jukebox?\u201d Addison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe jukebox had this large metal frame inside, and a bunch of gears and such. It wouldn\u2019t have burnt up. It\u2019s gone. And the ice box, and the bar. Whoever was driving the trucks must have taken it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Lana-Raye said, pleased at Colleen\u2019s quick uptake \u201cLooters. They swept into camp, probably moments after the bombing stopped,  took everything of value, then burned what was left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything of Value?\u201d Addison asked \u201cLike our jukebox?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d Colleen threw in \u201cWhy not? Russians like to get down too. I\u2019ll bet they\u2019re plugging nickels into it even as we sit here talking about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t say as I blame them.\u201d Lorraine added \u201cNothing like boogieing down to help you relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid the Jukebox is the least of our worries.\u201d Lana-Raye said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they got the Bar and the icebox too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\" Lana-Raye said \"I\u2019m talking about the aircraft. We had 10 brand new 190\u2019s sitting in the hanger. How much you want to bet that they\u2019re now sitting in a Russian hanger having red stars added to the wings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this just gets better and better!\u201d Lorraine sighed. \u201cWe got bombed, beaten, and looted.\u201d Lorraine said with a sigh. \u201cThen they burned what\u2019s left to the ground. And to top it off you're saying we're going up against our own fighters. So what do we do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe start again.\u201d Said Leslie firmly, falling back into her commanding officer role. \u201cLets move out!\u201d With that she climbed into the jeep and started it up.

What was left of the 123rd had set themselves up on a small airfield they had commandeered. More of a training field that an operational airbase, but it would do until they were able to set up operations on a proper airfield, if they ever did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBev looked up from the cup of whisky she\u2019d been nursing. \u201cI assume that\u2019s why you asked me to come over.\u201d She said. \u201cIt seems to me that when you invite several people over it\u2019s a party, but when it\u2019s just me and Lana it\u2019s because you have something on your mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I that obvious?\u201d Leslie looked up, sloppily setting her own glass aside for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBev shook her head. \u201cOnly on occasion. This time I know something\u2019s bothering you. If you need to talk, I\u2019m here. So spill it already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie smiled grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s this thing about Lindsay.\" she said, words slurring slightly as she spoke \"Her dying on us the other day. It was pretty traumatic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know\u201d Bev said. \u201cI was there, remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly too well.\u201d Leslie said, picking up her glass and downing it in one gulp. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the thing. The three of us have been playing these games for what, two years?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCloser to three. Ever since we all got together and bought those surplus VR helmets from the D.O.D contractor that boyfriend of yours worked for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for bringing him up.\u201d Leslie said as she poured herself another two fingers of whiskey \u201cNow I have two reasons to get drunk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHey, if you need a reason to get drunk I can come up with a lot more. Anyway, I\u2019m sure there was a point to that question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, there was a point. And it had to do with Lindsay, and this SIM. Have you noticed just how real this SIM is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. I mean, we all have. The game is modeled to give us as realistic an experience as possible, right. What about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie took a sip from her glass as she spoke \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about something Lindsay said to me a couple of days after she joined us. She said, who really needs to feel a drop of pee run down their leg? At the time I thought it was an odd thing for her to say, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Bev said \u201cShe may have still been trying to get a handle on all the little hygiene things a woman needs to know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was. And she was referring to the incredible detail in which everything around us is modeled. Tiny details that you wouldn\u2019t think are necessary, yet are there, just in case you notice them. Tiny inconsequential things. A bead of sweat on the end of your nose. The way your bra strap gets sweat built up under it, or a hang nail catches on your glove. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo they\u2019ve put a lot of effort into making the SIM as real as possible.\u201d Bev shrugged \u201cDo you think there\u2019s a problem with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe problem\u201d Leslie said, \u201cIs maybe it has become too real. It\u2019s so real it\u2019s starting to mess with my mind. I mean, I know it\u2019s just a game, yet Lindsay was blown to smithereens in front of me, and I can\u2019t get past it.\u201d She took another drink, finishing her glass again. \u201cWhy am I thinking that way? It\u2019s just a game, isn\u2019t it? I shouldn\u2019t feel this sense of loss. I should be all \u2018Dude, you really got yourself pwned that time\u2019, not staring at a whisky bottle wondering why it\u2019s not helping me feel better.\u201d<br>\r\nShe picked up the bottle to pour herself another drink, then thought better of it. <br>\r\n\u201cBev, you\u2019re the psychologist here. What\u2019s happening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know as well as I do I\u2019m no psychologist. That\u2019s just our inside joke because of the semester I spent at Berkley. Linda or Allison are just as qualified.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, but unlike those two, you listen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLinda listens too.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLinda makes me uncomfortable for some reason. Besides, you\u2019re my friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re all your friends. Someday you\u2019ll understand that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you say.

If she was coming back she should have re-spawned by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes MIA\u2019s take a bit longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not MIA. She\u2019s dead. She was blown to pieces right in front of me. If she was going to re-spawn she would have by now. I\u2019m just afraid that, well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfraid of what?\u201d Lana-Raye asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard what they say about SIMS? About what happens if a SIM gets too real?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana-Raye and Bev just looked at each other, neither of them had a clue what Leslie was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone once said that, If you die in the game you die in real life.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty sure that\u2019s a meme from some cheesy horror flick.\u201d Lana-Raye said \u201cColleen would know which one if you ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose are just rumors.\u201d Bev said \u201cUrban legends. Things people make up to tell each other. Nobody believes them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe. But what if they\u2019re not? What if all those MIAs aren\u2019t showing up because they\u2019re not MIA, they\u2019re really dead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense. We\u2019ve all died and come back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what if it takes a really brutal death to trigger it. Something horrible like been blown to bits?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMore horrible than drowning?\u201d Bev asked bluntly \u201cOr being trapped and burnt to death? Or being sliced to ribbons by a plate glass window? Because that\u2019s just a few ways Lindsay has died, and she always came back. If you really think about it, being blown to bits would be rather painless. At least it\u2019s instantaneous.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s something else that triggers it.\u201d Leslie said taking a pull straight from the bottle she\u2019d been holding on to during the entire conversation.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re really determined to believe the game is out to get us, aren\u2019t you.\u201d Bev said softly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to make sense of this. Of Lindsay\u2019s death. Of this war that never seems to go anywhere. And why is the game re-equip mechanism so screwed up. Did you know that as of this morning the 83rd now has one and a half bombers for every pilot? And we have two fighters each in the new hangers?\u201d<br>\r\nHangers was a generous term to apply to the Camouflage netting and low mounds of dirt that served as a poor windbreak around three sides of each parked aircraft. Still, the news caught both the women by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWasn\u2019t that something to do with having them all destroyed in the raid?\u201d Lana-Ray asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think? By rights we should have gotten one plane each. That was in the rules.\u201d Leslie said, waving her bottle in the direction of the hangers \u201cI\u2019m telling you someone\u2019s messing with the game mechanics.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you told the System admins?\u201d Bev asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried.\u201d Leslie said \u201cYou can\u2019t get a hold of them. You can\u2019t get a hold of anybody.\u201d She took another pull from the bottle, then sat in the battered chair behind her desk. Well not so much sat as fell back into the chair so suddenly it was like she collapsed. She rested her head on one hand, still holding the bottle. \u201cI\u2026 Well.. Bev, Lana\u2026 I think we\u2019re screwed.\u201d She looked up at them, her face almost white. \u201cI think we\u2019re really and truly trapped here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana-Ray and Bev looked at each other, then Bev reached over and pried the bottle out of Leslies\u2019 hand. It didn\u2019t take that much effort \u201cI think maybe you\u2019re just a little too deep into that bottle to talk about this right now.\u201d She said \u201cWhy don\u2019t we all go to bed and see how things look in the morning. Maybe Lindsay will be back by then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends exchanged a worried look. Leslie was far drunker than either of them had seen her in a long time. Whatever background information she had, and they were sure there was a lot more to it than what she had let slip, that information was worrying the usually unflappable Colonel. That in turn worried her friends. By mutual agreement they decided not to say anything to the others until they were able to talk more when Leslie was sober. Having decided that, they helped her into the communal barrack room they all shared now and put her to bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Lindsay wasn\u2019t sure how long she was out. Just that the attack seemed to be over when she groggily picked herself up. That, and her head hurt like hell. And there was a ringing in one ear, the sound kind of fuzzy on that side. With the other ear she could clearly hear the crackle of flames from the burning hangers and an occasional small pop as something burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she dusted off the dirt and small rocks that covered her she looked around, trying to assess the damage. The hangers were gone, along with her new Folker. And anyone else\u2019s aircraft too, she supposed. The light of the burning wreckage, where the fires hadn\u2019t burned themselves out yet, showed that quite clearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n There were a lot of fires still burning over at the section of the airfield the 83th called home up until now. Most of their part of the compound was flattened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her group had been spared the worst of the damage. Other than the hangers, most of the compound of the 127th was still standing, including their generator shed. She could tell because of the light leaking out from under the black-out curtains on the windows the Gasthaus, telling her that the lights were still on. Nothing else stirred. As far as she could tell, she was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Figuring the Colonel and the girls would be back any time, and that the Gasthaus was as good a place to wait as any, she headed over there. <br>\r\nInside there was no real damage to be seen. One of the tables had been knocked over, and the round Lana-Raye had ordered was spilled all over the bar, a coating of dust covering the sticky liquid. Other than that, and the acrid smell of burning that permeated the air, from inside it was as if the attack had never happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lindsay stood the table up, wiped it, then sat herself on the stool behind the bar as she cleaned that up too. She was still pretty dazed from the explosion, functioning mostly on autopilot. Mostly cleaning to keep herself occupied while wincing and wondering where the bruises on her back had come from, and why her head hurt so much. She was just finished cleaning the sticky goo off the bar and wiping it dry, and thinking that maybe she should have another drink herself, strictly for medicinal reasons, when she heard the sounds of truck brakes and shouting outside. Half expecting it to be the Colonel or one of the other girls she turned towards the door, trying and failing to think of something witty or sarcastic to say when the door slammed open and the first soldier burst in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The witty retort she\u2019d been failing to think of vanishing in the shock of his entrance. A man in the Gasthaus? Could he not see the sign? The soldier shouted something unintelligible, pointing a rifle directly at her. Too late, Lindsay realized the soldier was wearing a Russian uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two more soldiers appeared in the doorway, guns leveled. Lindsay froze, not sure what to say. Once again the soldier shouted something, probably in Russian would be her guess, then gestured with the rifle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, Lindsay would swear that something, perhaps the true spirit of the Dirndl Kjole, took over and guided her actions. That was the only reasonable explanation she could think of. She certainly wasn\u2019t mentally capable of coming up with the plan, not still concussed as she was from the explosion. Whatever the reason, Lindsay waved the rag she was holding towards a table, then picked up a serving tray. Putting on her cheesiest false smile she said \u201cWelcome to the Mad Cow Bar gentlemen. What can I get you\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the soldiers had been expecting, it obviously wasn\u2019t being invited to sit down at the bar. The three soldiers looked at each other uncertainly, lowering their rifles and looking around. Two of them warily stood guard the door while the first one carefully poked around, making sure there were no enemy soldiers hiding under the tables or behind the bar. Or in the icebox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Get out of there!\u201d Lindsay said loudly. Not that she was going to try and stop him if he insisted, but it was something a barmaid would say, right? It felt right so she went with it. She bustled over and shooed him away from the icebox, and to her surprise he complied meekly. The three soldiers gathered in a huddle by the door and stood there, talking. Lindsay didn\u2019t speak Russian, so she had no idea what they were saying, but they weren\u2019t pointing the guns at her any more so she figured it was good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the soldiers left, leaving the two standing at the door awkwardly watching her and talking between them selves. She asked them again if they\u2019d like something to drink, not really expecting an answer, and getting none. Never the less, more to keep busy than anything else, she loaded a tray with beer mugs, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The soldier reappeared, this time with an officer in tow. Lindsay could tell he was an officer because he had a huge bushy beard, a much warmer looking heavy coat with a fancy hat, and grumpier attitude than the soldiers meekly standing in the doorway. This time when she offered the drink tray he slapped it aside, spilling the mugs to the floor. Lindsay let out an indignant \u201cHey\u201d which he ignored, turning instead and questioning the three men at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  There was a lengthy exchange in Russian, during which the officer never took his eyes off her. For her part she stood there, trying her best to think of what an NPC barmaid would do, and deciding it would be something like putting clasping her hands together and swaying slightly as she stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The officer, obviously tired of asking his men questions they didn\u2019t know the answers to, decided that a better use of his time would be to ask a barmaid questions she couldn\u2019t understand. He stalked up to her, so close she could almost feel the whiskers of the massive bushy beard brush against her. Not using his inside voice he said something straight into her face. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nObviously the perks of being an officer stopped at including a tooth brush in the basic hygiene kit. Gagging at his breath and unable to stop herself, she turned her head and tried to push him away. Before she realized what happened he cuffed the side of her head, not too hard, but still hard enough she lost her balance and stumbled back a step and had to grab the edge of a table to stop from falling. Moving forward, the officer leaned forward and yelled something, as if he was going to break the language barrier with shear volume of voice. With as much dignity as she could muster, Lindsay picked herself up an then, hoping she wasn\u2019t making a big mistake but not really caring, haughtily turned her back to the glowering man, deliberately walking the short distance to the bar until a rattle of guns being cocked came from behind her. She stood stock still for a moment, and when the half expected being shot from behind didn\u2019t happen, she glared over her shoulder at the three men, standing watching her over their aimed rifles, then back at the officer who was glowering at her over his bushy beard. Then, slowly and as deliberately as she could, knowing it was probably a mistake, she reached up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd turned off the open sign. Then she sat down on a bar stool with her arms folded, watching to see what they\u2019d do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment nobody moved, then the officer turned and spoke, practically spitting in disdain. The soldiers sheepishly looked at each other and shrugged. The officer cuffed one of the men on the ear and stalked out, obviously on his way to take care of more officery things, leaving the problem of the uncooperative bar maid in the hands of his minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them spoke for a couple of minutes, one looking out the door as if expecting the officer back at any time, while the other talked rapidly to the third,  obviously trying the talk him into something he wasn\u2019t too keen on. Lindsay watched them for a couple of minutes, then picked up her rag and cleaned up the spilled beer mugs. As she was mopping the last of it up she heard a rattle from the counter, so turned and found the more talkative one leaning over the bar, trying to help himself to the contents of the icebox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Touchy\u201d she said, running over and slapping his hand away. The soldier glared at her and picked up the rifle he\u2019d leaned against a table. Before he did anything else though his buddy said something to him and he paused, then looked at her questioningly. For her part she folded her arms and glared at him from in front of the bar. Looking back at his buddy he engaged in another exchange of undecipherable Russian, then looked back at where Lindsay stood, blocking access to the bar and icebox. Shrugging, he laid the rifle on the table, then dug into his pocket and offered up a crumpled bill of some sort. <br>\r\nOkay, Lindsay thought, wheels turning in her head. Maybe there was a way out of this mess after all.<br>\r\nShe looked at the bill as if studying it, then shook her head, holding up two fingers. <br>\r\nAfter a moment, the soldier digs another bill out of his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay held the two bills up to the light, studying them. The bills looked like money. She had no idea if they were or not, or even how much was there. But that\u2019s something a bar maid would do, right? And she was going for effect at this point anyway, wondering how far she should go. Before she could say anything the second soldier pressed another four bills into her hand, gesturing at the spilled beer mugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, she thought. There\u2019s still a good chance I\u2019ll get shot, OR this just might keep me alive long enough to escape.<br>\r\nDeliberately, she folded those bills and tucked them into her cleavage. As the man at the door hooted with laughter she turned the bar light back on, then reached into the ice box and pulled him out a beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed they had reached a basic trade agreement.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The soldier grinned, and chugged down the beer in one go, then belched and held up another two bills. After swapping them for another beer Lindsay tucked these bills into the shoe box under the bar that served the 127rd as their cash register. There was a brief discussion from the two soldiers at the door. One of them kept a nervous look out while the other, the one that had laughed out loud at Lindsay stashing her \u2018tip\u2019, leaned his rifle against a table and pulled out a couple of bills of his own.<br>\r\n  Finishing his second beer at a more sedate pace, soldier #1 picked up his rifle and after a brief word with the one nervously keeping watch, headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  A few minutes later a couple more soldiers trickled in, looked around, and took over a table. At first they seemed to expect her to know what they wanted, and were quite irritated that she couldn\u2019t understand them. Finally, by pointing and holding up fingers, she finally got them to understand the very simple ordering process. If they wanted a beer. They held up two bills. If they wanted a shot of something harder, it was three bills. Except for the good stuff in the center cabinet. Those were 4 bills a shot. Once that was established things ran fairly smooth after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore soldiers trickled in and the place got a little rowdier. Not being able to speak the language she relied a lot on gestures and pantomime. What some of the soldiers pantomimed back sometimes was pretty crude, but thankfully no one took it any further. A couple tried, at first, sneaking a quick grab of her butt as she took their order, but she slapped the hands away and that was as far as it went. At least at first. Later on a couple of the drunker men would try to take it a bit further, but surprisingly were shut down by their comrades, who obviously become quite fond of the novelty of having a captured German server girl waiting on them. Lindsay did make up one more rule, after she caught one of them intentionally distracting her while his partner tried to help himself to the icebox. Anyone touches the ice box but her, and she would shut the bar down. This made Mister Clever and his partner a little less than popular, but the crowd of soldiers seemed for the most part to side with her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, she was quite surprised that she was getting away with as much as she was. In a room packed with enemy soldiers she was feeling no more threatened than she did that summer when she\u2019d done a stint working as a restaurant server. Maybe this is what being a waitress at Hooters feels like, she thought. The men staring and drooling over her, and tipping poorly. Part of that she was sure, was that Russian soldiers didn\u2019t get paid a lot. And a big part of it was also Lindsay\u2019s fault. There was no \u2018keep the change\u2019, seeing as the established price was two bills, any kind (because she had no idea what Russian currency looked like) and Lindsay wasn\u2019t giving any back. But often when she delivered the drinks one of the men would slide an extra bill across the table. Then she realized she kept forgetting and putting those tips in with the general cash, so she started tucking the tips into her bra, much to the delight of the soldiers, who immediately started tipping more often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the officer came back in and started shouting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer glared at Lindsay, then stalked over the bar sign, reached up, and turned it off, much like Lindsay had at their first meeting. <br>\r\nSome of the men scrambled immediately to their feet and grabbed their weapons. Others, more nonchalantly took the time to toss back the remainder of their drinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less that five minutes all the men had left. Lindsay followed the last of them to the door., peaking out to see what they were up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Russian trucks were lined up outside, being loaded with crates and barrels looted from various tents. Briefly Lindsay wondered if now was the time to sneak away, while they were distracted. Unfortunately, that same officer and the three guards were standing at the back of a truck, right in front of her, discussing something. Then they turned and came back towards the Gasthus. Lindsay ducked back inside when she saw them heading her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the door she was back behind the bar, trying to look like she was not one of the enemy looking for a chance to escape, but instead a mere bar maid cleaning up. The guise was still working apparently, as the men paid her no notice. Instead, two of them walked over to the jukebox and started pulling it away from the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u201d Lindsay shouted, bustling over to stop them. She stopped though, when the officer pulled out his pistol and aimed it at her head. One of the soldiers shouted something, then grabbed the officers arm. There was a brief discussion between the two, then the officer stalked over to the beer cooler and opened it. Lindsay started to protest, then stopped when he pointed the gun at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer rummaged around in the ice for a bit, then came back, empty handed. The soldier who had stopped him from shooting Lindsay (there was no doubt in her mind that\u2019s what would have happened had he not intervened) gave him an I told you so look, then pulled two bills out of his pocket and laid them on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay couldn\u2019t figure out what was happening, and only looked at the bills confused.  The officer pointed to the bills with the muzzle of his pistol, then at the ice box. Slowly, not sure of what was going on, Lindsay pulled a beer out of the icebox and gave it to him, automatically scooping up the bills for payment. At this, the officer only grunted, and instead of drinking put the un-opened beer into his pocket. Then he spoke to the soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore soldiers appeared and started stripping the Gasthaus of its furnishings, heedless of Lindsay\u2019s protests. The bar, icebox, jukebox, tables, chairs, and almost anything else that wasn\u2019t nailed down too solidly was loaded into the back of the waiting truck, herself included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t asked nicely either. Instead two of the soldiers loading proceeded to roughly tie her hands behind her back, then forcing a gag in her mouth to silence her when she protested at being so rudely handled. Of course one of them took a few additional liberties as well, putting his hands in places they needn\u2019t be in order to lift her into the truck with the rest of the looted furnishings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Minutes later the convoy headed off into the night, destined for the Russian lines.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Larry stood on the truck\u2019s running board, waiting for the convoy to move out of the compound. As soon as the last of them had passed his position he aimed his flare gun at the row of tents and fired. Of course, the tent to the left of the one he had been aiming at burst into flames, but that didn\u2019t matter. They had emptied several fuel cans earlier, and the fire spread rapidly along the lines of spilled gasoline until the whole camp was ablaze, flames shooting high into the night. With a grunt of satisfaction Larry swung himself up into the cab and settled into the passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s a beautiful sight!\u201d laughed the driver as he jammed the truck into gear and started after the rest of the convoy. They could just make out the taillights of the rest of the trucks in the distance, but the driver was in no hurry, casting lingering glances into the mirror until the blaze disappeared behind a hill. Only then did he speed up enough to eventually catch up with the rest of the convoy.<br>\r\nIt was just the way his luck was running that the driver was that one weird guy every outfit has. Far too fond of fire and explosions, and far short of conversation about anything that didn\u2019t include them. To him the night\u2019s raid had been a success, in spite of Larry\u2019s complaining. As soon as he realized that he and Larry had completely different views of how the raid went he shut up and just drove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was okay with Larry. He wasn\u2019t much in the mood for talking right now. In his opinion the raid was a complete FUBAR, and he was planning what he was going to say to the commander about just how badly the whole mess had been organized. Sometimes the incompetence of the people in charge was irritation. At other times, like tonight, it was so outstanding as to be award winning, if there was such a category, with it\u2019s little trophies and ribbons and better luck next time certificates. Larry wondered who\u2019s name would be engraved on the trophy for tonight\u2019s fiasco.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nThe Commander would have his vote, he decided, his thought going back to the day when he\u2019d gone into Commanders office to give him a piece of his mind and instead had been talked into going along with a raiding plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander looked up when Larry knocked. <br>\r\n\u201cCome in, Comrade Ivontabitch,\u201d the commander said, deliberately mocking the phrasing Larry was fond of using. \u201cWhat seems to be on your mind?\u201d Obviously the tone of the meeting was already set. Still, Larry forged ahead, wanting to get the grievances he and his friends had out in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis game sucks!\u201d he said, coming right to the point. \u201cMe and my friends are all pilots. We didn\u2019t sign up to be infantry and prison guards. We signed up on \u2018Battle for Volgograd\u2019 because it was air combat. Only for the last two weeks we\u2019ve done nothing sit around and guard prisoners. If we wanted that we would have joined the <i>\u2018Called to Battle Duty\u2019</i> server.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander just shook his head with a sad smile. \u201cYou must realize that at this point in the war our side faced severe equipment shortages. And since you lost your entire flight when you messed up your last bombing mission, we don\u2019t have the planes for you to fly right now. That\u2019s just the realism built into the game.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLarry wasn\u2019t buying it \u201cI don\u2019t care shit about realism.\u201d He said \u201cWe signed up on an air combat game server, expecting to fly air combat. Instead of flying we\u2019re guarding prisoners and slogging through mud to loot bombed out trucks and supply trains. The closest thing we\u2019ve been to a fucking airplane in the last week is watching the Germans fly patrol overhead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander\u2019s smile changed. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t issue equipment I don\u2019t have. But, if you and your friends are interested, I just may have the solution to this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander\u2019s solution was simple. Since currently the Russian supply of equipment was so limited as to be almost non existent, they would re-equip by raiding the enemy. Which was how Larry and the rest of Bulldog Squadron ended up bouncing around their way across the frozen countryside in the back of a transport truck. The Bulldogs, as well as about 20 other pilots turned grunts in four additional trucks, had gone through their meager equipment and kitted themselves out as best as they could for the mission. Larry hated the cold, so he wore his warmest coat and hat. Others went for mobility and dressed accordingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir target, a previously unmolested German airfield, was fairly small; Only about two dozen bombers and half as many fighters, relatively unprotected. It was also close enough to their base to make it easy to reach by ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan was to attack just after the Germans were snuggled into their beds. After the ground force was in position Grizzly Squadron would fly over and drop about half dozen bombs on the maintenance hangers to wake them up and draw them out. Then Bulldog squad, Team Mongoose, The Loosey Goosey\u2019s, and whatever the other two squads were calling themselves would lay down sniper and machine gun on the confused Germans as they came running out to man their planes. Once those were dealt with, they\u2019d mop up, load up all the wounded and captured prisoners into the trucks, then take the German\u2019s fancy planes and fly them back to the Pitomnik airfield to be painted and added to the glorious people\u2019s air force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good plan, Larry had decided, hiding a happy grin. It promised everything he wanted in a war. Or at least one where he was stuck on the ground. The ambushing of a confused enemy, Wholesale mayhem and slaughter, and a chance to capture and fly the high performance German BF109 that he\u2019d always wound up on the wrong side of. Larry liked the plan so much, he was still grinning when the truck screeched to a stop and they unloaded, not in the dark forest clearing as the briefing had lead him to expect, but in the middle of a tented compound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face fell as he and his friends looked around. There was a lot of smoke, and a few fires smoldering in the distance. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on? He shouted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the men that had been on the truck with him also stood around equally confused. Then someone from the front truck started shouting \u201cSearch the tents! Take prisoners!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, the Germans hadn\u2019t been lured out yet, he decided. That was bad. That meant they were still inside where they had been sleeping. And there was no way in hell they were still asleep after all the noise being made out here. Shit, any moment the shooting would start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there!\u201d Whoever was up in front was screaming. \u201cSearch those damned tents already! Capture the survivors\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Larry started directing the men from his truck down the row of tents. Bulldog Squadron cooperated without question, heading towards the tents he indicated.  But when he tried to do the same with the others he ran into trouble. Goose Company flatly refused to follow his directions and took off towards the big tent at the far end of the compound. The others, seeing this to mean there was no real command structure, decided it was every man for himself and took of in other directions. Swearing after them had no effect, so Larry turned and headed towards the row of tents that his friends were methodically searching, as the rest of the raid collapsed into a disorganized m\u00eal\u00e9e of random shouting and door kicking, with the occasional shot ringing out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first couple of tents he broke into were empty. Completely. No tables or furniture or anything. Just tent shells along the pathway. The third had a bunch of tables stacked in it, but was otherwise also empty. Before he could break down the door of the forth George came running up. <br>\r\n\u201cWe got one Larry\u201d he said excitedly \u201cA prisoner. We got one. Oh Larry, you gotta see the one we got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>George lead Larry to one of the tents they\u2019d been searching. This one was obviously the officers club, judging from the way the tables had been set up. There was a bar made out of an engine cowling, one of theirs by the look of it. Also an icebox, a juke box, lamps, comfortable looking chairs, and a bar maid with big bosoms dressed in the traditional German waitress outfit. Over the bar was a glowing <b><i>OFFNEN</i></b> sign. Something about the cheery redness of the lettering lead him to believe it said the bar was open. As he stood there, looking around, the barmaid came up and smiled, asking him something. In German, naturally. Having no idea what she said, he angrily brushed her away and turned back to the rest of Bulldog squad. \u201cWhere is the prisoner?\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s her\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Larry looked back in disbelief. \u201cA bar maid?\u201d That\u2019s your prisoner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d said George, a stupid grin on his face \u201cCaptured at great risk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat risk?\u201d Larry shook his head \u201cThe only great risk here is presenting her to the commander as a prisoner. Where are the others?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill searching, I guess.\u201d George shrugged.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI meant the other prisoners!\u201d Larry shouted in annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge shrugged again, his hands open in an empty gesture. \u201cThere are no others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean there are no others? We\u2019re on an enemy base! How can there not be any others?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody here!\u201d Greg said as he and Fred came into the tent. \u201cThese tents are all empty. Nothing but empty storage shelves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIf the tent\u2019s have storage shelves, they\u2019re not empty\u201d Fred put in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others looked at him. \u201cJust saying you can\u2019t call something empty if there\u2019s something in it.\u201d He continued. \u201cAnd not all the storage shelves are empty. Every fifth shelf has a box on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Greg. \u201cI looked in a few. They\u2019re full of car parts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re on an airbase, so I suspect those would be aircraft parts.\u201d Fred said. \u201cAnd scattered among them will be the occasional box of universal ammo and maybe a first aid kit. Or a ration pack. That\u2019s how things work in these games.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFile that under good to know, Fred.\u201d Larry said, not quite sarcastically \u201cIf we were in the middle of a pitched tent to tent fire fight. Which we are not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we could be!\u201d Fred shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave any of you heard any gunfire since we got here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They all looked at each other. \u201cNow that you mention it\u2026\u201d Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe answer is no. The only ones shooting are those boneheads breaking into tents out there. That\u2019s because this whole camp is empty\u201d Larry said, leaping to the most obvious answer. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here but empty tents and this NPC!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know she\u2019s an NPC?\u201d George said. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s a player. Wouldn\u2019t that make her a valid prisoner?\u201d At that they all turned to look at the bar maid, still standing where they\u2019d left her in the middle of the room. She was swaying slightly, a vapid look on her face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Larry spat, his voice a mixture of contempt and sarcasm. \u201cShe\u2019s one of their pilots. Probably the squadrons ace player.\u201d His voice rose half an octave in anger \u201cYou can tell because that\u2019s the way the Germans always dress when they\u2019re off duty!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLarry stalked over to the bar maid. \u201cHey!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhere\u2019s all the fucking pilots? Huh? Where\u2019s all the fucking planes?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNot that he expected to get an answer. He was just mad and had to take it out on someone. Mad at the camp for being empty. Mad at the commander who\u2019d sold him on this mission. Mad at himself for being mad. <br>\r\n.<br>\r\nOf course she cringed back, frightened. What did he expect? Still angry, he turned and threw up on hand. He had meant it merely as a dismissive gesture, and was just as surprised as everyone else when he felt it connect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar maid gave a startled cry and fell back, stumbling into the table, grabbing it to stop herself from falling to the floor. Larry stood there, half in shock at what had happened. He had never struck a woman before, no matter how mad he had been. It was just something you didn\u2019t do. Defensively the irrational anger he had at himself for doing this turned towards her. \u201cYour own fault,\u201d he screamed \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for standing too close!\u201d Even as he yelled this, Larry knew the words to be false. But they came out, none the less. And like bullets, words fired in anger cannot be recalled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anger washed out of Larry at the realization of what he\u2019d done. He\u2019d broken the pact he\u2019d made when he was 10, watching his father and mother fight. Numbly, he watched as the bar maid rose haughtily to her feet, then deliberately turned her back to him and walked over to the bar. Was she going for a weapon? Some instinct for self preservation kicked in and his head cleared. Larry un-holstered his pistol and cocked it, just in case. Behind him he could hear his friends ready their own weapons. Perhaps, there would be a fire fight after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she turned and gave him a look that spoke volumes about the stupidity of the situation, of what they were all ready to do. Slowly, deliberately she reached up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd shut off the \u2018OFFNEN\u2019 sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Larry thought, letting out the breath he hadn\u2019t realized he was holding. That\u2019s what she\u2019d do. Probably programmed for that action the instant there was a problem. Turning the light off meant the bar was closed. Then the good little Germans would scurry off to their little beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Better watch she doesn\u2019t do something stupid, like getting you drunk and stealing all your hard earned pay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem there, boss.\u201d George said between fits of laughter \u201cI don\u2019t work all that hard for that pay anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry angrily headed for the door. \u201cI want a couple of you to keep an eye on the place.\u201d He said, pausing just inside the door. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen so far this is the only tent worth looting, and I don\u2019t want the others to lay claim to it. And one of you search the other tents. Maybe there\u2019s something else worth taking back. I\u2019m going to see what\u2019s going on with all those planes we were supposed to be collecting.\u201d With that he pushed open the door and stalked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Larry left, the other three looked at each other for a moment. Then George grinned and said \u201cNow that he brought it up, I could use a drink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we should.\u201d Greg said \u201cTechnically we\u2019re still in the middle of an attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense.\u201d George replied, looking around \u201cLarry said we\u2019re looting now, and sampling the spoils is a big part of your basic looting process.\u201d He made his way over to the bar. The bar maid was too busy cleaning up the glass from the spilled drink tray to notice him until he started digging through the ice, looking for what was buried inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she noticed him she ran back to the bar, jabbering away, and slapped away the hand he\u2019d dared touch her ice with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was shocked, and began to bluster. Before he got started though, Frank let out a laugh. \u201cThreatening her isn\u2019t going to work, you know.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? We\u2019re the conquering army. Doesn\u2019t she realize we have the right to do anything we want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve played enough of these games to know that threats only work against Civilians and Criminals. With shop keepers you need to negotiate and barter. Otherwise nothing happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about her being a shop keeper,\u201d George said thoughtfully. \u201cShe\u2019s in the middle of a German base here. That says soldier to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got another chuckle out of Frank. \u201cSure,\u201d he said, \u201cIf you overlook a few minor details, like the short skirt and a corset. And serving beer in what\u2019s obviously some German pub. I\u2019d say there\u2019s a pretty good chance her NPC class is either shop keeper or camp follower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour reasoning is sound,\u201d George said, rubbing his chin. \u201cBut how can you prove it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOffer her money\u201d Frank said \u201cSee what happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge pulled a bill out of his pocket, one of the single chervonet ruple bills the men passed around. Not worth a whole lot, it generally took 2 of them to buy you a decent cup of coffee at the company mess. As expected, the woman just frowned at it when he handed it to her, so he handed her another. She stood there, holding them up to the light suspiciously. He sighed and dug out a half dozen more. To his surprise, the woman took the bills, separated out two of them, then tucked the rest into her blouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d He heard Frank laugh from the door as the woman pulled a beer out of the ice box and handed it to him. George just grinned and took a sip of the beer. It was cold, and bitter, and the best thing he\u2019d drank in weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank leaned his gun against a table, pulling out a couple of bills of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuy\u2019s,\u201d Greg said nervously, looking out the door. \u201cDo you really think we should be doing this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d George said, belching and holding up another two bills. \u201cNot only do I think it\u2019s a good idea, I think it\u2019s a good idea for all of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the three of us should be getting drunk on duty\u201d Greg stammered nervously.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat duty?\u201d George said as he downed the second, taking only slightly longer this time. \u201cWe\u2019re looting. And besides, I wasn\u2019t talking about just the three of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d asked Greg<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch as I make the Bulldogs the most popular squad on base.

She can\u2019t even make change, she just counts the bills. Can\u2019t even tell what they are. Give her two singles and you get a beer.

I don\u2019t think the Germans use coin, so she\u2019s not programmed to recognize them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon was watching the bar maid speculatively as she moved from table to table, passing out drinks and swatting away the occasional hand that tried to get overly familiar with her. \u201cFunny how she\u2019s programmed to wait tables but doesn\u2019t recognize money. Are you sure she\u2019s an NPC?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge nodded. \u201cA real girl would figure the money out quick enough.\u201d He reasoned. \u201cAnd what girl would let people grab her butt like that?

Those girls size you up the moment you walk in, and what you get away with depends on how much cash you\u2019ve got. This one? She\u2019s like talking to a piece of furniture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon nodded again, still watching as the bar maid served a nearby table.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Larry was stalking angrily across the compound, muttering about the unbelievable stupidity of the whole thing. The timing had been screwed up royally. Grizzly squadron had taken off at the same time the trucks left. Of course they were faster and had arrived early, way before the ground troops were in position. And then, instead of blowing up a couple of non essential work sheds like they were supposed to, they had proceeded to bomb the hell out of the base, destroying anything that moved. Planes, trucks, jeeps. If it moved they had hit it. Then they had gone home to bed, leaving only a twisted smoldering scrap yard to greet the loot hungry ground troops who arrived 3 hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe precious planes were twisted junk. All the fuel and ammunition was burnt. Any surviving Germans were long gone, probably loaded up any guns they could carry and moved in with Aunt Gertrude up the road. It looked like the only thing they would be getting out of the raid was whatever they found in that small collection of empty untouched tents they\u2019d started at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trucks were sitting there half loaded when he got back from his survey, with only a few men attended them, wandering back and forth and occasionally loading a box into a truck. \u201cWhere the hell is everyone?\u201d he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the men pointed. The answer was obvious. Sputtering angrily, he stormed towards the laughter he could hear coming from the tent where the Bulldogs had found the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry stormed through the door. \u201cWhat the fuck are you guys doing?\u201d he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re looting\u201d someone yelled, to much laughter from the rest of the crowd. After the laughing died down a bit Larry stalked over to the bar, turning the OFFNEN sign off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what gives?\u201d someone asked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you guys remember the plan\u201d? Larry yelled back. We need to load the trucks and get out of here. They\u2019re going to bomb this place again in 30 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the men got up immediately and rushed out, others were more casual, figuring there was still lots of time. Still, before 5 minutes had passed the men were all back out in the cold, loading whatever they could into the backs of the trucks. Most of it was from the big mess tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs George was leaving he pulled Larry aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about a bombing? I don\u2019t remember that being part of the plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it got that bunch of louts moving again, didn\u2019t it.\u201d Larry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the Bulldogs had laid claim to the bar, Larry had their truck back up to the door so they could load the furnishings. He still wasn\u2019t sure how much, if any, of this he was going to get this passed the commander, but there was no harm in trying. The first thing to load up was the big juke box, and he got a couple of men on that task at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course that bar maid started giving them grief the moment they touched it. Annoyed, he pulled out his pistol, more to scare her off than shoot her. Shooting a woman was a line he had yet to cross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet George must have thought he was really going to shoot her as he flung himself between them and grabbed is arm, yelling at him not to shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s gotten into you!\u201d Larry demanded, shaking him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t shoot her.\u201d George said, putting himself between Larry and the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hell I can\u2019t\u201d Larry stated. He wasn\u2019t about to admit that he wouldn\u2019t. But can\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t were two very different words, and he wasn\u2019t about to admit that weakness in front of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t kill her. She\u2019s valuable.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a player, she\u2019s a useless NPC.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s the only one who can pull beer out of the ice box.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave Larry a pause. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry it.\u201d George insisted \u201cGrab a beer for yourself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry did so, opening the ice box and rummaging around. Other than ice, there was nothing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you guys drank all the beer on me. Thanks a bunch.\u201d He said bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s a bar tending thing. Here, watch this.\u201d He pulled out a couple of bills and handed them to Larry.\u201d Larry looked at them, puzzled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive them to her.\u201d George said. Larry put the bills on the table, pushing them towards the bar maid with the barrel of the pistol he\u2019d forgotten he still had in his right hand. She looked at him for a moment, puzzled. Then took the money and went over to the empty icebox and pulled out a cold beer he would swear wasn\u2019t there a moment ago, handing it to him. For a couple of moments he just stood there, gun in one hand, beer in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee.\u201d George said, \u201cShe\u2019s part of the system. As long as you give her money she gives you beer. Without her the ice box is just a box of ice. Less than worthless in the middle of Siberia here. She has to come along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry shook his head. \u201cWe can\u2019t take an NPC as a prisoner. The Commander will kill us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a prisoner.\u201d George pointed out \u201cShe\u2019s captured equipment. A part of the beer serving machine, don\u2019t you see\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry thought for a second, then came to a decision. \u201cYou have a point. Okay, load everything up. Take her, but keep her quiet. If the commander finds out he won\u2019t see it the same way I do, and we\u2019ll all be shot at dawn.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead two of the soldiers bound her hands behind her back. When she started yelling at them in protest one of them grabbed a table cloth and tore a couple of strips out of it, wadding one between her teeth, tying the other over it and behind her head. Bound and gagged, she was loaded into the truck like a side of beef. One of the soldiers took the opportunity to cop a feel in a most inappropriate place, laughing when she tried to kick him. In short order she found herself stacked in with the rest of the looted furnishings. A few minutes later five soldiers climbed into the back with her as the engine rumbled to life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truck lurched forward several meters, only to come to a stop just as they exited the 123rd's compound. With her back against the cab she watched the rest of the line of trucks snake their way passed her until the compound was empty. Her last look showed her a forlorn and miserable looking huddle of tents and sheds, their doors broken and leaning, contents scattered. Then a flare screamed past them, and all the tents and sheds she had called home exploded into flames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the truck she was in started moving again, carrying her away into captivity as her burning home receded into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the bar equipment the Russians had looted there was barely room for Lindsay and the 5 soldiers she had to share the ride with. They were all jammed up against the cab trying to shelter from the icy air that blew in around the canvas tarp that covered the back. A couple of them, part of the group that had first burst in on her, saw her shivering so one of the wrapped a blanket around her, then wrapped another blanket around them both. The others joined suit, and soon all of them huddled under a mountain of blankets, no doubt swiped earlier from the 127th, as the truck ground its way through the freezing night.<br>\r\nIt was almost three and a half hour when the truck finally came to a stop and everybody jumped out. Everybody but Lindsay, that is. When she started to struggle to get up one soldier pushed her back down where she was sitting, pointing a finger at her in an unmistakable gesture to stay. Lindsay settled back down, trying to capture the last remaining warmth in the blankets, joints aching in protest over the broken promise of some exercise. Fortunately she didn\u2019t have to wait too long, the truck started moving again almost immediately, turning and backing up. When the canvas was thrown back and Lindsay stopped blinking in the harsh glare of the single flood lamp shining onto the load she could see the truck had backed up to an improvised loading ramp. Some of the barrels looted from the 127th were stacked along the back wall, while boxes and crates were being hand carried through wide timber doors into the dark cavern beyond. Several soldiers Lindsay recognized from the group that had been drinking in the Gasthaus earlier started unloading; dragging all the bar furnishings, including her, through the door and inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay didn\u2019t get much of a chance to look around the cavern. By the time her eyes had adjusted from the sodium lamp glare to the lack of light the soldier leading her shoved her into a store room and closed the heavy wooden door, plunging her into even deeper darkness. As she stood there in the dark she heard the sound of a heavy key in the lock behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was warmer than she would have expected, but still too cool to be standing around dressed as she was. Moving around wasn\u2019t really an option, the room was crowded and she kept bumping into things, and with her hands tied as they were it was hard to keep her balance. There didn\u2019t seem to be anywhere she could find to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the door opened again she was shivering once more in the cooling air. The soldier looking in didn\u2019t look too pleased to see this. She could hear him yelling through the door as he moved away. Then he was back, carrying a blanket that he draped over her. Then he pulled out a knife and cut the ropes holding her hands and arms before leaving and locking the door again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had rubbed some feeling back into her numb fingers she started to feel around her prison. In the dark she wasn\u2019t able to locate anything she could use as a weapon, at least not one that would help her escape from a dark locked store room in the middle of what she assumed was Russian held territory. At least with her hands free she was able to create a place to sit while she waited for what ever happened next. And clutch the blanket around her for warmth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later the door opened again. This time the soldier had an electric lamp on a cord that he hung up, illuminating the room. As soon as he did this more soldiers, the same ones that had unloaded the truck it looked to Lindsay, swarmed in and began hauling away the looted furniture. Handing a box to Lindsay, the guy that had hung up the light and given her a blanket gestured for her to follow the other men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The line of men snaked their way across the crate strewn cavern to a set of stairs that lead upwards into a massive network of carved stone tunnels and corridors. If she hadn\u2019t been following someone else she would have been uncharacteristically lost in the dizzying maze, which she wouldn\u2019t have minded, and which the soldiers were obviously there to prevent. At last, they entered a largish stone room lined with shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Earlier that night, after the raiding party returned to base, the commander had called for Larry to update him on the raid. He had asked Larry to meet him in the planning room instead of his office, which surprised Larry a little. Normally debriefing reports occurred in the commanders office. Still, the commander wanted the report soon as they\u2019d returned, so Larry headed off to the planning room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander was bent over a topographical map of the local area when Larry came in, studying reports and moving small models into new positions. He looked up when Larry knocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Comrade Ivantobitch. Welcome home. I trust the raid was successful?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuccessful? Hardly\u201d Larry said \u201cTry Disaster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many planes did you capture?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZero.\u201d The commander looked puzzled, so Larry continued \u201cZilch. Nada. Not a one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander looked disappointed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t capture any?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere were no planes on that airfield.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you look?\u201d the commander asked. \u201cIntelligence reports say that airfield had a strength of 16 BF109G fighters, as well as 24 Henkle 111 bombers. In addition at least eight FW190s were delivered yesterday. Surely you would have managed to capture something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry rolled his eyes \u201cLet me rephrase my answer. There were no planes on that airfield that had not been turned into scrap metal by the air strike three hours before we got there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. Prisoners? How many Germans players did we capture?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne for each plane we brought back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I thought you said\u2026? Ah! Your famed sarcasm. I should have known.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commanders calm attitude was beginning to irritate Larry, and his demeanor slipped a little. \u201cDamn right you should have known. The whole fucking raid was FUBAR from the moment Grizzly squad screwed up the timing and took off at the same time we did. They got there way before we did and blew the shit out of everything.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I give you a mission to raid an undefended German airfield and capture as many planes and prisoners as possible. You come back and tell me you managed to capture exactly zero planes and zero prisoners. Not a very impressive looking report to send to command.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe captured all we could. From my perspective I would have to report that our secondary ground attack captured 100% of the men and equipment still available. And we destroyed all parts of the German airbase that the air attack missed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander looked at Larry, questioningly \u201cSo that\u2019s your report?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith all due respect, we were still three hours away when Grizzly squadron started bombing. By the time we got there any players still alive had bugged out and most of the airfield was a smoldering garbage dump. Anything we got was from an isolated collection of tents the bombs missed. My report is the only way I can think of to put a positive angle on the fiasco.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that was unfortunate. The intent was that you would be able to capture the planes and fly again. Unfortunately, it looks like some of the attacking squadron was a little too enthusiastic, and, as you said blew the shit out of everything. Still, accidents happen. I\u2019m sure that the next raid will go much better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry shook his head. \u201cYou can count Bulldog squad out. The only reason most of them agreed to take part in this raid was because we were promised captured planes and equipment in return for being the ground troops. Then we get there and discovered the place was destroyed. No planes, no guns, no ammo, no fuel. We did our part, and we got nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, you were promised a share of the loot for bringing back prisoners, which you didn\u2019t do. But you did get, what, three truck loads of loot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, if you want to call it that. Turns out most of it was food from the German mess hall. A lot of it the men won\u2019t touch, so we\u2019ll either toss it out or give it to the cooks to feed to the prisoners. The rest of it was tin trays, pots, pans. cutlery, that sort of stuff. Cooking and serving equipment mainly. And some pub furniture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything of use to the war effort?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPossibly. The men won\u2019t like the food but it\u2019s a change. Some furniture we could use to set up a place for them to relax. There\u2019s also something that looks like it could be a still.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander shook his head. \u201cAnd do we really need another one of those?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s on in the officer\u2019s latrine yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo a whole lot of garbage then?\u201d the commander said, going back to his models.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the point in the conversation Larry had been waiting for. \u201cI was thinking we could clean out one of the crypts and set up the pub furniture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander looked up \u201cWhatever for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen the boys will have their own bar to drink at. Sort of a place to go to relax when they are off duty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure having a company pub is such a good idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe men are Russian, so they\u2019re going to drink anyway. Right now they\u2019re hanging around the town or building bonfires in the woods. This gives them a place to go that\u2019s underground and out of sight. If we give them that as a reward, they will see it as a positive outcome of the raid and moral would improve. And they will be more willing to participate in the next raid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll excellent points.\u201d The commander said, somewhat distractedly \u201cVery well, if you think it will help then by all means do it. Clean out whatever crypt you think best suits your needs, then take what you need from the captured supplies and build your little pub. You will have to stock it yourself I\u2019m afraid, but that is another incentive for the men to go raiding the Germans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry grinned as he left the debriefing. It had actually worked out better than he had thought. Now all he needed to do was decide which crypt to commandeer. And detail a work party to clean it. He was thinking the currently well rested Grizzly Squadron would be an ideal choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now that everything was neat and tidy the lack of sleep was catching up on him, and would hit him hard in a few minutes.<br>\r\nWith this in mind he headed for the barracks level, intending to grab a few hours sleep. But first, there was no reason he couldn\u2019t get things put in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Almost as if by providence, when he entered the small mess hall adjacent to where the Bulldogs had their bunks, he saw someone he knew could be trusted to carry out orders with a relatively competent level of success. Sammy the Squirrel they called him. Samuel had the ability to grasp what you wanted to accomplish and figure ways to get it done with only limited supervision, right up until he got distracted by one of the innumerable side quests the game kept throwing at him. Nobody was as good at stumbling across the little optional missions hidden in a game as Sam was, and as a result his locker was loaded with enough optional gear to outfit a platoon. Oddly enough, Sam rarely got distracted on a side quest, finishing each one completely before returning to his original job. If you were lucky he would finish that before another challenge rolled his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Larry laid out the plans, Sam listened with growing enthusiasm, and was more than happy to take on the task of starting the project while Larry got some shut eye. Larry watched Sam tear off to wake up the Grizzly Squad. Even if Sam got distracted, he figured, the chances are he\u2019d get enough of the work started that Larry could pick up where he left off with no problems. And with any luck, building the bar would turn out to be a side quest in itself for Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this arranged Larry made his way to his billet and dropped heavily into his cot, falling asleep the minute his shoes were off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The room they had lead Lindsay into was very large, with shelves lining every square inch of wall space, and seemed to be carved from stone. Arches of stone swooped up and across the low, dome shaped rough stone roof. Standing in the middle of the room was a soldier she\u2019d never seen before, obviously the officer in charge judging by his cap, and the way the other soldiers sneered at him behind his back as he imperiously shouted directions to the soldiers who were doing the actual work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one corner was a grey pile of rocks and sticks one of the soldiers was scooping up into a wheelbarrow.  Against the other wall the line of soldiers were dropping the crates and furniture they\u2019d looted from the 127th. Someone had already set up the LaGG cowl against the wall. Lindsay had a sinking feeling when she realized the Russians were setting up their own pub using the looted furnishings. And she was pretty sure who they had in mind to tend the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was quite a bit larger than the Gasthaus tent, and the Russians filled the extra room by adding several solidly built trestle tables and a few heavy, comfortable looking arm chairs that looked solid enough to serve as cover if anyone started shooting. Luckily, Lindsay wasn\u2019t asked to help arrange any of it. Judging from the straining expressions the soldiers were exhibiting it took a lot of effort to move one of those tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier who had handed Lindsay the box to carry now took it back from her as she stood there, then handed her a broom. At first she just looked at it, not really believing what was happening. A sharp barked order from the officer spurred her to action and she started sweeping the middle of the room. After a few moments the watching officer slapped her roughly on the shoulder and pointed to the far corner, indicating she should start there. There was no mistaking the disdain on his face as he looked at her, a bar maid too stupid to sweep a room properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Lindsay started sweeping the accumulated dust and debris, pushing it into a pile. Every once in a while, when the pile was big enough, the soldier with the shovel would come by and scoop it into his wheelbarrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The second time he did this one of the rocks fell out of the soldier\u2019s wheelbarrow as he was pushing it towards her, landing with a hollow <i>Thock</i> to bounce and roll across the floor, stopping at Lindsay\u2019s feet. Lindsay was just thinking how the hollow pits in the rock made it look like a skull when, with a small shock, she realized that was exactly what she was looking at. What she thought were rocks and sticks were human bones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, she took actual note of the items she was sweeping up. In addition to the dirt and twigs, there were scraps of rotted cloth and small bits of yellowy white gravel, or what she thought was gravel until she realized that they were actually teeth. Here and there was also the occasional bit of corroded metal. When she bent over to pick one up and try to identify it a sharp blow to her butt and an evil glare from the soldier in charge reminded her that she wasn\u2019t there on her own time. After that she ignored anything glittery and just swept. When she finished, as a reward for doing a good job sweeping, they graciously allowed her to mop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the floor and shelves were clean, and the soldiers got the furniture arranged the way they wanted. As the rest of the soldiers settled into the chairs, the one in charge indicated Lindsay should start serving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously he was wanting to buy the first round, handing Lindsay a bank note of a type she\u2019d never seen before. Not knowing what the note was worth, Lindsay shook her head, pushed the bill back at him, and held up 2 fingers, falling back on the exchange system established, oh so many hours ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer wasn\u2019t happy about this, and said something angrily. Back and forth they went until Lindsay turned away. Tired, with her back and shoulders already aching from hours of pushing the broom mop around, Lindsay retreated towards the bar and sat down. The officer followed her, slapping the bill on the bar and talking angrily a mile a minute. Lindsay wasn\u2019t in the mood, and just shook her head, holding up two fingers. Let someone else serve for a change, she thought, as she leaned back and closed her eyes. She didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a minutes discussion, it got quiet, then she heard someone calling as they rapped on the bar. Stifling a yawn, she opened her eyes.  The officer was no where to be seen. Instead, standing at the bar with a pile of bank notes spread in front of him stood Blanket Guy (That\u2019s what she\u2019d decided to call the soldier who had cut her free and given her a blanket it the store room earlier.) With an ear to ear grin he started counting the notes out in twos. If it had been the officer she might have decided not to bother, or that the price was now three bills, just for the hassle. But something about blanket guy\u2019s earnestly goofy expression changed her mind and she started pulling beers out of the ice box. These were quickly snapped up and passed around the tables by the soldiers, who began to laugh and talk among themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out the officer hadn\u2019t left as she first thought. Instead he had seated himself at a table along the far wall. She didn\u2019t realize he was there until she heard him growled out something that brought all noise in the room to a stop and turned the good nature conversation into grumbles of discontent. Sullenly, the soldiers finished their drinks and filed out of the room. As the last of the men left the officer got up, and without even bothering a glance in her direction, followed through the door after them, pulling it closed behind him. As Lindsay started towards the door she heard the rattle of a key in the lock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing to the door, she confirmed that she was once again locked in. At least this time there were lights on. She turned to explore the room, looking for another way out, but finding none. Just as she\u2019d given up she heard the door being unlocked. Once again Blanket Guy was there, holding a couple of blankets which he handed over with an apologetic look, before turning and closing the door behind himself as he left. And again she heard the sound of a key in the lock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, she thought later, curling up on the hearth of the gigantic Russian stove the soldiers had somehow contrived to fit into one corner of the room. At least she wouldn\u2019t freeze to death. The bricks and stone of the stove, heated by the roaring fire the soldiers had built earlier, radiated a comfortable warmth through the blanket she\u2019d laid down as a sleeping pad. A warmth that almost made the top blanket unnecessary.  <br>\r\nTired out from the events of the day, she was sound asleep before she\u2019d finished the beer she\u2019d pulled for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The dimly lit rock cavern she was in brought her home to the reality of the present. It hadn\u2019t been a dream. She really had been captured, driven to God knows where and press ganged into a group of enemy infantry as a mere waitress. At least she hoped that was all she was supposed to be. A shudder ran through her as she realized just how dire her predicament was. There were a lot more things female prisoner could be used for, and most of them were far less pleasant than being a waitress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay pushed back the thin blanket that covered her, knocking over the stein she\u2019d been drinking from the night before. It fell of the hearth to shatter on the cold stone floor, flooding the immediate area with a large puddle of ceramic shards and stale beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay ignored the puddle for now, concentrating on finding her clothes instead. Fortunately she didn\u2019t have to look far. During her sleep the game had removed all the stains and dirt her Dirndl Kjole had collected from yesterday\u2019s activities, and the small rips and tears patched and sewn. Now, cleaned and mended; the dress hung over the back of a nearby chair. The rest of her clothing was folded on the seat, all neatly pressed. Her shoes, one of the pairs the Colonel had brought back for her from Voroshilovgrad, sat polished on the floor in front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least it wasn\u2019t her duty uniform, she thought with some relief. That would have made it very awkward to try and maintain her cover while she worked out a way to escape from this place. Then she realized something. This WAS her duty uniform, now. That thought threatened to depress her even further, so she firmly pushed it aside and quickly dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecently attired, her hair once again pleated into two ponytails, she began to explore the room, giving it an even more thorough investigation that she had last night.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The morning\u2019s investigation revealed little more than it had the night before. None of the low wide shelves had the decency to conceal a hidden switch that caused a secret panel to swing open when she pressed it. The wall mounted candle holders proved equally disappointing, steadfastly refusing to open any hidden corridors no matter how she twisted or turned them.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like the only exits from the room were the three iron banded oak doors she could see. The largest one at the front of the room, where the men had exited the night before, she knew from last night would be locked from the out side. Testing proved this to be the case, so she explored the other two. One of the smaller ones at the back of the room lead to a small chamber, lined with more of those large wide stone shelves that who ever built the place was so fond of Lindsay wondered if these were bunks. They were certainly the right size and shape for someone to lay on. Although there would need to be a good mattress, she decided after seeing the roughness of the carved surface, a thick soft one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was currently being used for storage. Crates and boxes bearing identification of the 127rd  mess hall lined the long wide shelves, piled in that haphazard fashion  that tells you the person doing the job wasn\u2019t really that interested in doing a good job, just in doing what they were told so they can be finished. Moving these boxes and tapping on the walls revealed there were no hollow spaces hiding behind them, and served to only knock down more of the dust that soon coated her in a thin film. Other than that dust the only thing she came out of the room with was a box of tea, which she had swiped for her breakfast. <br>\r\nDipping into the water barrel, she filled the kettle and put it onto the stove. While she waited for it to heat she explored the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last room turned out to be what books about old castles called a garderobe; A tiny, not much more than a closet size room with a simple hole in the floor and a bench over it for relieving oneself. The hole was old and, judging from the lack of smell, hadn\u2019t been used in some time. That would change, she realized, as soon as the soldiers started to make use of the Pub. It was also only about 6 inches in diameter. Lots of room if you were a snake or a rat, but totally useless to someone of her size. That is, unless you wanted to use it for its intended purpose, to which Lindsay put it to now. She was gratefully to have discovered it was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a tiny stand below the cracked mirror in the corner behind the door, barely big enough for the stone basin and jug, obviously placed there so a person could, if they felt so inclined, wash their hands after using the facilities. As it had been a crew of men how were setting the place up, of course there was no water in the jug. Not a problem, Lindsay thought, there was plenty of water heating on the stove. <br>\r\nDipping hot water into the basin she grabbed a rag from the bar and carried it back into the small room. After freshening up everything that needed to be, she emptied the soiled water down the waste hole and set about tidying up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blankets she folded and tucked on a shelf in the store room. Her spilled beer she moped up, dumping the shards of mug into a bucket under the bar. By this time the kettle was boiling, so she made herself a cup of tea and sat down to think about how she was going to get out of this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Obviously not happy he slapped Lindsay and gestured around the room. Confused, Lindsay gathered up the few empty bottles from the tables and tidied up, hoping that was what the officer was after. Although not particularly happy, the officer seemed mollified with her efforts. He obviously thought he was in charge, judging from the way he turned the bar light on and theatrically opened the door. What ever he was calling this little impromptu pub, it was now open for business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening passed quickly. Thirsty soldiers filtered in, eager for the drinking and entertainment they\u2019d been promised. As the night wore on and the men became rowdier she was hard pressed to keep up serving drinks. Not to mention that, as the men got drunker, more and more of them felt entitled to put their hands were they weren\u2019t invited, or appreciated. And through it all, the officer who seemed to have made himself in charge sat at the bar and drank. At first, he seemed to think he was entitled to free drinks for some reason, but when Lindsay refused to serve him unless he paid he just shrugged and opened a jar on the bar closer to him. He\u2019d been selling some sort of raffle tickets, putting the money into the jar. Now he dipped into that jar, carefully selecting bills to pay for his drinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, just when Lindsay didn\u2019t think it could get any rowdier without a fight breaking out, a fight did break out. Five or six men were arguing at a table, and while she was trying to serve a group nearby one of the men started throwing punches. Several others joined in, including some from the group she was serving. Before long a group of military police came in and arrested everyone involved and clearing out the rest of the bar, shutting is down. The overly entitled officer yelled and swore at them, but did not get them to change their mind. In frustration, after everyone left, he slapped her face, hard, and then locked her in again.<br>\r\n'Seriously?' Lindsay thought, dabbing her split lip with her apron, 'what is with Russian Officers and their habit of slapping women?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was a disaster, and she was aching from the scrapes and bruises picked up during her escape from the brawl. Not to mention the painful cuts on her face from the rings that pig of an officer was wearing. She thought about cleaning up, but decided she was too tired and hungry. Instead, she dug out one of the captured med kits that she\u2019d seen in the storage area, and applied a thin film of the healing ointment to her injuries. Then she drew herself a beer and curled up in her blankets on the hearth again, wistfully dreaming of escape and revenge.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When she woke up, she had no idea what time it was. Her internal clock was totally messed up by everything she\u2019d suffered through, and it could have been mid- morning, or after noon, or early evening for all she knew. She did know she was staving, almost shaking from hunger. She needed food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just finished searching all the cupboards of the bar, finding nothing that resembled food, when she heard the lock rattle and the door to the pub slash her cell opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer was back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strolled in casually, like he was entering his own living room, completely at home. His jacket was open and she could see that his shirt as well was undone and disheveled. Like he had just gotten out of bed and hadn\u2019t taken the time to dress properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  There was an apple in his hand. Briefly she wondered where he had gotten an apple in the middle of winter, but didn\u2019t dwell on the question much. Something about the way he looked around the room when he got far enough in to get a clear view of the place terrified her into motionlessness. His eyes narrowed, but he didn\u2019t say anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unconsciously took a step back as he started across the room to where she was standing, but to her relief he didn\u2019t come all the way, stopping at one of the heavy tables close by and seating himself where he could watch her. From his belt he pulled that very large and wicked looking knife, using it to peel the apple in a slow and deliberately manner. Not in one long coil, like you would expect a normal person to. He pealed it as if it was a potato, slicing off small discs of skin that he let fall onto the table as he methodically worked his way around the fruit until it was completely denuded of any trace of the red peel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after carefully inspecting the naked fruit to make sure there was no skin left did he start to cut slices out of it, using the sharp blade to transfer the slice to his mouth, watching her as he chewed slowly and methodically. Swallowing before cutting the next piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay felt like a mouse feels when being watched by a snake. She couldn\u2019t help but watch. The sight of the apple made her mouth water, and she realized just how hungry she was, how little she\u2019d eaten since being captured. When she swallowed she saw him grin, and realized that he knew how hungry she was. That he was deliberately doing this in front of her to torment her. She pushed herself away from the wall she\u2019d unconsciously backed herself against and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her she heard him laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood by the bar and squeezed her eyes closed, breathing deeply and trying to compose herself. That was a mistake, she soon realized. As she drew in her second breath she felt his presence behind her. He must have stood up the moment she turned her back. There was an unpleasant look in his eyes and the wicked knife was still in his hand. She cringed back, but she was trapped against the bar and had no where to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his free hand he grabbed her arm, dragging her roughly out into the middle of the room and tossing her to the floor. She scrabbled to her hands and knees, as he glared at her, but he didn\u2019t move towards her like she expected. Instead he started speaking, loudly and deliberately, like he was issuing orders. Abruptly she realized he was. Each time he issued a command he pointed the knife towards one of the tables, still littered with the remains of last nights drinking. Clearly he was annoyed because she hadn\u2019t cleaned up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he did move towards her. Before she could scrabble away he was in front of her, reaching down and grabbing her face by the jaw in one massing paw, holding it steady while the knife he held was brought up until it just touched her cheek under her eye. Trembling she tried not to move, staring at the wicked tip that threatened her eye as the officer spoke a few more harsh guttural words. Then he pushed her way, hard enough that she hit the floor with a thump, and stalked away from her, back to the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerching himself on one of the stools he leaned against the bar, watching as she slowly got her feet under her. Too slow for his taste, it seemed. He shouted a word at her and slammed the knife into the bar, hard enough to half bury the blade in the wood top. At this she scrambled to her feet and began to gather up empty bottles and cups. Hauling them behind the bar to the little washing station there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother barked command made her turn, and she saw him pointing towards the ice box. No doubting what he wanted. She held up two fingers. Payment first was the rule. He just snarled and shook his head, and pointed again. No doubt about what he was saying, he didn\u2019t think he needed to pay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first reaction was to refuse. That firm resolve lasted until the second time he slapped her for shaking her head. After that she chose the path of least painfulness and brought him the beer he wanted, not surprised that he made no offer to pay when he got what he wanted. Obviously he was used to using intimidation and force to get what he wanted. She was justifiably afraid she would set a precedent of free beer. Maybe she could get him drunk enough to pass out.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she set about cleaning the tables he sat at the bar, watching her work and drinking beer. The stool he occupied was positioned so that she had to pass right by him each time to get to the sink, and after his second beer he started playfully swatting her rump each time she went passed. The first time he did so she protested. He merely grinned and patted the knife still firmly embedded in the bar. After that she tried to make as few trips passed him as possible.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe must have over built the fire when she was trying to boil the water to wash dishes with, and the big stove had made the room quite warm by the time she was done cleaning. The officer had removed his jacket and shirt, and was leaning back against the bar, bottle of beer propped on his paunch, looking for all the world like white trailer trash watching his favorite game show on television. Lindsay could easily picture him with a remote in his other hand, watching some game show in a run down double wide while eating cheese doodles and complaining about how noisy the trailer park has gotten lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat and the work and the lack of eating was getting to her. When she stood up her head started swimming and she abruptly sat down. This brought a growl from the officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStuff it.\u201d She said. \u201cI can\u2019t work any more. I\u2019m tired and I\u2019m starving. You understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer growled again, threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay just shook her head. \u201cI need something to eat.\u201d She pleaded \u201cFood. Can you understand food?\u201d She opened her mouth and pointed, hoping the gesture might help get her point across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer grinned and said something, getting to his feet. Then he started to unbuckle his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought Lindsay to her feet, tired as she was. She started to move away but wasn't fast enough. The officer moved faster, grabbing her before she had moved a step. Drunk as he was he stilled proved to be much stronger than her. Still, she struggled, which annoyed him, and with his free hand he swung a back handed blow across her face that knocked her back against the table and to the floor, dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTangling one massive, greasy paw in her hair he dragged her up onto her knees; the other paw grabbed a hold of her blouse and tore it open. His mouth split in a predatory grin as he gazed hungrily at her exposed breasts. With an ugly laugh at her cringing whimpers he finished unbuckling his belt and dropped his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them, the door swung open.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Greg pushed the rubber tire buggy, nicknamed the slop truck, down the sloping tunnel towards the dungeons below. The Gruel in the pots was actually quite tasty, just not as pleasing to the eye as the proper food served up in the mess hall was. That was one nice thing about the game. It made good food. Greg couldn\u2019t imagine that there was a professional chef in the mess hall that was making the gruel they served the prisoners, but it sure tasted that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe task of delivering the gruel to the guards responsible for feeding the prisoners was supposed to rotate equally among the other guards. Greg was of a rank above the regulars, and normally wouldn\u2019t be doing this duty, but said duty was also used as currency in their nightly game of cards. Greg had lost last night, and was making good his debt.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe long sloping tunnel would take him from the camp kitchen down to the catacombs where the prisoners were being held. It also brought him past Burial Chamber Number One that he had decided was going to be his first stop. His squad leader had convinced the brass to set the chamber up as a squadron run pub, on the argument that it would keep the men happy. Since they were being Russians, the men were going to drink anyway and it made sense to try and keep it located in one area. Plus they had all that pub equipment they had looted from that disaster of a raid on that German airbase the other night. The only decent loot in the lot really, and that was more than just Greg\u2019s opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly enough, the brass had agreed, and a surprisingly short time later they had evicted the former residents and set up a bar. Pivnaya Catacombs was what they\u2019d renamed the burial chamber they\u2019d cleaned out. Furnished with all the amenities of a beer house the squad could find, beg, borrow, steal, or otherwise scrounge together. And since almost all of it was looted from the Germans, the results were heavily on the 'Steal' side of the ledger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what the men were saying about last night, it was apparently quite a lively place. Greg had been on duty, so he hadn\u2019t had a chance to visit the pub yet, and was looking forward to seeing if it lived up to the hype. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was slightly ajar when he stopped and ladled out the first bowl of gruel for the day. Technically the bar maid was more in the category of furnishings and equipment, and not categorized as a prisoner. As equipment she didn\u2019t warrant feeding from the prison gruel truck, but the game was funny sometimes about making you take care of your stuff. The NPCs acted as realistic as hell these days, so equipment or not, she was probably starving, or at least programmed to feel like she was. If anybody asked, he would justify his actions with saying that, by feeding her, he was ensuring she would feel gratitude towards him, and he would get better service for all of Bulldog Squad because she thought they were being nice to her. Plus Greg felt that it was the decent thing to do. The thought that she was also nice to look at, and this was the perfect way to spend a little time alone with her, was a thought he refused to think. After all, she was an NPC and he told himself he didn\u2019t need that excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he pushed open the door he was startled to hear slapping noise and a woman cry out in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo people were in the room when he pushed the door open. One was the bar maid they had so carefully smuggled in the night of the raid. She was kneeling on the floor crying, while in front of her stood Dmitri.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDmitri wasn\u2019t his real name. If you had the resources and dug deep enough, like maybe just asked one of his online player friends, you would have found his given name to be Phineas. Phineas Delousa Funk. In spite of this, or maybe because of it, he had insisted his in-game name was Dmitri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDmitri the Dog the others called him behind his back. Usually with his unspoken approval. That was the way he played the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Dmitri\u2019s uniform jacket and shirt were draped over a chair, and he was standing with his pants around his knees while the half naked bar maid huddled before him, trying to hold the ruins of her dress closed.  That her dress being ruined was not of her choice or doing was made obvious by the tears streaming down her face. A face that sported a purpleing hand shaped bruise on the left side. That, and the half of her blouse that was clutched in the hands of the Dmitri. You didn\u2019t need to be a dime store detective to put together what was happening.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leave the sluts to those that know how to handle them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou keep your hands off her.\u201d Greg yelled, dropping the bowl and grabbing one of the gothic candleholders off a table as he started across the room towards Dmitri.<br>\r\nThe Bulldog squad did not capture this NPC to turn her into a sex toy for anyone, especially Dmitri.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDmitri\u2019s hand went for the pistol at his belt, fumbling at the flap of the holster. Had it been around his waist he undoubtedly would have quickly drawn it, no doubt shooting Greg before the incident went any further. Instead, with the belt hanging loosely around his knees instead, Dmitri had to bend over, wasting precious time fumbling with the tie holding the flap closed before he could get the gun clear of the holster. Time that allowed Greg to get close enough to plant a kick to the wrist that sent the gun flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou interfering tiny son of a bitch\u201d  Dmitri roared, bringing a savage elbow up into Greg\u2019s stomach that sent him flying across the room. With another roar, Dmitri charged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg may have gotten the first blow, but Dmitri was a street fighter. That was another reason they called him the dog. He fought hard and dirty. Greg had been in one fight in his life, at age 12, and had lost that one so badly even the guy who had beaten him up felt sorry for him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNow Greg, armed with a heavy candle holder, righteous wrath, and good intentions, faced down an unarmed and naked overweight man with his feet trapped in his trousers. Greg didn\u2019t stand a chance. One elbow, three kicks, and a punch to the kidney later he was groggily trying to get to his feet. Or failing that, at least get up onto his elbows and knees. None of his limbs would cooperate and he fell heavily back to the floor. A foot flipped him onto his back, and blearily, his head swimming with double vision, he looked up and tried to focus on Dmitri, standing there grinning down at him. It was an ugly grin, made worse by the angle of view. And the sight of a heavy fireplace poker in Dmitri\u2019s right hand. \u201cI\u2019m going to teach you what happens when you meddle where you\u2019re not wanted\u201d he said, coldly raising the heavy cast iron bar over his head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Then dropped it as a deafening explosion spun him around, knocking him to the ground. Greg squinted, his double vision coming to focus on the far side of the room where the bar maid was. She was aiming Dmitri\u2019s pistol at them from an almost textbook example of a defensive crouch. Holding the pistol in both hands she kept her aim steady as she rose and slowly walked across the room towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d given up on trying to use what was left of her shirt to cover herself. Her magnificent breasts now bobbed and swung free, or as free as they could, given that her two handed grip on the gun had them squeezed between the arms being held straight in front of her. She advanced, gun pointed steadily at where Dmitri lay writhing in pain and clutching at his shattered knee. Greg would remember the sight for a long time, sometimes regretting that he\u2019d paid more attention to the pistol in her hands rather than the twins behind it. Or not, he\u2019d finally decide years later, when he\u2019d matured enough to appreciate what had really mattered at the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cold look of fury the bar maid advanced on Dmitri, the gun never wavering. It was pointed straight at his heart as she came, until she was close enough that Dmitri, even writhing in pain as he was, couldn\u2019t help but catch sight of her looking down at him. His lip curled back in a snarl as he looked up at her. Greg thought it odd that at this she seemed to waver, the muzzle of the gun, so steady during her advance, dropped slightly. The look on Dmitri\u2019s face slowly became a feral grin. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you pay for this, you stupid bitch!\u201d He snarled. The gun in the bar maid\u2019s hands sank even lower as Dmitri\u2019s hands reached up. Then the gun when off, and Dmitri\u2019s face went white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis scream galvanized Greg to pull himself into a sitting position, shaking his head to try and clear it. Dmitri was rolling on the floor, crying in pain as blood streamed out from under the hands he now held clutched between his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the pistol down on a nearby table, the woman ignored the bubbling cries of the screaming Dmitri. While Greg fumbled and tried to get unsteadily to his feet, she calmly began pulling on Dmitri\u2019s discarded shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Greg\u2019s head had stopped swimming enough that he was able to fully appreciate what he could see. Which was too bad, in a way.  What he now saw was the barmaid, now fully dressed. She\u2019d tied the tail of Dmitri\u2019s shirt together with what was left of her blouse in a knot to one side, leaving her belly exposed and the top half of the shirt buttons undone. Although from the way the buttons strained, that was probably because that was as far up as she could button it. Other than that, or maybe because of that, the shirt actually complemented the Dirndl\u2019s skirt quite well, looking very much like a revamped servers outfit. The only thing that looked out of place was Dmitri's pistol, now tucked into the waistband of the skirt.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing the pistol reminded Greg of his own, still in its holster on his belt. Slowly he reached towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNein. Nicht einmal daran zu denken\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe pistol that had been tucked in her waistband moments before was now pointing straight between his eyes. Greg froze. He had no doubt that if he tried anything he would have a third eye before he so much as blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout breaking eye contact, she nodded towards his holster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGib es mir!\u201d She said, beckoning with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg didn\u2019t understand the words, but the meaning was clear. Slowly, so there was no mistaking his intentions, he undid the flap of the holster and pulled his pistol out, grasping it between his thumb and finger the way they did it in cop shows. She took it from him and put it on the table beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuter Junge.\u201d She said, \u201cIch k\u00f6nnte dich leben lassen.\u201d She pointed her finger down and spun it in a circle, then pressed a palm forward. \u201cBis gegen die wand und verteilen, Sonnenschein.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg wasn\u2019t sure what the words meant, but this was usually the point where the prisoner was searched for concealed weapons, so maybe that was what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to put my hands on the wall? He said, half turning and holding his empty hands in the air. He glanced towards where he\u2019d last seen Dmitri and was startled to see only a trail of smeared blood. His expression must have warned the girl, who whirled and snapped off two quick shots, causing Dmitri to tumble from out from behind the chair he had been crawling onto. Now Dmitri was bleeding from both knees as well as the groin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word Greg placed his hands against the wall and didn\u2019t move as she quickly and efficiently relieved him of his belt knife, the only other weapon he had. Then, after binding his hands behind him with strips cut from a nearby tablecloth, she quickly did the same with Dmitri. Although how much of a threat he was with two shattered knees and a groin injury Greg couldn\u2019t guess. Still, she did a quick and very thorough search, then with a nod of satisfaction, dumped all of Dmitri\u2019s knives in a heap in the middle of a table. Then she picked up Dmitri\u2019s jacket and headed for the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to stop short beside the bowl of gruel on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bowl had landed right side up when he had dropped it, and while some of the Gruel had spilled, a lot of it still clung to the bottom. The girl dropped to her knees and picked up the bowl, sniffed it, then began using her fingers to shovel the thick fluid into her mouth, moaning as if it was the most delicious thing she\u2019d ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg could hardly believe his eyes. The girl ate like she was starving, rapidly shoveling the food into her mouth and licking her fingers. When the bowl was clean she stared longingly at the food spilled on the floor, as if she was weighing whether or not to eat that too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s more on the cart, if you want.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped up, startled, and he realized she\u2019d forgotten he was there. Silently he cursed. If he\u2019d realized she was so distracted he could have captured her. Now, staring once more down the barrel of her confiscated pistol, he was again her prisoner. Sighing he raised his hands back in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying you don\u2019t have to eat that off the floor. There\u2019s more on the cart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just looked at him quizzically. Of course she wouldn\u2019t understand. He thought to himself. It\u2019s not that she\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s the language barrier. <br>\r\nHe pointed at the bowl, then at the door. Slowly, he moved towards the door, keeping his hands up and in her sight the whole time. When he reached the door he was startled when she pushed her hand against it, stopping him from opening it. Gesturing him back, she eased the door open and checked the hall. Satisfied it was clear she motioned him through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cart was where he\u2019d left it, which wasn\u2019t surprising. Nobody would be in these halls to bother with it until the pub was supposed to open, and that wouldn\u2019t be for hours yet. \u201cSee, he said, lifting the cover off the huge vat and ladling out another bowl that he held out to her. \u201cLots of food to eat.\u201d Ordinarily he would have shuddered at calling the gruel \u2018food\u2019, but he was coming to the realization that this was probably the first thing she\u2019d eaten in days. Still, she looked at the bowl suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing you ate in there, Greg said. \u201cMaybe a little warmer.\u201d He pulled out a second bowl and ladled a bit for himself. \u201cSee?\u201d he said taking a spoonful and smacking his lips. \u201cFood!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a spoon, she carefully tasted it, then began to quickly spoon it into her mouth. Gone was the ravenous hunger with which she\u2019d downed the previous batch, and she ate a little slower. Still, her bowl was clean by the time Greg had finished the small amount he\u2019d portioned for himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFude\u201d She said. Setting the bowl down on the cart, patting her stomach and favoring him with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah\u201d he laughed and smiled back. \u201cFood!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanke f\u00fcr, Decke Kerl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg wasn\u2019t quite sure what she\u2019d said. He was sure <i>Danke</i> meant thank you, and she was looking at him with a warm smile. The warmest smile he\u2019d seen in a long time, so it was probably a good thing.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chapter 103<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her smile vanished as she looked up and down the corridor.<br>\r\n\u201cWas ist die Richtung, die ich, um hier raus nehmen sollte um zu bekommen?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg just looked at her, uncomprehendingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAus! Aus! Heraus. Ich m\u00f6chte zu verlassen?\u201d She asked again, gesturing about with the muzzle of the pistol she was once again holding.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg couldn\u2019t figure out what she was saying. Die itch hair grouse? Something about Ass? Why was she asking him questions when she was supposed to be escaping? Then he realized why. She didn\u2019t know which way to go. Of course she wouldn\u2019t. There were only two ways out of the catacombs but she would have no way of knowing that. If she went up she would reach the kitchen, in the middle of a town swarming with bored soldiers. If she went down she would reach the loading docks and dungeons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe docks are probably your best bet.\u201d He said, not sure why he was being honest with her. By rights he should send her upwards to certain capture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t understand, of course, so he repeated himself, gesturing towards the tunnels that sloped downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat time she seemed to get it. Then gestured with the pistol for him to walk ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she would, he thought with a sigh. \u201cWait.\u201d He said, moving back and grabbing the handles of the cart. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be delivering the food. If I show up without it they will know something\u2019s not right.\u201d <br>\r\nHer look said she didn\u2019t understand, but she didn\u2019t stop him, just waiting until he\u2019d pushed the cart passed so she could walk behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later she spoke again, almost casually. \u201cDas ist eine Menge Lebensmittel, die Sie dort haben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg again tried to puzzle out what she said. Probably telling him to go slow and not to try anything funny, he figured. She was letting him go ahead because he would be expected, and therefore wouldn\u2019t immediately raise the alarm. Also, she could use him as a meat shield if needed, he thought, being a realist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he thought of that he regretted it. Things had a way of becoming real when thought of, and this was no exception. They were half way down a long smooth stretch of corridor when they heard the voices. At least three soldiers, coming towards them. This wasn\u2019t a good place to be trapped, Greg thought. If the soldiers challenged them there would be gunfire. He had no doubt they wouldn\u2019t be too choosy who their target was, and the only thing he currently had to hide behind was roughly 264 litres of soup. Thick, but not likely to stop a lot of bullets. Ahead of them, the soldiers had several alcoves and a corner from which to choose from as cover. In panic he looked back at the girl, wondering what she would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise she had a plan. The first step involved grabbing him by the collar and yanking his face down until it was level to hers. Putting a finger to his lips, she whispered harshly \u201cEin Wort, und ich verwenden diese Pistole, um sowohl Ihre B\u00e4lle abschie\u00dfen sowie\u201d Without breaking eye contact she tapped the barrel of her pistol against his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg swallowed nervously. He wasn\u2019t any better now at understanding German than when they started, but he was getting her meaning perfectly. Behind them in the locked pub Dmitri was slowly and painfully bleeding to death for what he'd tried to do. Although Greg had helped her escape that, there was very little doubt in his mind that this girl was threatening to inflict the same injury on him if he gave her away. If his own side didn\u2019t kill him, she\u2019d make him wish they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that the message was received she jammed a pistol into his belt, positioning it so it was very obviously there, then pushed him back and took his place pushing the cart, draping the confiscated jacket loosely over one of the handles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three soldiers came around the corner moments later. Shoulder patches identified them as being part of the Loosie Goosies, the squad the Bulldogs had been drinking with the night they had captured the girl. Greg even recognized one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Leon!\u201d he called nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreg, my old drinking buddy. What\u2019s up? Got some help with feeding the prisoners I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight as well make her useful.\u201d Greg said with a nervous laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFote!\u201d The girl exclaimed with that bright smile of hers. \u201cIch Diene Fote!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Greg said, joining in. She has the food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to call it that.\u201d laughed one of the men. The second, one Greg didn\u2019t know, just looked at her, an odd expression on his face. It was almost pity. Or guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers moved aside and let them pass as they continued down the hall. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHey Greg.\u201d One of the men called from behind them moments later. The girl stiffened and stopped, the hand under the jacket tensing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYes?\u201d Greg said, as they both slowly turned to look at the group now behind them. He wondered if he should dive to the side and hope the bullets would miss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was just standing there, looking like someone who needed to say something but wasn\u2019t sure where to begin. His buddies stood a little bit behind him, looking similar, and a bit shamefaced.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething ugly is going down, Greg. Stay away from the Pivnaya Catacombs tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Greg asked suspiciously. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man glanced at the other two, as if seeking permission to continue. Neither of them gave any indication one way or the other, so the man continued. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear it from us, okay? But you should know about the situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat situation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat lottery Dmitri is running.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLottery? What lottery?\u201d Greg was truly confused now. Out of the corner of his eye he could see that the girl still had her hand all the way under the jacket, undoubtedly clutching the hidden gun. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose tickets He\u2019s been selling.\u201d Now that it was out in the open the man started to speak more freely. \u201c10 bucks a shot. First prize being your little lady friend there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg tried to wrap his head around what the man was saying. \u201cFirst prize?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man\u2019s buddy spoke up. \u201cAnd second. And third prize as well. All the way down the line to number six. When your ticket is drawn is when you get your turn at her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour turn?\u201d Greg was lost for a moment, then his eyes narrowed as an ugly suspicion took a hold of him. He looked back at the first man, who made a hand gesture that confirmed his suspicions. \u201cYou\u2019re talking a lottery to take turns raping her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, pretty much.\u201d The first man said, shuffling his feet nervously.\u201d And everyone with a ticket gets to watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg put his hand on the butt of the pistol in his belt. Probably exactly the wrong thing to do given the dynamics of the situation, but he wasn\u2019t thinking of about that now. Subconsciously he took a protective half step sideways, closer to the girl. \u201cThe hell they are!\u201d He declared. When none of the men denied what he was saying he got madder. \u201cWho the hell would buy tickets for that? And why the hell isn\u2019t somebody doing something about it?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWe are.\u201d The second guy said \u201cWe\u2019re not going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Greg yelled. \u201cDmitri is selling tickets to a gang rape and your idea of helping the victim is to not participate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside him the girl was looking back and forth between the two groups, warily watching. Her hand was likely still clutching the gun hidden there, but not drawing it just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Leon said, coming back to stand beside his squad mates. \u201cHe means that we\u2019re not going because we\u2019ve already informed the commander about it.\u201d Both men nodded in confirmation \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going down. He\u2019s planning to raid the place tonight and arrest anyone participating. He\u2019ll probably have them shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that will be a small comfort for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, we don\u2019t like it any more than you. But what can we do? He maybe part of Grizzly squad but he also manages the production line at the plant. And after this all done we have to work with that little dick-wad come Monday. If he finds out we had a hand in busting up his little perverted game he\u2019ll make the job a living hell.\u201d Leon stopped and took a breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s as much as we dare do. Hell, she's only a Sim. We\u2019re only telling you \u2018cause you seem like a decent enough chap and shouldn\u2019t get caught up in the crossfire when this goes down.\u201d He clapped Greg on the shoulder apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI truly hope the commander doesn\u2019t shut the place down. I kind of like the idea of it. It\u2019s the nicest thing to come out of these stupid raiding parties, and one jackass shouldn\u2019t ruin it for every one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to leave, \u201cOh, and Greg,\u201d he said, turning back \u201cif you\u2019re going to carry your gun like a cheap gangster, you might want to load a clip in it first.\u201d Then the three of them walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked down at the gun, noticing for the first time the clip was missing. When he looked at the girl she just gave a rueful shrug. He sighed and closed his eyes. The commander was going to be in for a disappointment when he raided the pub tonight, he thought. Dmitri had already been shot, and the girl would be long gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squeaking of tires pulled him back to the present. The girl was headed down the corridor with the food cart.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a tense few minutes in the tunnel there, and it was all Lindsay could do to keep calm and not start blasting away. The thought that she\u2019d not likely come away unscathed had helped calm the itch in her trigger finger. And then her boy had come through for her. She wasn\u2019t sure what the men had been discussing; Some of the words sounded angry, but at least it wasn\u2019t along the lines of \u2018Help! I\u2019m a hostage\u2019. Two of the men kept glancing her way, but they had looked more guilty than suspicious. She realized they were more focused on her cleavage than on what her hands were up to. The tall one actually blushed a bit when he realized she\u2019d seen him looking. Men, she sighed. So predictable. With that in mind she leaned a little further forward. Never underestimate the power of a distraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pat on the shoulder the group of guards left, but not before saying something that made Blanket Guy check the pistol she\u2019d given him. The look on his face when he saw it was missing the magazine was priceless. Well, what did you expect? She thought. That I\u2019d give my ticket out of here a <i>loaded</i> gun? I may be a blonde but I\u2019m not stupid. Then she started pushing the cart down the tunnel again, anxious to get to the end before they had to bluff their way past any more guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck was with her, as they didn\u2019t see anyone else until the corridor they were in bottomed out and they came to a large antechamber. In addition to the opening for the corridor they were exiting, there were three other doors around the chamber. Like all the doors in this place they were made of heavy oak and clad with rusting iron straps and hinges. Someone had a thing for heavy oak and iron. At a table in front of one door sat a bored looking guard, reading a dog eared paperback. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClinging to the old adage \u201cIf it worked once, it will probably work again, Lindsay pushed the cart towards the guard. \u201cI bring you food!\u201d she said, trying her best to smile like the harmless serving girl she was pretending to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYA ne znayu o yede, no vy pritsel dlya bolit glaza\u201d The man said excitedly, jumping to his feet the moment Lindsay got his attention. \u201cTy takaya malen'kaya veshch' iz bara, ne tak li?\u201d He jabbered away, obviously happy to have someone to talk to and break the monotony. After a minute or so of this Lindsay realized that he was not, as she had hoped, just going to take the food and leave them. Something needed to be done. She glanced toward Blanket Guy, and when she caught his attention she gave him a signal, glancing meaningfully towards his crotch. She felt a little bad at how quickly he paled, but at least he interrupted the guard\u2019s incomprehensible monologue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYA nenavizhu preryvat', no my dolzhny idti.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO, der'mo, proshu proshcheniya. YA dolzhen byl znat', chto byla prichina, po kotoroy Dmitriy pozvolyal yey begat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever her boy had said to the guard worked, he seemed to be practically falling all over himself in a stammering apology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYA dumal, on skazal, chto on ne snimayet yeye po chasam do sleduyushchey nedeli. Dumayu, on peredumal. byli li vy pobeditelem rozygrysha proshloy noch'yu?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blanket Guy\u2019s eyes narrowed the guard quickly took over the cart and pushed it towards the door behind the table, giving Blanket Guy a none to subtle wink as the door closed behind him. The guard had obviously caught her signal as well, even if he\u2019d somewhat miss-interpreted what it was about. At least the two of them were now alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNu, ty khotel vyyti. Tam eto.\u201d Blanket Guy said, pointing to a second of the three doors. \u201cDok-stantsiya dostavlyayetsya tuda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strolled over and opened the door he had pointed at. Lindsay looked out in dismay. The door opened right onto the dock she remembered from the night they had brought her in, although this was from the opposite end. Gone was the harsh sodium glare of the flood light. Now it was mid day and harsh winter sunlight flooded the dock, now bare of any crates and barrels and anything that would give cover to someone trying to sneak in or out of the place. Which would be okay if it wasn\u2019t for the half dozen guards that were just pulling a prisoner out of the lone truck backed up against the far end of the dock. As they frog marched him towards the doorway where Lindsay was hiding, she felt a hand on her shoulder, and when she whirled around Blanket Guy put a finger to his lips, then motioned for her to follow as he lead the way towards the third as yet unopened door. Without even wondering why the man she\u2019d now twice threatened to turn into a eunuch was trying to help her, she followed him quickly across the room and through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door lead to another stone staircase. This one cold narrow, and when the door was closed behind her, pitch black. She felt a hand on her arm, urging her forward. Carefully her free hand against the rough stone wall to steady herself, she began to feel her way forward. It helped that the steps went upwards at an even, comfortable pace. Eventually, they pushed their way through a broken door at the top into a ruined building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the near pitch black of the stairwell, the bright sun streaming through the broken windows was blinding. Blinking rapidly, her eyes quickly adjusted and she could make out where they were. It had once been the vestry of a now ruined cathedral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay looked around. The most obvious way out was, well, out. Out of the question, that is. A pile of crumpled wreckage was heaped against the massive main doors of the church, blocking them from opening. Timbers and rock had been piled against all of the side doors. Any windows she could see started an unreachable 5 meters above the ground. Unless there was another way out hidden in the rubble they had reached a dead end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they began to search for a way out of the ruined interior Lindsay marveled at the work that had obviously gone into the place. In it\u2019s prime, the church had been impressive, even as Russian Orthodox churches go. How it had survived the Bolshevik purge without being razed to the ground was a question that would remain un-answered, although the communists had obviously helped themselves to the finer furnishings over the years. Gone were any of the fine gilded fixtures and polished woodwork that were the hallmarks of a house of worship. Stripped and bare, the smashed and broken statues of saints, apostles, and other holy figures littered the floor along with massive scraps of twisted metal and rock and the remains of broken furniture. Glittery pieces of broken glass winked in the sunlight. Broken glass that came from the massive stained glass window high in the wall behind them. A massive stained glass window with a very familiar looking hole in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a start Lindsay recognized the hole, and with a feeling of dread turned towards the largest pile of crumpled wreckage that blocked the main doors.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fighter, or what was left of it. Shredded by the impact of slamming into the massive stone wall that formed the front of the building. The shoulders of a leather jacket was just visible through a gap under a piece of twisted  aluminum panel. Not wanting to but unable to stop herself, she walked over to the wreck, lifted the panel up, and looked under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grinning skull with blond pigtails stared back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp, she dropped the panel. It fell heavily, dislodging the skeletal arm in the jacket which slid down the sleeve and towards her. For a brief moment she thought the skeleton was trying to grab her and scuttled backwards in panic, bumping into the Russian, who had come up behind her. When he saw what had startled her, he nodded \u201cDa. Skelety. Odin iz nemetskikh letchikov. Inogda my nakhodim ikh v krushenii. Telo igrokov ne ischezayet. Oni prosto prevrashchayutsya v skelety.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered, suddenly now very interested in finding a way out of the church even if it involved climbing up to the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it looked like the Bolsheviks didn\u2019t want anyone to have easy access to the church, and had piled mounds of rubble against the doors. The only obvious way out was either through the roof, which would require a ladder they didn\u2019t have, or through a window, which had the same problem. Unless they could find a third way out, they would have to go back down and try the loading dock again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey failed to find another door that wasn\u2019t blocked. Maybe there was another door behind the wreckage, but Lindsay doubted that, and did not really want to investigate. Shuddering, she pulled her confiscated jacket around her a little tighter. Turning back towards the wreckage she bowed her head for a moment in silence, then touched a hand to her forehead. Head. Heart. Shoulder. Shoulder. She crossed herself like she used to every time she\u2019d entered a church, back when she\u2019d gone every week. Like she should have done earlier, she thought, a bit guiltily, when she had realized this was sanctified ground. A habit she\u2019d gotten out of, but one she was seriously thinking of taking up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she sighed, and started back towards the stairwell and their only exit out of the place.<br>\r\nBlanket Guy stood there for a moment, looking at the wreckage and copying her movements. Then he picked up a piece of metal from the pile and followed her, speaking over the solemn mood she was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEy, ya dumayu, chto eto tot paren', kotoryy zastrelil menya v posledniy raz, kogda ya poletel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped and looked at him, no clue what he was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDa. Eto ya i Frenk, i Dzhordzh, i Larri. My byli v bombardirovke, i etot paren' vyshel iz oblakov i poluchil vsekh nas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just stared some more. Blanket Guy seemed really pleased about something he\u2019d found, and he showed it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPainted on the twisted aluminum was the cartoon mascot of The Mad Cows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not surprised. The same way the name on the chest of the skeleton\u2019s uniform hadn\u2019t surprised her. Not really. She had known what it would say even as she\u2019d lifted the chunk of wreckage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cANDERSON\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresno, kak on okazalsya zdes\u2019.\u201d Blanket Guy went on, \u201cKogda-nibud', mozhet byt', ya rasskazhu vam istoriyu. Vy, veroyatno, vsegda budete sluzhit' parnyu v etom bare.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat ever he wanted to talk about Lindsay wasn\u2019t really interested. She was feeling a bit weird-ed out at the recent discovery, and wanted nothing more than to both be alone with her own thoughts right now, and not be alone at all right now. Something that wouldn\u2019t happen until she got out of this place. She turned and started back towards the stairwell. After a moment he dropped the piece of metal with its happy painted picture and followed. They had almost reached the door before he spoke again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYA mog by byt' otkrovennym, mademuazel', dlya vas bylo by chudom, chtoby vytashchit' vas otsyuda, i pokhozhe, chto russkiye ob\"yavili vne zakona chudesa\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was really too soon to be moving about, but he didn\u2019t care. There was only one thought on his mind, and that drove out all others. To catch the little bitch that did this to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serving girl was an idiot to think her pathetic attempt at tying him would work. As soon as she\u2019d taken her attention off him he had started flexing and twisting his wrists. The weak strips had parted easily the moment the door had closed, and he\u2019d crawled his way towards where he\u2019d seen the German Med Kit that ungrateful slut must have used to heal her bruises. There had been plenty of healing salve and bandages left over and he had lost no time in applying that to his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to what was left of the little pump action 12 gauge he carried between his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been the most painful part of the process. He\u2019d almost passed out a couple of times as he peeled the blood soaked cloth of his trousers away from the wound. His prized little Remington was an unrecognizable mess of clotted blood and torn tissue. That little slut had better pray it healed properly, he had vowed. No one, player or NPC, was going to do that to him and get away with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the cool healing gel soothing the pain of the ruins of his personal armory, Dmitri applied more to his knees and then bandaged them. As soon as they would take his weight he went after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrdinarily, the heavy locked door would have stopped him, except for the spare key he kept hidden in the woodwork of one of the tables. It was a matter of a moment to retrieve the key and let him self out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat faggot from the Goose group, Leon, and a couple of his Butt Buddies were just passing by when he opened the door. Another bunch of queers this game attracted. He had long suspected they were into men the way they all hung out together drinking tea during their breaks on the production line. He wasn\u2019t too surprised when they\u2019d declined to join in on the special in game entertainment he\u2019d been arranging for the real men. They probably spent their off hours drinking tea and swapping make up tips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world would be better off without them he had decided, but that didn\u2019t stop him from accosting them in the hallway and commandeering Leon\u2019s pistol and spare clips to replace the one the little cunt had stolen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group had also let slip that the little slit and her wimpy boyfriend were headed towards the dungeons. Re-armed, he hobbled along the hall as fast as his crippled legs would carry him. He had no doubt that their destination wasn\u2019t the dungeons. It would be the loading dock. Obviously they were going to try to escape. Too bad, He was going to catch them first, and when he did, the bitch would pay. Both of them would, but the slut most of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t on the loading dock when he got there. There was a group of guards tormenting a prisoner on the docks. They\u2019d been at if for a little while and would have noticed her, they all swore to that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, he hobbled back inside to question the guard at the dungeon door. Before he got there though, his attention was caught by the third door in the chamber. The one that lead upstairs to the ruined church the catacombs were built under.  A door that had been recently opened, judging by the scuff marks in the dirt in front of it. With the grin of a predator that knows he\u2019s about to make an easy kill, he pushed the door open and started up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top, he stopped just inside the dark doorway and watched in delight, hardly believing what he was seeing. The little cunt and that little traitor Gregory were walking back towards his hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg wasn\u2019t sure how much the girl could understand, but he kept talking. Trying to lighten the mood. The skeleton in the plane seemed to have freaked her out for some reason, so he was trying to find something to distract her. Talk about movies, some one had suggested to him once when he had confessed his awkwardness at small talk. For some reason the only movie with Germans in it he could think of was Casablanca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might as well be frank, mademoiselle,\u201d he quoted, paraphrasing a little \u201cit would take a miracle to get you out of here, and the Russians have outlawed miracles.\u201d <br>\r\nWhen she didn\u2019t react he went on. \u201cThat was a movie reference. Did you ever watch Casablanca? Nice romantic movie. I\u2019ve seen it maybe a dozen times\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was leading them back to the stairwell, only to be stopped short when a pistol emerged from the darkness, followed by the grinning face of a man he thought would be dead by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you like the romantic movies do you?\u201d Dmitri asked casually, pulling the pistol out of Greg\u2019s belt before he could react, then motioning them back into the relatively debris free central area of the church. The wimp wasn\u2019t a threat to him, now that he\u2019d taken his gun. He carefully kept his pistol firmly trained on the only real threat in the room, that bitch from the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m more of an action movie fan myself.\u201d He said casually, \u201cSeagal, Van Damme, Bruce Willis, Schwarzenegger. Eastwood. You like Clint Eastwood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He didn\u2019t really wait for an answer, but continued monologing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo? Too bad. I think the spaghetti westerns were his best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The bitch\u2019s pistol he collected from her waistband as well, then gestured for the two of them to stand where he could see them clearly. A glance at the confiscated weapons surprised him, and he let out a dry laugh. Here the wimp had been strutting around all dangerous looking, and he\u2019d forgotten load a clip in his pistol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that gave him an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what I like most about them?\u201d He asked, not really expecting them to answer. \u201cThe big gun fight at the end. Always a big gun fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin, Dmitri ejected the bitches clip, then tossed the pistol back to her. She caught it with a confused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now we\u2019re going to play a little game.\u201d He continued in a conversational tone, tossing the wimp\u2019s pistol back to him as well as he moved to the center of the space between them, keeping them in his sights as he did so. Five meters in front of the bitch he carefully placed a clip on the ground. Moving to the left he did the same in front of Greg. Lastly he backed up. Making sure the gun was carefully trained on them as he did so, he placed a third clip in front of himself. Of course, his was much closer, but that was because of his wounded legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis game,\u201d he said conversationally, \u201ccombines speed, skill, luck, and timing. Kind of like the end scene in a Fist Full of Dollars. Combined with the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. You are familiar with the movies? Too bad. Classic western cinema. I\u2019m going to eject my clip, then we\u2019re going to race to see who can reach the new clips first. Winner shoots the others. Simple, yes?\u201d As he spoke, he pantomimed the actions. Whether the bitch understood or not he didn\u2019t care, he just wanted to give Greg the illusion that he was giving them a chance. He fully intended that they would die. Greg first of course. A belly shot should make it painful and slow. He would get to watch as the bitch got what was coming to her. What that would be he was still deciding, but it too would be slow and painful. For now, he was waiting until he judged the two of them were at the edge of nervousness. Then he ejected his clip, tossed it, and waited for one of them to make a move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, the wimp was hesitant and unsure, Looking at him like he didn\u2019t want anything to do with this. The girl, however, looked at him coldly, eyeing the distance between the nearest clip and herself. In that moment Dmitri realized that he maybe he had misjudged her. This was not some dim witted piece of bar fluff to be taken lightly. At this realization he tensed his muscles. He was just about to fling himself forward when she raised her empty pistol and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg started at the sound of the shot. In disbelieve he saw a look of shock that mirrored his own cross Dmitri\u2019s face. Then, as Greg watched, Dmitri\u2019s legs buckled, pitching him face first into the dust where he lay, unmoving and still. The girl casually strolled over, nudging the body with a toe. When there was no response she spat on the corpse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSie vergessen immer derjenige in der Kammer. Das ist, wie die meisten Pistole Unf\u00e4lle passieren, Idioten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg couldn\u2019t believe it. She\u2019d just shot Dmitri again, this time with an empty gun. Who or what she was he didn\u2019t know, but he was beginning to doubt she really needed his help all this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had to be some sort of side quest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnmoving, he watched as she collected the clips from the floor, slipping one into her pistol. Then she walked back to where Dmitri lay, and coldly emptied that clip into the corpse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnd ficken bleiben tot, Arschloch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed for the stairwell, reloading her pistol as she went. Almost as an after thought, she tossed the third clip to Greg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIch hoffe bloody gut, dass ich hier einen Fehler mache nein\u201d she said, leading the way into the darkness. \u201cWenn du leben willst, komm mit mir\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not until several turns later at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the way down Lindsay was second guessing herself. Did she really trust Blanket Guy? True, upstairs that Russian officer acted like he was going to kill them both, but that didn\u2019t automatically mean Blanket Guy was on her side. Maybe it was part of some game they all played. It seemed like the kind of thing people in love with guns would think was funny. She could tell by the way the idiot was tossing them around that he knew nothing about gun safety. Especially when he\u2019d tossed hers back to her with a live round still in the chamber. She couldn\u2019t believe it. Forget the fact she still had the magazine from Blanket Guy\u2019s pistol tucked into her garter. Which the idiot would have found if he had even tried to pat her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, Officer Entitlement deserved to be removed from the gene pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut did that mean she could trust Blanket Guy not to shoot her in the back?<br>\r\nHe seemed to be helping her, but why? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the door he went ahead and opened it, looking out. Then motioned her through. The only person in the room was the guard that had been there previously, who looked up and grinned when he saw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOna tak zhe khorosha, kak oni govoryat?\u201d He called out as they shut the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlanket guy nodded his head enthusiastically. \u201cOna chertovski potryasayushchaya!\u201d he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard laughed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He\u2019d hoped that the place would be unoccupied, but apparently the guard at the desk was already back from delivering the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up when he heard them close the door, a leer on his face.<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d he asked. \u201c<i>IS</i> she as good as Dmitri says she is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg shook his head. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what she can do.\u201d he said ironically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew what the guard was talking about, of course. And it angered him that Dmitri thought he could pimp her out like she was his personal sex slave.  Which is why he wasn\u2019t too upset that what was left of Dmitri was upstairs cooling off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to see for myself,\u201d the guard said, leering at the bar maid, who shifted uncomfortably. \u201cNext time you see \u2018The Dog\u2019 tell him to send her down here.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t plan on talking to Dmitri for a long time.\u201d Greg said in all honesty as he turned to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might not have a choice.\u201d The guard called after him \u201cI heard that he was looking for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Greg stopped and turned back. \u201cWhat for?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew what for, of course. Dmitri had wanted to kill him and recapture her. He was curious to know what he\u2019d told the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d The guard shrugged, \u201cJust that he was asking the guys on escort duty if they\u2019d seen you two. Actually, he was specifically looking for the girl, from what Cedric said. I don\u2019t think he mentioned you. He was mad as a wet hen about something too. Did you try to pay him with fake money?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg gritted his teeth at that, but turned back to the guard and forced a smile. \u201cAre you going to Pivnaya Catacombs tonight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet.\u201d The guard said, still not taking his eyes off the girl. \u201cHopefully The Dog still has tickets left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid everybody know about the rape lottery but him?<br>\r\n\u201cIf not, just tell every one you have one from earlier, you just can\u2019t find it. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll believe you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a dick move, he knew. He had just ensured the guard would share whatever fate anyone with a ticket got. Still, the guard probably deserved what ever happened anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent idea.\u201d The guard said with a leer, putting at ease whatever qualms Greg had about what he\u2019d just said. \u201cAt least I\u2019ll get to watch. Hey, don\u2019t wear her out, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCount on that.\u201d Greg said, leading the way to the loading dock. Out of sight of the guard, he stopped, then unclenched a fist, exhaling. The girl was watching him with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be very thankful you can\u2019t understand what people are saying.\u201d He told her, peering around the corner at the loading dock. The truck from earlier was still parked against the far end, but otherwise the place was deserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like your lucky day.\u201d He said, then strolled nonchalantly out into the daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment she followed, walking purposefully right beside him, he noticed. Obviously thinking the same thing he was. The best way to blend in someplace is to act like you belong here. Just like on a job site, he thought. A person sneaking about is suspicious. A person with a hard hat blends in to the back ground and isn\u2019t likely to get noticed. Give him a clip board and a worried expression and people would go out of their way to avoid them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo hard hats and clipboards here. Still, nobody challenged them as they climbed into the truck and started it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grind of gears they pulled out of the yard and trundled up the roadway.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Drafts of winter air leak in through gaps and miss matched panels, bringing with them a cold that the heater barely keeps at bay. Sound deadening between the engine and passenger compartment is almost nonexistent. With the cargo area empty the wooden boards of the cargo bed rattle and bang as the truck rattles and groans its way over the frozen road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the best place to have a conversation, but that didn\u2019t stop Greg from trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis reminds me of the truck I used to drive for my Grandpa.\u201d He said over the roar of the heater motor. \u201cBack on the farm. He always said that anyone could drive an automatic but it took a real man to drive stick.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was looking at him with a puzzled look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStick. Stick shift. A manual transmission, you know? Not easy to drive, but Gramps insisted we learn. All the kids did. And they loved to drive that truck.\u201d Greg went on. \u201cDriving it was our reward for helping out around the place. We used to haul hay around for the horses and feed for the cattle. That was the reward for helping out. Getting to drive.\u201d He looked at her questioningly. \u201cDid you ever do something like that? Work hard just because you got to do something you loved while doing it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDu bist nicht einer jener Menschen, die die ganze Reise zu sprechen, sind Sie?\u201d she said encouragingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Greg wasn\u2019t very good at the kind of small talk that a long drive with a pretty girl should be filled with. And yet the last think he wanted her to think was that he was boring, so he babbled away <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYeah. I loved driving that truck. I actually thought that\u2019s what I would do when I finished school. Drive the big rigs, you know? Travel the open road? See the country?\u201d<br>\r\nHe looked at her to gauge her reaction. She didn\u2019t give him one, so he continued. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cExcept it turns out nobody wants to hire a kid with no experience unless he has his own rig, you know. And when I finally got hired on if found that the good jobs always get given to the guys that have been around for ages. The new guy only gets the garbage runs the experienced guys won\u2019t touch. I lasted 6 and a half months before I quit. Got a job doing inner city deliveries with USRPS instead. Been doing that for 6 years now. You ever drive truck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at him as he asked the question \u201cOh Gott.\u201d She replied \u201cSie werden den Weg dorthin zu sprechen\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDriving delivery is okay. I mean, the people are great for the most part. Not all of them, of course. Some of them are too full of themselves about how important their little packages are. And I had that one guy on my route who would phone in a complaint every time I was late. Even if it was only a minute. And there\u2019s the other drivers. The cars on the road I mean. The drivers. Some of them are real jerks. There is a reason that the world\u2019s most useless job is a toss up between telephone sanitizer and BMW turn signal mechanic.<br>\r\nStill, It\u2019s a great job and I love it, but lately I\u2019ve been thinking I need to do more with my live. Get a career or something. Maybe meet some one and settle down. I mean, a life of gaming and driving truck is great, but I can\u2019t help feel there\u2019s something missing. You know what I mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn inarticulate grunt was her only answer, so he continued to babble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, back there in the church. That logo I found, from the wreck. You recognized it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Of course she didn\u2019t answer, but he continued none the less. \u201cOf course you would. The same picture was hanging over the bar where we found you. That guy was from the same squadron your bar was at, isn\u2019t he? You probably served the guy all the time. You probably know him. Man, I wish I could really talk to you. I have so many questions about him. That guy was probably the greatest pilot I\u2019ve ever seen. Everybody I know has been shot down by him. Did you know he once single handedly shot down my entire squadron? That was back when we still had enough planes for everyone and we would go out on bombing raids. One day we were on a raid and that guy came out of the clouds and handed us our ass\u2019 on a platter. Just tore us apart. Kind of why I\u2019m on guard duty instead of flying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized she hadn\u2019t said anything lately and looked over at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was leaning back against the seat with her eyes closed. She\u2019d turned the collar of her jacket up and folded her arms across her chest to ward off the chill of the drafty cab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She can\u2019t really be asleep, can she?\u2019 He wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Of course not, you idiot!</i> the part of his brain that hated him said. <i>She\u2019s only pretending so you will stop talking. <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThe feeling between that part of his brain and Greg was mutual. There are times when Greg would ignore that part of his brain. Times he actually did things and had fun, in spite of what the nay-say in his head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not one of those times. He shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Blanket Guy seemed quite happy babbling away to himself so she closed her eyes and leaned back, tuning him out. In spite of the jacket and the truck\u2019s heater she felt chilled. Too bad she couldn\u2019t sleep, she thought. She\u2019d never been able to sleep in a car. Or anything that moved really. Something about the constant jostling kept her awake, even when she was dead tired. This time she wasn\u2019t really tired, just cold. There was an icy draft on her legs that was extremely uncomfortable. Leaning forward, she felt around under the dash, trying to find where the draft was coming from. To her surprise, she found an open manual air vent. She slid it closed. Instantly the draft stopped and the cab quickly began to warm up. As the cab warmed up she was able to relax a bit. She put her hands behind her head and stretched her back, easing her stiff muscles <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d she said, suddenly realizing something. \u201cYou stopped talking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was staring out the windscreen, of course. \u201cIzvinite, ya znayu, chto vy pytayetes' spat'.\u201d He said, not taking his eyes off the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Lindsay said, sitting upright \u201cYou probably thought I was trying to sleep. I didn\u2019t mean to be rude. I wasn\u2019t sleeping. I was just trying to keep warm.\u201d Her shirt was loose and gaping open, showing quite a bit more breast than she intended, so she straightened it up and retied the knot as she leaning towards him \u201cDid you know there\u2019s an air vent under the dash?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlanket guy kept driving, checking the mirrors and scanning the road. Looking anywhere else but at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed a little inside as she realized what was making him uncomfortable. The blush creeping up his neck gave it away. Boys and their fascination with cleavage. Taking pity on him she straightened up and pulled her jacket back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it was blowing cold air on my legs. Now that it\u2019s stopped I\u2019m warm. Too warm. Mind if I turn the heater down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dolzhny byt' tam cherez paru chasov, Yesli my ne stolknemsya s patrulem.\u201d Blanket Guy replied nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay took this to mean yes, and flipped the heater switch to medium. The blower noise dropped considerably. Almost to the point where it wasn\u2019t noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rode in silence for several minutes. Other than them selves, the road was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVy znayete, chto nuzhno etomu gruzoviku?\u201d Blanket Guy said suddenly \u201cRadio. Dazhe staryy gruzovik imel radio\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay looked at him, then at the two way radio mounted on the dash. Why was he wanting the radio all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNe dvukhstoronneye radio. Obychnyy. Dlya muzyki.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay still didn\u2019t understand.

If that was what he was really saying it was actually not a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDumayu, nam pridetsya improvizirovat'\u201d he said, starting to tap on the steering wheel. \u201cMozhet byt', my mozhem pet'.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only that, she\u2019d found an open vent under the dash and had closed it, causing the cab to warm up considerably.<br>\r\nGreg mentally chastised himself for not realizing the vent was open. He knew these old trucks had manual vents, it just hadn\u2019t occurred to him to check. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she still had her gun. If she\u2019d woken up with him fumbling around between her knees she might have gotten the wrong idea and shot him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the cab warming up she had let her jacket fall open. The borrowed shirt must have slipped a couple of buttons while she slept. The front gaped open when she yawned and stretched her back. Suddenly Greg felt a warm flush that had very little to do with the truck heater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHallo! Du hast aufgeh\u00f6rt zu redden.\u201d She said while adjusting her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d Greg lied, looking straight ahead and concentrating on watching the road. \u201cWe should be there in an hour or so, unless we run into a patrol.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIch wollte nur warm bleiben.\u201d She leaned towards him \u201cWusstest du, dass unter dem Armaturenbrett eine L\u00fcftungs\u00f6ffnung ist?\u201d she asked, tying her shirt tight <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg swallowed. He was only half listening to what she was saying anyway, torn between desperately wanting to look at the view she was offering, and knowing it was wrong. He was scared half to death he was going to start leering and making her uncomfortable. He needed a distraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what this truck needs?\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cA radio. Even that old farm truck had a radio.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started tapping on the steering wheel. \u201cI suppose we can improvise by singing.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure, but she didn\u2019t look impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on.\u201d He said \u201cIt\u2019ll give us something to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she didn\u2019t respond he started singing;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEast bound and I\u2019m loaded up and trucking. We\u2019re going to do what they say can\u2019t be done. We\u2019ve got a long way to go, and a short time to get there, so sit on back and watch old bandit run.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just sat there, looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOkay,\u201d he said \u201cDon\u2019t know that one? How about this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I pulled outta Pittsburgh, rolling down that Eastern Sea board. I got my diesel wound up and she's running like a never before. There's a speed trap ahead on the right, but I don't see a cop in sight. Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl just looked at him like he was crazy. But in a cute way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you suggest one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain with the blank look of incomprehension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny song at all. I\u2019ll join where I can. It will be fun, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him like she was studying his face for clues to what he was saying. Greg was suddenly aware of just how attracted to this girl he was. Not just the physical aspects either. They were a big bonus, no denying that. But there was a real intelligence when he looked into her eyes. She definitely wasn\u2019t stupid. He was really tempted to believe she was a player. But supposedly the only characters available on their server were pilots. They did have overlaps with the \u201cCalled to Battle Duty\u2019 server, but that was all for the infantry parts. And why would someone play as a mere waitress? It didn\u2019t make sense that she was a player and yet she was obviously more than an NPC. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to be a quest giver. To Greg that was the only answer that made sense. Whoever had programmed her subroutines had exceeded all expectations and knocked the Turing test out of the ballpark. For a few brief moments Greg fantasized that the side quest was to hole up in a remote cottage and wait out the war by teaching her how to speak Russian while she taught him German. Or maybe inventing a language all of their own. It wasn\u2019t until she sat straight up on her own side of the truck that Greg realized he\u2019d been daydreaming. He hoped to God he hadn\u2019t also been drooling like an idiot.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a good minute and a half of awkward silence. Singing still seemed like a good idea. But what? Christmas Carols? They were universal. Everybody knew the tunes and the words. But the bleak snow covered landscape about them certainly didn\u2019t inspire a Christmas like mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Greg suddenly had the perfect song.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.\u201d<br>\r\nGreg worked his way through the intro, not so much carrying the tune as dragging it by the heels.  <br>\r\nTo his delight she picked up on the tune and started singing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMama, ich nur einen Mann get\u00f6tet mit einer Pistole gegen seinen Kopf zog ich den Abzug, jetzt ist er verstorben.

Wenn ich nicht zur\u00fcck wieder morgen um diese Zeit bin. Weitermachen Sie, weitermachen Sie, als ob nichts wirklich wichtig ist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was amazed at the way her voice sweetened and softened the naturally guttural German words. It was like someone pouring warm honey over Lego Blocks. Encouraged, he sang the next part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo late, my time has come. Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAuf Wiedersehen, muss jeder, ich jetzt weggehen.

Then slashed it downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo someone sitting at the side of the road, say perhaps an insomniatic ground hog who had waken up in mid hibernation, getting up for a glass of water and now stared groggily out the kitchen window thinking he should probably head back to bed and try to squeeze in another 3 months of shut eye, the truck and it\u2019s two passengers would have appeared to be possibly insane. The driver was bouncing up and down, head banging along as he vocalized the guitar part of the song. The girl in the passenger seat too was head banging, pony tails flying about as she drummed on the dash along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Baw pap pap bap bow pap pab bow wowo wow bapappa\"<br>\r\n\u201cSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDu denkst also du kannst lieben mich und lass mich sterben?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Baby\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKann dies nicht f\u00fcr mich Baby\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust gotta get out\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWerfen Sie hier direkt raus\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis part works a whole lot better with a real guitar solo.\u201d He said, laughing.<br>\r\nShe was laughing right along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes they caught their breath. \u201cEveryone knows Queen\u2019s Bohemian Rhapsody.\u201d He said \u201cOf course, some of the Rhyming was off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was wondering if there was another song they both knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Frag mich nicht, ich werde nie erz\u00e4hlen.  Ich schaute auf Sie, als sie fiel. Und jetzt bist du in meinen Weg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg thought maybe she was singing a folk at first, yet wondered why the tune sounded familiar. Then he realized the song was a staple of \u2018Top Teen Pop Tracks\u2019 on the satellite radio he sometimes listened to in his car, when the radio was actually working. <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\u201cIch tausche meine Seele f\u00fcr einen Wunsch Pfennige und Groschen f\u00fcr einen Kuss Ich war nicht f\u00fcr diese Suche Aber jetzt bist du in meinen Weg\u201d <br>\r\nShe obviously liked the song, or at least dancing to it. She was rolling her shoulders in time to the song as she sang.<br>\r\n\u201cIhre starren hielt. Zerrissene Jeans. Haut zeigte. Hei\u00dfe Nacht. Wind wehte. Wo du denkst wirst du Baby?\u201d<br>\r\nHey traf ich nur dich. Und das ist doch verr\u00fcckt. Aber hier meine Nummer ist. So rufen Sie mich vielleicht.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop music wasn\u2019t his favorite genre, but he\u2019d heard this one enough times he could almost think of the name. <br>\r\nShe was just singing the middle part of the song when suddenly she grabbed his arm and sat bolt upright, staring into the rear view mirror. \u201cSchei\u00dfe. Jetzt nicht.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked into his own mirror, seeing nothing. Questioningly, he looked at the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEin verdammter Messerschmitt. 4 o Uhr Ebene.\u201d She said hurriedly, pointing back over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesserschmitt? Crap. Enemy fighters. And this stretch of road was the clear of cover, not even a tree. Just low scrub brush for almost a Kilometer in either direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg did the only thing he could think of doing and started weaving back and forth across the road, trying to make themselves as difficult a target as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNicht in einem vorhersagbaren Muster Sie Idioten!\u201d  the girl yelled. Reaching over and grabbing the steering wheel and holding it firmly. The truck started to slide sideways. She held it for a second, finally releasing her hold just before the sliding truck could leave the road. Fishtailing, Greg fought to bring it back under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe fuck are you trying to do? Get us killed? Greg shouted <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZuf\u00e4llige Bewegungen!  Zuf\u00e4llige Bewegungen!. Nicht in einem Muster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe road ahead of them erupted in flying dirt and snow as the Messherschmidt roared past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d missed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, there only seemed to be one fighter. A lone patrol without a wingman to follow behind and take out the target if he missed. Of course, the missed pass only meant they got to live until the next one, which looked to be in the immediate future as the fighter climbed and started to turn back for another pass. This time he came at them from the front. This time there would be no missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg slammed on the brakes, throwing open the door and diving to the road when the truck had slowed down enough for them to do so. As he hit the ground he recalled the advice he\u2019d been given during orientation. \u201cThe truck is going to be the fighter\u2019s primary target,\" one of the older drivers had said. \"Run at a right angle to the vehicle. The Kraut won\u2019t bother you as long as the truck is there.\u201d Greg shouted this at his passenger as he ran, forgetting she wouldn\u2019t understand a word of it. He ran until he heard the plane roar passed overhead again, then threw himself to the ground, scrabbling under a scrub brush to hide as the small explosions of cannon fire hitting frozen dirt died away. \u201cGo to ground as he\u2019s passing.\u201d The driver had said. \"He won\u2019t be able to keep an eye on you and see where you hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlat on the ground there was no man shaped shadow to define himself as a target, and the grey of his uniform blended in with the surrounding dirt and snow. From the air he'd look like another, maybe slightly larger, feature of the terrain. Or so he hoped that was how it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom under the thin cover of scrub Greg looked back at the truck. It had rolled to a stop, and was now a big black motionless target in the middle of the road, miraculously still untouched. He was hoping against hope that the girl had gotten out and was hiding somewhere along the road, yet knowing in his gut that she didn\u2019t have the same information he had. With any luck the self preservation instincts she seemed to be blessed with would make up for that.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNot a chance. To his astonishment she was not huddled under the semi concealing scrub.  Instead, she was standing beside the truck and waving her apron as the fighter came in for another pass. For a long moment he could only sit there, staring in shock. Thinking that it was a pretty stupid thing to be doing, even for an AI. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could gather his wits about him and shout a warning, she exploded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a long time after the noise of the fighter\u2019s engine had faded into the distance that Greg finally crawled out from under the scrub brush he\u2019d taken refuge under. Only to sink to his knees beside what was left of the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the longest time he just sat there, staring. Unable to fully comprehend what he was seeing at first, he took it in small details, like he was putting together a mental puzzle. Details like her left shoe had been knocked off and was sitting upright half way between her and the truck. That her toenails, visible through the sheer of her stocking, were painted red. That her skirt had hiked up when she fell, so high he could see her garter. That the garter was red and frilly and had a spare clip of bullets tucked into it. That higher up her bare navel looked flat and firm, and had a belly button that was small and cute and, unlike most girls he\u2019d seen pictures of, completely devoid of any piercings or jewelry. That her shirt was still tied in a tight knot just above that cute little navel. That there was very little of her left above the knot of the shirt, and nothing that didn\u2019t look like extra chunky salsa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes Greg managed to stop heaving and pushed himself upright, sitting on his heals and scooping up a handful from the skiff of snow on the rock beside him to try and clear the taste of bile still burning the back of his throat. He had a feeling he would never eat tacos again. The shear senselessness of it all weighed on him. One minute she\u2019d been so warm and alive; Sitting beside him laughing and singing as sweet as any angel. The next she was half of a bloody corpse beside a smoldering truck on a war torn roadway. When he finally rose to his feet he felt as cold and numb as the winter surrounding them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and started to shuffle away, only to stumble on something. It was her arm, the hand still clutching the white apron she\u2019d tried to wave the plane down with. Without thinking, he picked it up and carried it back and placed it next to where the rest of her lay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough that action made him feel, well, not better, but a sense of rightness. A small patch of relief pasted on a welling cloud of grief that threatened to overwhelm him. A purpose that got him moving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking around, he located and gathered up what other parts of her body he could find. An arm here. A shoulder there. A large lump that turned out to be a bare breast, possibly the same one he had that tantalizing glimpse of earlier; it\u2019s large brown areola and nipple now completely devoid of any sexual appeal what so ever. There were unidentified bits with shards of bone sticking out. And bits without. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head he retrieved from the scrub bush that she should have been hiding under. The bush had cushioned the fall, leaving her face oddly clean and unscathed. Not even a scratch marred her features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gathered up as much of her as he could find, then started to scrape out a shallow grave in the frozen ground with one of the hubcaps he found lying nearby. After a few minutes he started to curse his stupidity, threw it aside, and rooted around in the smoldering wreck of the truck until he located a proper shovel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he was still shell shocked, but the gore wasn\u2019t bothering him all that much now as he arranged the body in the shallow grave, taking care to tuck the skirt modestly under the knees. The jacket she had left in the truck when they had jumped he laid over the ruins of her chest. With the jacket covering the mess, the body almost looked normal, although even with the eyes closed her face still had a trace of that stunned rage that was her undoubtedly her last emotion, frozen into her features at the time of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burial deserved a moment of solemn silence, which Greg gave, kneeling at the head of the grave. Head bowed and eyes closed . Then he crossed himself the way he remembered she had crossed herself. It seemed appropriate.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was a GAZ which was the Russian equivalent, similar looking but with a more rounded nose, Still, Greg couldn\u2019t help but think of it by the American term Jeep. When it stopped three soldiers got out. Infantry by the looks of their uniforms. Two of them accosted Greg while the third checked out the still smoldering truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you ran into a bit of trouble.\u201d The first said, almost conversationally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Greg said. \u201cYou could say that. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re headed anywhere near Gulag Four, are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one under St. Athanasius\u2019?\u201d the second soldier said, glancing sideways at the first soldier in a way that made Greg uneasy. \u201cYeah. Actually, we\u2019re headed there now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou suppose I could get a lift?\u201d Greg said, in spite of his misgivings. It was too cold to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d The first soldier said, a bright smile flashing across his lips. The rest of his face didn\u2019t move. \u201cWe\u2019d be happy to give a fellow soldier a lift.\u201d  Then his eyes narrowed and his face got all serious again. \u201cI just need to see your orders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOrders?\u201d Greg asked with a sinking feeling in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Gone was any trace of a smile on the soldiers face. All business now, he held out his hand. \u201cTraveling papers. Transfer documents. Unit assignment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm,\u201d Greg faltered. \u201cI must have left them in the truck.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat true, Jack?\u201d The first soldier called, not even looking over his shoulder to the soldier currently ransacking the trucks cab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing in here.\u201d the one referred to as Jack called from the door of the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had them, Honest.\u201d Greg pleaded. \u201cMaybe I left them on the dash. That\u2019s it. I left them up on the dash and they blew away when we jumped out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d The soldier said slowly. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I don\u2019t think you ever had orders. You see, the last we saw this truck it was headed to St. Athanasius with another captured flyboy destined for the Gulag.  Then, it was to head towards Nekchtickovitch to pick up a load of munitions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man\u2019s eyes never left Greg\u2019s as he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept that here it is, halfway back to the front, and empty except for you and that dead hooker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s not a hooker.\u201d Greg protested. Why did everyone insist on seeing her that way? <br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a waitress. She serves beer.\u201d He stated defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d the soldier said with a thin smile. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a butler. And next you\u2019ll probably say that you\u2019re not a deserter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a deserter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvidence says otherwise.\u201d The man said, drawing his pistol. \u201cWhy else would you and your hooker be headed to the front in a stolen truck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not a hooker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are hereby charged with desertion and theft of Military Property. How do you plead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need an official plea for the record.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put me on trial. I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as not guilty then, shall I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said.\u201d Greg said desperately, looking at the others. They had come up while the first soldier had been talking and were standing with their own guns drawn in a half circle around him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuilty on all the charges.\u201d The first soldier said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late, Greg turned to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree guns went off simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first soldier watched Greg\u2019s body as it slowly stopped twitching. After a couple of minutes he picked up the shovel. Placing the point of it against Greg\u2019s throat he stomped hard, ignoring the blood that seeped out around the edge. Again he stomped, splattering gore on his pant leg and severing Greg\u2019s spinal column.  After adjusting the angle of the shovel he brought his foot down hard one last time, severing what remaining tissue was holding the head on the body. As the head rolled away he used the shovel to scooped it up and carry it over to the jeep, dumping it onto the passenger side floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d one of the other guards yelled. \u201cI have to sit back there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI called shotgun. Not my problem.\u201d The second called. \u201cHey, you want we should take the other head too? It\u2019s already off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the jeep and its sorry cargo roared off, spinning tires sending a spray of slush and dirt across Greg\u2019s body which lay beside the road where it had fallen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, a light snow began to fall, gradually dusting the bodies with a thin coating of white that covered the signs of violence with a pristine veil. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could have sworn she was already standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why was it so dark all of a sudden? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground had turned unseasonably soft and spongy, and her feet tangled in something, pitching her forward. As she tried to regain her balance her left foot slid off the edge of whatever she was standing on and she fell in a spinning circle that landed her flat on her back, knocking the wind out of her. As stars spun around her head she struggled to catch her breath and free herself from whatever was tangled around her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn exasperated voice came from the darkness surrounding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, goodie!\u201d It said peevishly. \u201cLindsay\u2019s back!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bedside light snapped on, revealing an annoyed looking Linda, sitting upright in her cot. For a moment Lindsay just stared, and not because of the small stuffed bear tucked under Linda\u2019s left arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my nightgown.\u201d she stammered eventually, her mind totally coming up blank on anything else to say.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou woke me up to tell me that?\u201d Linda asked. \u201cMine are all in the laundry. Besides, I didn\u2019t think you would mind.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind?\u201d Lindsay said absently as her brain struggled to shift mental gears and make sense out of the sudden change of surroundings. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind. After all I said you were welcome to borrow\u2026\u201d her voice trailed off as her brain double clutched and got the gears to mesh. Suddenly everything made sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn intense sense of relief and joy flooded her.  She struggled to her feet and threw herself at Linda. \u201cOh God it\u2019s so good to see you!\u201d she sobbed, grabbing her still groggy room mate in a fierce hug. \u201cYou have no idea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, careful. You almost knocked me out of the bed\u2026\u201d Linda said, although only half serious. It was obviously Lindsay needed a hug, so she hugged her, although not nearly half as hard as her re-spawned roommate was holding her. \u201cThere, there.\u201d She said soothingly \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose one day I\u2019ll look though this door and NOT find the two of you like this.\u201d a voice said from behind her. Lindsay looked up to see Colleen leaning against the door jam, a bemused look on her face. Lindsay realized that once again she had been found stark naked and hugging the crap out of her room mate. Maybe one of these times she\u2019ll re-spawn wearing clothes, but at the moment she didn\u2019t care, even as Colleen was joined by a couple of the other members of The Mad Cows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless of her nudity, Lindsay jumped up and rushed towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am so glad to see you guys. You have no idea how glad I am to see you guys\u201d she babbled as she grabbed as many as she could in a massive group hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Those who hadn\u2019t been woken up by Lindsay\u2019s scream had been roused by those who had. Not one of them seemed to mind too much about being up early, especially Leslie. She was very happy her theory about violent in-game deaths being fatal looked like it had been just  dis proven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Lindsay had reached the part where her and Blanket Guy had stolen the truck the cafeteria had began serving breakfast, so Lindsay loaded up a tray and finished off her story as she worked her way through a mound of her favorite German Apple pancakes, with a side of bacon, eggs, hash browns, toast, and anything else she could get a fork into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap, girl!\u201d Colleen said as Lindsay came back with a second tray piled nearly as high as her first. \u201cAre you eating for two now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith the size of those helpings it\u2019s more like three!\u201d Addison chirped.  .  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m starving.\u201d Leslie protested. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten anything except that bowl of gruel since I was captured. I\u2019m making up for lost calories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you said it was two bowls.\u201d Lorraine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne was half empty, so that doesn\u2019t count. And they were small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Addison added \u201cIf that\u2019s what the Russians eat I\u2019m glad I\u2019m on the German side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve played the Russian side.\u201d the Colonel said, watching Lindsay eat. \u201cUsually they eat as well as we do.\u201d There was a thoughtful look on her face. \u201cGruel is more like what you\u2019d feed prisoners or captives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I certainly qualified as a prisoner!\u201d Lindsay retorted \u201cLocked up in that room with nothing to eat and forced to wait tables.\u201d Her face darkened \u201cAnd for food that pig of an officer wanted me to\u2026!\u201d Lindsay slammed her fist into the table, causing the plates on the table to jump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she apologized, then closed her eyes and took a deep breath to calm down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay\u201d Bev said, wiping the spilled coffee off the table in front of her. \u201cThat was right before you shot him, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, pretty much.\u201d Lindsay admitted, turning back to her stack of pancakes, although her appetite wasn\u2019t the same as it was a minute ago. Still, a girl has got to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom the sounds of it he got what he deserved.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought a grim smile to Lindsay\u2019s face \u201cYeah, I guess he did.\u201d She said, looking around for her fork. To her surprise it was stuck handle first into the table top. When had that happened? Lindsay tugged at it, but it was stuck fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, could someone get me another fork, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was tossed her way, which she deftly caught in midair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, yeah.\u201d She continued, a little calmer. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they were all eating bear steaks and beet stew, while all I got was gruel from the soup trolley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA whole soup trolley, just for you?\u201d The Colonel asked thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot just for me,\u201d Lindsay said around a mouthful of pancake, \u201cI think Blanket Guy was supposed to be delivering it to the basement. They had a holding cell down there and I caught a glimpse of people in prison uniforms when the guard opened the door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout how big was this trolley?\u201d The Colonel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout average.\u201d Lindsay said, shrugging. She pointed towards the back of the mess with her new fork. \u201cSame as the ones in the kitchen there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you saw how much gruel was in the pot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really. I remember the pot said 305 Liter on the handle, \u2018cause the number struck me as an odd measurement for a liquid.  But I\u2019m pretty sure it wasn\u2019t quite full. Come to think of it, there was a tag on the side that said 256 Litry Supa. Probably Russian for 256 liters of supper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Colonel got up and refilled her coffee cup, her expression indicating she was mulling something in her head while she did so. \u201cHow many men do you think you could feed with 256 liters\u2019 of soup? She asked eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. 100? 200? Not something I ever thought of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrampa use to work in a soup kitchen.\u201d Addison piped up. \u201cHe often said he could feed 100 men with 5 gallons of soup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a reference to the loaves and fishes thing is it?\u201d That was Lorraine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLoaves and Fishes?\u201d Addison asked, a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Colleen said. \u201cLike in the bible when Jesus was trying to feed the multitude and all he had was a basket of fish and a loaf of bread. Although personally I think he might of had a \u2018Skip the Dishes\u2019 app on his phone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes no sense.\u201d Lorraine replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Addison added \u201cSkip the Dishes is only in North America, so it wouldn't be a bible reference. Anyway, it was an actual thing Grampa used when figuring out how much food to buy. Five gallons for 100 people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that five gallons US or five gallons imperial?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s say five gallons US. That means\u201d Lindsay closed her eyes and moved her finger, as if she was writing on a chalk board only she could see \u201c5 by 3.78 equals 18.9 liters to feed 100 people, There was 256 Liters, so divide 256 by 18.9 comes to\u201d her eyes snapped open. \u201cHoly crap! That\u2019s food for almost 1300 people!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She said, seeing the look on the others faces. \u201cI do math in my head. It\u2019s not that hard.\u201d She trailed off \u201cNot for me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re thinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet you two.\u201d Leslie said before turning back to Lindsay. \u201cYou weren\u2019t here, but a First Lieutenant Mackentyre came by yesterday. He\u2019d been looking into the MIA\u2019s like you\u2019d suggested, and according to the figures he\u2019s dug up, there are an astonishing number of players that are listed as MIA even thought they have had more than enough time to make their way back to base. 1256 of them, to be exact. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three hours later Lindsay was in front of the 83rd\u2019s hangers, squeezing through yet another belly hatch of an HE111 idling on the tarmac. This time it was the flight leaders. As she clambered up to the cockpit she recognized Captain Robert Stone from her jogging group, already at the controls going through the preflight checks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome aboard\u201d he said, as Lindsay settled herself onto the bench behind the nose gun. \u201cI hear you are going to guide us to some precise bombing this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d Lindsay said. She was still a little bewildered at the speed of which Colonel Helgameire had put together the raid, but she was determined not to show it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering when you'd get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the delay. I had to adjust the settings in the other bombers, and took longer than expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really think we\u2019ll pull this off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you and your boys can hold your pattern, and I don\u2019t mess up. Yeah\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTower to Maxim 20 leader,\" the radio crackled \"Prepare for takeoff.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger that, tower. All aircraft, signal ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all the other pilots had indicated their readiness, Captain Roberts pressed the mike again. \u201cAll aircraft, this is flight leader. Pull chocks and prepare for takeoff.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that, the Captain opened the throttles and the heavily laden bomber began to bump and bounce as it moved down the runway, closely followed by the eight other aircraft of the flight. Unlike the fighter pilots, the bombers seem to relish taking off in formation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the wheels retracted Captain Roberts made his final transmission. \u201cTower, this is flight leader. All birds are in the air. Operation Maxim 20 is on it\u2019s way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger that, flight leader.\u201d The tower responded \u201cGood luck boys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOperation Maxim 20.\u201d Captain Roberts said to Lindsay over the noise of the engines. \u201cWhat\u2019s that code name mean, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt means,\u201d Lindsay responded \u201cI\u2019ve finally found something about my commanding officer to love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind his goggles Roberts raised his eyebrows, but didn\u2019t say anything. A lot of the information in the hurried meeting this morning was passed around on a need to know basis, and a lot of stuff was glossed over. He was dying to know what his curvy bombardier was referring to, but didn\u2019t want to distract her from the job. His commander had stressed the importance of the mission, and that somehow the young first lieutenant with the ample assets had a major role to play in pulling it off. He only hoped there would be an opportunity later on to get some answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after that, they both got busy with their own jobs, and, and didn\u2019t speak until long after they were airborne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c5 Minutes to target\u201d Captain Robert radioed to the rest of the flight when Lindsay signaled him. \u201cCheck position and altitude.\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay had been hunched over her station since they had changed course after takeoff. Unlike the previous flights where she\u2019d taken the time to enjoy the scenery, this time she fretted and fussed, checking and rechecking the settings. Current altitude. Heading. Wind direction both aloft and on the ground. Making small adjustments as she noted discrepancies between the posted reports she was reading and what she could see through the bombsite. Until the watch she had borrowed from the flight stores at the 87th had indicated it was time to give the five minute warning. Now she closed her eyes and breathed deep, trying to calm her nerves. So much was riding on this mission, and now the moment of truth was almost on them. After several moments her nerves steadied so she opened her eyes and looked back into the bombsite. Just like before the control of the big plane was divided between her control station and Captain Stone\u2019s. With him keeping the bomber straight and level, she concentrated on the task of making the small course corrections that would get them over their target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this mission she\u2019d been issued her own headset plugged into the radio, and she triggered her throat mic, saying as crisply and precisely as she could \u201cMaxim 20 leader to all ships. Confirm position and altitude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her in the other bombers that made up the strike force the pilots confirmed they were right where they were supposed to be. Strung out behind her like three chevrons, one behind the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConfirm fuse delay by the numbers.\u201d she called back, once everyone acknowledged they were in position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one the following bombers radioed back the delay on their bomb fuse, which Lindsay checked off against the clipboard beside her knee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far so good. \u201cConfirm radio delay and sync.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the radio link in place, all the bomb release triggers were linked to the one in Lindsay\u2019s plane. When she pushed the button, the nine aircraft of the MAXIM 20 strike force would drop their load of bombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, each aircraft radioed back that their link was ready. Lindsay dutifully put a check mark on her clipboard beside each aircraft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back into the bomb sight. Almost there. Wetting her lips with a tongue that was too dry for the job, she gave the command. \u201cArm bomb release.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the litany of confirmations came back. Behind her pilots flipped the switches linking their bomb release with hers until all were ready.  Now all it would take is a press of her finger and 32,400 Kilograms of high explosive in hardened steel casing would rain down on an unsuspecting enemy. Lindsay poised her finger above the button as the cross hairs crept slowly closer to her release point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay held her breath, then stabbed her finger down as the cross hairs intersected the release point at last. The plane lurched and shuddered as the payload was released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBombs away\u201d she said into her throat mike, unnecessarily. Behind her she could imagine what was happening on each of the aircraft. The radio beeping as it acknowledged it had received the order to drop. The short preprogrammed delay to allow that aircraft to move into the position that would allow the bombs to hit where they were calculated to do the most damage. Then the shuddering of release as the bombs dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay imagined all of this, repeated for each of the eight aircraft following. If she\u2019d done her job well the enemy stronghold would be wiped out. If she hadn\u2019t, if she missed, there would be little or no damage. Worse, the Russians would been alerted that the Germans were onto their scheme and would take steps to prevent the success of future raids. With the familiar feeling of butterflies in her gut Lindsay racked the sight backwards, zooming out a little, watching the target and barely breathing as the unseen bombs streaked downward. Focusing on the cliff face and the single truck at the bottom that marked the loading dock, the only part visible of the labyrinth under the mountain where their comrades were being held. For as long as she could she watched it, until her aircraft passed overhead and the view was blocked by the top of the cliff the church was built on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she held her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the parking lot at the base of the cliff exploded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh Lindsay pulled off her headset. \u201cMaxim 20\u201d, she said to no one in particular. Then she buried her face in her hands.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay was sitting at a table with the rest of the 127th. The 104th mess hall was larger than the officers club, so today it was hosting the apr\u00e8s bombing party for the combined forces from the mornings raid. In typical Lindsay fashion, she was not saying much of anything. Just letting the jokes and conversation wash over her as usual. Occasionally people would wander by and congratulate her about the job, and she was basking in the attention. Sure, she was proud of the accomplishment. But there was a difference between being justifiably proud of your own achievements, and having a whole bunch of people recognizing that you had done them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have to be careful, she decided. A person could get addicted to that feeling of pride and self confidence. At least it covered that persistent feeling of nagging self doubt that threatened to crawl out from under that rock in the back of her mind, in spite of the large amount of alcohol she had carefully placed on top of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought depressed her a little, and she was staring at the mouth of her beer bottle wondering why that was so when her mussing was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHey there, Lieutenant.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay looked up. It was Captain Roberts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Captain\u201d she replied, maybe a little more cheerfully than she was actually feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was hoping to congratulate you on a good job up there today, and maybe buy you the first beer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little late for that,\u201d Lindsay grinned, waving her bottle, \u201cBut you can buy me my fifth if you want.\u201d She tipped back her bottle and drained it. \u201cOr maybe it\u2019s the sixth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she put the empty bottle on the table she was surprised to see the Captain had another one ready for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlanned ahead did you?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, the Captain laughed.\u201d That\u2019s what being a good pilot is all about. Cheers!\u201d he said, tilting his bottle in Lindsay\u2019s direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheers.\u201d She laughed, clinking the neck of her bottle against his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look much happier now than when you got off my plane earlier.\u201d He said after a couple of minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sorry about that.\u201d She shrugged \u201cStress does that to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d The Captain said \u201cAt first I thought it was because you hit the parking lot instead of the church. But then everyone was on about how successful the raid was. How does that work out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the things they hadn\u2019t had time for, before the raid, was explaining to everyone exactly what they were trying to accomplish. Lindsay took another swallow and thought her way through the explanation.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said \u201cYou know the bombs we dropped were deep penetrators, right? That\u2019s why we drop them from so high. So they can gather enough kinetic energy to sink deep into the dirt and rock before they explode. Which is great when used against buried installations. But even the deepest penetrator we have wouldn\u2019t have been able to get through the mountain and reach the lower levels where the prisoners were kept. So what we did was the next best thing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe blew up the parking lot?\u201d the Captain asked \u201cWhat, so they can\u2019t move the prisoners out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHardly.\u201d Lindsay laughed \u201cThe parking lot was at about the same level as the dungeons, and right at the end of a box canyon. Since we couldn\u2019t hit the target directly, we hit beside it. The bombs I dropped from the three lead aircraft sank really deep into the soft earth under the parking lot and created a huge underground crater. Plus a shock wave that should have also weakened or collapsed any foundation structure. Then the bombs from the second and third wings sheared the face of the mountain off, collapsing it down into the crater hole and turning the impenetrable underground fortress into a collapsed pile of impenetrable rubble. Even if we didn\u2019t get the whole structure anything left should have collapsed on itself from the secondary shock waves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Roberts just stood there, gazing in awe. \u201cThat\u2019s brilliant!\u201d he finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know, right?\u201d Lindsay replied. \u201cI stole the idea from the Brits. They called them Earthquake Bombs. They were quite proud of them.\u201d She took another drink from her beer. \u201cHey, did you know that for years after the war ended they had a live 10,000kg bomb on display outside the RAF base in Lincolnshire. Families would come and look at it, have picnics, take pictures of their kids sitting on it. All with typical British aplomb. Then someone decided it was too dangerous and hauled it off to a field and set it off. The blast could be heard for 60km. You wanna know what they called it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Captain gave a smile. \u201cLet me guess, they called it a Maxim 20?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. They called it Ten Ton Tessie. I would have called it a 10 Double K Kelly myself, you know? Two Ks \u2018cause it was 10 kilo kilograms. But maybe that sounds like a marathon runner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something about if you\u2019re not willing to bomb your own position, you\u2019re not going to win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\u201d a voice interrupted from behind them. \u201cThe maxim reads If you\u2019re not willing to shell your own position, you\u2019re not willing to win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay spun around and saluted crisply, or tried to. At least as crisply as the five beers in her would let her. She was relatively successful in her attempt though, if you count that she didn\u2019t blacken her own eye as success. And gave bonus points for not falling off her bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Colonel,\u201d she stammered \u201cI was just putting the quote into a perspective the Captain here could relate to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I gather. Still, if you\u2019re going to go about quoting Schlock, you might as well get it right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSchlock, eh?\u201d The Captain asked \u201cA brilliant military strategist like that Sun Tsu guy? The one who wrote the art of war?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHardly,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cSchlock is an anamorphic brown blob who is a character in a relatively popular  Web Comic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sometimes, when a person is thinking something is very profound, and then they are told the source was something they totally didn\u2019t expect, that shatters their expectations of what they were thinking they were going to hear and kicks their brain goes into neutral. When that happens sometimes something embarrassing will slip out.  Something like \u201cYou love your Colonel because of a web comic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sometimes all the conversation in a room just happens to stop just at the right time and allows everybody around you to hear that comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately this was not one of those times, at least in relation to the ambient noise level in the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the blurted out comment, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out the only three people who actually heard it were actively involved in the current conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Lindsay been reasonably sober, she would have found herself desperately wished there was at least one fewer person who had heard. Possibly two, if she could push her luck that far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially since one of those persons just mentioned now looked at Lindsay, raising her eyebrows questioningly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrdinarily, Lindsay would have cowered, and possibly ran, but today with courage born of, and bolstered by, the beer in her belly, Lindsay decided to brazened it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, in spite of her ears reddening. \u201cAnyone who can quote the 77 Maxims is obviously a fan of the strip. Like I said. One more thing to love about her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, the Colonel was smiling at her. \u201cWhy, thank you Lindsay. Although I doubt if I can really remember any more than eight or nine of them, and certainly not all of them by number.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d gushed an emboldened Lindsay heedlessly, \u201cAny fan of my favorite space opera deserves the love and admiration of the lowly staff who serve beneath her. Of those who serve and obey and willingly die for her. And that I would do willingly. I would be happy, no, eager, no, honored to die to please my brave commander.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLindsay.\u201d The Colonel said, still smiling, but with her eyes hardening and her voice taking on a dangerous tone. \u201cAre you truly so willing to die? Right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course I am,\u201d Lindsay continued, before catching sight of the Colonels smile. \u201cWell, maybe.\u201d She faltered \u201cActually, probably not.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had layered it on a little thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen shut up.\u201d the Colonel said in a tone that suggested she might be joking, but did you want take the chance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir. Shutting up now, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey Lindsay\u201d Colleen said through the open door of the hut Lindsay and Linda had shared the last couple of days. \u201cFinal scores are up, if you\u2019re interested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay looked up from the carryall she was packing. Why she was bothering to do so was a bit of a mystery to her, after all. It wasn\u2019t like her luggage was going to accompany her back into the real world. Still, she supposed the ritual gave her a bit of closure. One more firm indication that the game was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how did we do?\u201d she asked, carefully shaking out and folding a blouse she\u2019d never gotten around to wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of us qualified the cash prizes, unfortunately. A couple of honorable mentions. Team spirit award for cooperation. One for fewest losses due to enemy action. That sort of thing. You got an honorable mention in the category of most versatile pilot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose that gave me enough points to put me back into the black?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope,\u201d Colleen said, shaking her head. \u201cStill well in the red.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be all the penalty points she\u2019d racked up when she\u2019d dropped the bombs. 1200 penalty points each for every friendly killed. And because the bombs had released on her command, all the penalties were awarded to her alone. A bit unfair when the pilots on the raid had actually been awarded points for success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it helps at all, the 127th has the dubious distinction of having a pilot with the all time record of penalty points\u201d Colleen continued, as if pressing the point home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just don\u2019t come back from a negative score that was well into seven digits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of the fact that her actions had released over 1000 German airmen and changed the balance of power in the game,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all the prisoners killed by Lindsay\u2019s bombing raid had re-spawned, the German side was suddenly fully manned and able to take advantage of all the equipment that had stockpiling up. Eager for revenge over their treatment and with the balance of power now heavily shifted to their side, the Germans lost no time in wiping the Russian forces off the map where ever they could find them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days and three missions later, the game was officially over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that was left to do was collect the awarded points and pack their stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd say goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the 127th was crowded into the small hanger that had become their ad-hoc officers club solely because it was right next to the tool shed Leslie was calling her office. The industrious girls had scrounged what they could to outfit the temporary space; there was an old phonograph and a stack of records in place of the Jukebox. An old washing tub filled with ice sat perched on a couple of saw horses and served to keep the beer cold. Someone had done a half decent job of copying the squadron logo onto a bed sheet to hang on the wall in place the original company mascot. Although a few chairs and benches had been pilfered from the 104th when someone was convinced to look the other way, the tables were still roughly fabricated of shipping pallets on top of parts crates, some of them still containing spare parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rough atmosphere seemed somehow appropriate for the going away party; Adding an atmosphere of spontaneity to the gathering. The few beers rapidly deteriorated into a round of tearful hugs and earnestly vague promises of keeping in touch, and the next thing Lindsay knew she was walking through a doorway in Leslie's office she knew wasn\u2019t there an hour ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she passed the threshold the world dissolved into flecks of colourless shades of drab grey, swirling and coalescing into the washed out image of a room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay\u2019s living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a grunt of effort Lindsay pulled off the headset and pushed it aside, rubbing his temples and the sides of his face where the memory foam edging had been pressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fluid ease of the body he had gotten used to, it took him a couple of minutes to re-acquaint himself with the way his real body worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd smelled. The odor was almost overwhelming as he unsteadily disconnected the harness of tubes and wires and climbed unsteadily out of the suspension cradle. A shower was his first priority, he decided, then changed his mind as a wave of dizziness swept over him and he staggered, barely catching himself against a conveniently close wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he decided. Something to eat first, then a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggily, he made his way across the tiny apartment to the kitchen, deciding on the way that prepping a microwave meal was beyond him at the moment, and settling for a can of meal replacement from the fridge. <br>\r\nHe downed the first while standing in front of the fridge, then grabbed a second when the first failed to fill the gaping maw of hunger inside him. He was actually on his third by the time he felt energetic enough to pay attention to the recorded voice from the refrigerator; a tiny, cheerful sounding voice that endlessly repeated a cheery good afternoon greeting, and reminding him that he needed to buy milk and eggs, that the tuna casserole was out of date, and also that the refrigerator door was still open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the door closed, Lindsay turned and staggered into the tiny bathroom attached to the kitchen to tackle the task of taking a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust his luck the building hot water was out again. Which meant that his planed fifteen minute cleansing became a mere two minutes of slightly tepid rinsing. Adequate enough to flush away the worst of the dried sweat and crud that was crusted to his skin, but did little to sooth his soul. Still he felt marginally reenergized afterwards, enough to throw a pair of sweats and order a pizza for dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he waited for it to arrive he turned his attention to cleaning the VR cradle. Cleaning the cradle was a ritual that he had forced on himself early on, and was now an ingrained habit. Even though every component and surface was made of, and treated with, the highest quality anti-bacterial materials available, not a week went by without there being a news article on someone who had developed toxic shock or a septic infection that was being blamed on a dirty VR Rig. Horror stories abounded of people who had to have toes, fingers, legs, and even genitals either partly or completely amputated because of septic bacterial infections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleaning the rig wasn\u2019t an inconvenience, it was a necessity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the designers made the rig as easy to clean as possible. Armed with a bucket of hot soapy water (boiled on the stove) and a couple of cleaning rags he wiped away the weekends worth of caked on sweat and other stuff, which is what his mind preferred to call the goo that leaked around the joints and valves of the tubes that carried away the body waste. Then he sprayed everything with a specially formulated blend of rubbing alcohol and room deodorizer. Mountain Fresh Breeze this fragrance was called. He usually preferred it over the Lavender Garden he\u2019d bought by accident because it was on sale, and only kept only in the event there was a chance he would have female visitors unexpectedly drop by. That this hadn\u2019t happened yet, and was unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future, was not a factor in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizza arrived as he was putting everything away, so he grabbed a couple of slices, a beer, and settled in front of his terminal to get caught up on the news as he ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Huge breasts \u2013 each a luscious mound easily more than twice the size of her head \u2013 extended out from her torso. Long and shapely legs supported her, with thighs and a butt that wouldn\u2019t look out of place on a fertility goddess. You couldn\u2019t resist giving her a bit of a belly either, a plush and soft looking little thing, but it was relatively tiny and almost hidden in the middle of what lay above and below. The face was sculpted to be noble and refined looking but with more than a little hint of sensuality in those plump lips and luminous green eyes. Crimson wavy hair spilled around the curving horns and floppy ears that sprouted from her head, the thick waves cascading to her waist. A tail extended out from just above her rump, ending in a tuft of hair similar to that from her head. You had chosen to forgo an udder though, figuring her breasts made up for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, you hit the confirm button and watched as the cow apparently vanished. It didn\u2019t take you long to realize that you were now looking from her/your eyes, looking down at the canyon of cleave between your breasts. Soon after you were dropped into the sci-fi universe and started to enjoy yourself. Other than the temporary mess you had become when you found out about how you were trapped in here, you had been steadily exploring and having the time of your life.

You were in line behind a Wausk and in front of a Qlef\u2019e. The short scaly little guy behind you was even more pungent than the usual for his species, while the lumbering oaf in front of you blocked much of your view. Your arms chafed in the binders though there was little you could do about, especially with them secured behind your back. Your legs were similarly bound, but there was at least some slack in the energy cable between those to allow you just enough space to take shambling half-steps. <i>Probably still quicker than having to cart the prisoners around</i> you supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wausk stepped forward and you heard a voice asking confirmation of ID and the deep bass response before he trudged up a loading ramp into the bowels of the ship. You stepped forward as quickly as you could, coming to a pair of guards; the Wir held a datapad, while the human at his side cradled a rifle in his arms. The Wir looked up from the pad, his four little beady eyes almost bugging out at the sight of you, your frame more than a little more exposed than usual due to the ill-fitting prison uniform\u2014the Avarian Union likely didn\u2019t get too many prisoners with your build. You rolled your eyes as the Wir looked you up and down, his thick tongue wetting his rubbery lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re\u2026\u201d looking down at the pad \u201c\u2026Sarah Wallace?\u201d You nodded your head, that\u2019s all you could do with the muzzle across your face. \u201cI think I might have to come\u2026visit you when we\u2019re underway. May as well before you get totally broken in where you\u2019re going,\u201d he gave a bubbling hum at that, his species way of laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growled in the mask, glad that the sounds of the port around you kept it from reaching anyone else\u2019s ears. He gave another you lecherous look before pointing you up the gangplank. The human said something to the other, too low for you to hear, but the Wir laughed again as he turned to watch the hillocks of your rump retreating towards the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the ship was in marginally better repair, though the sound of the air filtration system gave you some concern. You were shoved along by another guard \u2013 this one a Gevar in what looked to be riot gear \u2013 till you came to a cramped cell. Another push caused you to stumble inside, and the door slammed shut behind you. The only light you had was an extremely dim reddish glow, barely enough to see the wall in front of you. You growled as you realized that you were still bound hand and foot, they obviously weren\u2019t even going to let their prisoners get the least bit comfortable. You managed to find the \u201cbed\u201d though it was only a hard metal platform extending out of the wall with no padding of any sort. The way you were restrained meant that you couldn\u2019t lay on your back, and even lying on your side proved tricky, but you made do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, you felt the familiar rumble of a ship lifting off from a planet, eventually followed by the lingering sense of vertigo and nausea that an improperly tuned or maintained void drive jump could cause. You were actually more than a little glad that was all that happened, if the drive was in a really bad condition the ship could be ripped apart or worse. With nothing else to do, you closed your eyes to wait, but quickly opened them again as you heard a sound.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The exact mechanics and spread of VR in everyday life is entirely open to the individual writer, but here's a general basis:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVR has advanced to the point where users are able to be experience full-sensory, convincing, computer-generated worlds. More advanced VR may come equipped with perception dilation technology, which essentially overclocks the brain, allowing hours of simulation<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany variant of VR technology exist, though they can loosely be divided into two groups: anchored and inserted. Anchored is where the user remains in their body, and a computer-brain interface is established, usually via a headset or implanted neural lattice, while the sensations of the artificial world is beamed directly into the brain. the alternative, insertion VR, downloads the mind of the user into the simulation itself. The user's body is left an empty shell, awaiting the mind to be replaced back in the body at the end of the simulation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth types come with inherent weaknesses. Anchored V has been known to cause brain damage under high perception dilation, in simulations featuring extremes of sensations, or if the user is unplugged unexpectedly. Though real world motor control is generally suppressed, users may still injure themselves accidentally. In semi-rare cases, the RL body may manifest injuries incurred in simulation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInsertion VR avoids most of these problems by seperating the mind and body completely - this also allows much greater perception dilation than anchored VR without any risk of melting the brain. The most obvious downside is that the body is left totally vulnerable in the real world and any disruption of the brain-computer link may leave the downloaded user stuck in the simulation until a connection can be reestablished. To reduce these risks, the users body may be Installed with a Bodyguard program, a rudimentary AI that takes care of the users body in RL for the simulation duration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the biggest risk in VR with both types is of the user becoming unable to leave the simulated world. If this happens - usually through user or programming error - the user's body may be at risk of starvation, dehydration, and dying, particularly if perception dilation is not active. Alternatively, if it is active, the mind may experience years or even decades inside. They may even forgot that they are in a simulation and lose their identity completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo reduce the risk of this, most simulations have programmed safeguards and means of logging out. Should a timer not be set, many scenarios have an end goal, a mission or mission that when completed will end the game automatically. Should this fail, many simulations come with a carefully concealed 'exit', usually a door, often with a distinguishing feature, which when passed through will return the player to their body. Safety words can be set which end the simulation immediately. Finally, anybody accustomed to the programming language, may use the in-world console to end or at least modify the parameters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all the risks, virtual reality has become enmeshed in almost all aspects of life. Entertainment, gaming, education, Training sims, teleconferencing, even dating, all have capitalised on the new tech. The virtual sex industry is booming. As is, unfortunately, virtual identity theft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIA (Virtual Identity Assistance), the government agency that has come to oversee the use of the technology, lists the following safety guidelines on its website. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Users must be aged over 18, and be of robust physical and mental health<br>\r\n2. Never under any circumstances, remove or switch-off a VR headset that is currently in use. <br>\r\n3. Do not enter VR while under the effects of alcohol or other drugs. <br>\r\n4. Have friends keep watch over your body while under VR.<br>\r\n5. Take a fifteen minute break for every hour of play.<br>\r\n6. Do not use equipment calibrated for other users. <br>\r\n7. Do not use the log-in details and/or assumed identity of other users. Users found breaking this will face criminal prosecution under the Identity Protection Act of 2014.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally nobody takes the slightest bit of notice of these guidelines. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Total Body Conversion is a type of VR where the physical body of the user is downloaded in its entirety into a computer simulated world as pure data. It involves the use of a matter-to-energy conversion unit to transform the person's mass into electrical essence. The personality profile is then extracted from this data and installed into a simulated avatar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally the process of turning mass into energy produces a vast amount of electrical energy, enough to power the simulation for years. The excess electricity may be sold to the national grid for a healthy profit. Because of the lucrative nature of this VR, many companies offer this treatment for free. Total Body Conversion is now seen as a potential solution to both the looming energy crisis and overpopulation of the 2020s, with many governments offering incentives for citizens to undergo the process, especially as they approach retirement age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obvious drawback the TBC is that the process destroys the body and users cannot be returned to the real world unless able to pay the expensive reassembly fees. The energy-to-matter process required to reassemble the body is less efficient, and thus costly to perform. If a user lacks the funds to reassemble their body, they effectively become trapped in VR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany companies attempt to aleviate these fears by offering a supply of soulless bodies (bodies which have lost their original minds inside VR) to their users every year, as assurances that there is always the possibility of an exit. However, demand for these bodies always outstrips demand, thus ensuring that within VR players are constantly vieing for one of these bodies, either in tournaments or through the accumulation of vast amounts of virtual wealth in order to buy their escape.</span></div></div>",

Snapping your head around you expect to see your killer, but it's a cute Japanese girl with too much gloss, applied unevenly over her lipstick. She's wearing a tiny bikini, more or less. Her lush curves overflow the meagre scraps of her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's typically rather short, you tower over her by four or five inches. But she's blessed with greater than average curves, especially for such a small girl. She has a young face, which attest to her maturity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suki..... I said wait...\" a male voice bellows from the cabin. It is full of mock anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki winks at you, her tongue darting out, slipping over her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit... you think, it's cum... she's enjoying slurping down the excess cum from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't let Sindi, have all the fun.\" she beams back, before heading off down the forest path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Brad... catch me...\" she taunts her man, as she runs.

If there's going to be any sex, you'll be on the receiving end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door thumps open, and you see a guy getting dressed as he comes. An open shirt hangs from his shoulders, exposing his little male nipples, and muscular chest, the shirt flapping loosely as he struggles to tuck it into his trousers. He's wearing some baggy short, but from the huge bulge you assume he's Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile widens when he sees where your gaze has fallen.

Dark clouds swirl into a previously sunny sky, plunging the clearing into deep shadow. A damp wind tugs at your dress and a few drops of rain splatter against your sunglasses. In just a few seconds, the scene has become far more ominous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously turning back towards the cabin, you are shocked to see a bulky figure slides around the corner of the cabin, it's face obscured by a blank white hockey mask, blood red eyes staring at you through the slits. The rotting remains of a boiler suit hang from a physique grotesquely swollen with muscle. In its right hand is a machete dripping blood, while in its left it holds something matted with bloody hair. It tosses it at your feet. You yelp and leap back as Sindi's severed head rolls to a stop in the mud, her lips and eyes open in a dead expression of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure advances towards you slowly and you discover yourself frozen in horror. Wait, not horror. The program is intentionally limiting your movements, you realise as you're unable to twitch so much as a finger, forcing you into the role of helpless cheerleader with the most blunt method.<i>This is cheating!</i> you think in anger and terror as the figure raises the machete and swings down. At the last moment, the program releases its hold just long enough for you to raise your arm in defence, which is severed neatly at the wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't expected the pain to be so visceral, so real, and you find yourself screaming high and loud as the machete is swung again and again. You drop to the dirt as your legs are cut clean out from beneath you with two powerful blows, face down in runny, bloody mud. A gnarled hang twists in your raven locks and you feel the machete sever your head from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your severed head is carried away, the semi-transparent screen appears in your vision. \"You are dead, Barbi. Try again in 5...4...3...2...1....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you're back, alive and whole, before a roaring fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You up for a spot of skinny dipping at the lake?\" Sindi smiles and leans in closer, planting a passionate kiss on your lips, \"and we can tease the guys too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's odd. You know your own murder that you just experienced was fake, but it felt so real. Suddenly you've never been more happy to be alive. You find yourself kissing her back eagerly, almost crying tears of happiness. \"Save some for the boys,\" she giggles as you finally part lips. She turns as if to head outside.</span></div></div>",

You start walking in the opposite direction of Sindi through a wooded area, and sure enough a few minutes later you hear Sindi's poor sweet little voice let out a bone chilling scream that went abruptly silent moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you here this you start running.  Your heeled shoes fly off of your feet and your large breasts fly out of their tight little container but you don't care and just keep sprinting.  You take a second to look behind you to make sure nothing was there when you feel your foot collide against something hard and fall flat on your face in the dirt.  You stand up and wipe the dirt, leaves, and hair out of your face and look back at what tripped you.  It didn't feel like a branch or rock or anything natural.  And sure enough upon further investigation you find that you had tripped over the door handle to what looks to be an underground shelter of sorts.  \"Jackpot.\"  You say to yourself as you grasp the handle, and with all of the strength your Barbi body could muster you manage to slowly open up the hatch exposed a set of stairs.  You knew that there was no way that masked machete wielding freak could get to you in here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you descend down the stairs.  For safety you shut the door behind you and make your way down.  The stairs seem like they go down at least 20 feet below the surface before they end and you find yourself in a room.  \"Must be a nuclear fallout shelter.  Or some rednecks idea of a war bunker.  And if that's the case their could be a weapon I can use to defend myself against the killer.\"  In the pitch black you begin to feel your way around the room  you found some bottled water, preserved cans of some sort of food, and beside that seemed to be living breathing over 6 foot tall man.  You let out a terrified scream of surprise as you soon realize who is in the shelter with you.</span></div></div>",

You paw ineffectively at his vice-like grip and, for the briefest of moments, see a twin flash of red before you feel the massive hand shift violently to the the side, snapping your virtual neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are suddenly removed from your body, and though you cannot see it, you do hear yourself dropping noisely to the floor and the heavy footsteps of the killer as he trudges away to find his next victim. The now familiar screen appears before your disembodied vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are dead, Barbi. Try again in 5...4...3...2...1....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blast of simulated heat greets you as you find yourself once more in front of the fireplace, and you shudder uncontrollably and feel your neck with both of your tiny hands, expecting to feel the shattered and twisted bones jutting from your fair flesh. You left out a sigh of relief as your examination turns up nothing out of the ordinary. Aside from you being a woman, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You up for a spot of skinny dipping at the lake?\" You hear Sindi's voice say and you look up right as she leans in close for what has, for the second time, been your last kiss, \"and we can tease the guys too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply sit there and allow Sindi to kiss you, your mind a million miles away as you try to figure out what to do next. You can't escape outside, both those options lead to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSindi releases you and fixes you with a curious stare. To her programming, you're expected to respond to the stimuli as Barbi had (to her) always done. Not to be ignored, Sindi waves a manicured hand in front of your eyes, and and you suddenly you break free of your trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, Barbi? Girlfriend? Are you coming or not? Those boys won't wait around forever and it's soooo much more fun to get them wound up before the finale. Can we go-\" Sindi begins but her simple protest is ended as your eyes light up. It's changed! She's still here and not out getting murdered! You leap out of your chair and wrap your arms around Sindi's slightly taller frame, both of your breasts squishing together in a feeling that you can't deny is pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" the program states, seemingly lost as it struggles to adapt the change in the scenario. You pull out of the embrace and grip Sindi's shoulders tightly, so much so that she squirms under your grip. You try not to smile as you take a deep breath and begin to explain the situation to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Sindi, we can't go out there! There's a killer on the loose! If we leave this cabin, both of us will die!\" Your words are met with deaf virtual ears, however, as Sindi's face changes from one of uncertainty to that of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like whatever, Barbi! Just because you're more fun behind closed doors doesn't, like, give you the right to take all the fun out of my vacation! God, you're such a mean bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSindi slaps your arms away and shoots you a dirty glare before storming off towards the front door. Her hand closes around the door knob and she turns to look at you one more time before the giant blade of a machete suddenly bursts through the thick wood and slides effortlessly through the center of her neck. Sindi's eyes go wide as virtual blood spews everywhere as she begins to spasm, her hands pawing weakly at the blade before, with a wet gurgle, her blood soaked body goes limp on the blade, her eyes staring at you lifelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blade retracts back through the wood and the girl's body collapses to the floor of the cabin with a series of thumps, the once attractive form folding in on itself until it is finally settled in a awkward, jumbled position on the floor. Blood continues to pour out of the wound in her throat and pool on the hardwood floor around Sindi, the slowly expanding pool of crimson sliding inexorably towards the dated carpet on which you stand in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the door caves in with a single, massive kick, sending fragments of wood flying across the room as the larger portions collapse on top of Sindi's body, burying the dead eye's of the blonde as the killer slowly makes his way inside. His boots splash in the pooled blood, his machete clanging loudly on the wall as he uses one hand for leverage to propel himself over the corpse heaped at his feet until finally he is in the cabin.with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're utterly terrified at the behemoth in front of you, but you do notice that you're still able to move, unlike the first time you died.

You spin on your heel and begin moving forward...only to stumble and fall as your massive new assets and their seemingly own laws of physics throw you off balance, sending you crashing to the floor. You don't wait to hear the second footfall, you scramble on all four, your longer fingernails scratching at the hardwood floor until you find yourself back on your two legs and dashing down the small hallway towards what you can only assume are the bedrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, that was your plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the unnatural speed of all horror movie slayers, the killer lashes out and grabs you by a delicate ankle just as you pull yourself upright in your mad dash for freedom. You scream as you slam face first into the floor, and you feel your nose break from the impact and the world fills with stars. In your dazed state, you can only mumble incoherently and squirm slightly before the the white hot flair of pain clear your senses entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you realize you no longer have a right arm. You scream, a ear shattering shriek that would be right at home in a slasher flick as you twist your head and stare at the stub where your right arm was once connected to your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThwuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the blinding hot pain replace your left arm. And twice more as the killer removes your legs, though you can't do much more than sob as darkness begins to slither into your vision as your body begins to shut down from the traumatic blood loss. You feel a massive hand slide through your hair and grip it tightly, but the pain of being lifted up by your roots is nothing compared to the amputations. You hang there in the killer's grip, conveniently in sight of a mirror and you get a glimpse at your pathetic form, little more than a head and two breasts on top of a bloody torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes as the killer lifts his machete and swings it at your extended neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear your body hit the floor before the world goes black and the familiar screen appears in your vision once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are dead, Barbi.

Her obdy lays still for a moment, and you take that as all the encouragement you need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you change the events of the scenario, at least here, you can change how this particular AI reacts to you. But you have to be smart about it, right up confronting the AI about the simulation seemed to trigger the brutal response that was given to you, both from Sindi and the killer, If you play within the rules of the simulation, perhaps you can figure a way out of this endless loop of murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSindi wiggles pleasantly and pulls her face out of the pile of pillows, her cheeks red from embarassment while her eyes stare at you with confusion, before she straightens her clothes and stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\" she asks, \"Let's go play with the boys.\"</span></div></div>",

You're running out of time to think. If you try to convince Sindi to stay here, you'll have to do it in character and your knowledge of the scenario won't be much greater than what you've already seen: The small cabin, the dark woods, the killer stalking around outside and Necksnap Bunker somewhere out in the darkness. There's something to be said for situational awareness of your surroundings. Maybe you should play along for now instead of trying to talk your way out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, if you mess up, you'll just end up back here again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath you collect your thoughts and crack what you hope is a convincing grin at your female companion. \"Like, totally\" you say in the most brainless voice possible, and let loose a giggle while fighting the urge to just tell the killer to, well, kill you now. You follow Sindi to the door and bracing yourself for the worst, follow her out into the dark wilderness while she blathers on mindless about how much fun teasing the boys will be. You don't hear more than a handful of what your companion is saying as you try your best to see through the oppressive darkness, your eyes and ears wide open for anything that might give you a clue on if the killer is near or for something that might help you in your fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, you and Sindi are at the lake, standing just within the tree line as Sindi gazes lewdly at the cluster of dark forms splashing about in the water. Then you hear her let loose a rather unflattering whisper of a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like oh my god, I can't believe that bitch beat us here!\" Sindi leans in and whispers to you, never taking her eyes off the water. You focus your own gaze on the swimmers and hear the high pitched laugh and shapely form of another woman already in the water with what you assume are supposed to be your boyfriends. Chalk up at least something to increased knowledge of the simulation, you now know that you CAN make it to the waterfront, and that there really are more than just you, Sindi, and the killer within the simulation. You feel Sindi slap you lightly on one of your slender arms that you unknowingly crossed under your massive breasts and you bring yourself back to virtual reality. You look at her in the shadows and realize she's expecting you to reply to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's just a...game, you tell yourself as you summon up your inner bimbo as you force yourself to look shocked. \"I know, right? What do you want to do?\" you feel bile rising in your stomach as Sindi frowns and turns back to the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna show Tammi that she can't just still our ideas!\" Sindi states defiantly, and for some reason you feel compelled to follow her, mincing out across the small snady beach and onto the creaking dock as the four swimmers cease their swimming and turn to face the two of you. Suddenly the shadowy form of one of the men pushes away from the smaller form of who you can only assume is Tammi and splashes quickly to the dock. A second form is not far behind him. Before you know you're staring at the soaked, chiseld chest of a man who looks rather nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby\" the man says, his voice deep but shaky as he places a single meaty hand on your feminine shoulder \"I swear I was just about to come get you! You know I can't have any fun unless you're with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, whatever Brad!\" Sindi shouts at him before turning to the other man rising from the water, \"And don't you, like, even start Tom. Barbi and I both saw what you were, like, doing with that bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason you feel your own blood rise and pull yourself away from Brad. \"Yeah!\" You hear yourself say, but not entirely sure where the words are coming from, \"Like, how could you cheat on us? We're SOOOO much better than that...that...WHORE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did that come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can ponder this suddenly change in your bahavior, your girly tirade is cut short as a scream pierces the night air. You, Sindi, 'Brad' and 'Tom' rush over to the edge of the pier and gaze out across the black water. Tammi is flailing in the water, obviously fighting something as the prone form of the other male bobs silently beside her, a large blade sticking out of his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe killer is here, you realize, but you can't do anything other than slide close to Brad and gasp in horror as Tammi begins gasping for air as her body slips deeper beneath the lake's surface. Her gasps for air turn into wet coughs before she goes under one last time and never resurfaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sindi both scream. Tom dives into the water, and Brad holds out an arm to keep Sindi from following her beloved. After a short search where Tammi vanished under into the lake, Tom pulls the other male's body to shore and you all cluster close. Your new companions argue frantically about what to do, and you can feel yourself talking in your bimbo voice as you clung to Brad's chest. You're fearful of the killer, of course, but what is scaring you more now is the fact that you can't control your actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're so caught up in your thoughts, as a prisoner trapped in your own body, that you don't even realize that the conversation has stopped and the group is looking at you expectantly. You finally feel free to move and you take this moment to push yourself away from Brad, stumbling in the sand slightly but keeping your balance as you grow ever more used to the massive pendulums on your chest heaving to their own drums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barbi, like, what do you think?\" Sindi asks you. You take a breath and say...</span></div></div>",

Is it because I made the choice to go back whereas before I let Sindi decide what to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought that you could have your personality suppressed and replaced by a script fills you with dread. Surely the program isn't THAT sophisticated...But if it is, well, you'd have to be extremely careful about deferring the judgement of the situation to the AI characters. The last thing you need is to wind up converted into a permanent part of this nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming, of course, you could figure out how to beat the killer and escape the loop. You allowed yourself to feel a little bit of joy, however; you had managed to escape death this long and you now have friends. But that feeling of joy vanishes immediately as you reach the trail head back to the cabin. The dim moonlight from the slim crescent hanging high in the sky does nothing to light the path, and all you can see is darkness in front of you. You hear the others stop behind you and you turn to face them.</span></div></div>",

Two pairs of panties join the pool of clothing as she pulls you down with her onto the bearskin rug in front of the fire.

Her thigh pushes forward and your legs spread in welcome until she is pressing against your most intimate parts.

As pressing your mound against her hard muscular thigh does. The butterflies in your stomach are drinking champagne now, spilling bubbles that go straight up you spine to your head.
