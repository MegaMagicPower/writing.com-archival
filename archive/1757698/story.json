She had long ago made it her duty to keep the city happy as it's guardian, and her sheer size made that easy to do. She was greatly admired by all of the citizens and, despite declaring herself as ruler of the city when she first arrived on the scene, never actually used her size to force the people to obey her. They originally had done it simply out of fear, but now they obeyed her out of respect or adoration. Everyone in the city held Alice in very high regard. She had spent so much time earning their trust, and things finally seemed to be going well for everyone in her city. However, as many people know, peace can't last forever. The joyous cycle of life in Alice's utopia of a city would soon be shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was busy helping clean the windows on a skyscraper when it happened. A massive tremor was suddenly felt throughout the city. At first nobody thought anything of it, but then another one occurred. Several more tremors soon followed. They were getting closer and closer together each time, and Alice knew that this was not a natural earthquake. Judging by the size of the tremors, she knew that something big was approaching. She she didn't know what it was, but she could only hope that it would be something she could handle. She knew that something bad would soon happen, and immediately alerted the citizens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone inside, quick! There's something coming, and I want you all somewhere safe until I deal with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout questioning her order, everyone immediately bolted to the nearest buildings and hid inside. They knew that if this thing was enough to cause their guardian Alice to worry, it would probably end up being their worst nightmare. One young child asked her mother: \"What's going on mommy? Are we going to be okay?\" To which her mother responded: \"Of course, dear. Miss Alice is going to protect us. She won't let anything bad happen to us.\" Although she said this, however, she and virtually every other person in the room was thinking the same thing: \"Will Alice really be okay? It would take something pretty awful to get her so worried...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the source of the tremors came into sight. It was a woman; a giant woman whose height dwarfed even Alice herself! As Alice stared up at this new and even bigger giantess, she was amazed at her sheer size. Alice stood at 100 feet tall, and she still barely came above this woman's knees! She could only stare up in awe. In truth, Alice was terrified. She had never seen anything so big in her life, and she now faced a woman who was clearly three times her size! She desperately hoped that this woman would be gentle like her, and not attempt to harm her city. She knew that if this titan was in fact evil and decided to attack, there would be absolutely nothing that she could do to stop her. Suddenly, the new giantess looked down at Alice with a mischievous smile and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there little girl, my name is Maria. Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm Alice...\" Alice stuttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Alice, this is a pretty fun looking city you have here... I hope you don't mind, but I think I'm gonna take it off your hands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, worm! I'm in charge here now! Everything here belongs to me, including you! You're all my toys from now on, and I'm gonna do whatever I want with you from now on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looked up at the devilish woman above her. She was truly petrified. Alice had never known true fear before, and now it was staring her straight in the face. This 300 foot tall woman named Maria was going to take over the city that Alice had sworn to protect, and there wasn't a single thing that she could do about it! She had never felt so helpless in her entire life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She takes the blast hard and is knocked through the air, plowing through several of the buildings before crashing to the ground again, and any of the poor people who had been unfortunate enough to be in her path were instantly crushed due to Alice's massive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria then walks toward the injured giantess and starts punching and kicking every part of Alice's body mercilessly. She was getting beaten to death in the worst possible way. Almost everyone in the city was watching in horror as their protector, who they had until now assumed to be invincible, getting beaten to a pulp by this monstrous 300ft tall woman known as Maria. Many of them fell into a panic as Maria was walking towards them, crushing all who stood before her below her massive feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattered and bruised, Alice is too exhausted to move at all. Maria simply laughs as she presses her foot down onto her defeated opponent. She wasn't putting any real pressure on it, but she was certainly reveling in her total superiority over the much smaller giantess. Kicking the barely conscious Alice aside, Maria placed her hands on her hips in triumph and proceeded to address the terrified citizens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your inferior protector is no more! As of right now, you are all my slaves! If any of you attempt to defy or resist me, then you all die!\" Maria boomed with a clear tone of dominance in her voice.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria decides to head into the downtown area so she can drive the people in the city into even greater fear with her colossal size. She simply loved the thrill of watching those smaller than her as they ran from her in terror. It was as though she was born to be a destroyer of cities, and she had become an expert in using almost any part of her body as a lethal weapon. Her sadistic nature and ability to think up the most horrible forms of torture imaginable off the top of her head made her more terrifying than anything this city had ever seen. Much more terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe skillfully used every part of her gorgeous body to demolish any buildings that were within half her size, and the smaller ones were simply kicked over and flattened beneath her soles without a second thought as she walked by. Maria paid no attention to all of the powerless people below her as she felt them popping like grapes beneath her gigantic feet. As she continued to destroy the city around her, she couldn't help but laugh at the people trying to flee from her in terror. She knew that, no matter how fast they ran or how well they hid, they would never be able to escape from her wrath. However, as she looked down at all the fleeing citizens, Maria noticed one person who was holding their ground in her presence. It was a little 10 year old girl, and as Maria curiously leaned toward her to get a closer look at this brave little bug, the young girl shouted out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you!\" The girl yelled out with an unwavering determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what do you want little bug? And just who do you think you are, speaking to me with such a rude tone!\" Maria replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Sonia! I'm one if Alice's closest friends, and if you mess with her, you have to mess with me too! I don't care how big you are! I won't let you get away with what you're doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria simply stared down at the little girl in shock. Nobody had ever been foolish enough to stand up to her like this. Still, she wasn't about to let some puny insect talk to her in such a way and get away with it. What will Maria do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A devious smirk spread across Maria's face, and she swiftly snatched Sonia off the ground. She then dropped the tiny girl into the palm of her massive hand and raised her right up to her face. Sonia somehow managed to remain brave, even in the face of a monster like Maria. Seeing the gleam of determination in her helpless captive's eyes, Maria couldn't help but laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are one tough girl, aren't you?!\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! I'm not gonna be scared by a big mean monster like you!\" Sonia yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And may I ask why not, little bug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I know that Alice will find a way to stop you! I believe in her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Maria simply burst out in laughter. This girl had to have seen how powerless Alice was during their first confrontation, and yet she still thought that that sorry excuse for a giantess could defeat her? Maria knew that no matter how many times they fought, the outcome would always remain the same. Alice could try as many times as she wanted, but the fact remained that she was just weaker than Maria. She would never be able to match the strength of the bigger and clearly superior giantess. It was as simple as that. Still, Maria decided that she could at least humor her captive's naive hopes of salvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice! If you can hear me, then I've got a challenge for you! I'm gonna keep demolishing your precious little city here, and your friend Sonia will be coming along for the ride. So here's the deal: If you can somehow find a way to save your puny friend from me by the end of the day, then I'll agree to leave your city and never return. However, if you fail and Sonia is still in my possession by that time, then you'll have to surrender to me and become my loyal servant for life! The choice is yours, Alice: You can either accept my challenge and put your life on the line to save your city from me, or you can refuse and run away with your tail between your legs! Of course, since I'm sure that we both know how this is going to turn out in the end, you should probably just surrender to me and save us both a whole lot of trouble! So, what's it gonna be Alice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice, now recovering from her earlier injuries, got to her feet and looked up at the massive giantess who was holding her best friend captive. Seeing Sonia in the palm of Maria's hand, Alice knew that she had to make a decision right now. Would she try once again to outmatch the enormous girl who was laying waste to her precious city, or would she take her earlier defeat at Maria's hands as an indication that she had no hope of winning in a rematch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Alice do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew that she did everything that she could to protect the city, but in the end it simply wasn't enough to stop Maria from taking over.

The giantess seemed entirely unperturbed by their shocked glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, did you think I would spare the children?\" She asked incredulously. Her foot came up and slammed down on a group of two or three fleeing humans, sending shockwaves through the ground and splattering them against her rough skin. Maria raised her leg and showed all dumb enough to stand around watching her sole. \"Honestly, find that girl in this mess. Or any of the other children I stepped on during my time here. Hell,\" she laughed,  \"let me go get your guardian angel real quickly. We can go over her, I bet she hit a couple of the younglings when I tossed her through a tower!\" Maria stomped down again, catching only empty cars this time. \"Now keep running! I'm just getting warmed up!\" Maria snarled and began marching inexorably forward. She'd only made it a few steps before small arms fire started tickling her at about chest height. Briefly glancing down and to the left, she saw a few people clustered on the balcony of a hotel with various shotguns, handguns, and an assault rifle or two. Judging them to be no threat, she kept strolling forward until she was alongside the roof. Her pendulous breasts swung right and then smashed against the ledge, erasing the pitifully equipped vigilantes. Maria gently brushed off her lethal weapons and kept going up the street, hoping he trickle of people running up this street would lead her to more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was busy teasing a family as they struggled to free some diminutive shape from the crumpled ruins of an SUV that had met her pinky toe when she heard the whirring blades of a helicopter. Her digits, previously only knocking over or maiming the tiniest that tried to save their relative landed all at once, removing the bloodline from history. Maria smiled inwardly, noticing two particularly small forms crushed beneath her. 'At least that bug won't lack for playmates,' she thought. The goddess then turned her attention to the new threat. Two police choppers and a newscaster hovered well beyond the giant woman's reach. The ants in the larger, more heavily armed flying machine were screeching some nonsense at Maria. Posing no threat and being out of range, she lost interest in them. A small flock of refugees trying to get another group of refugees to let them into a mall drew more attention. If the ones inside were scared more people would attract the murderous behemoth, their fears proved right. But those outside felt the worst of the impact. Maria lay down, burying the entire group under her plentiful frame. The few insignificant security guards holding the doors shut against the outsiders backed away as a giant brown eye peered through the bulletproof glass. But then an equally colossal hand came smashing through the glass and concrete facade and they didn't have to worry about much of anything anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria flailed around inside, eventually trapping the majority of the cowering humans in her palm. She pulled her arm out and examined her prize, presenting the helicopters still blaring unneeded messages with an astounding view of a perfect behind. The effect was slightly offset by the numerous bloodstains marring the bronzed globes. Maria had completely forgotten them, anticipating far more enjoyment from the panicking tinies trying to escape her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was such a long walk over here, and Alice fought sooooo hard. I think I'm just about starved. But then you adorable creatures end up right here. It must be fate,\" Maria cooed happily. Her tongue snaked out, carving a swath through the crush of humanity in her hand. Then it quickly darted back, dragging her screaming morsels inside. With an exaggerated gulp, Maria sent them to her belly. It always made her feel tingly, the first mouthful. She was just about to finish off the last mouthful when she felt like a human would if they had suddenly been pelted with water from a garden hose. Angrily rushing to her feet, she turned towards the police vehicles. One had ventured close enough to try for a shot, and was unprepared for such a large being to move so quickly. It backed off, barely missing its partner. With nothing but her victims at hand, she hurled them at the three helicopters. The pilots, rusty from inexperience during Alice's peaceful autocracy, failed to react quickly. The smaller took a cluster of people to the rotors, damaging them. Maria had already closed the distance between them and backhanded it from the sky. The helicopter exploded against the side of a skyscraper. The other helicopter had a body smeared over the windscreen, and could barely see as her fingers plucked it from the sky. With barely any force, she crushed the aluminum craft flat and let it fall to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final helicopter, the news one, remained aloft but stationary while a camera man filmed the events. Maria admired their dedication to the job, but still felt no need to let them live. She gently grasped the landing skids, and felt a gentle tug as the pilot tried to pull away from the titaness. Adding just a little more weight to her tug, she lowered it to face level. Maria smiled brilliantly for the cameraman she assumed was still filming, unless he'd fallen or she'd accidentally squished him. Then her pearly whites parted, and the enormous to tongue crawled out like an enormous beast eager to receive the treat she presented it with. Then the helicopter was rushing towards the darkness, and the millions watching the devastation viewed the helicopter chewed as easily as a potato chip, and heard the screaming of the crew up until a perfect molar descended on an outstretched human hand and the video ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lump of metal fell into her cavernous stomach, Maria felt very good about herself. A new home, new victims, a whole new definition of terror to instill. She would enjoy herself for a while, and then move on. As she had before, and as she would after she found somewhere to replace this city. Of course, lost in her ruminations she didn't hear a primal yell of anger, or see Alice run up the face of a skyscraper to deliver a brutal aerial blow to the back of her head. She did become aware of the ground rushing quickly towards her face.</span></div></div>",

Maria smiled at her expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want to have all the fun alone? Well that's just too bad for you, then! But don't worry, I don't plan to harm you. I just want to have some fun with these bugs of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alice was shocked. It was clearly visible in her face, and the sight made Maria laugh out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute... Do you actually like them? That's so pathetic! Why would you ever want to associate yourself with such worthless little creatures?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's face lit up with anger as Maria said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you hurt them, Maria!\" Alice exclaimed. \"These people are my friends, and you... You'll have to get past me first if you want to do anything to them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Maria was still laughing uncontrollably, but she caught herself and looked down still smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you plan to stop me? I'm three times your size,<i> little girl</i>! There's no way a weakling like you could possibly do anything to stop a goddess like me! I guarantee you that by the time the sun goes down there will be nothing left of your precious 'friends' and their city. There's nothing you can do about it, so you might as well just give up now! But whatever... It's your choice, Alice: you can either walk away peacefully and let me have my fun, or you can continue to stand in my way die here alongside your puny friends!\" Maria said with a malicious laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Alice was truly terrified. Knowing that Maria's words were true, that there was nothing she could do to protect her beloved city, she turned around to begin running away. However, before she could get very far, Maria reached down and grabbed Alice by the wrist, stopping her in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\" Maria said as she held her finger to her lips in a thinking pose, \"I don't think I'll be letting you go after all. You are quite cute, so I think that I'll keep you. I'm sure that you'll make a great pet! Now, stay here little pet. Your new master still has some business to attend to, and if I see that you've moved from this spot when I come back, then you'll be getting some serious punishment!\" Maria said sadistically as she turned her attention back to the tiny city at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice balled her fists in frustration as she helplessly watched Maria begin her rampage. She loved her city and its citizens, but what could she do against the sheer size of her opponent? Nothing, that's what... Alice was powerless against Maria, and she knew full well that fighting such a massive woman would only end in failure. But still, she couldn't let Maria kill everyone she loved! As Alice looked back to the city behind her and saw the suffering that her people were now enduring, and then up to the towering goddess who was cruelly obliterating everything she had spent her life protecting, Alice finally made her decision. </span></div></div>",

She did say nothing while her destruction but her smile did not let any sign of mercy or pitty show. Alice saw lots of familiar faces in the rubble of her city before a shadow cast over them and Marias foot let them not even the slightest chance of survival beneath it. At one point she stopped crying and just closed her eyes and listened to the sounds of terror getting less with every mighty step until she could not hear any no more. \"Think thats it\" Maria exclaimed with her hands on her hips. She shuffled over some ruins which where not a deep crater shaped like her foot or stomped piles of rubbles to dust, just in case there was somone still breathing beneath. As she was fully satisfied and nothing in the city was higher than her toes, she walked over to Alice. \"Thanks for the invitation\" she sneered while wiping her giant, dirty feet clean on the defeated giantess. \"See you when I see you\" she waved goodby as she left for the next city she could obliterate.

The panic quickly spread through the bronze-age city, the intruder had just stepped over the city wall, which barely reached the upper half of her shin. Alice carefully measured Maria, still shocked that there was someone even bigger than her. Her face warped with an evil snarl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare to threaten a goddess, upstart?\", she hissed maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The other giantess just laughed at her, her big hands resting on her hips, which where towering above Alice's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no goddess, Alice! Just a giantess abusing her power without any shame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice examined Maria thoroughly. The larger woman was not only taller than her, she seemed to be much stronger too. She wore an artful decorated velvet-strip of cloth around her upper body. But it was barely enough to cover her massive bosom. Alice saw the underside of the newcomers breasts and her impressive cleavage. Despite the warmth of this sunny day she was either cold or horny, because Alice could clearly see Maria\u2019s erected nipples bulge the fabric and slightly pointing upwards. Proudly the dark haired giantess displayed her athletic body, showing clearly defined muscles and a six-pack that seemed to be chiseled out of marble. Her long legs were like perfectly sculpted pillars to the heavens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's bare feet left deep imprints on the ground. The brunette was stunningly beautiful, a gentle smile on her face, though Alice could barely see it from her angle, obscured as it was by Maria's staggering breasts. Alice discovered that Maria was also absolutely gorgeous, with big brown eyes and long dark hair, deep red lips and an angelic face. Alice wasn't ugly. On the contrary, her features were remarkably delicate and her body was astounding: great legs, cute butt, and nice big breasts. Also in proportion smaller than Maria's. Her waist-long blonde hair glistened in the sunlight like molten gold. Alice's eyes were pale blue and so bright they seemed to glare in the sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her beauty was lost to her subjects, overshadowed by her cruel behavior and tyrannical reign. The beauty of her eyes was lost to the citizens, who called her eyes the \u201cice orbs\u201d. Envy filled Alice. This upstart was bigger than her and apparently richer, judged by her clothes \u2013 it was a miracle she found people with enough velvet to make even the small \u201cbra\u201d she wore and the thin cut thong, which was barely able to cover her private parts. On the contrary, it even draw more attention to this area, clearly showing the outlines of her vagina and emphasizing her perfect ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alice\u2019s clothes weren't veiling their owner\u2019s body either, but they were made from cheaper material. Although her servants had to trade with the surrounding cities for several years, in order to buy enough cloth to craft them. Maria\u2019s hulking shadow darkened the whole market place. There where buildings in this city as high as Alice, but none came even close to Maria\u2019s size. Even the large temple - one of the few buildings not marked by damage through Alice\u2019s thundering steps and her rampages - didn't even reach the cusp of Maria\u2019s ample bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice decided that her only chance would be a surprise attack and sprang forward, aiming for Maria\u2019s right knee. The brunette leviathan reacted surprisingly fast and evaded her nimbly and skillfully. Almost casually she made Alice stumble and sent her sprawling on the ground. Alice slid forward on her stomach and breasts, flattening the front of a building, the force of her impact sent stones flying through the air and a dust cloud took her sight for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her bra tore. Something incredibly strong grabbed her and dragged her up. She felt the air caressing her bare breasts. Flung around like a doll, she saw citizens flee in terror from the fight of the giantesses. In seemingly safe distance some of them stopped and watched in awe. She felt her anger rising, when she spotted some of them cheering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInsolent wretches, you\u2019ll bleed for this!\u201d, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unbelievable strong hands forced her to the ground, the impact forcing the air from her lungs. Suddenly she was released. Furiously she jumped up, rewarded by the hint of surprise in the eyes of the bigger giantess towering over her. With all her strength she landed a blow on the side of Maria\u2019s belly\u2026 a sharp pain jolted through her knuckles and made her yelp. Her blow had struck something impenetrable and unmovable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbelieving she stared where her blow had struck Maria. She saw smooth, slightly reddened skin, solid muscle In her youth when she had started to grow she had occasionally tested her strength by punching trees, metal and solid rock, all crumpling under the sheer force of her strength. Nothing had been able to withstand her\u2026 till now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive!\u201d, Maria smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin betrayed her words to be only partially true. With quick movements she swept Alice from her feet. The smaller giantess hit the ground again and Maria placed her foot on her chest, playfully pinning her to the ground. Maria\u2019s sole covered Alice\u2019s breasts and applying enough pressure not to hurt but enough to keep her in place. Slowly she bent over the defeated smaller giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to accept your submission!\u201d, she said with an almost innocent smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t so much rule Alice was too kind for that rather she protected it and the people who lived within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was its appointed guardian and even though she was something of a tomboy Alice never allowed herself to harm any innocents. She wasn\u2019t like that she knew she had to be responsible with her size not abusive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the city thrived from Alice\u2019s continuing kindness even after a new presence had made itself known\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome weeks ago while Alice was busy helping clear out a bit of the mess a passing storm had left in its wake she was suddenly alerted by the townsfolk that something massive was headed toward them all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive figure was another giantess by the name of Maria. This lovely blonde-haired (down to the mid of her back) green-eyed girl was seemingly strolling on by but her posture suggested to Alice that she was well aware of her surroundings almost as if she was afraid of accidentally crushing anything beneath her immense feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she a kind soul just like Alice? Telling everyone to stay indoors Alice bravely went out to meet with the approaching Maria their height difference making the raven-haired girl bite the lower portion of her lips. Regardless she called out to the blonde titan\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out Maria was in fact a gentle soul just like Alice admittedly the blonde stated that her height also made her a little bit of a klutz but she always did her absolute best in making sure nothing of value was hurt or destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlonde, fair-skinned, green-eyed, bubbly cheerful, and a slight klutz Alice couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at how Maria was her complete opposite outside of the given fact that both of them were kind individuals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that the two of them became fast friends and now the city was blessed with two titanic ladies looking after it and its people...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice continued to relax a peaceful slumber attempting to grab a hold of her as she stared at the afternoon sky high above her. A part of her wondering what Maria was currently up to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat girl always tried to do so much that hours later she\u2019d find Alice and tell her how worn out she was. The raven-haired giantess always reminding her that just because she was enormous didn\u2019t mean she had an infinite amount of stamina so it was best she space herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice figured that maybe she was right on the nose when she\u2019d mention stamina to Maria the blonde was after all so large that maybe her body did require a lot of energy and pushing herself they way she did just served in tiring her out as fast as possible. Alice being \u201c<i>smaller</i>\u201d didn\u2019t have to worry about that too much that and she knew when to rest when she had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill if something had occurred with Maria she was sure she\u2019d have heard about it by now either by the giantess herself or the townspeople. So for the moment she continued with her rest and relaxation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a normal day in one of the cities under the control of the giantesses. Buildings burned, or were completely leveled. The wreckage of traffic jams were flattened like a giant hammer had smashed them. And the unfortunate victims of their pleasure were lying (or more often smeared over several blocks) all around. In the middle of this carnage were the two giants who had caused it. Alice stood at 100 feet tall, and had an athletic body framed by blonde hair and two blue eyes. Maria towered over her, and a lot of other things, at 300 feet. She had darker skin, and her curves would have been amazing if she had been normal sized. At her massive height, they were legendary. After a week in the city, they had destroyed a majority of things there. However, they still hadn't completely exhausted every option they could imagine. This afternoon's entertainment was capturing as many survivors as possible and seeing which giantess could crush the most beneath their ass.<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure I've got this one,\" Alice told the much larger giant as she piled her humans on top of each other before she crushed them.<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but you still haven't beaten me once so far,\" Maria purred as she pulled her people out of whatever crevasses she'd concealed them in. \"Nobody can beat this!\" She laughed as she smacked her ass. Several screaming humans fell out. Both of them laughed sadistically.<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's just do this.\" Alice said, and them waggled her rear over her humans. They didn't run, for they knew their fate was the better option than trying to run. Both giantesses began brushing against their piles at the same time, and then let all their weight fall on their butts. Maria instantly squashed all the people, laughing and wiggling her butt to further destroy the people. Alice didn't completely crush everyone the first time. She bounced up and down a few times. Each bounce brought more brutal crunches and screaming. At last, everyone was finally a stain on her ass.<br>\r\n\"Well, I think we both know how that went...\" Maria said, sifting through the remains for any survivors. She found one and stuffed him up her pussy. \"He was already dead,\" Maria said, fingering herself</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shaun glanced around nervously. Well, a little more than nervously. He was terrified. He and a few dozen others were trying to escape the rule of the evil giantesses who had terrorized all in his cities. They had a few vehicles in a rough column, driving through a dense forest. One was a pickup truck with a .50 caliber machine gun welded to the bed. They'd left the boundaries of the city twenty minutes ago, and he was beginning to hope that they'd finally escaped. But from stories he'd heard no one had ever escaped, and their fates were always brutal for the remainder of their shortened lives. Still, the hope lived on.<br>\r\nShaun was checking the rifle he held for the thousandth time, although he doubted it would do much good. He'd seen the titantic women take shots from dozens of such rifles without blinking. In fact, they'd usually laughed while they killed the men using the rifles. Shaun froze all of a sudden. He thought he'd felt a slight tremor. A few moments later, another shake in the ground confirmed his fears. Then he heard the crash of falling trees and what were now clearly footsteps. Then, at the end of the train of vehicles one of the giants burst from the trees sending them flying like sticks, and crushing a car beneath her stumbling feet.<br>\r\nShaun fired a few shots at her head. He couldn't tell which giantess it was, they were both huge to his eyes. And there was only one, they weren't even worth both of their time. The bullets did nothing but draw her attention, so Shaun dropped the bulky weapon. She started for his car, but then the machine gun started hammering away at her. Taking the moment of distraction, he dove for the bushes. When he was concealed enough in the undergrowth, he watched the carnage unfold, not daring to stray too far from the road so he wouldn't get lost and end up back in the nightmare he'd tried to escape. Shaun spotted the big gun, and silently cheered when it looked like the giantess stumbled backwards. Then he had to choke down a yelp when a mountain of flesh landed on the vehicle with a shriek of twisting metal and maybe fear. Shaun tried to forget the rest, as one by one, the escapees were caught and killed. Finally, the last one was dragged from beneath a car and hoisted out of sight. There were some panicked talking, a deeper, sexier, voice from the giant, more screaming and then the unmistakable crunches of someone being chewed up. After ten minutes, everyone in the convoy was dead, and the footsteps of the giant receded back towards the city. But hours later, as darkness fell, Shaun was still breathing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the night fell, Shaun thought he would be safe. Neither of the giantesses had suddenly flattened him while he was down or eaten him, or given him other punishments he'd rather not imagine. He didn't want to push his luck and let one of them come back to the battle site and find him. Shaun got up and set off down the side of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeeper in the trees, a huge shape watched the tiny man set off for what he assumed was safety. But the evil rulers had never let a person escape, and didn't start now. She followed Shaun soundlessly, a feat for someone so large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun had walked all night, and now he could see the trees thinning out and being replaced with the abandoned ruins of a highway. Beyond this, normal-sized people ruled the land. Also, the sun was just rising over the horizon and bathing the landscape with golden light. He walked another few miles, and found a section of the road in perfect condition. The silence was shattered with the roar of an engine, a sound that multiplied and deepened. Several military humvees drove towards Shaun, who waved like a madman. Behind them, a squadron of tanks rolled along. Helicopters buzzed overhead. It was the happiest day of his life.<br>\r\nSoldiers piled out of the vehicles, and ran out towards Shaun. The sergeant smiled at him and shook his hand.<br>\r\n\"Welcome back to the United States, glad to see you. Congratulations on your escape. You're the first man to ever do that you know. Come on, let's get you away from here. From what we've seen, the giantesses don't like losing escapees,\" the soldier said. Both he and Shaun were grinning like idiots. A blackhawk hovered above them, and lowered a rope ladder. Shaun took it and began to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria saw Shaun getting into a conversation with the soldier, and then begin to climb the ladder. She figured that the perfect time to attack was now. She crept closer, keeping some foothills between herself and the humans. But then, she heard the whirr of rotors behind her moments before she heard the shriek of missiles. Maria rolled out of the way, flattening some shrubbery and a deer that hadn't run from the giantess. Not bothering with stealth anymore, she ran towards the people. They opened fire on her with everything they had. The rifle bullets were annoying pinpricks, and the machine gun bullets hurt but not enough to slow her down. A shell from a tank flew by, but missed her. Then she was in the midst of the military, her feet crushing hummers and soldiers. She body slammed a squad taking cover behind two vehicles, feeling their bodies pop under her breasts. Maria grabbed a man with a missile launcher before he could shoot, and shoved the screaming soldier down her maw. The helicopter she needed was gaining altitude and flying off. Four tanks still stood between her and the escaping chopper. Maria charged them just as one fired. The round grazed her arm and gashed her arm with the explosion. Another hit her leg, reducing her to a limp. She walked past them, only to confront an attack helicopter. A hail of rockets took the last steam from her movement, and the wounded giantess toppled backwards. Before she slipped into unconsciousness, she took some pleasure and satisfaction from feeling a tank crumple under her sexy ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Alice led a gang of laborers out to find the passed out Maria lying in the ruins of the highway. They dragged the massive woman back to occupied territory and into a recuperation room designed for someone specifically of her size. Alice slammed the doors closed, leaving the two hundred workers in there. When Maria woke up, she'd probably be hungry and angry. The smaller giantess thought she'd be safer if she had some tiny people to take that out on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria woke up on an improvised bed made of pretty much anything soft, which she used until a bed big enough for her had been built. She groaned and rolled over, feeling the wounds she'd suffered ache and sting. She looked at the damage from the weapons, and saw the injuries rapidly fixing themselves. The giantess didn't heal instantly, but overnight all but the most serious were fixed. When the pain dimmed down, she took in her surroundings. Large walls surrounded her, and were even taller than she was. Maria knew where she was. It was a room designed specifically by her in case she was badly injured. Maria had anticipated being angry at mankind for beating her, and the only thing that would stop her from flattening she and Alice's entire territory would be a room she couldn't escape with a decent supply of people to punish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thought caught her attention, and Maria looked around with a predatory smile for her victims. The room was relatively bare, and she saw small clumps of the people cowering in the corners. She began to walk towards the nearest group, swinging her hips seductively as she approached them. As she got closer, the people tried to run away. Seeing this, Maria simply laughed and gathered them all up in one swoop. She inspected the group in her hands, and frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you'll have to do.\" The giantess said ominously, and dropped them down her massive cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess then stalked off to capture the rest of the tiny people. It took about ten minutes to catch everyone in her area. After she had finished collecting her playthings, Maria moved back to her bed and began to unleash her fury on the helpless souls in-between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had stood outside the door, waiting for the bigger giantess to tell her she's okay. All the other times, she hadn't been and destroyed large areas of the city. Alice didn't care, it was fun to watch and she got a little private time with her own slaves before she invariably ingested them through her pussy. But this time, Maria didn't knock as soon as she got up. Alice was just drifting off when the first screams drifted over the walls. They didn't stop after a few seconds, the space of time Maria usually finished with a victim. As it went on and on and on, Alice was happy that Maria hadn't asked to get out earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours, the sound of the sadistic giantess's fun had finally ended, and a polite knock came on the door. Alice stood up and opened the door, expecting to be knocked over and then watch a massive rampage. Instead Maria simply towered over her, blood dripping from her mouth, her boobs, and her soaked vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done.\" she said calmly, and walked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice saw that her gigantic ass was also soaked with blood. She looked back inside the room and then jerked her head back. She'd done some very nasty things to people, but not like that. Alice looked back at Maria, who was standing on top of a bus and inspecting a minivan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, I think, you'll expect me to explode and annihilate everyone in this city. I don't blame you, I want to feel every last one of them pop like a grape-\" Maria clenched her hand around the car, and dropped the smoking wreck, \"-against my body. I could do it too. Destroy the biggest towers with a swing of my hips,\" Maria did this, and knocked her rear though a skyscraper, cutting it almost in half. Then she slowly lowered herself onto the stump, moaning slightly as she finally reached the ground, \"and then lowering myself. But no, that's not enough this time. I'll do it later. I want to get the escapee back, and expand our territory. Show people it's worthless to even try and run. And I've learned to think ahead a little more.\" Maria lowered her foot onto a crowd of fleeing people and listened to the crunching. \"Well, I think you'd have a lot of fun if you'd help. It's been too long since we've annexed any new towns. Wanna come along?\" Maria phrased the last part as more of a command than a question. But Alice didn't need telling, she wanted to go conquer as much as Maria did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will this story go next?</span></div></div>",

They controlled three cities in their empire, although the cities were a little more than husks of themselves after the two giant women took control of them. It had been a while since new territory was taken under their control. They walked through the forests and past the highway where Maria's battle had taken place. The wreckage was still there, as well as the outline of Maria's ass around a flat tank. Both giantesses laughed at that. Not long after, they came upon a small farm. The animals heard them coming and went into a panic. Neither of them would have paid the place much attention if Alice hadn't stepped in the pig pen by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, that's all over my foot!\" she said, scraping smashed pig off her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am a little hungry and could use a snack before we start the real feast!\" Maria said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices drew out a worker from a shed. The taller giantess spotted him instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do!\" she exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped his bucket and tried to run, but the giant caught him easily. She walked over and straddled the house. She raised him to her eyes as she began to put pressure on the roof. In seconds, it collapsed, sending a plume of dust flying into the air and some more farm hands scurrying outside. Alice snatched them up as hungrily as the bigger girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, you look delicious!\" Maria told the terrified man held in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked him all over with her tongue for a few minutes before finally wrapping it around him and pulling him in. He struggled inside her mouth, and could be seen bulging against her cheeks for a moment or two before her teeth clamped together with a series of snaps and crunches. Maria gulped contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why you kill them so early Maria. It's a lot more fun to let them live on and struggle for a little while,\" Alice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe talked around one of the men in her mouth, still alive and fighting to get out. Alice tilted her head back and swallowed him whole. She rubbed her smooth stomach, moaning contentedly. Two more were clenched in her hand. She pulled one out, and surveyed him carefully. Judging him as okay, she lowered him to her tight ass. The giantess pushed the wriggling man closer to her asshole, until he was brushing against it. Each move sent jolts of pleasure through Alice, until he disappeared completely into her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me that one, you don't get to have all the fun,\" the taller giantess said, mock mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alice tossed the remaining farmer to her. She smiled at the terrified person, savoring every second. Finally, she carried him to her massive bubble butt. She lay down on top of another barn, bringing out the scared moos of cattle as they were smashed by her boobs. Maria dropped the man down her crack, laughing as he disappeared between the two gigantic mounds of flesh. She felt him fall against her hole, and pushed him in just a little. The farmer fought as hard as he could to escape, but he was strongly stuck. In fact, he was being pulled in, much to the amusement of his tormentors. Finally, all the residents of the farm were dead, or as good as dead inside the giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love little farms like this before a huge fight,\" Maria said, happily massaging her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but there are usually more people here, more than four. Did you hide them away when I wasn't looking?\" Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, they're not hidden. They're just my new tatoos.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria pointed to the inside of her thighs, where some streaks of blood indicated the people in the farmhouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm all dirty, I think I should clean up before we kill anyone else,\" the bigger giantess said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now she ruled an entire city. Well, almost all. Alice still controlled the suburbs, but Maria didn't care. She was happy with what she had and if she ever did want more, she could easily take it. This afternoon she wasn't in the mood to cause destruction, so she carefully strode through the streets. People scattered like bugs out of the way of her massive feet, which totally filled the streets. People had stopped driving cars, because they couldn't get out of the way when Maria decided to go for a walk and often ended as metal coffins for the drivers. Even now, some still weren't fast enough to avoid being crushed. Maria giggled every time she felt someone pop beneath her.<br>\r\nEventually, she came to an all glass skyscraper, where her magnificent form was reflected back at her. She had curly black hair, a perfect golden brown tan to her skin, easily DD breasts, and an incredible ass that many people <i>did</i> die for. She had just stopped admiring herself when she tripped over something. She landed with a thundering BOOM and launched everything not smashed beneath her into the air. Looking back, she saw steel cables tied between two buildings. Dozens of people now swarmed out of every place imaginable, holding guns, grenades, and even a rocket launcher. Maria smiled as one lit a Molotov cocktail, and threw it at her face. He missed, and hit her shoulder. Her bikini strap caught on fire, but she could only feel a faint tickling.<br>\r\n\"You really think a little fire's gonna hurt me? I'm disappointed!\" Maria said sweetly, and pulled herself forward. The man turned to run, but Maria's huge boobs caught him and smeared him along the ground. Then she pushed herself up, and sat down on the place where the rebels had come from. She heard the screaming, then the crunches as she literally crushed the rebellion. Grinding her ass back and forth, she sent an unmistakable message to the people in her empire. She was in charge, and nothing would change that. But now something unexpected happens...</span></div></div>",

Almost on cue, rocket granades. machine guns, and rifles opened fire from seemingly every rooftop downtown, and they all were aimed at one thing: Maria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria tried to smash through some of the buildings,but the shots seemed to come from everywhere. And these shots were far more powerful, because they hurt this time, and even caused Maria to bleed in some areas on her body where the firing was concentrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was in a panic. The rocket attacks jostled her about as she ran to and from the buildings. She could barely see through her blood. These fighters were better armed, that's for sure. They were also smarter, as they synchronized their attacks for maximum effect. Something was wrong. The puny folks of this city weren't supposed to be so well armed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere these military forces from outside the city that were trying to take her out? Or worse, were these forces sent by Alice to take this territory from her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was certain: she was going down if she didn't leave the city fast. So Maria ran as fast as she could out of the city and towards the plains to the south so that she could think on her next move. The sun was going down. Maybe by nightfall she could sneak back in and find out who was after her.</span></div></div>",

She would never let that happen, so her only option was to try and sneak in. She knew the there was a river that ran along the edge of her territory, bordered by a forest. The guys at the dock were always causing trouble, no matter how many of them she tortured, maimed, ate, or otherwise killed. If there was a leader behind the attack they lived down on the dock. Maria, now with a plan in mind, strode purposefully towards the forest.<br>\r\nWhen night fell, Maria was ready. For a 300 ft tall giantess, she could move with startling stealthiness. The docks had a chain-link fence surrounding it. She could try and swim up farther, and surface in the middle of the troublemakers. But if she was wrong about the leaders being at the docks, then she would have revealed that she hadn't left for good. Maria decided to go in the easy way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve and Rob were patrolling the western edge of the docks tonight. They had two machine guns tonight, a change from the usual hunting rifles. The pair hadn't argued with the upgrade, but wondered why they were suddenly told even less. Few people knew that Maria had even left, and even fewer knew that the shooting had been at the giantess. But now they walked leisurely along the fence, discussing boring topics like wages and their lives. As they passed the densest thicket of trees, Steve stopped unexpectedly.<br>\r\n\"Hey, did you hear something?\" he asked. Rob shook his head. \"I swear something was breathing a minute ago. Wanna check it out?\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, it might be Maria. She's pretty damn hot, but she'd kill you man. But I thought she was sleeping-\" Rob stopped talking as Maria, who had been crouched among the trees stood up to full height, and smiled in the darkness.<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, just passing through. But sorry, you're in my way!\" she said, reaching down to grab them. They turned to run, but the huge hands caught them before they could move. \"Sorry, I really don't want to do this but I can't let you go. You might tell others,\" Maria said in a voice that indicated she wasn't at all sorry. She opened her mouth wide, and carefully slipped Steve in so he wouldn't have an opportunity to yell out. She swallowed him alive, and turned to Rob. Grinning and unable to leave an opportunity unexploited, she pulled down her bikini bottom and placed him in her ass. She pulled the garment back up, and took a few steps. When she felt Rob was suitably positioned, she clenched her cheeks together. Maria was unable to resist a giggle of pleasure when she felt him pop like a grape. Emboldened by killing her two captives, she reconsidered an all-out attack. Now that she knew what she was up against, she would easily destroy any opposition. Maria thought she would completely level this area forever. It would be fun! Or she could continue killing silently, and the city would awake to see that she had returned and killed every one of the rebels without them even knowing until it was too late. In the end she decided to</span></div></div>",

She was about to start sneaking up on the next guards when she felt Steve kicking in her stomach. In a moment she was flooded with a feeling of invincibility and charged in. She stomped towards the towering cranes, the next set of guards looking up just in time to fire a few shots before being ground into paste. The rest of the compound heard the shots and ran to find the disturbance. Maria was easily spotted, 300 feet tall and laughing happily as she smashed everything in her way. A spotlight came on and lit up her face. She smiled, and hurled a parked semi at the light, obliterating it. Maria marched towards the docks, feeling the bullets peppering her skin but causing no harm. There were a few boats moored by the docks and Maria put her feet through all of them, ensuring nobody could escape. Behind her, some men had climbed onto the cranes and had begun to snipe her from there. Laughing,she climbed out of the river and walked between them. With a casual sway of her hips both of the cranes toppled, killing anybody with a weapon capable of hurting her.<br>\r\nFinally, after an hour of mindless destruction Maria thought the survivors were intimidated enough. Despite her display of power, she still had to slowly sit on close to twenty people before one of them spoke up and told her where the leaders were. He had the pleasure of getting crushed between her massive breasts. The rest became her midnight snack. Maria took a walk over to the building where the stain on her boobs told her the orchestrators were. She knocked off the entire upper part of the building and grinned down at the terrified people inside. They stared up in horror as her bare butt descended on them. Maria moaned in pleasure as she felt each separate man get flattened by her titanic rear, and as each floor collapsed beneath her. She noticed one person somehow miraculously escaped her slaughter, and was trapped beneath her pussy. She thought about torturing him for information, or using him for her own pleasure. Lying amid the burning ruins of what had been a cell of rebels, covered in their blood, and dozens of them stuck to every part of her body, she was feeling pretty turned on.</span></div></div>",

Maria forced herself down a little harder, and heard some of his bones snap. He cried out in pain, and she laughed.<br>\r\n\"You can get yourself out of this position little man. If you answer a few questions for me, I'll let you go. Can you do that for me?\" she asked sweetly. The man screamed as she lifted off a little and then came down on him even harder. He managed to nod a desperate yes before she crushed him completely.<br>\r\n\"Good! They won't even be too hard. Where'd you get all the weapons and organizational skills to try and overthrow me?\" Maria asked. She waited for a minute before using one finger to push his head into the ground.<br>\r\n\"I don't know! I just got a gun and was told where to go! That's all I know, I'm just a foot soldier, I don't know about the plans!\" he screamed. Maria was still suspicious, so she picked his broken body up and dropped him into her cleavage. She stared at him, and repeated her question. Then she slowly pressed her breasts together until more of him broke. He was yelling something about a Mr. Gindart hiding in the metro hub. But Maria was having fun, and kept giggling and saying \"Speak up, I can't hear you in there!\", and forcing her boobs closer until finally there was a crunch. This would have made most people sick, but Maria was still incredibly horny and this only made her hotter. She saw just beyond the fences the bustling city, where she normally took dozens of the homeless from the alleys all the time.

She was too excited to sleep, but she wanted to wait for broad daylight to display her invulnerability. So she found a secluded alley, grabbed some people, and had some early breakfast. By the time the last screaming man had slid down her throat the sun was up. But not enough people were up and about for Maria's purposes. So, cursing herself for eating all her toys so quickly, she waited in boredom until noon.<br>\r\nAt this time, she removed the burned and holed bikini top that had barely contained her huge boobs. Maria walked into the street, stepping on a handful of unaware citizens. She shrugged luxuriously, her naked body glistening in the sun. The people on the street stared, scared for their lives and captivated by the giantess's body. They stayed that way, and she winked at one of the guys standing closest to her. He almost fell, and she reached down and scooped him up. Maria brought him to her lips and kissed him, and he almost seemed to disappear into her mouth. But then the goddess pulled him back and brought him down to her giant vagina. He stared in horror as she pushed him, his arms flailing wildly as her fingers pushed him deeper and deeper until he was completely devoured by it. Maria pleasures herself with him, gasping and moaning while she felt the man struggling against her deep inside. She orgasmed just as he was caught against the sides of her pussy and crushed. Her juices were tinged with red blood, and his crumpled body also slid out. The spell was broken, and people ran every way as Maria laughed, and crushed everything in sight. In minutes the street had no living people on it, everyone either dead or had by some miracle escaped. Maria moved on to other areas where the panic was just spreading. Finding a particularly crowded area, she walked into the middle of it. There was a bus there, one of the few left. It was crowded with terrified people, and Maria picked it up. Examining it, she decided it would do just fine as her toy. She sat down, and groaned sexually when her ass compacted quite a few people. She finished laying down, killing many more and trapping some underneath her. These she enjoyed feeling struggle under her while she eyed the bus some more. She placed the vehicle between her boobs, and started to crush it. The windows shattered and its orders were tossed wildly as the mounds of flesh began to bend and break the metal. Just before she finished it, Maria took it out. Then she stuck it down her pussy, crying out in pleasure as she pushed it deeper and deeper. Finally, she came again. Her orgasmic juices flooded through the bus, pinning everyone against the back and sweeping some out the smashed windows where they were crushed against her walls when she pulled the bus out again. Holding it up to her face again she giggled. There were broken bodies inside the bus which was dripping with her liquid. The bus itself was torn and dented, with huge rents in the roof. The survivors were clinging onto anything they could for dear life. One slipped out the windshield, and landed right on Maria's lips. She parted them, allowing him to fall right into her mouth and down to her stomach.<br>\r\nSatisfied, she rolled over onto her chest. This action crushed some insane people who had survived her wild thrashing and hadn't left. The giantess laid the bus in-between her buttcheeks, and laughed again when she heard the people screaming for mercy. Maria found their pleading just as arousing as using a bus to masturbate. Finally deciding to end it, she squeezed her cheeks together. With a groaning of metal, the bus yielded to Maria's body and collapsed in her ass. She stood up, and the flattened metal fell from her mighty rear with a crash. She was soaked in blood and juices, and extremely exhilarated. That was the best time she'd ever had, aside from the time she played with an entire village of 1500 in Colorado before crushing them all with her breasts. She looked around, surveying the aftermath of her fun. Hundreds had been smeared by her colossal body during her fun, cars lay smoking and flattened, the bus was beneath her foot now, and all around buildings had huge holes in them where she'd accidentally rolled into them. Maria was very happy and wanted...</span></div></div>",

Looking beyond her skyscrapers, she saw the tiny suburban homes of Alice's territory. On a whim, she decided she wanted it. She left the wreckage of her fun, she'd get someone to clean that up. She went to the city capital building, which had become her official chair while making decisions. Now it flew the flags of the rebellion, and several leaders were rallying their troops from it. They saw Maria coming and pointed frantically at her. She crossed the square in seconds, and squared her butt over the roof. She wiggled her ass, and then lowered it not the fleeing leaders. She smiled as the flags cracked beneath her, and the people joined the stains on her rear.<br>\r\n\"Okay, you've had your fun. Now I'm back, and good news! I'm willing to forgive you all if you go to war for me! As you know, I only control this area. I want more, and you're going to get it for me! Now come and fight with me, and no one has to suffer for now!\" Maria said cheerfully. The people appeared uneasy, and a few even spoke out. After these and the people standing next to them had been flattened, they eagerly ran for their weapons. Maria assigned generals, and then the mob marched out, with the naked giantess at their head. They quickly reached the edge of Alice's territory, where there was a shack with a border guard. Maria trampled the small gatehouse and called for Alice. When she didn't answer, she went on a ten minute rampage that destroyed several blocks and secured Maria some lunch. While she was contentedly playing with her food in the wreckage of the homes, Alice ran up. She jumped into the gathered mass of Maria's soldiers, crushing several beneath her.<br>\r\n\"What do you want Maria?\" she asked, a little worried.<br>\r\n\"I want your land,\" Maria said, contemplatively chewing up another screaming citizen, \"But I'm not going to simply kill thousands of you innocent people and beat you into submission. I have this army to fight other people on your side. The winner gets this part of the city.\" Maria swallowed the last three people and brushed the debris off her long, slender legs. She stood up and looked down on Alice. \"I recommend you accept. Maybe you can be my sub-mayor when I win!\" she said, and giggled.<br>\r\n\"Fine, give me an hour to raise a militia and we shall wage war over this land. Hope your army doesn't lose you a lot of territory.\" she said. She winked at the milling crowd below her, and walked off. She made sure to squelch another dozen or so people on her way out. Five hours later, the two forces were gathered and facing each other. Maria yelled \"Charge!\" and they rushed at each other.</span></div></div>",

Neither army had much experience outside of Call of Duty, and so the bullets ran low while soldiers fired thousands to kill one man. But maria's forces had been fighting a losing battle. They had been pushed back into the skyscrapers, and had slowly lost hundreds of fighters to Alice's forces. Now the last of her army were gathered in the square, and a temporary ceasefire had been called.<br>\r\n\"All I asked was for you to win two or three battles for me. But you are too incompetent to do even that! So, I am left with no choice but to make exapmles from you all.

Maria heard none of it, except the sadistic pleasure she took from torturing people. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. There is no other way.

They have undermined us at every turn! Now they shall die, and inspire their successors to greater achievements.\" Maria said, smiling. She knew that everyone in the city was watching her. She eased herself up from her chair and turned around, mooning the gathered people. She took one tiny man, and slid him up her ass until his feet touched her asshole. He looked around, panicked, as he realized what was happening to him. Slowly, he was getting pulled into Maria. She had spread her massive cheeks to give the crowds a perfect view of this. He had been completely consumed in under a minute, but it seemed like hours. The next five went just as slowly, their screams echoing in the minds of the people long after they were gone.<br>\r\n\"Now, maybe with this as inspiration, you'll all do better!\" Maria said to the new generals.

With a yell, they rushed forward, knowing what awaited them if they didn't perform at 110%. Just as they cleared the first skyscraper and emerged into the open space, two feet came from nowhere and crushed the front rows. Those behind them came to a grinding halt. They all stared up in fear at the giantess who now towered over them and grinned down at them. She slid her enormous foot forward, and it sucked the unlucky people beneath it and smeared them like bugs. They turned and ran in fear. Maria threw her head back and laughed, her whole body shaking in glee. She marched forward, crushing more and headed them off again. The horde turned onto a different street, and were once again running into the central square. Maria watched them run from her, a plan forming in her mind.<br>\r\nThe soldiers in the square on both sides were too scared to fight each other. They talked to friends that they had been cut off from for a long time, catching up while waiting for the inevitable. But then, with a grinding of metal and a loud crash, a skyscraper fell. It completely blocked off one way out of the center of the city. Then another fell, blocking another street. When only one street was open, they realized what was happening and ran for the opening. Just as they got there, a massive wall of flesh fell on them. Hundreds were killed in seconds as Maria sat down on them, not caring whether she killed her own people or Alice's. She slowly backed up, her ass crushing some people who didn't turn and run fast enough. Those who ran to the sides she scooped up and ate in one swift motion. Eventually, she had the last hundred people in the city backed up against a fallen building. A trail of blood and bodies stretched across the square. Maia stopped just long enough to let the people feel some fear, then she moved forward at a snail's pace. She savored the feelings of people tripping and slowly being flattened beneath her. She laughed as she felt people try to pull an unfortunate victim out from her butt, only to get their hands trapped and crushed themselves. Finally, the city was empty aside from Alice, Maria, and some stray citizens who had not yet been killed. Between the two of them, Maria and Alice caught them. None lasted much longer than an hour.<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like we've finished everyone in this town Alice,\" Maria said, looking down on the smaller girl. But had stains covering their bodies, showing not only Maria had done a little killing in the fight.<br>\r\n\"Yep. Can't say I'm sorry. It was so much fun! I only regret that everyone's dead now. Guess we'll only have each other.\" Alice looked sad at the prospect of having no more freshly scared people for a snack or a sex toy.<br>\r\n\"There is an entire country out there! We could capture a few states, or even the entire place! Or we could part ways and capture different cities. We'll still fight, but it will be more fun with more tinies!!\" Maria said, absentmindedly rubbing herself and feeling aroused. \"What do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

Maria dove into the river, which wasn't deep enough to hold her curves. Throughout her weeklong journey up-river, the water was deeper but her ass was always just below the surface. The river itself had only a few commercial vessels going up and down it, but these became her meals. As she swam beneath them, Maria would thrust her rear up, disabling the ship. She would peel the hull back layer by layer and eat the terrified sailors like sardines. As entertainment, she would sometimes catch small fishing boats in her crack and slowly crush them. After a long journey, she finally arrived at a new town. It was a medium-sized city, a little bigger than her previous stomping grounds. Does Maria capture this city?</span></div></div>",

Although the inhabitants of the city had to deal with two tyrannical giantesses instead of one, they quickly learned to adapt to the separate ruling style of the two over sized rulers. Alice was very playful and the more childlike of the two, smashing smaller buildings at at a whim and forcing the populace to play various \"games\" with her. Maria, however, mostly left the little people alone as long as they gave her regular \"tribute\" of food (though neither giantesses needed to eat), trinkets, tech, etc for her to use as she saw fit. She was also quite vain, and loved to look at herself in the reflective surfaces of the tallest buildings, even as she made city folk slave away to paint her nails, massage her feet, or even fashion her hair. When she couldn't find willing slaves, she simply threw a controlled tantrum and caused a bit of collateral damage to prove her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even as all this had been going on, a strange thing was happening: people were running as fast as they could... into the city! From the countryside they came, almost like refugees.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the Apocalypse, things were generally very untidy. Nuclear war just tends to bring out the worst in civilization, and as the social infrastructure broke down, many large urban centers became cut off from each other, allowing petty dictators and other corrupt governments to run their lands like kings. That, in and of itself, was bad. The city formerly known as New York was one such urban center. However, the Big Apple, although not as pristine as it once was, still had some unique attractions. The Statue of Liberty, the remains of the Chrysler building, and, of course, Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was a hundred feet tall. That, in and of itself, made things much, much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the extra radiation in the atmosphere seemed to have some unexpected side affects to a small percentage of the population. One tenth of one percent of humanity underwent violent mutation after the bombs started dropping, and nine tenths of a percent of those died immediately from the changes. But Alice was different. This spoiled young woman happened to have just the right combination of DNA to not just survive after her mutation began, but to thrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to grow, getting larger and stronger, easily installing herself as Queen after the collapse of the national and local government. Born into a wealthy family, she'd never been denied anything, and when said family tried to restrain her during her rise to power, they'd found themselves as nothing more than smears under her foot. Such was the fate of anyone who challenged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, if there was any silver lining to this monstrous matriarchy, it was that at least Alice was somewhat reasonable. Oh, she was still spoiled, petty, and self-centered to a fault. But so long as the citizens/prisoners of New York City did what she said, when she said it, they could be reasonably assured to survive. And there was a certain level of safety to having Alice around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nasty violence of the wasteland regions destroyed in the nuclear war stayed out of New York, because its Queen wouldn't tolerate any such affronts to her home. She considered the people of New York to be disgusting insects, but they were still her property, and the surest way to bring her wrath upon you was to mess with her stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis particular morning, Alice was examining her reflection in the windows of a skyscraper. A woman of good breeding, she had lovely flowing brown hair, framing a naturally tanned face. Her green eyes shone like emeralds, just as lovely and just as cold. Her moderate (in normal proportions) bosom was held back by a pink bikini top, above a toned tummy and hips. She smiled at her image, playfully smacking her rump, before heading for a dip in the Hudson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heading for a swim now, pets,\" she noted to anyone within earshot. \"So stay out of my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she strolled over to the Bay, ignoring any stray citizen unlucky enough to be caught underfoot, she noticed a strange vibration. At first, she thought it was her own tremendous footfalls, but she soon realized it was happening out-of-sync with her steps. And it was getting louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world-\" she managed, before she turned a corner, and almost screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of Alice was a woman fully three times her size; she barely came up to the giantess' thighs. The new giant was of Asian descent, and had she been of regular proportions, she'd have been politely described as a bit pudgy. Her hips and thighs were massive, topped by a healthy stomach and massive breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was completely nude, which didn't particularly surprise Alice; it had been hard enough to make a modest bikini in her own size, let alone for a three-hundred foot be-shemoth. The giant's face was a bit chubby, and should have been cute, if it hadn't been larger than a condominium. And then there were her dark-brown eyes, which looked down at Alice with cold contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands on her hips, this new goddess stepped forward menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Alice,\" she noted. \"Heard a lot about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...well, yes, I am,\" Alice stammered, trying not to be intimidated. \"And...and you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria,\" the woman replied, looking up and down at the smaller giantess. \"Huh. I thought you'd be taller. Guess people exaggerate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...well, I can imagine how,\" Alice allowed. \"I mean, I've never met another person like me, before, so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said I'm like you, princess?\" Maria snapped with obvious contempt. \"I'm a hell of a lot more woman than you'll ever be. I heard you ran this place like your own personal fucking day spa, and I wanted to see it for myself. And I gotta say, it's pretty fucking lame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was getting worried, now. She was hoping she could cooperate with Maria, but this conversation was taking a bad turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What... What do you want?\" she finally said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smiled down at her, a smile that chilled to the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Maria's response?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA. \"You know how long it's been since I last got laid?\" Maria forces Alice to pleasure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB. \"I'm gonna show you how a real queen deals with these little bugs.\" Maria rips New York apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC. \"I want to put you in your place, princess.\" Maria starts beating on Alice. </span></div></div>",

'Course, I thought you'd be taller, princess. Guess this whole place is overrated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This whole place,\" Alice repeated, rounding on the taller giant. \"Belongs to me! Stop breaking my stuff!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she twirled to strike Maria in her thunderous thighs. <br>\r\nIt was singularly ineffective. Smiling devilishly, Maria simply slid her hips to the right, knocking Alice completely to the ground. In her fall, the former ruler of New York grazed a nearby building, ripping its facade completely off. Winded, she lay on the ground, desperately trying to regain her breath. Maria laughed again, slapping her ass with a thunderous smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It don't mean none unless you got buns, hun.\" she sang, observing the now-exposed building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There were dozens of cowering people inside, and Maria's eyes lit up with a lustful gleam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey! Snacks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill sprawled on the ground, Alice was confused for a moment, until Maria grabbed a handful of terrified tinies and greedily licked them up. The smaller giant turned a shade of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really... Really gross...\" she managed, regaining her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't knock it till you tried it.\" Maria noted absently, continuing her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was getting more enraged by the second.

Think you're fat enough already?\" she snarled, getting back to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria regarded her with surprise, before smiling darkly again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, little princess, you got some guts...\" she sneered.</span></div></div>",

She'd find some way to deal with this cow, and then she'd have to rip up a bit of her own city to remind the little ones who was boss. She didn't want to have to destroy even more of her things, but it'd be worth the cost in order to reassert herself over all these ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so lost in contemplation that she missed Maria's surprisingly-fast advance on her. Alice raised her hands to try and defend herself from what she assumed was an incoming blow, but she had no way to block what actually happened. Surprising both Alice and those normal-sized people still watching from cover, Maria thrust her hips forward and slammed her stomach into the smaller giant's body. Alice stumbled backwards as Maria laughed at her plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could right herself, Alice found Maria looming over her again. With a resounding THUD, the ample Asian was on her knees, still towering high over her prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think I'm fat, huh?\" She sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't... 'think',\" Alice muttered, preparing to get up. \"I know you are. So does everyone for miles around, you cow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria laughed at her again, before simply allowing herself to fall forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh, maybe you're right, princess. Take a closer look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was struggling under the soft warm mass, turning red with both humiliation and absolute rage. There was no way should could budge from under Maria's bludgeoning body. In the back of her head, Alice realized that if Maria were a normally-sized young woman, she'd just be slightly pudgy. It'd probably be cute. But at three hundred feet, Maria's love handles were an unstoppable force. And this wasn't even the worst part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the worst part was that the larger giant's amazingly ample breasts were smothering Alice's face. Now, at normal size, these would have been less \"cute\" and more \"overtly sexy\". And at this size, they were downright life-threatening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get... off!\" Alice snarled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was thrashing as hard as she could, but Maria was just laughing at her efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go, princess! You can do it! Ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther angered by the bigger giant's taunting, Alice changed tactics. She began to bite at Maria's naked chest, and kicked and kneed her violently. She had no idea if this was working, but it was certainly making her feel a lot better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Alice, she was actually making Maria feel a lot better as well, in a manner of speaking. The tinier girlzilla was biting her chest and sliding between Maria's thighs, and if she'd been of equal size, it would probably be painful. But Alice was merely a third her size, and these efforts were actually rather pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, really pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't know you swung that way, princess,\" Maria purred. </span></div></div>",

Crushing a few tinies with her. Alice expected the much larger girl to get right back up and attack. But she didn't. Alice was confused. Did she kill her? If so it served her right for trying to devour her property. No one messed with her stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice cautiously walked over to the giantess and saw she was still breathing. She cursed silently. Why couldn't the pavement do it's job and crack Maria's skull open? Well it did actually do that if the small bit of blood was anything to go by. Well, small to Alice at least. For the 'insects' it must've been a vast river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was still alive and unconscious. Alice didn't like the alive part but perhaps that was a blessing in disguise. If Maria was still alive then Alice could make an example out of her. Show the rest of the wasteland who the top dog really was. Yes, that sounded good. Hell she might even get a new nickname out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice the Giant Slayer. Yes, she really liked the sound of that.</span></div></div>",

The starting point will be the same as before: pick the personalities of both starting giantesses to choose how things will progress. If you introduce further characters, then take a chapter to settle rather she's gentle or evil. I just want people to have that option, but you can do whatever you want with their character development after that. I would like to encourage introducing a new giantess every 5-10 chapters, just to keep to the theme of this route. One last thing: I would like any new girls to be around 3-6 times bigger than the one before her. This isn't exactly a hard limit on her size, but I want her to at least be able to easily interact with the girls who came before her. </span></div></div>",

No 4 month ago this happened and life changed immediatly, for everyone. She came from the lands beyond the moutnains. Dark hair and eyes and olive toned skin. Her Body was young but you could tell that long walks and hard work are nothing new to her. Her walks, with long, proud strides, was enough to calculate her fearlessness and confidence as she walked into the city. Without a care she smashed cars beneath her bare feet or kicked the, aside. Pedestrians who where too slow to get out of her way suffered major injuries or mortal wounds as they got caught by her foot in motion or beneath it. Trampling her way through the filled market place she clinbed onto the massive townhall and stood there with her hands on her hips like a greek goddess in Bikini and raised her voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Alice, your new supreme. Your useless life ends in this moment as you will devote everything you have got to me. Your city, your goods and your bodies are mine now to command and use as I see fit. Even your souls shall be only filled by the wish to serve me. Oppose me and I will end your life for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd that has formed was confused and scared. On her way this woman had brought more destruction and death than the last heavy storm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course this announcement didn't fall on deaf ears as the horns of the police blarred through the city and most of the forces surrounded her, weapons unlocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We demand your complete surrender or we will open fire in 30 seconds\" The giantess giggled and jumped onto the free space between the townhall and the terrified crowd. \"Have you not listened to me?\" she asked in an innocent tone as she slowly walked to the man with the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith unexpected speed she lunged forwards. The immediatly firing cops didn't seem to bother her as she landed on the car in front of him and snatched the guy up like a doll, holding him in her fist. \"you all are expandable toys to me and I tend to discard not propperly funktioning stuff\", she hissed and pressed on his head with her thumb. crumbling the man up in her hand while he screamed in pain and his body was utterly destroyed, was combined with her resistance against bullets enough to let the men seize their fire. With one hard throw she smashed the pulp in her hand against the townhall, making it splatter. The town was hers and it didn't even took half an hour...</span></div></div>",

There wasn't a single building left standing, and not even the military was able to cause a single scratch to these merciless goddesses.

With one defining trait: it's ruled by a 100 foot tall giantess! Alice has always ruled her city without fear of opposition. After all, nothing could possibly hurt her at her size right? <b>WRONG!</b> Her world is soon turned upside down when an <i><b>even bigger </b></i>giantess arrives on the scene. Standing at 300 feet tall, Maria is going to teach Alice an important lesson: there's always a bigger fish in the sea. Follow the story of what happens when big meets bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ <br>\r\nOkay, that's basically the story right there. Now for the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No other giants can be introduced in the main 4 routes. Option 5 on chapter one is immune to this rule, and can add as many new giantesses as desired. Either way, no male giants allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The personalities of both starting giantesses will be chosen at the start of the story. Please stick to them throughout the route you choose. In Route 5, the personalities of all giantesses can be decided upon their introduction to the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. I will allow you to decide the physical appearance of both giantesses, but they are only allowed to wear a bikini. There's no way that they could get enough fabric to make a full outfit at their size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No changing the giantess's sizes. Alice is 100 feet tall, and Maria is 300 feet tall... Lets stick to that, okay? Same goes for anyone added in later chapters on Route 5. Once you settle on their size, please don't change it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. No one-sentence chapters. I will allow you to make 'choice chapters', but I want you to fill out at least one of the choices yourself if you do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. No killing off either of the main two giantesses in routes 1-4. I will allow it in route 5, but you have to introduce another giantess who is even bigger than the one who killed them immediately afterward. The story is based around having multiple giantesses at different sizes, and if you kill all but one of them, it takes away the point of the story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. In the event that one of the two giantesses in routes 1-4 is \"removed from the story\" in a way other than death (ie: Alice runs away from the city to escape from Maria or something like that), they still can't be replaced by a third giantess. In a case such as this, the story can either be ended in the next few chapters or continued by alternating between the POVs of the two. Also, always leave an option to steer around this sort of scenario as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. I'd prefer it if any giantesses added in on route 5 were about triple the size of the biggest one currently there. (ie: You introduce a new one when Alice and Maria are the only ones there. Maria, the biggest one there at the time, is 300 feet tall. So the new girl should be somewhere around 900 feet tall.) As such, the only time there should be more than one giantess of the same size is if they were introduced at the same time as eachother. However, this one really isn't as much of a solid rule as it is a preference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b><u><br>\r\nIn order to improve the reading experience, I'll try to correct any spelling and grammar mistakes I find.
