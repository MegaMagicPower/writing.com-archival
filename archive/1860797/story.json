There was hardly a cloud in the sky, but the sun's heat wasn't too unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ was lounging on one of the branches of the large tree in his backyard. He was wearing a black t-shirt and a pair of khaki shorts, he wasn't wearing any shoes because RJ liked the feeling of being bare-foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was on summer vacation, so he didn't have to worry about school for a long time. His parents had also signed him up for little league baseball for the summer, which RJ did enjoy. Many of the boys on his team were either a bit older than he was, or just plain bigger than him. His parents seemed a bit worried about that, since RJ was their only child they wanted to make sure they were taking proper care of him, so they seemed to think RJ was not as big as he should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs RJ sat in the tree, he thought about his sixth birthday party, which was only three days from now. It was going to be a sleepover at his house with all his friends from school and the baseball team. What also seemed rather coincidental was that he had a baseball game the afternoon after the sleepover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted when his mom called him in.</span></div></div>",

But where are we going, Mom?\"  He asked as he goes over to put on his trainers to head out with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out and see, honey!\"  Mom replied with a wide smile and soon went out to the car, where his Dad was waiting in the car to drive them down to the restaurant, despite RJ doesn't know where they taking him for a treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many choices to pick a restaurant that could satisfy their only son to add the beef to it.

He could hardly contain himself through-out the day (the party didn't start until 6 o' clock).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, am I the first one?\" asked Matt (a portly, messy-brown haired boy who was RJ's best friend) as he came in. A sleeping bag in one hand and a wrapped box in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you are,\" replied RJ. \"Come on, let's go put your stuff in my room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hour ticked on, more boys arrived, each with their own sleeping bag and gift for RJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second to arrive was Sam. He was also pretty chubby and had short blonde hair. Sam was also known to be a bit of a trouble-maker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was the next show up. He had short curly brown hair, he also loved to skateboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor and his little brother Anthony came shortly after. They were african-americans with notable differences: Connor was overweight and had short brown hair, while Anthony was rather thin and had his head shaved. Anthony was rather openly jealous of his brother's bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Andrew, who had a noticeable pot-belly, freckles and short black hair. He was often calm and a bit of a math nerd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slightly-buff (but still rather slim) bright-red haired boy named Leo came next. Leo likes to work out alot, but like every other kid, he hates vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last to arrive was Derek, a massive boy with slightly tanned skin and short black hair. He loved to eat, he'd eat anything that he could get his hands on and often complained about being hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the boys (including Anthony, who was younger) seemed very large when compared to RJ. Either because they had round guts or they were just simply taller. This of course made his parents irrationally concerned about RJ's health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once all eight boys had arrived, the party soon came into full swing. They all set up their sleeping bags in RJ's room, which had been cleared out for the most part for the party, and sat in there telling stories about their summer vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then my older sister opened the hamper...\" explained Sam. \"...my pet mouse ran out and made her scream like crazy!\" Many of the boys burst into laughter as they pictured the scenario Sam described.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, girls are SUCH sissies!\" chortled Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the boys could continue, the doorbell rang once again, only this time...</span></div></div>",

The pizzas are here!\" called RJ's mom from the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment of uncontrolled chaos, all nine boys scrambled to the kitchen where 10 large pizza boxes had been stacked. Each boy had a whole pizza to themselves, except for RJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind having two pizzas...\" said his mom. \"...I didn't know if you wanted pepperoni or sausage tonight, so I got you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, mom!\" smiled RJ. \"I'm STARVING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom hated to lie to him like that, but she couldn't come to accept her son's \"unhealthy\" size, so she ordered the extra one to help fatten him up. Besides, it was a special \"10 pies for $25\" deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, all the boys had eaten their fill of the pizza and had gathered back in RJ's room. All the boys seemed quite content with their stuffed guts. RJ however felt rather sick. In the celebratory feeding frenzy, he'd managed to wolf down the first pizza, and had struggled to finish off the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...\" moaned RJ. \"...I think I ate too much...*burp*....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had more than you could handle, RJ?\" chuckled Connor, rubbing his own round gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Sam, wrapping an arm around RJ and lifting his shirt so all the boys could see his double-stuffed belly. \"You look like you swallowed a bowling ball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I swallowed a bowling ball!\" exclaimed RJ, massaging his exposed stomach. \"I'm so full. I don't think I can even move...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel you,\" said Max. \"Didn't you say we'd watch a movie or something at some point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...*urp*\" said RJ quietly. \"Anyone else wanna watch a movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the boys agreed to the lazy idea, they then gathered in the living room and decided on a movie. It was the perfect way to let their stomachs digest while they still chatted and laughed about the activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the movie was over...it was time for cake!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Save for RJ, who looked at his with some fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rather sizable chocolate cake with the words 'Happy Birthday RJ' in thick red icing. He certainly was delighted to have such a delicious treat on his birthday, but all that pizza still sitting in his rotund gut made him feel uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the other boys could get a chance to shove their own cakes into their faces, RJ's mom lit the candles on his cake and they all sang Happy Birthday rather hastily (at least it seemed so to RJ).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as RJ's mom left the room, all the boys began shoveling big handfuls of cake into their mouths, moaning at the wonderful taste of the dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the best party EVER!\" said Leo. \"Pizza and LOTS of cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\" said Derek. \"I think I'm starting to feel FULL for once in my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they finished laughing at the comment, they continued to eat away at their large cakes. RJ found it rather shocking how much those boys could eat, especially after all that pizza! RJ just couldn't help himself. Even though his belly was still full from the pizza, that cake was just so delicious to stop eating. He could feel his shirt growing tighter with each bit of cake he swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could eat like this everyday!\" said Anthony through a mouth full of cake. \"Maybe then I'll be as big as Connor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, keep dreaming, bro...\" said Connor, shoving a massive handful of cake and practically swallowing it whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all the boys had managed to eat their fill (Derek actually ate his entire cake plus some of the others'), they laid back against their chairs literally none of their shirts could cover their stuffed-beyond-belief bellies. Occasionally someone would let out a small burp or hiccup, followed by a sigh of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the best...\" sighed Matt. \"Your mom sure knows how to feed growing boys, RJ.\" He patted his stomach and let out a hearty belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I ate too much...\" moaned RJ. \"My tummy hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had really gone overboard. He didn't finish the whole cake, but there was hardly anything left over of the monstrous dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay boys, time for bed!\" said Mrs. Anderson (RJ's mom) as she returned to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks goodness...\" whispered RJ, rubbing his stomach slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the boys slowly managed to stand up and stagger their way back to RJ's room, their bloated bellies sloshing around as they did so. Everyone quite literally fell onto their sleeping bags and dozed of in a blissful food-coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ himself wanted nothing more that to stay absolutely still, and NOT EAT! His stomach was so full that he had a hard time just walking to his bed. Not to mention it was almost as big as a basket ball!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys slept peacefully through the night until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After what seemed like a rather short night, the boys awoke to the smell of hot pancakes and bacon wafting in from the kitchen. Almost everyone sprang out of their sleeping bags and ran as quickly as they could, shouting things like: \"Yay, breakfast!\" \"I'm starving!\" or \"It smells great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ, having witnessed this from his light sleep, slowly got up and rubbed his eyes. \"How can they be hungry again so soon?\" he thought, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he started to leave his room, RJ glanced at the mirror hanging from his open closet door.<br>\r\nHiss stomach wasn't nearly as big as it was last night, but it certainly wasn't the flat thing it was yesterday morning. He lifted his red shirt up to get a better look.<br>\r\nWhile still at little full from his birthday binge, his tummy had gained a very small layer of fat. He poked and pinched at it, giggling quietly as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smell of breakfast food finally got the better of him, RJ finally pulled his shirt back down and walked to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other boys had taken their places at the dinning table, and each where munching away at a stack of pancakes along with some scrambled eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, sleepy head!\" greeted RJ's Mom from the stove, making breakfast food by the pan-full. \"Hurry up and eat! Your baseball game starts in less than an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" exclaimed RJ. In all the excitement, he completely forgot that the big game was today! \"But should we really be eating this much?\" he asked as he sat down at the table. \"We might be too full to play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense,\" said his mom. \"You boys are going to need your strength today. So make sure you eat every single bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" said RJ, as a giant stack of pancakes was placed in front of him. Still unsure that all this excessive eating was good for them, RJ began eating the warm, fluffy, syrup-drizzled goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter piles of pancakes, scrambled eggs, and what seemed like endless amounts of bacon, all the boys where once again stuffed to bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I want live here!\" moaned Derek, rubbing his exposed gut. \"My mom never lets me eat this much at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she always make this much for you?\" asked Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" said RJ, slumped in his chair. \"Not really. It's kinda weird that she is giving me so much all of a sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well enjoy it while you can!\" said Matt, wrapping an arm around RJ's shoulder. \"Stuff like this doesn't happen for long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" said Sam, standing up and sucking in his stomach as best as he could. \"I'm so full, I can't even see my feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well I'm the fattest one here!\" said Connor, standing up and sticking his belly out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not including me!\" said Derek, pushing his belly against Connor's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to laugh and joke about how big they were until their parents came one-by-one to take them home to get ready for the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better get ready too,\" RJ's mom said after they waved goodbye to Matt and his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said RJ, as he walked back to his room. His belly bouncing along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came back to his room, he looked at himself in the mirror as he got undressed. His belly looked very big and round in comparison to the rest of his scrawny body. While he did find it fun to bounce and joke around with, RJ had a hard time feeling confidant that he could play baseball with such a fat stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ had a bit of a difficult time getting his uniform to button up, considering he had grown quite a bit after eating so much. The uniform felt snug against his tummy, bit it fit no less. He had an even harder time trying to tie his shoe laces with his bloated gut in the way. He eventually had to get his mom to do it for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, RJ and his mom got in the car and began driving to the baseball field. RJ quietly patted and rubbed his gut, which poked out from under his seatbelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Dad going to be at my game today?\" asked RJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not, RJ.\" said his mom. \"It may be summer vacation, but your dad still has to work on Monday. But don't worry, I'll record video of the game so he can watch it tonight when he gets home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" said RJ. \"I'll be sure to do my best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the field, RJ made his way toward the rest of his team. Their stomachs were are still full and were pressing against their uniforms much like RJ's. Except Derek, who just left his last button undone, so now the world could see his belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you all have fun a RJ's party?\" asked Coach Burt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet we did!\" exclaimed Matt. The other boys responded much the same with: \"Yeah!\", \"It was awesome!\", \"Best party ever!\" among others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see it went well. But I hope you're all ready for today's game!\" said Burt. \"Let's get out there and have fun!\"</span></div></div>",

They lost the game 12 to 1, several moments of the game played over and over in RJ's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBottom of the first with no runs, RJ took the mound. Once the boy on the other team was at the plate, RJ started to pitch. The weight of his stomach caught him off-guard and he stumbled forward, the ball flew right of the bat and into the out-field as RJ did a somersault onto his back.<br>\r\nConnor chased after the ball, but had to stop and catch his breath several times before he managed to reach it, by now the runner was on 2nd base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo stretched his arm as high as he could to catch the ball from Connor, only to lose his balance and fall flat on his back, the ball landing three feet beside him. Not wanting to lift his heavy belly, Leo tried to reach the ball from where he was laying, only for the runner to dash right past him and straight to home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTop of the second and they were down by 3. This was actually the high-light of their game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek was on 3rd when Andrew hit a long one into the out-field. Andrew made it to first (granted, he was panting like crazy when he got there), and Derek trundled as fast as he could to home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tripped about half-way, but he didn't stop when he hit the ground, he managed to roll his way to home plate. Even body-checking the catcher as he passed, earning their only run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBottom of the third and they were still losing 5 to 1, RJ had gotten better at handling pitching...kinda. It was a pop-fly near first; an easy out. But when Max had made it over to the ball, he couldn't reach the ball because his gut was in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on...\" he muttered as he stretched his arm further still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stuffed tummy could not be more in the way. He could hear his fellow teammates yelling: \"Come on, Max!\" \"Get 'em out!\" Max even got down on his knees, but the ball was just out of his hand's reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a bold effort and lunged himself forward slightly and finally felt the ball in his palm, he grabbed it and made his best effort to return to 1st base...only to find the runner crossing home plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTop of the fourth and the score showed 9 to 1, by some miracle they managed to get two runners on 1st and 2nd (maybe they were just going easy on them?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was at bat, although that round gut wasn't making easy for him to be in a bating position. Despite his added weight, he got a hit into the left side of the out-field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then began lugging himself to first base, those third helpings of pancakes relentlessly pulling his bulbous stomach to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta...keep...moving...\" he muttered under his heavy breaths, his running (if you could call it that) slowing to a crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the ball found its way to 1st base: Sam was out, followed by Derek...then finally Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had to be without a doubt the worst game the team had ever played! And RJ couldn't have been more disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're upset you didn't win, sweetie...\" said Mrs. Anderson softly as they drove home. \"...but I know you guys will do better next season!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" pouted RJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The important thing is that you tried your best,\" explained his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were too stuffed to try our best!\" blurted RJ. \"Everyone was too fat to play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RJ, I think you might be overacting a little,\" said his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, look at my belly...\" RJ said, grabbing his still bulging stomach. \"If we didn't eat so much we might've won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look...\" began his mom. \"You stayed up a little late last night, you've had a rough day, I think you just need to cool off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ continued to silently pout for the rest of the car ride home, just wanting to forget the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally can home, RJ changed out of his baseball uniform and into a casual red shirt with brown shorts. He laid on his bed, staring distastefully at his stomach. The fabric of the shirt stretched tightly over the bulge in his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid fat...\" he muttered, lifting his shirt to look at his belly directly. \"...weighing me down and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed at it in anger, wanting to just simply pull the extra weight off his body. But as RJ ran his fingers over his taut belly, he remembered how it made him feel earlier. <br>\r\nThe sensation of the added curve to his body, jiggling it up and down when he jumped, his tummy sticking out his outie belly-button...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ got up and looked at himself in his closet mirror, his shirt still rolled up. He glanced at himself from the front, then he turned side-ways to see the real size of his gut. He stuck it out farther, pretending it was growing bigger, giggling as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly all of RJ friends on the team had some belly fat, and they still played baseball fine enough (except if they're stuffed). RJ himself was starting to like his new belly. So maybe getting a little fat wouldn't hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mom!\" he yelled. \"What are we having for dinner?\"</span></div></div>",

For a month he's been sneaking candy, chips, anything he could get ahold of to expand his belly outwards. He's taken a few days from Baseball Practice as well on account of \"Tummyaches\", some are legitimate, some are just so he can focus on eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a month of eating, his belly was noticeable under all of his shirts. It stuck out like a sore thumb. He looked in the mirror and rolled up his PJ Shirt, to play with his belly. He enjoyed it a lot. His Mother was getting suspicious, though, so he's had to cut down so that he doesn't raise any eyebrows. <br>\r\nHe ran downstairs, his belly jiggling like a beanbag chair, and sat down at the table for Breakfast. \"Ooh, looks like you're getting a bit big for those shirts. Remind me to go to the store and get some bigger ones for you later today.\" RJ's mother said as he ate his cereal. \"Sure thing. Can we also stop by the Burger Place for Lunch while we're out?\" RJ asked. \"Okay, but don't get too much. We don't want you getting TOO big.\" They both chuckled and continued with their mornings.</span></div></div>",

Brian's mom worked at a local bakery. She always brought home cookies and tarts and many other bakery items... by the box full. Over the years Brian and his brother Derek had rounded out because of their mother's treats. Derek being greedy was now a 190 pound 13 year old boy. He played defense on the school football team. That boosted his popularity. Often girls would come over and rub his belly or feed him treats. They would giggle when he let out belches. Even though Derek was more popular than Brian and they were very competitive, Derek still loved his little but growing brother and promised him that he would turn Brian into a fatty like him.<br>\r\nBrian fixed himself a bowl of potato chips, grabbed a liter of Pepsi, and plopped down in front of the television. He started grabbing chips by the handful and shoveling them into his mouth. When the chips were gone, Brian opened the Pepsi and began to chug the whole bottle. He laid a hand on his midsection as he felt it bulge outward with each swallow. He then finished the soda with a satisfied gasp. He then felt a bulge travel up his throat and bulge his cheeks out.<br>\r\n\"Buuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrpppp!!!\" Brian belched. As he burped a button popped off his shirt, exposing a sliver of white flesh. Brian then rubbed his bloated belly marveling how it sloshed around with fizzy liquid.He then heard some one come in through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

After drinking all that soda, Brian didn't feel like moving from his seat. But he reluctantly stood up and walked slowly to the front door, his bloated belly sloshing some-what noisily as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened the door, he gaped at the towering confection his mom's trembling hands. It was a huge wedding cake intricately decorated with frosting along the rim of each of the three large layers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" said Brian in awe, his mouth starting to water at the sight of the monstrous dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" grunted his mom as she slowly carried the cake through the door way and into the kitchen. \"...this<i> was</i> going to be the Johnson's wedding cake. But apparently I used the wrong shade of beige when frosting it! I swear, those people want the whole world to revolve around them!\" She carefully placed the cake onto the table, which creaked slightly under the weight of the dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how much you Derek like my baking, so I thought I'd bring it home instead of throwing it out. Does your uniform feel a little...snug?\" she asked after noticing the skin poking out from under Brain's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh...yeah,\" said Brian, tugging his shirt. \"Maybe a little. It probably just shrunk in the wash or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" said his mom glancing at the microwave clock. \"Listen, I've got to redo this whole wedding cake the right way, so I'll be home pretty late tonight. There are some cold-cuts you and Derek can reheat in the microwave, I won't have time to make dinner so help yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After dinner, it's straight to bed.

He walked upstairs and into his room. <br>\r\nBrian's room was surprisingly tidy for a boy his age, mainly because the he mostly just played games on his computer, so he didn't have alot of toys and such. He did have quite a few posters of planets and all sorts of things one might find in space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered his closet and changed into a simple blue t-shirt and grey shorts. They both fit him, but they were quite stretched against his pudgy gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he'd changed, he heard the front door open and his brother's voice yell: \"Hey!

Even though they teased or insulted each other all the time, everyone knew these two got along just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that our long hours of boredom are over, how about I mop the floor with you on the Xbox?\" said Derek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we'll see about that, chump!\" said Brian, racing his brother to the seat closest to the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afternoon soon withered away into the evening as the boys fought against each other in numerous video games. Dishing out their normal friendly banter as they played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, their stomachs started growling loudly over their laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's time to eat,\" said Derek, patting his empty belly. \"What's for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom's working late tonight, so she said we could have some of the leftover chicken,\" said Brian, getting up and walking into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?!\" whined Derek, as he followed Brian. \"Man, I wanted alot more food than just some cold chicken!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brian popped the tupperware contents on a plate and into the microwave, Derek suddenly noticed the big wedding cake sitting on the kitchen table. His eyes widened at the sight of the sugary mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this...?\" he said quietly, still enamored by the towering dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" said Brian, pulling the re-heated leftovers out of the microwave. \"Oh, that! Mom brought it home today. She said we could eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget that measly chicken, Bri'. We're eating THIS for dinner!\" said Derek happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" said Brian, looking at the beautifully prepared cake with his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" said Derek, then a sly smirk spread across his face. \"What's the matter? Too much food for my little bro' to handle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think Mom might get mad at us for eating it all?\" asked Brian. \"Hey, what do you mean that too much for me?! I could eat FIVE of these if I wanted to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see you try, short-stuff!\" taunted Derek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on!\" said Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that after gulping down the scrawny leftover chicken, both boys climbed onto the chairs by the table and started shoveling handfuls of the discarded wedding cake into their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came to making desserts, no one could compare to how Brian and Derek's mother did it. Everything she made tasted incredible, and this cake was no exception. Brian enjoyed every bite of the scrumptious cake as he ate. But he hardly had time to savor the flavor, for Derek was scarfing away a the cake even quicker that he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrosting was spattered all over their fingers and lips, but when it came to filling their guts...these boys ate like real boys would.<br>\r\nAs they continued to eat, both boys could feel their bellies press against their shirts as more cake was crammed into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian's light blue tee slowly began to rise up and reveal his expanding stomach. When they got to the point were they could sit in their chairs and eat, Brian was glad he changed into his stretchy elastic shorts. Those jeans he wore to school would have been WAY too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, all that remained of the cake was either still on the platter or on Brain and Derek. Who were sitting slouched in their chairs and breathing heavily. They'd licked their fingers clean so they could pat and rub their stuffed guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...*BUUURP*...that was great...\" moaned Brian. He lifted his shirt up more so he could rub the tight flesh on his chubby tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Mom makes the best treats ever...\" said Derek, letting out an even louder belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love eating like this...\" said Brian. \"...then my belly gets all round and heavy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too...\" said Derek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" said Brian as he stretched and yawned, \"I think I'll go to bed now. I'm beat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, after a meal like that, I just wanna take a nice long nap...\" agreed Derek.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So she went upstairs to have a sneak peak and started off by have a look at Derek first of all.  He was shattered by the most part once he was fulled up so quickly, she can see his eldest son was sleeping without his shirt on and can see his thickness of his arms wrapping over the quilts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled and shuts the door as quiet as possible before she went over to the next bedroom to check on her youngest son, Brain.  It was like she told him straight when she told an eight year old to head to bed early after dinner and it proved just that for a kid.  She knew he was started to eat well and was catching up to his eldest's weight.  Brain was wearing his pajamas which it was kinda a bit tight but the quilts covered the rest as he slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boys have been growing very well!\"  Mom thought when imagining what the boys be like if they kept on eating her baking foods among the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her mind off  for now and closed Brain's bedroom door before heading herself to the bedroom and earn herself for some sleep before she'll be getting out for work again, first thing in the morning.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sweet freckly little tot smiled sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuv you too Mommy,\" he mumbled, snuggling back up into Mr. Blanket, his soft blankie that went everywhere with him. He heard her lock the front door and rolled over, going back to sleep. It was a few hours later when he woke up, his flat little tummy rumbling. Time for some breakfast! With a yawn he sat up and hopped out of his big-boy bed, dragging Mr. Blanket behind him. The plate of lunch Mommy had left for him was waiting as promised---yaay, hot dogs and grapes! But what <i>really</i> excited Benji was the big bowl of chocolate pudding sitting beside it, just calling his name. Mommy had made it for a get-get together of ladies from her work tomorrow, but she wasn't here and he REALLY liked chocolate! It couldn't hurt to just have a taste, right? Just to make sure it was good before his Mommy gave it to her friends? It might be yucky and then Mommy's friends would be mad at her. He was helping her! His tummy agreed this was a good idea, giving a loud growl that shook his whole belly. The bowl was nearly as big as Benji, so he spread Mr. Blanket out and set the bowl on it, dragging it into the living room by one corner. He wriggled up onto the sofa and spent the morning cuddled under his blankie watching cartoons and eating pudding. By the time the afternoon rolled around and the cartoons switched to boring grownup shows, the bowl was empty and Benji's tummy was as round as a soccer ball. <i>Oops.</i> He hadn't meant to eat all of it, it was just so good he couldn't seem to help himself! He'd make her some more later; Mommy always had the things to make pudding because it was one of Benji's favorites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the mean time, what to do now? Remarkably, Benji was still a tiny bit hungry despite his bulging belly. He could try to eat the plate of lunch Mommy made him, the hot dogs and grapes. Or, he could go over to old Mrs. Cardwell's house next door; she'd be fixing lunch right about now and she always said Benji was welcome any time. She might be making her famous berry pie or even chicken and dumplings! Or, he could look around in the cabinets and see what else there might be that was good to eat. He could even make a new bowl of pudding and surprise Mommy! </span></div></div>",

Sweat beads his face as he pushes the huge bowls on to the counter. He bangs the bowls down onto the counter. He relaxes panting hard from the weight of the bowls. When he recovers he opens the fridge to gets out whole milk carton, with some heavy cream. He hops onto his stool and measures the milk and cream. He then pours them into the bowls along with the mix. He grabs a whisk and starts beating the pudding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he's finished, he takes a deep breath. He carefully pulls the pudding off the counter and into the fridge. \"Phew\" He breaths, \"Good thing mom makes me food.

Thanks to the power of medicine, he can eat whatever he wants and not gain a single pound.\" Alex had never smiled more now than he has in his entire life. Dr. Feedar continues,\"Loosing weight should be fun for children and my new diet and medicine should work like a charm. Be sure to pick up this prescription right in the clinic pharmacy when you leave. The sooner the better. Make sure he eats a large healthy meal for dinner tonight to get the medication working properly.\" He writes down and signs the prescription and hands it to his parents who blindly accepts the advise given by this doctor. They are just about to leave and go out the door. \"Wait!\" They all turn around. \"I only save these for my most special patients and I think you deserve one for being such a good sport.\" Dr. Feedar leaves the examination room and goes to his office and gets out a very large 4\" across in diameter lollipop. \"This is just for you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alex is having a hard time choosing because there are so many places to choose from that his belly heaves in hunger just thinking about it. Then it hit him! He had to eat at the fattiest, most delicious place in town: Pattie Queen! It was his all time favorite restaurant and the burgers are just to die for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go to Pattie Queen, daddy!?\" he started to bounce up and down with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, son. You earned it.\" Alex stops bouncing and runs straight to the car and nearly runs out of breath doing so. \"Was it always this hard to run around like that?\" He thinks to himself. \"I'm getting to fat for this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, honey. Not too much. You are still trying to loose weight.\" Says his mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now honey bunch. Remember what the doctor said. He can eat whatever he wants and as long as we are taking the pills, he will not gain a pound.\" said his dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know, but he still needs to try the healthy foods and be act...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give the kid a break, he's just a kid! The weight will come right off when he is older. You know, you worry too much about him. He'll be fine,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, mom!!! I'm hungry!!!\" She sees that he is already at the door visibly out of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming, son!\" she hurries to the door hoping he hasn't ordered the entire menu yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up, Alex. You can have whatever you want. Remember, doctor's orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, dad!\" He looks up at the colorful menu and examining his delicious options. \"I want the Texas double cheese burger with bacon, 20 chicken nuggets, a large fry, a large coke, and... a large strawberry milkshake, extra whipped cream!\" The cashier looks disgustedly at the  chubby adolescent but he didn't care. All he cared about was all the food about to be in his belly. They paid for the food and sit down and had it all brought to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to take your medicine, Alex\" He pops out 2 yellow pills and hands them to Alex as he is being handed his large coke. He takes them, swallows them, and washes them down with a big swig of coke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of his food is being delivered,  Alex's eyes opened wide and nearly popped out of his head at the sight of such spectacular food. He unwraps the Texas double cheese burger with a full half-pound of all beef meat patty, with 3 slices of american style cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, loads of secret sauce and topped with 4 slices of thick, crispy bacon. He takes a big bite and he is over come with sweet, savory bliss. Greese and sauce slowly drip from his chubby cheeks. Bite after bite, his belly is ever more filled with empty calories going straight to his ever growing belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother looks over and sees how he is enjoying his eating and how truly happy he is. Maybe she is over reacting about his weight? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is about half way done with his burger when he gets started on his fries. He slathers them with ketchup and eats them by the fist full. He soon gets bored with that and puts the rest of the ketchup stained fries and puts it on his burger where he has to open his mouth extra wide to fit all of that sandwich in. Even though he is not even half way done with his meal, his mother's recent healthy cooking has made his stomach smaller and not as able to handle this food like he used too. More and more he is shoving into his over stuffed belly. Hist shirt is starting to ride up showing his deep belly button.  He greedily shoves into his mouth the rest of his burger and takes a big swig of coke. He is breathing heavily from all the food he has had so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Alex. Eat up. You had me order all of this food and now you don't want to eat it?\" His dad snickers at him. Almost daring him to eat more. His mother adds in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the rule in our house. You must finish what you have on your plate or you get no dessert!\" She takes away his 32oz milkshake.  No, Dessert!!!! With a new found vigor he returns to eating the rest of his chicken nuggets and the last of his left over fries. Every bite is getting harder and harder to finish. He slides the last ketchup stained chicken nugget into his mouth and swallows it almost whole. He did it!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The whole restaurant looks back at him. Alex only laughs. After such a big burp he now has a little more room for his milkshake. But he was to tired to really think about his dessert. He reaches out for his milkshake from his mom with the most content and cutest eyes she had ever seen clearly struggling to breath with all the food he shoved into his gut. He stands up from the booth, more belly exposed than when they entered and having trouble keeping his balance with all the food in his enlarged belly. His father comes in and picks him up as best he can. (His father is clearly ripped) With his milk shake in hand filling his overstuffed belly all the way home. Alex slurps down the last of his milkshake in complete bliss. He hopes he can eat like this every day. With his new \"diet\" and pills taking action, how far in the future are we going to see Alex?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. You earned it my little piglet!\" She hands him back his shake </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After many months and months of feeding Alex all the food he could possibly fit into his belly, it really took a toll on his weight. His weight ballooned up well into morbid obesity by now. This would be his eighth month of his parents giving in to every indulgence, letting him have every snack whenever he wanted and filling his belly with more than enough delectable foods than his belly would ever be able to handle. The month was now June with summer in full force. The sun was beating in his hometown giving Alex all the more reason to stay in the house. However, this was a special day for Alex because this was his birthday on June 8, 2012. He will be turning 8 years old today bigger and better than ever. His mom just brought him home from an amazing day at the arcade with all of his friends. He comes waddling through the door with a big smile on his chubby, round face. This was not only because he had just beaten the high score on the video game called \"Western Shoot-out\", but by beating that high score and being the birthday boy, he won a free large pizza! Which he happily devoured and enjoyed every single greasy bite all by himself. Of course, he had help from his friends cheering him on. They knew he could do it with some encouragement and someone running over to refill his soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent, he comes home with a sense of accomplishment and a full belly stuffed with pizza, soda, and lots and lots of cake. It was every young boy's dream. He comes in and immediately sits over on the couch and starts to play on his Xbox system. His mother comes in shortly afterward carrying all the gifts people gave him at the arcade. She starts putting them away in his room <br>\r\n\"Honey, aren't you going to change out of your shirt before you play your game?\" He continues playing with the only response is the video game noises coming from the TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, pause.\" He pauses the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, mom. My room is so far away and I'm tired. I've been on my feet all day and I need couch time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least change out of that shirt, it's dirty.\" She is referring to the white tank top with the state of Texas on it saying \"Everything is Bigger in Texas\". It was<br>\r\ncovered with stains from the pizza sauce. He still insisted on wearing it even though it stopped fitting him a couple of months ago. It really failed to contain his weight as it didn't cover all of his belly. When he sits down it rides up his belly showing his deep belly button and fat spills out the sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugg. Fine.\" He raises his arms up. His mother tries to remove his shirt but it has been so tight that she had to tug and pull. Finally, it comes off! The end result of constant eating and indulgence. All of his fat spills out onto his lap nearly covering his blue athletic shorts (not that he really used him, to begin with). He tries<br>\r\nto go back to playing his video game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh. Not yet. We still have to measure you against the wall. We do it every year, remember?\" The only response was video game noises. \"Alex, if you don't do this, you won't get to see your new gift.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks over at his mother and pauses the game. \"Gift, I thought you gave me all the gifts at the arcade?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost. Come on, Alex. Let's measure you.\" Alex heaves himself off his big butt and waddles his way into the kitchen where the wall where he will be measured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His dad was waiting there with a camera, a clipboard, a scale, a measuring tape, a bottle of whipped cream, and a triple-decker moon pie waiting just for him. He immediately notices the moon pie and reaches for it. It's just his favorite: a chocolate-covered moon pie with a side of whipped cream. He wasn't even hungry but just out of instinct he chows down like he has not eaten in a month. He quickly downs it with whipped cream shooting it right into his mouth, filling it with as much as it can handle. With Alex pacified, filling his belly, his dad puts a tick mark next to the crown of his head. Alex moves away, finishing his dessert. \"You are getting taller, Big Boy. You grew 4 in this last year. You are now up to 4' 4\".\"  He then gestures to the scale. Alex was about to get on the scale and then, \"Now wait, Alex. Is that how we finish food this house?\" He points at the only half-full can of whipped cream.\"You need to finish it or else you won't have a happy belly.\" He pats his son's now overstretched belly. He takes the can of whipped cream and starts to fill Alex's mouth. Alex opens wide ready for the rest of his creamy dessert. He was truly living the dream. With each swallow of whipped cream, he is sent into a world of creamy goodness, filling his belly slowly past the point of being full. Alex's dad empties the last of the whipped cream into the bottomless pit that is his son's stomach. \"Now, was that so bad? Isn't your tummy happy now?\" Alex starts to rub his swollen tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dad.\" He now steps up on the scale. It keeps going up and up until it settles on 174lbs. Alex tries to look down at what it says but is having trouble seeing around his belly now that it's been stuffed with whipped cream. \"What does it say? How big am I now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says you have grown up to be a big, strong boy!\" His mother chimes in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says 174 lbs. You are getting so big. I'm so proud of you!\" He gets showered with compliments. He can't help but blush a little. \"Alright son, say cheese.\" She takes a picture of him trying to flex his now fat encased muscle; fat is just drooping from his arms. He is also holding a small dry erase board that has his age and weight that he is resting perfectly on his tummy and his double chin. He poses with no shirt on letting all of his fat hang down its all of its glory. Love handles, tummy, arm fat, and all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge 8 at 174 lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, its time for your final gift\" They lead him over to his master bedroom to reveal his gift. It was a fully stocked big grey Lazy Boy recliner with built-in cup holders and a tray table to hold lots of food. It also came with some plugs and USB port to charge his phone and devices. Right next to it was a fully stocked mini-fridge packed to the brim with soda and snacks within close reach as well as a TV with a brand new Nintendo Switch system at the ready next to it. They both say, \"Happy Birthday, Alex!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's eyes and mouth open as wide as they possibly can. \"Is that all for me?\" He says as he waddles over as fast as his fat legs will carry him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, son. This is what you wrote down on your birthday list, right?\" And right they were. He did write it down but he didn't think that they would be able to afford all of these things. \"You are happy with it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AM I!!!!\" He immediately takes a seat in his new Lazy Boy. It's as if this chair was designed specifically for him. in a comfortable bliss, he wearily says, \"I'm never moving from this spot ever again. I love you all. This is everything I ever wanted.\" He lifts his arms um gesturing for a hug from his parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We love you too.\" They both gather around the recliner and hug his soft, fat body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Let's look and see what this bad boy can do.\" His dad picks up the remote for the recliner. It can recline back, go back to normal and it raises itself so you can stand up without any effort. He is lifted out of the chair to pick up the Nintendo Switch only to sit back down. He opens the mini-fridge and pops open a Dr. Pepper and grabs the cookies right next to them and starts chowing down as he boots up the system and starts to play a game. \"Happy birthday, son\" He turns to go out the door. He turns back to look at his son right as he is about to shut the door. He is now intently playing his game and mindlessly shoving cookies down his throat. His fat body is spread out for all to see not knowing how fat he is. (Or even caring)  He will be here where he will be safe. My son is fed, he is fat, and he is happy. He is living the life all boys dream of. That is all I could ever want from my son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething special always happens at Christmas for this young child or, should it be some other day in the year?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was that time of year again for Alex to go back to school. Of course, Alex was not ready for this because he had spent all summer gorging himself with food, playing video games, and waking up whenever he felt like it. In fact, they were late leaving for school this morning. After all, Alex had to eat his \"healthy-sized\" breakfast before he did anything. It's not like they would be able to move the kid anyway once he was set on eating something. As he was scarfing down his 4th dinner plate-sized waffle, his mother came over to him. \"Make sure you eat as much as you can because you may not be able to eat as much as you want now that you are going back to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widen at the fact. \"But mom! I want to eat when I get to school.\" His dad chimes in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we are writing a note that says you need to have 2 lunches and access to snacks. If they don't we will make a ruckus until they do. No one tells my son when they can and can't eat.\" He steals a piece of bacon from his overloaded plate of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!!!! That's mine! And why can't you do home school? My friend Billy went to home school.\" He wolfs down more of his sausage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex.\" His mom comes over with another full plate of food. \"You know we can't afford to. Your father and I still have to work. And especially after seeing your food bills.\" She pats his tummy and places a full plate of bacon and eggs. \"Now eat. You still haven't finished your first course, yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his massive breakfast, he finally gets to school utterly stuffed to the brim with all breakfast foods imaginable about 30 minutes late. When he opens the door to the classroom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRP <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks into the classroom with everyone's mouth wide open. Alex, completely oblivious to his own obesity waddles over and tries to sit down in the desk, but his belly simply won't fit. \"Umm, Teacher. Do you have a bigger desk? My tummy won...\" CRASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is now on the floor, his belly still jiggling from the sudden movement. He broke the desk he was trying to sit at. The desk simply could not handle his new 180 lbs frame. He rolls over and tries to get up but with no success. Almost gasping for air now after several failed attempts to get on his underused feet he says, \"Teacher, I can't get up!\" The teacher and some of the bigger, stronger 3rd graders struggle, but eventually get him up. One of the boys that helped him up was named Riley. He was a lot more muscular than a lot of 3rd graders but was still skin and bones compared to the others. And especially when compared to Alex. The boy on the other side named Billy. He was a friend that has to know Alex for a while now. Last time he saw him, he was only a little chubby. He is a little chubby himself at only a mere 100 lbs. They set him down in a chair built for adults breathing quite heavily now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang, dude.\" Says Billy. \"I knew you were getting fat, but dang you're getting fat.\" He gives his belly a playful slap. It jiggles for a while before settling again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" says Riley. \"How does a kid get this fat.\" He gently pokes his belly fat. Alex, still panting, points to his backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need food. Hand me my bag.\" Riley hands him his back form his broken desk. Alex opens the bag as it is loaded mostly with snacks that could feed an army. He immediately un-wraps 2 triple-decker moon pies and shoves as much as he can into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. That's why.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, class. Take your seats. It's time to start class now that that is over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the school for the week was of a similar schedule. Everything was just difficult for young, fat Alex now that he was huge. He still made friends like Billy and Riley. In fact, they even started to buy extra food for him and stuffed him with snacks during the day. Everyone was just enamored by his massive weight. He was the biggest in the whole school. Students would ask him to touch his belly. They would ask to come over to his house. He would even offer his new friends snacks. His weight, however, was really starting to take a toll on his legs. He even had to take breaks walking through the lunch lines every day to get his second lunch. His parents gave him a gift that would change him forever. What will his parents do to help him deal with the struggle of school?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a long day at school, Alex came home all red and sweaty from the short way from the car to his home. He immediately takes off his shirt and makes his way to his awesome Lazy Boy Recliner takes a large soda from his mini-fridge and chugs it. His parents come in with a large plate filled with half a family-sized bag of pizza rolls. They notice his legs are red and swollen from all the walking he has been doing at school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, what happened to your legs?\" First thing's first, he grabs thee massive plate of pizza rolls from her hands and shoves them in his mouth like he has not eaten in ages. An hour without eating for Alex is almost a lifetime. In between big mouth fulls of pizza rolls, he would state all the horrors of being at school. Like they would make him walk everywhere, they would not let him eat as much as he wanted, he didn't have enough lunchtime for the amount of food he would bring, and lastly, they made him go outside and play with the others encouraging physical activity. Not that he would of course. In fact, what really set his parents off was the fact that they took his food away from him trying to get him to move around more. Just talking about school started to make him cry and shove more pizza rolls into his mouth at a way faster rate. It was simply the last straw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't have to worry about those mean old teachers anymore. We will have a stern talking too with the principal tomorrow. How about I make you your favorite? Mac and cheese with extra bacon? Would you like that?\" Alex plops the last pizza roll into his mouth and feebly nods his head. His eyes are red from the crying and some remnants of the tears have mixed with the pizza sauce on his fat, chubby face.  His mother wipes his face off and dries his tears. His father comes in with a bag of cookies and a large glass of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat this until dinner is ready. You have been a good boy today so you get the extra good and fattening snacks today!\" With a renewed sense of vigor, he immediately digs into the cookies now resting on his jiggly belly alternating between a cookie in his right hand and his glass of milk in his left. Having a big belly does have its perks after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a stern talking to the school administration, he can now eat as much as he wants whenever he wants to so long as it does not disturb the class and their learning environment. He can have up to 3 lunches now. One that his parents make him, one in the lunch line, and another during recess. With Dr. Feedar's clearance, he has been taken out of P.E. and now has an extra lunchtime where he can go to the cafeteria and get another lunch. With that, his parents present him with a brand new electric wheelchair. Now he does not have to walk ever again. It has an adjustable desk that swings out from side to side and up and down to fit his growing belly. The seat his much bigger than he is but is quite comfortable as it anticipates his growing size later down the line. It has all the things a fat boy will ever need. Charging ports for his devices, a large adjustable cupholder, and several compartments to hold many snacks. Alex, even dropped what he was eating to stare in awe at such a wonderful contraption. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he never has to walk again unless it was to go to the bathroom or the small space between the recliner and his new wheelchair. He will spend most of his time in this chair or in his lazy boy recliner.  He arrives at school and the kids are very excited to see Alex with this really neat contraption tricked out with all those spaces for his snacks and by the sheer amount of weight this kid has. His belly jiggles for quite a while when he starts and stops. His school work has improved now that he does not have to worry about lugging his 188-pound frame. Alex loves it and even gives some of his friends a ride in it every now and again. His smaller friends, of course, because his growing belly gets in the way with anyone who is at a normal weight for their age. With all the food he eats a day, the weight just piles on. They do not even make him wear the school uniform with a button-up shirt because he has grown out of the bigger sizes they have. With his 3 lunches at school, kids giving him snacks and their leftover food, this makes his already useless legs even more useless. His legs are no longer red and swollen but are now swollen up by all the fat he has put on over the course of a month. He has gained 8 lbs and is now eaten himself to 188lbs at the age of 8. He only has a double chin now, working on a third. Even without a uniform, he starting to burst out of his clothes and his shorts are getting tighter than ever. You wouldn't notice because his belly covers almost to his knees now and every roll of fat is heaving with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day at school his friends, Billy and Riley come by to Alex. They noticed that he is struggling to open up a compartment in his Wheelchair that has his snacks in it. His love handles are getting too big. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

He always wanted to remain so big, and it appeared time again that his parents would give in and do anything whatever he wants.  So much so that his parents have also got him a new computer, so that he can play some games, whilst eating whatever he feels like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a birthday present he had been waiting for, and so after some setups from his Dad, Alex is able to use the computer and gets started straight away!  He looks to see what are some stuff in there, and he could even try and use the game disks to place it in.  But then, he spotted what looks like an internet, and of course being so curious as any other kid would, Alex leaves with no hesitation and clicked on it to take a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, he would look at the pages and be able to search anything whatever he desires.  But it was only a moment or so later when he had come to this particular page, like there\u2019s pictures of fat kids, chatting ups and other on this kind of website.

So are these kids wanna be fatter like me?\u201d  Alex wondered, looking into pictures of the kids.  Mostly chubby at best, but one or two of them are lot bigger than he ever saw, and it caused with a wide smile in all.  \u201cWell if they like it, then I wanna join in!  But, where should I start though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Alex a lot to think of things to make an impression to the other fat kids, so that he can get noticed.

He would tell them about how much he eats and how his parents give him pretty much whatever he wants when it comes to food. Of course, since he is one of the bigger ones on the platform being 174 lbs at 8. Most of the people he would talk too would ask him for tips on how to gain weight themselves. There was this one little boy age 11 at 145 lbs who is gaining weight to be a wrestler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you do it. I try to eat as much as you do but I can't seem to do it! It's like you belly is some kind of bottomless pit! I'll never catch up to my dad at this rate!\" He sends him a picture of his dad. His dad is at least 300 lbs and most of it is muscle but he still has an impressive beer belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex responds impressed, \"Whoa. Your dad is huge! I wish my dad was that big. He is just an average dad. I outweighed him last year.\" He says quite smugly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so cool! We should hang out sometime. You can show me how you eat so much!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. My mom says we can't hang out with someone you just met over the internet.\" They both think for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. I got it! Have you heard of Mukbang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mu-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's this thing that Koreans do. I think it translates to social eating. You can set up a webcam and you can talk to people over a live stream without ever having to leave your room!\" That was a great idea. Alex had just received a new computer. Now he just had to get a webcam. WIth Alex, all you had to do is ask and it shall be given to him. All his parents want is his happiness, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dad got him set up with everything he would need for a live stream setting. Which, of course, included lots of space for lots of food around his big and comfortable Lazy Boy recliner. It is almost showtime. His parents start bringing him all of his favorite foods. His mother comes in and feeds him a cookie and rubs his hungry belly. \"Open.\" Alex opens his mouth wide to receive calorie-filled goodness. \"Have fun, Alex. If you need any more food just use the walkie-talkie and I'll get it for you.\" She feeds him another cookie from one of the plates she brought in. She leaves the room and closes the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Showtime!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, everyone! My name is Alex. I'm 8 years old and weigh 174 lbs!\" He shows off as much belly as he can sitting down. His belly now completely covers his blue athletic shorts when he sits down. He takes off his shirt and jiggles some of his rolls and shows off more of his curves and sits back down. Gesturing to the massive display of food in front of him, \"This is what I will be eating today. I have a whole pot of Macaroni and Cheese with lots of bacon, Thirty chicken nuggets with a bottle of BBQ sauce, and 20 strips of bacon. For dessert, I have 20 of my mom's cookies, a box of double glazed doughnuts, 64oz of Dr. Pepper, and my dad's famous chocolate milk overload, extra whipped cream.\" He gestures to the whipped cream can on the table with him. He takes the can and sprays as much as his chubby cheeks could handle and swallows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, there was not much talking as he was really focused on eating for the first part of it. After all, he hadn't had anything to eat in over an hour. He was starving. Once he got started talking, he and his viewers have a great time talking to each other. They shared tips on how to gain weight, what they do at home, how much they eat. All this while Alex is chomping, munching, and slurping his way through his massive feast. He constantly has something in his mouth, resting one thing on his growing paunch while stuffing his face with something else. Warm and gooey cheese runs down his double chin as he fills his belly with more pasta than his belly will ever be able to handle. Finally, it comes down to the last doughnut. One last double glazed doughnut after his gargantuan feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, practically gasping for air, he pitifully looks at his audience, \"I don't know if I can do this.\" His chat immediately blows up with words of encouragement! EAT IT! EAT IT! EAT IT!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe musters up the last of his strength, his tummy still protesting and takes a big bight at the delectable morsel. He finally slides the last piece in his gaping maw and swallows. He finished. The chat roars with cheers and words of encouragement! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, guys!\" BUUUUUURRRRRRP! \"Thanks for eating with me. This is Alex, sig BRRP ing off.\" He turns off the stream and immediately starts to fall asleep. His parents come in to clean up after the messy aftermath of his great feast. Nearly 4500 calories are gone into the ever-hungry tummy of Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he make this a weekly event or, does he find something else interesting to do on this kid gaining website?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pull him out of PE.\" The doctor said. They said their goodbyes and picked up the first month of the prescription from the pharmacy. On the way home they stopped by the grocery store and picked up the extra things that they needed for the diet. They drove home. When they got inside Alex was sent into the living room and told to stay there. His mother and father stood in the kitchen looking over the box containing the pill slides. The father opened the box and found two 31 pill slides. One with blue pills and the other with red ones. Two 60 pill slides of yellow pills also fell out and an instruction sheet. The note  read: <i>Take one red pill upon waking and one blue pill before going to sleep. Take a yellow pill as a booster to enhance the affects. Only take on yellow pill per meal. Whilst on this medication do not do any form of exercise above that of short walks. This can cause the pills affects to accelerate to dangerous levels. Do not mix with any weight loss medication or diet foods as this can also cause the pills affects to accelerate to dangerous levels. If you forget a pill or start them halfway through the day just take the pill immediately and continue as normal. </i> Alex's father popped a red pill out of the slide and made a small glass of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took them to the living room and gave Alex the pill. He used his chubby fingers to put the pill at the pack of his mouth and gulped it down with some water. His mom brought in a whole 16 pack of crisps and 8 packs of biscuits and handed the remote to her son then left him to the diet that her and her husband where blindly following under doctors orders.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His already large stomach now hung a few inches further down and half a foot further out. His gelatinous thighs now pushed together and forced him to waddle. His moobs had began to sag down and his arms had expanded with jelly like fat. His face had grown plumper and his double chin had got far larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents were oblivious to his substantial gain and actually thought he had lost weight. His shirt was extremely tight and his belly slumped out the bottom a ways. His jogging bottoms were skin tight and fraying at the seems. He was sitting on the sofa with a massive packet of crisps. Greedily shoving large handfuls of crisps into his fat face with his flabby hands. After he had finished he chugged a bottle of cola and loudly burped.

The little blonde boy had already put on a lot of weight on his once slim form. On friend put shoved a spoon of ice cream in his mouth. He finished the ice cream in no time, slurping the melted goop out of the bowl. He began to rub his tummy and mistaking the groaning for hunger. . Next was a 2-liter of Coke. Austin sat up and chugged the pop, feeling his tummy fill up and grow even bigger. But as he finished, he realized he was full. Too full. His friend grabbed another bottle, Austin miserably sipped the soda. But then, he realized he began to take bigger drinks, this was because the friend began tipping it higher, this caused his belly to fill up all the way. Austin thought  he was going to explode! So he guzzled the rest, immediately regretting his mother inviting his friends over it when his tummy began to feel even worse. He lay back and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Austin woke up he was forced ate pancake after pancake, his friends kept methodically shoving them into his mouth,  when therAustin took made its way to his super stuffed belly. Another large batch of pancakes were ready. Austin rested his hands on his swollen gut and he felt it expand with every bite he took. Though she was being fed, Austin's belly only gurgled more violently and it started hurting more. He started rubbing his belly instinctively in an effort to soothe it. Once all the food was inside of Austin's belly it was hurting a lot and gurgling violently. He let out a huge belch as he was clutching his belly that amazingly was being held by the buttons of his shirt still. One of his friends went to the closet and said \"surprise, more soda\". He started drinking soda but the carbonation only made his belly feel worse. His friends wanted to make the buttons on his shirt to pop off using his belly so they tilted the bottle and he drank and drank until he felt like his belly would pop. The buttons still clang to the fabric and Austin let out a large belch. It gently shook his belly making its contents move around. His oldest friend shook his belly with his hands and saw that it grew a little bigger from the carbonation trapped inside. They shook his belly as hard as he drank the rest of the soda and buttons flew off like rockets. With nothing restraint his belly anymore, Austin drifted off into a food induced coma.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They all waited for Austin to let it out again but he wasn\u2019t able to. His belly started to push out as the pressure of all the carbonation building up in it was unable to come out like last time. His buttons soon rocketed off his shirt letting his belly rest on his lap relieving him of the pain. His friends untied him and dragged him to a cage where they locked him in for the time being. Austin was unable to get up due to the weight of his belly and he felt himself slip into another food induced coma.</span></div></div>",

His mother had finally stopped cooking and looked at all the food that Austin hasn\u2019t eaten. She sighed and walked over to the table. She forced his mouth open and started to shove the food down his throat. Austin tried to plead with his mother to stop but she didn\u2019t listen. He kept his hands on his belly rubbing it with one and holding it with the other.

He was much happier nowadays and sits on the chair to grab some breakfast to start the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, brother!\"  Emma says in her excited reaction and see's Dalton was feeding more just by watching him getting fatter again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, sis!\"  Dalton replied before he had to reminder when a message was received from his mother this morning and wanted to let her know anything regardless.  \"Listen, your Mom says you're gonna have to come with me to the football today, so you don't wanna be left on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but can we get something to eat once we done?\"  She asked, knowing that she has to come with him for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, she left me some money to go out whenever we want.\"  Dalton replied and scoops some more breakfast to his mouth before he would placed his hands on his belly to jiggle it in for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Emma was much excited by staring at him, watching him eat until he was all done and ready to got, not forgetting a burp soon-after though which she giggled a little.  Both were getting ready to head off and the two walked moments later.  Dalton was carrying some bags so he can get changed at the locker room while Emma held a couple of chocolate bars so that she could pass it to him anytime she want it to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two have walked just only five minutes away from their house and reached towards the field where Dalton plays mostly in home games.  Emma wanted to ask in offer when she wanted to show the chocolate bars to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Dalton, do you wanna have a these before you get changed?\"  She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, why not?\"  Dalton smiled and takes the bars and eat them before heading towards to the building to get changed at the locker room, while Emma waits outside in a sunny blue skies.</span></div></div>",

When Dorian managed to knock off attacks in defense, he can see the other side of the field and his counterpart surprisingly used the same strange to take down too.  It was as if both were evenly matched, but Dalton was a bit fatter than his teammate, which sparked an idea to try and fatten Dalton up, so that Dorian himself could reclaim as the best defense around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew this is going to work, and bet that could make Dalton out of the team if turning into a blimp sooner rather than later.  Thought he may have the patience to start with, all he could do now is congratulate his newly bigger teammate, and he had Dalton walked over to the house to have some huge feast.  When it says huge feast, Dorian would mean huge for Dalton to stuff loads while he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019ve reached Dorian\u2019s place moments later and got in to make Dalton sitting on the couch comfortable, whilst his teammate asked with a bit of a smirk to face as fat as his ideal plan is concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Dalton, is there anything you would like to eat or anything?\u201d  Dorian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... I\u2019m not that fuzed, so I can have anything you got, if that\u2019s okay?\u201d  Dalton shrugged before he replied with a smile.  \u201cBesides, you said I could get even bigger, no matter how much I ate, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, at least you\u2019ve reminded how fat you are than me.  But I might have some while I can though.\u201d  Dorian nodded with a slight smile, and it was exactly why he invited Dalton to come to his house in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course he wanted to get things done straight away, and can only imagining of Dalton being so massively fat, he couldn\u2019t even stand a chance to play football again, but who knows what can happen, when he heads to kitchen to make as many as he can.  Dalton meanwhile would sit there and watch some TV, when his stomach began to growl so much, he held his hands on it and rubs his belly to calm it down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about half an hour before Dorian came back with a wheeled-cart, brought in loads of burgers and hotdogs to begin Dalton\u2019s feast.  He smiled and says when presented it front of his bigger teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Dalton!  I\u2019ve made it all myself, but there\u2019s more to come.\u201d  Dorian says before he asked.  \u201cBut in the meantime, would you like me to feed you lots of food, while you just sit back and relax.\u201d  The kid offered which Dalton was happily made his response.</span></div></div>",

As Dalton was doing to, Emma was so thrived to see his fat belly hanging out and despite on how much he just ate, it was still somewhat jigglish. Emma was proud of herself as she saw the prove of her hard works are showing off. Dalton burped and proceeded to finish the baconator very slugglishly, but at the end he still manages to finish all of the burgers and washed them down with coke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well a bet is a bet.

His belly was now hanging over his sweatpants, with his shirt almost getting tightened from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis butt and thighs have gotten bigger and wider a bit, but still maintain the biggest part of his body so far.

It was probably the biggest park they\u2019ve went to so far, and there\u2019s different kinds of things all three could do while being here.  There is a number of waterslides, both the thrills and the small ones, a lazy river, river rapids, and so much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s seems to be interesting, but what made Emma really interested at the moment, is that they have some snack bars all over, including some pizzas, burgers, and ice-creams.

She would think that Dalton\u2019s fat body would be more effective than Edward, and hopefully she may be right when it happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three had gotten to the structure and Edward was the first to go down, no problems from him there.  Then, it was the turn of Dalton, which means Emma could see what\u2019s happening behind him, and the first instincts when he sat down, was that his thighs had touched the frame of the slide.

He also isn\u2019t sure what Emma\u2019s been up to since she did had a chance to rub his chubby belly it seems.  But he wouldn\u2019t want to question it for now and took some rest through the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning came, and it was later than usual since there was no school in regards to be on their break.  So it was a chance for Emma to make up a full plan to get his eight year old brother gain as much weight as possible, and it starts now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that, Emma goes over to Dalton\u2019s bedroom and can see he was still sleeping as a result.  So she would come over and gives his brother a little shake just to try and wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, big brother!  It\u2019s time to get up!\u201d  Emma says, when Dalton somehow responded by waking up slowly, still feeling tired it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha...what time is it?\u201d  Dalton Wondered since his vision is not being cleared yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s 10 in the morning, and guess what?  We\u2019re going to have a day out, just the two us!  So get ready and meet me there!\u201d  Emma says with the exciting tone and hop-skipped out of the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait... what?\u201d  Dalton is so confused when trying to call out his younger sister, but she already took up and sighs as if he may had to go out and see what does Emma had something in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it feels like Dalton had got no choice but to get himself up.  He had his vision clear up again and climbs out of the bed to get himself changed.  Again his clothes are like similar to his pajamas, where his shirt he\u2019s putting on are bit tight with his belly pushing out slightly, and his shorts had some trouble with a waistline being tight.  But at this moment, everything seemed fine for now, and Dalton wouldn\u2019t want to complain at this moment of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really wanted to check the mirror to see what is up, but he realised that his sister is waiting for him.  So it was socks and sneakers to put on and Dalton\u2019s out of the room when he joins his sister  and exit the house for a walk.  Although it was a very nice day to go out for a walk, Dalton still didn\u2019t get this idea and asked where is Emma leading into?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo tell me sis!  Where is it you\u2019re taking me to?\u201d  Dalton wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d.

Since it's in the other side of town from Dalton and Emma's place, they've decided to take a bus. When they finally arrived, they could tell that the restaurant was busy. However, lucky for them, the server still managed to find them a booth. They got their drinks served right away with Dalton getting milkshake and Emma getting water. It was hard for Dalton to pick his burger on the menu since they all looked so appealing to him. Finally, Dalton had decided that he's going to pick the Avocado Blue Cheese burgerwith extra bacons and crispy onions, he also ordered 10 Hot wings as an appetizer. Whereas Emma got a Veggie burger and Calamari. They got their appetizers fairly quick, however they've ended up inside Dalton's belly within 5 minutes; Emma just sits there and enjoyed every second of it. Despite him just munched 10 chicken wings down and having half of his milkshake gone, Dalton's belly us still growling. After what seemed like a centry of waiting and stomach growling, their burgers finally came along with Dalton's second milkshake. Dalton literally started devouring his burger ravenously, enjoying the avocadoes, the juicy burger, the crunchy fried onions, his fries, and every last bits of bacons. When Emma was half way on finishing her burger, she was distracted by a huge burb from Dalton, who had already finished his whole burger with his hand on his growing belly. Emma then got another idea. \"Hey Dalton, I don't think I can finish my burger and calamari, can you finish it up, pleaseee?\". Although Dalton is already decently full, he just couldn't say no to this offer. It took Dalton another painful 15 minutes to finish half of Emma's Veggie burger, her fries, her Calamari's, and the rest of his shake. \"Oh boy.. Emma, I don't feel so good.\" Said Dalton, followed by another burp. Emma was real pround of Dalton that he could pack all those food inside him, she's also glad that her plan actually worked. After they paid for their food, Emma left the Burger Diner with a very full Dalton who's still rubbing his now big stomach.</span></div></div>",

Of course, she didn't want to let that secret coming out yet, and so she tries to let her brother know, just as where she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dalton, I'm away to my bedroom, so enjoy the food I gave you.\"  Emma says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No probs, sis!\"  Dalton says with a reply, whilst he had some steak in his mouth chewing as much as he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Emma walks out of the kitchen and heads upstairs before she goes into her bedroom and lies herself down on her bed for some rest a bit.  Whatever her mind had gone into, she just loved seeing her brother eat, but this was not a reason why she loved it this way.  In fact, she loves to try and get his brother fatter and gain considerable weight from eating loads of food, she provides for their sake. That was her secret admiration to which Dalton doesn't know what goes into her mind for this reason<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she couldn't help it, but at least it would be a shot and see what happens sometime soon.  But for now, Emma was starting to get tired and once she made that yawn, she closed her eyes and begins to fell asleep, just as much as she made some food with her mother, before both her parents left for their conference and both her and Dalton were left on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough every time she sleeps, she would always have this dream which she could only think about her brother, but in a much bigger and fatter state of his body.  She could think of any weight from fat side of things, to even the largest human being in the world.  She does have that strange scenario, but she's still a little girl after all.  Right now, her dream was focused on her, as she watches her brother Dalton, doing what?     </span></div></div>",

Her curly hair was tied back into a ponytail. She was wearing a grey sweatshirt and navy blue sweatpants.<br>\r\nShe came into the living room where a handsome twelve year old boy stood up from the couch to meet her. He was a tall skinny lad. He had fair skin and nice green eyes hidden away under his long shaggy brown hair. His boxes stuck out from between the ripped jeans and the punk rock tee shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Erin. Thanks for running out and getting the pizza,\" the boy said as he grabbed the pizza from Erin.<br>\r\n\"Hello to you to Nick. I hope school was okay\" Erin greeted Nick. She then looked towards the stairs and to the second floor.<br>\r\n\"Hello Arty!\" she yelled up.<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" a soft sweet voice answered from the second floor.<br>\r\nErin looked back to Nick and spoke in a quiet voice,\" How is our chubby little bunny doing?\" <br>\r\n\"He's coming along great!\" Nick said enthusiastically.<br>\r\nArtemios was part of the Doukas family. He was the son of a wealthy Greek land owner and he lived in Miami Florida in a large house with there own private beach. Erin had been his nanny ever since he was born. Everyone who knew him called him Arty.<br>\r\nWhen he turned seven, Erin and Nick decided to make Arty into a fat little cherubic boy. Nick wanted to make Arty gain weight because he thought it would be fun to have a plump little baby brother who he could tease and pinch. He liked the idea of having a soft little brother to be a role model for. Nick wanted his brother to be the chubby little bulldog he always wanted. <br>\r\nErin agreed to help fill out Arty's figure because she always liked the look of round little children, especially boys. She always saw cute little boys with big bellies and ham like legs and chipmunk cheeks walking down the streets, and this made her want a kid like that for her own. So she decided to make Arty  into her fat little baby so he would be funner to play with. When he sat on her lap she hopped to feel his round butt press against her thigh and she would reach around and hold his soft belly to keep him from falling off. She also wanted to hear him burp and fart like a silly little fat kid.<br>\r\nThe two had initially  encountered problems trying to make the boy fatter. Arty had a very strong metabolism, and when the two first started sneaking him extra large helpings and more snacks, Arty just consumed the treats and did not gain a pound. But soon the two got what they were doing down to a system. Erin learned how to cook, and every night, Erin would cook up a fattening Greek dish because Arty would eat Greek any time anyplace. Nick also encouraged Arty to enter various eating activities at school and he would give Arty some of his allowance money each day for him to buy more desserts at the cafeteria. It was helpful that Arty seemed to always have a huge appetite and that Mr. Doukas arrived from work at twelve every night, leaving the devious two plenty of time to make sure Arty was completely filled with food. Slowly but surly, Arty's thin tan body began to soften up. Arty needed to be careful if he didn't want to become Erin and Nicks' big fat blimp baby.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Today was the first grade pie eating contest. Arty did not win, but he ate two and a half pies! His teacher posted pictures. You should have seen him. He sat like a sack of potatoes when he was done. He had blueberry juice all over his face and shirt and his little belly pushed from underneath his tank top!\" Nick finished his long winded story.<br>\r\n\"Sounds good!\" Erin said.\"Well are you going to take that up to Arty?\"</span></div></div>",

Ben did not worry about interruptions, as he was in charge as their parents were going on a date.<br>\r\n        Max, confused, swallowed and asked Ben to stop, but Ben ignored him.

Some boys were even as big as Sam, and while a couple were clothed, most were just in their underwear like Sam. Some didn't even have underwear on, but nobody seemed to mind, as their bellies covered everything. Sam didn't even need to worry about clothes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam went to his classroom, and a lot of his classmates, himself included, couldn't fit in their desks anymore. The teachers had is covered, though, as they just had the fat boys sit at tables in separate chairs. A lot of the fat boys talked about how they got fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle, one of Sam's friends, was almost as fat as Sam was. He had short, dirty blonde hair and brown eyes. He said, \"My mom and dad got this new kind of milk, and it made me really fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! Isn't it cool?\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool went on as usual, though, and the teachers didn't have time to figure out this new trend, so they were more or less fine with it. Either way, Sam had his bottles of milk stored in the classroom fridge for lunch, and he was excited to have them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day at lunch, Sam and Kyle went outside, with Sam having his bottles of milk with him in his backpack. There, Sam saw Vinny, his rival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since they were put in the same class a couple of years, Sam and Vinny were constantly going at it. Vinny always seemed to come out one step ahead of Sam, though. When they would play games like tag at recess, Vinny would always barely win. Vinny was even a couple of inches taller than Sam. Vinny had dark, medium length hair and slightly tanned skin. His eyes were brown, and he was always very skinny, so Sam assumed that he was fatter than Vinny. Sam was ready to finally beat Vinny at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Sam, Vinny must have discovered the fattening properties of the milk, too, as Vinny was now even fatter than Sam, by at least 50 pounds! Vinny was in a pair of extremely tight gray briefs, and he was proud to be as fat as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you lose again, Sam!\" Vinny said with a cocky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this time!\" Sam said confidently as he pulled out his milk bottles and started to drink. Vinny watched in silence as Sam started to get even fatter, his belly pushing out in all directions with his moobs swelling up to match. Sam's ass also started to get bigger and bigger, until his underwear finally couldn't handle it, and it snapped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's arms and legs also got even fatter. Sam had to take a wider stance to make room for his thighs. Even his hands and feet were looking even chubbier. Sam stood proudly as he easily grew fatter than Vinny, much to Kyle's amazement and Vinny's horror. Sam was now easily the fattest kid at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who's fatter now!\" Sam said, smiling triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on Sam's face soon changed to worry because...</span></div></div>",

Lewis looked very well rested and smiled when he looked at Ben.<br>\r\n\"Morning skinny. you ready for a fun day of just you and me being the \"best of friends?\" <br>\r\nBen said \"Ummmhhh Lewis I think I mite need to go home today I have a lot of homework to do.\"<br>\r\nLewis hugged Ben tightly and said \"Oh no skinny your speeding the weekend with me, besides the fun's only begun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis smelled his armpit and said \"Oh I stink I think its time for a morning bath.\"<br>\r\nLewis then got out of bed and dragged Ben into the bathroom with him.<br>\r\nBen saw Lewis's bathroom was really big tub. that looked big enouth for two people with plenty of room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis ran the bath and said \"Well Ben its best you strip down so we can bath together.\" <br>\r\nBen blushed and said \"What? no way I'm not having a bath with you. cant I just have a bath after you?<br>\r\nLewis smiled and said \"That's a waste of water besides where good friends its fine just where your underwear so you wont feel embarrassed.\"<br>\r\nBen said no again but Lewis was not having it.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said \"Fine if your going to be a big baby about it I'll have to strip you myself.\"<br>\r\nBefore Ben could do anything Lewis wrestled him to the floor and began to strip him off his cloths till Ben was in his underwear just like Lewis.\" <br>\r\nBen felt so humiliated while Lewis just giggled at how skinny Ben looked without cloths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said \"Well that waters not getting any warmer lets hop in.\"<br>\r\nBen was then forced into the bath with Lewis.<br>\r\nThanks to Lewis's huge size the big bath felt pretty cramped as Ben was squashed into Lewis's big fat body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He tried it again, until he may had given up and told Lewis since he got stuck there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, I would've move, if you could let me go and get it for you.\"  That was Ben's argument of that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop being a cry baby and let me do it then.\"  A rather annoyed Lewis sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he would move himself by getting himself up to his feet and goes over to try and retrieve the sponge.  Whilst doing this, Ben was nowhere to when when he had to contempt with his face getting planted and rubbed by Lewis' fat belly, wobbling all over as a bully reaches over.  Ben tried to push him off, but a big kid is too heavy and squish his face so hard in fact.  All that is more when Lewis finally grabbed a sponge and rolls back by sitting the same place he was, leaving Ben getting squished by his massive body again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis then tossed the sponge to Ben and soon, he had to try and move himself with a bit more squishing and give demands to what Ben needs to clean first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now use that sponge and rub it on my...\"</span></div></div>",

But it wasn't the only day he had to put on with Lewis, but almost every single day when it happens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis can make some demands of either coming over to Ben's house, or forcing a skinny kid to come over, and pretends to the parents that things are pretty okay.  It may be hard for Ben to try and break silence, but it's when Lewis is around, there was nowhere to go in his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it continued on, two months and what a difference it makes.  Firstly, Ben's looking more concerned than worried, since he would have to get used  of giving a receiving end by his bully in mind.  Also, when he thinks of it, he can only picture the size of Lewis as of right now.  Since two months had passed, Lewis had gotten even fatter, weighing at a massive 700lbs in weight.  He had that record being the fattest kid in the world bar none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly was larger, and had it lapped over his meaty thighs, which that and his butt are so huge and gigantic, it takes up a full length of the couch, and he was like a monster to Ben in many ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, it was back to its usual meeting, as where the two had met this time?   </span></div></div>",
