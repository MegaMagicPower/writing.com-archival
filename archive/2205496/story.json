Seeing this makes him curious, and he swam his way towards the crystal to get a better look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just what on earth is THIS doing here???'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGodzilla thought to himself as he observes the crystal. Suddenly, the crystal begins to emit a low rumbling sound until it abruptly engulfs the big g in a shining white light. Godzilla roars in slight pain until the light quickly diminished. He opens his eyes again, only to see that the crystal had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n' huh, where did it go?! '<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaffled, Godzilla looks around for any signs of the crystal, only to find none. He then shrugged it off as nothing and continues on his mary way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*LATER THAT NIGHT*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGodzilla slept in the deep caverns of the ocean, his brain conjuring up many dreams. However, unbeknownst to the big g, he was changing!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens to Godzilla???)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
