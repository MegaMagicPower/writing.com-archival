            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, Keith,\" the doctor said. \"That's the last of your shots for this year. How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skinny red-headed boy looked at his arm as he rubbed it. \"Okay, I guess,\" he replied. The shots hadn't exactly been pleasant, but he remembered what his father had said: he was ten years old now, which meant he was in double-digits. He wasn't a little kid anymore, so it was past time for crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then I'll see you next--\" The doctor stopped himself as he flipped through pages on the clipboard. \"Oh, I almost forgot! There's one more injection we can do. It's optional, but it's supposed to lead to healthy development in boys your age. I just got to go grab it from the supply closet. One moment please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith grimaced at the thought of another needle poking through his skin. He wondered if he could just tell the doctor not to do it; he did say it was optional, after all. But he figured that if his doctor was this positive about it, it couldn't hurt, and the pain would just be temporary. <i>Might as well suck it up and just do it,</i> he thought to himself.  He tried to focus on something else while he waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the doctor returned into the room holding a needle, one that looked much larger than the previous ones (or maybe that was just his imagination at work). \"All right, Keith, this should be the one. Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Should?</i> Keith thought to himself, not liking the slight hesitation in the doctor's voice, but he pushed his fear down and simply nodded. The doctor gently grabbed his arm, batted the already-tender spot where the needle was about to go in with a cotton swab wet with rubbing alcohol, and brought the tip of the needle to the skin. Closing his eyes and biting his lips, Keith braced himself, waiting for the inevitable sharp sensation of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sensation never came, though. Instead, he only felt a half-second's worth of pressure, and then nothing for several seconds. He waited, expecting that pain to come any second, until finally he heard his doctor say \"All done! That didn't hurt too much, did it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith spun his head around and gawked incredulously at his arm. Sure enough, there was a red spot where the needle had gone in, but he could've sworn that he didn't feel any hint of pain there. In fact, now that he thought about it, a slight feeling of pleasure was swelling through him, one that was rather unfamiliar to him. \"N-no,\" he stammered in reply. \"That didn't hurt at all!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" The doctor sounded skeptical, but shrugged it off. \"Well, that's certainly good news! You handled your injections like a pro, Keith. You're really growing up to be a fine young man. See you next year!\" And with that, the doctor was off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the car ride back home, Keith could feel the unusual pleasureful sensation spread throughout his body. It wasn't anything too overwhelming, and it was probably best to be ignored, he thought, but it certainly was a nice side effect of the shot, if that's what caused it, anyways. Much later that night, though, he began to realize just how significant that feeling was, and that it was only the beginning of something... big...</span></div></div>",

Go take a shower!\" his mother called. \"It's already 8:45!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith himself was currently in his room, playing a new game on his computer about a giant boy who must fight other giant boys to get even bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man,\" Keith muttered. \"Just when I grew to 75 feet...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe relunctantly began making his way to his dresser where he began looking for clothes. As he did this, that sudden pleasuring feeling that he felt from before came back. But this time it was way stronger! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs buckled from the sheer bliss that wracked his body, before eventually falling to his knees. Keith let out a soft groan as he suddenly felt giddy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as soon as the feeling came it quickly vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what was that?\" Keith asked himself. \"I have never felt anything like that. It felt so, <i>good</i>.\" Picking himself up, Keith quickly resumed searching for his clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked out of his room to the bathroom, he saw his mom by the door. Upon noticing Keith, she said, \"Keith, honey. I have to go do something. I will be gone for a few hours. When I return I expect to see you in bed. Understood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mom.\" He answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he did, he walked into the bathroom and shut the door. Keith put his clothes on a nearby table, undressed himself, and got in the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned on the shower, and let the nice cool water flow down his head and soak his body. However, as he was getting ready to clean himself, the pleasuring feeling from before suddenly came back with a vengance! This time, it was even stronger than before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith fell into the tub, unharmed. He began to shiver from the immense feeling, this time however, it didn't go away. \"It's that feeling again!\" Keith exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Keith sat in the tub, he noticed something. His body was sliding. At first, he thought he was slipping, however he felt his feet begin to to touch the end of the tub. Then the walls on the tub began closing in on him. Looking around, Keith saw that everything in the room had begun to get smaller and smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the pleasuring feeling stops, and so does his growth. After laying in the tub for a few seconds, Keith gets out of the shower, or tries to as he bumps his head. \"OW!\" He cries, rubbing his head. \"How big am I? Wait, why am I asking myself that when I can just find out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunching towards the huge mirror in the bathroom thanks to his new size, Keith looks at himself. But the only thing he he sees is his chest. \"Hmm, I've gotta be pretty big if I can't see my own face...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting another idea, he hunches up to the table and grabs his clothes. Much to his surprise, and disbelief, his shirt and pants are about the size of his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this is just awesome!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Keith know, things were gonna get even bigger for him...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Ok, so the author of the previous chapter was a little inconsistent with what had been already been set up as Keith's background. For one, he lives with his father, not his mother, so for now, let's just day that his father was a bit busy working out of town, and his \"mom\" was his babysitter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if you don't want then that's fine, after all, this is a choose your own path kind of story.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serum was supposed to simply give Keith a boost in his metabolism, but somehow, when the serum entered Keith's body it had a completely different effect on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon injection, his body was supposed to absorb the serum but at the same time <i>resist</i> it. This would have given Keith the effects that the serum was meant to provide. For some reason however, Keith's body was extremely sensitive, so when it absorbed the serum, it did not resist it's effects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, instead of a simply boosting his metabolsim, it overloaded it with with boosts, causing it to go into overdrive and as a result, Keith would now grow to unknown heights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side, he was now free to do as he wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after learning that his clothes were now the size of small towels, Keith quickly became fascinated with his new size. Sure, he now had to walk around with improvised clothing, but Keith decided that he would rather walk around with nothing below his waist. I mean, he was practically unstoppable now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, that was what his little mind thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he didn't know how big he was, he was sure that at least now he would be really strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was also certain that the bathroom was really cramped. Now realizing just how uncomfortable his hunched position was, Keith slowly slowly made his way towards the door, only to come across another problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands were too big and he could no longer grasp the doorknob without the risk of breaking it. For a moment, Keith was stumped, unsure of what to do, until a sudden idea came to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClenching his little fist, he punched the door lightly, knocking it clean off its hinges. He jaw dropped at the sight, before a smile spread across his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He was so going to have fun with his new body!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling through the door, since he was way too big to walk through it, he made his way into the living room and approached the main entrance. Once again he knocked off another door off its hinges and crawled through the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he was free! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at a proud 18 feet tall (not that he was aware), Keith looked around at surroundings. He was now about as tall as his house and all of the nearby parked cars looked like oversized shoes to him. He almost wanted to stomp them and wear them like roller blades, but he decided against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe when I'm bigger.\" he mused<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Keith picked a random direction and started strolling across his neighborhood. At first, there was nothing there other than the occasional lamppost that reached up to his chest and the booming sound of his footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he continued walking, people slowly began to come out of their homes, alarmed by the small earthquakes Keith's feet would produce whenever he stepped on concrete. Some people stared at him slack-jawed, others would scream and run away in terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Keith did not mind, in fact he felt . . . empowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Keith slowly approached the end of his neighborhood, more and more people began to notice him, many of them began to pull out their phones and take pictures or videos of him. In response, Keith turned around and gave the biggest grin that he could possibly muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more and more people began to approach him, the amount of people who feared him began to decline, until most of his spectators were simply admiring his newfound size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith was content with the attention and simply kept on walking, until he felt something familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething. . . pleasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The boy has stopped walking.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the same thought that all of the spectators had as they stopped walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany would never have dreamed of the idea of a giant boy walking through their streets with nothing below the waist, but here they all were, tailing a giant boy and taking pictures of him with their phones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, now they were staring at the boy, confused, as he suddenly started hugging himself, eyes closed and breathing heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he started shivering, letting out short moans every now and then. This had not gone unnoticed by the crowd, and they quickly backed off, just in case something dangerous occured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all of a sudden, the body's body started to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis skin started to grow darker and darker in shade, as if he were getting a light tan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bright red hair started to grow longer, until it became a wild mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears grew pointy and bregan to stretch until they became elf-like in appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this was witnessed by the baffled spectators as the boy's body changed. As they all stared at the boy in silence, listening to his moans and groans, something dawned on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis boy. . . <i>was mutating.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they saw the boy's canines begin to extend, until they became sharp like the fangs of wolves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the boy started fidget in place, moaning and groaning far more frequently than before. The crowd was rendered silent once more as the boy began to grow even larger. They could hear bones popping and muscles groaning as the boy grew taller before their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet dug into the pavement, toes cracking it as the sidewalk could no longer support his ever increasing weight. To their disbelief, the boy moaned in pleasure as he grew, despite the painful sounds that his body was producing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the growth began to slow down, and the boy's moans and trembling began to cease, until he had eventually stopped growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the boy had stopped hugging himself and opened his eyes, revealing two glowing light brown eyes to the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say the crowd was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like last time, the pleasure came back, but this time, it was less stronger than before. Even so, Keith had still fought for control over his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis knees had buckled, threatening to make him fall over, something that he wanted to avoid. Needless to say, he had endured the feeling and he had been rewarded for it. Now even taller than before, Keith looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was not dissapointed by what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrees now reached up to his leg, lamposts did not reach higher than his belly button, and his feet were now large enough to wear cars and not slip off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked around, Keith realized something. He was at the edge of his neighborhood and didn't know where to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could either go directly into the city, or he could wander around in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will he go?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was having a happy life by any means, and enjoyed so much that he got to spend some time with his family like it should.  That is until six months ago, when tragedy struck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was at school one morning when he was informed of a terrible car crash on a highway.  Sam knew his parents were heading through to go on a business, so he thinks they would be safe with an incident.  But it was not the case, when his teacher told him privately that both his parents were amongst the other fatalities involved in what was later learned, was a careless, drink driving from one man.  Yet, he survived at the expense of others on the highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis dropped Sam so hard, that he could hardly believe his parents are no more, and unable to spend some quality time together than he should get.  All because of one man to blame, he also felt angry in frustration with this cause.  He always wanted to take this loss and find this man some revenge, as if he needed it so badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix months on, and still can\u2019t get to terms of his loss, now that he lives alone that he needed some quiet reflection on his own.  He can be seen sitting on the bench at the park, wanted to have some quiet moment for his benefit.  It kinda helps sometimes, when he had bad dreams in the middle of the night, thinking about his parents he\u2019s unable to see them again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty common for Sam to take it easy for a while, but that was until one day when he spotted something that was laying on the ground.  It was some kind of a toy gun that some kids would use, but he finds it suspicious, and picked it up to take a closer look at it.  What turns out is  there\u2019s just two buttons and a trigger, which Sam begin to curious about this toy gun he\u2019s now holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm... so this is the size ray gun, eh?\u201d  Sam wondered for a moment, before he shrugged and thought otherwise.  \u201cI hope someone doesn\u2019t mind if I can have a shot at it for a while?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat curious smile was the first since his loss to his parents, as he feels he\u2019s been gifted to act his revenge or some sort.

He has blonde hair with cute looks, and he simply enjoying life by any means, even when it\u2019s eating lots of food he\u2019s enjoyed the most.  That\u2019s the reason why he\u2019s so obese, he weighs at only 250lbs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had his love for food, so much so that he simply liked the flavours of junk foods and meats to fill himself up.  However despite he had grown fatter with his shirt gotten so tighter, which caused his fat belly to see underneath, Damien doesn\u2019t seem to phased from it, since it\u2019s these delicious foods that kept himself going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wouldn\u2019t be that easy if it wasn\u2019t for a challenge set by his parents.  Obviously concerned about their son\u2019s weight gain, they tried to convince him to stop and look after his own body, but even Damien tries at least, it\u2019s the food that got himself distracted, and couldn\u2019t help but gorge it so much more to have his stomach filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was someday when Damien had to walk to the shops, since his parents think it\u2019s better to burn off the fat than get in the car.  Of course, it was a challenge for Damien to give, but of course his mind about food became his number one priority.  He was about to walk into the store, when he spotted a vending machine that caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw, was some brand new bottle of soda, which he has never seen like it before.  Even he couldn\u2019t remember if it was advertised or not, but whatever the case, Damien couldn\u2019t help but shrugged it off, and wants to give it a try.  So he paid into the machine, and got the bottle out to pick up, and get a closer look to the soda itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...  I\u2019ve never seen a soda like this before.  I\u2019m sure hope I\u2019ll give it a try though, because I\u2019m so thirsty!\u201d  Damien says, since he felt his mouth rather dry for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he wasted no time but to open the top cap of the bottle, and takes a sip to give it a taste.  That\u2019s when he had that surprised expression and felt a satisfying taste of that drink.  Of course with him nodding his approval, Damien takes another drink, as he would chug down...</span></div></div>",

He had been famous being in these roles, both on TV and on Film, but is yet to star in the main role, until now with his latest project was eventually his Dad\u2019s idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father named David, is not only Lewis\u2019 father but he\u2019s also an agent to a nine year old, so he would always gave Lewis an opportunity to give these roles a try and experience what it\u2019s like to act right in front of the cameras.  Of course David knows his son is always nervous when the planes project is on, but even when the youngster is about to star in his main role of movie, David would be making sure he gets Lewis some composure before going out to make the impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first day of filming, and Lewis already knows what roles he\u2019s going to be.  It\u2019s the film parodied by \u2018Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\u2019, but with a boy being in the centre of the attention.  He liked that idea, and thought he was gonna get some miniature buildings or special effects to look like he\u2019s a giant indeed.  But what he doesn\u2019t know is that the directors and his Dad wanted to make Lewis a giant, like for real, by using a ray gun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main reason for this is because they don\u2019t wanna use any scenes that many viewers branded this a fake, and non-existent.  Their aim is to try and make this a reality and it will be the first time to make any person like Lewis a giant for real, just so they wanted to surprise everyone all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, they wouldn\u2019t want to tell Lewis until the filming process, as they wanted to make the scene...</span></div></div>",
