He went to high school, was an average student and basically faded into the woodwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went home every day to see his annoying 14 year old brother, Robert, and hear his parents talk about how great his older sister, Caitlin, was. 23 and she still came home often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, one night he went home late after partying (or being at a party and watching everyone else). He went to sleep. And stayed asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this is where our story begins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his dreams, a nightmarish figure kept appearing. Each time it appeared differently. One, a Grim Reaper-esque figure with burning eyes. Another time a perky Goth girl...who when she opened her mouth, revealed a snake's tongue and fangs. The versions kept changing and never ceased. Always telling him he would never wake up. And if he did, it would be in a way that made him wish he would stay in his nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, nothing too nightmarish had happened. But then...the figure disappeared. And Alex found himself in front of five doors. He was in the middle of nowhere, like purgatory. Nothing but white space and the five doors. Which door does he go in?</span></div></div>",

Though he didn't know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, he looked at a bookcase. On top of it was a portrait of his family...but he wasn't in it. Caitlin then walked around the corner, her usual Playmate looking way and stared at Alex. It was like she had never seen him before. Like he was a stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin said, \"Who are you?\" Alex replied, \"I'm your brother, don't you remember?\" Caitlin shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked at Caitlin, who merely looked confused as she licked her lips. Alex wondered why she would lick her lips. A noise went off and Caitlin went off to the kitchen, the oven apparently beeping. Maybe that was it. She was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked around the house and eventually met up with his parents and brother, Robert. But they didn't know him either. Things were getting slightly weird. He sat down on a couch, pondering what to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning on the nearby TV, a kid's show was on. Talking purple dinosaurs. One said, \"Kids, remember loneliness is just a state of mind.\" Then the next said, \"If you're lonely, talk to someone you trust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the room started getting smaller and smaller until it crushed itself, crushing Alex to death. Then he \"woke\" up in the guest room bed. Caitlin, Robert and his parents were there. But they were...different. Each in a different way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin kept checking herself out. Lusting over herself. Touching herself. This was odd, she was pretty but she wasn't in love with herself...at least not to this extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert kept cracking his knuckles. Over and over. Again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom kept scratching herself. Never stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad was just...blank. No emotion whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they all started humming Frere Jacques. Wait, doesn't that song translate to \"Are you sleeping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething had to be wrong. This whole place was wrong, crushed to death and then waking up like it was nothing...to a creepier version of your family? ...Maybe you should talk to one of them. Maybe that would help. Hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard rain outside. Looking out the window, it was raining. That was oddly timed. But this whole thing is just too messed. Alex thought maybe he could get answers from his family. Talk to one of them, see what was going on...or he could leave and get out of this freaky house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

If you really love your family, remember to use nothing but the finest of spices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was slightly disturbed at this broadcast. But it got worse. He found Caitlin in the kitchen. That previous beeping was just the oven after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin, wearing...surgical gloves for some reason, pulled something out of the oven. She pulled something out of the oven. Licking her lips, she pulled out a human head, falling apart from the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Alex want to vomit. Caitlin was smiling for some reason. Caitlin said, \"Do you want to join us for some food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex felt uneasy at this but before he could answer, Caitlin droped the head on the floor and went off somewhere humming and looking at herself with lustful pleasure.

Searchlights trained on him, and instead of being outside his house on the ground floor, he was on the third floor of a mansion! \"Alright, wiseguy,\" said a cop on the ground \"you can't escape! We've got men everywhere with guns trained on you, so drop the money and put your hands up!\". It was clear that the cops weren't giving him much of a choice.

Suddenly, Caitlin picked him up and threw him into the mirror, oddly enough, it didnt smash, but he seemed to pass into it, as if he was now a reflection of himself. When he got up from falling on the bathroom floor, he looked into the mirror, and Caitlin was staring at him, she had an evil grin on her face, yet she was only in the mirror, not beside him. Alex was really freaking out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything started twisting and turning until everything Alex could see was a cross of black and white and lots of grey. Eventually, everything came back into focus and he hoped that this dream was something of a more safe enviroment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was standing in a forest clearing, everything was calm and still, not the scary kind of somethings-going-to-jump-out-at-you kind, but the peaceful, this is an intermission kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt most certainly was not. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a massive bulldozer came crashing through the trees, knocking everything over in its wake. The thing was at least twenty times the size of a usual bulldozer, but it towered over Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before it was about to crush Alex, who couldnt move for some reason and was frantically trying to get away, it stopped, an inch from his nose.<br>\r\nAt this point, someone hopped out of the cab and jumped down. At least this person was of normal height, but something was wrong about this person, something was very, very wrong. It was Alex who jumped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caitlin, what the heck are you doing out here?\" He asked, raising his eyebrows, but not in a worried sort of fashion. Wait, he called Alex Caitlin? That cant be... Oh no! Alex looked down at himself and found that he had been fully turned into Caitlin! Alex screamed, but when he did, he found even his voice had changed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newer Alex rolled his eyes, and went up and punched our Alex (Who is now for some reason Caitlin) in the face, knocking hi-... 'her' out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alex came too, he was back as himself. This was daunting, scary and he wanted out, as SOON as possible. He tried pinching himself, hitting himself, but nothing worked, he was stuck in this nightmare and it wasnt even halfway yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Caitlin appeared, oh why oh why was it always HER?<br>\r\n\"It's me or you. Choose\" Said Caitlin, almost looking annoyed at you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alex slowly made his way to the front door, careful not to alarm any of his family. He opened the door hesitantly and peered through the darkness. It was hard to see through the heaviness of the rain. He shifted his weight to his right foot stepping outside of the doorway. He suddenly felt himself falling forward. He couldn't understand why the ground wasn't catching his fall. It was like he had fallen into an empty void. Some sort of black hole. His body began to pick up speed, traveling so fast that he began to feel heat against his skin. He continued to grow warmer the further and faster he fell. He began to panic, screaming, \"Somebody help me. What's going on? Where am I? Why are you doing this to me?\" But there was only the echo of his own voice and the wind that surrounded him. <br>\r\nIt seemed like he had been falling for an awful long time. The heat continued to grow. Suddenly, the was a flicker of light in the distance below him. It was orange and red and yellow. And then he began to hear what he thought was moaning and screaming intertwined. The light was very hot and he could feel his skin beginning to burn and sting. The screaming got louder as he fell. It began to get close very quick. He knew he was about to come to the end of whatever this place was. The burning became very intense and suddenly he was overcome with the pain of his body slamming to the bottom of the pit.<br>\r\nA loud deep voice laughed at him as he laid the screaming. Alex yelled, \"Stop! It hurts! Stop the pain, please. I'll do anything!\"<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" the voice replied. \"Now that sounds tempting! But I thought we could have some fun first,\" he laughed. Then two men came out of the darkness and grabbed Alex's arms and legs. They drug him to a long table covered in blood and fastened him into shackles that were attatched to the table. Alex cried and screamed for them to stop, but they continued like robots obeying a command. He tried to look at the men as he begged them to stop. He was horrified by what he saw. Their flesh was burnt and they had empty, blackened eye sockets. Their fingernails were long and sharp like claws and cut his skin as they held him down.<br>\r\n\"What is this place? Who are you? What do you want from me?\" Alex kept yelling out. But his voice was drowned out by the other screams in the background. And this evil man just laughed at his misery.<br>\r\nThe two men came back over to Alex and began pressing sharp, cold, metal hooks into his chest. The pain was excruciating. He could still feel his flesh blistering from the extreme heat surrounding him. He screamed as his skin ripped open. The pain was so immense that Alex began to go into shock. His eyes became glazed and fixed. All he could do was try to focus on something else, something far away.<br>\r\nHe thought of his family. Then he began to remember pieces of waking up in a bizarre reality just before he had fallen into the pit of Hell.<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'm still asleep. Yeah, that's it,\" he thought as he fought back the tears. \"This has got to be some sort of dream!\"<br>\r\nIf only he could just wake up, maybe this nightmare would end.<br>\r\n\"I can make all of this suffering go away, if you could give me just one thing,\" said the man with the evil laugh.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Alex.<br>\r\n\"Kill your brother!\" the man demanded angrily.<br>\r\n\"I can't do that\" said Alex.<br>\r\n\"Then suffer for an eternity!\" the man yelled in a very deep voice. He tortured Alex until he gave into the pain. <br>\r\nJust as soon as Alex agreed to kill his only brother, he felt like he'd been hit in the chest until his breath was knocked out of him. He opened his eyes to see that he was laying on his bed again. He couldn't tell if he was awake or still stuck in yet another dream. Just then Robert walked into the room.</span></div></div>",

The ground under him was soggy yet jagged like it was covered in shards of rock or perhaps metal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear running water all around him that sounded like it might be running through pipes or maybe there was a river above him. The room was oldly shaped and most likely made of dirt and mud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't like this horrible place and tryed to turn around and go back out the door, only to run smack into a slippery wet wall covered in barbed protusions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeaaagg!\" Screamed Alex as he fell to the wet floor, scraping his hands on the hard razor-like things that seemed to be stuck in the walls, the floor, and maybe even the ceiling. He simply sat on the small floor for a minute in deep pain before trying to get back up. He fought back tears as he stood back up slowly, trying his hardest to avoid any more injuries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms, his face, and most of the front of his body as well as his legs and his lower back were driping blood and covered in gashes. He was sure that something was sticking out of his back and lower leg. He tried vainly to remove one of the things, but the pain was too much. It was freezeing cold in this tiny place, but poor Alex couldn't tell if it was the dripping walls that seemed to be oozeing ice-cold water or himself as he felt his own blood run down his face and chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was afraid to move, lest he get caught on a metal wire or broken tin can that he now realized this small room was filled with after his fall earlier onto what must have been the remains of some garbagemans collection of trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat really scared him was that everything in here was metal and was probaly rusted at that... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Alex struggled to break free, he began to hear footsteps coming through the door. Something was approaching on the other side. With every step, hot air was whipped through the edge of the door frame and flowed over Alex's body. The air was hot enough to feel very uncomfortable, but not scorching or truly painful. Unlike the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's hand was steadily being overcome with pain. The searing metal that had fused with his skin burned ever hotter, and was now emitting a faint orange glow. Alex began to scream, even worse than the pain itself was its gradual increase. When would it stop? How badly would it scar my hand? Alex's mind was flooded with the grimmest of scenarios as his hand was charred, now down to the bone, by the glowing metal handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm dying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cried out, his face displaying great anguish, his mind ready to blank out in a desperate attempt to escape the pain. Then, the foot steps came again, followed by a dark distorted voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his father calling from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad? Dad help me, I'm burning! I can't feel my skin, help me! Don't let me die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex pleaded with his father's voice, praying that his suffering would end, but his father did not seem to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex. I told you to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot steps were now mad stomps, the ground buckled after every impact, and the entire building seemed to weaken as whatever roamed past the door drew closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, I'm sorry, it's not my fault, it's killing me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, you disobeyed. Why? You do not...\" Alex's father roared, and another stomp rocked the entire Earth. \"You do not disobey me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex felt something slam him just below the chin, then he lost track of the ground, as he could no longer feel it through his feet. Splinters of wood cut and nicked him, and the burning shards that had comprised the handle branded his flesh as they scattered. Alex found solid ground again when his head crashed into something, and his body fell to the ground. He was stunned, he was burned, he was panting. He could not feel the hand that had been burned, and he was too weak to move his body and examine his wounds. As Alex lay, staring up at blinding white lights perched on some far off darkness, he could only heard the voice of his father once again, now even more twisted, and clearly enraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALEX.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU DISOBEYED, WHY DO YOU TRY TO UPSET ME? WHY DO YOU,\" The sound of twisting, scraping metal filled the air \"TORMENT ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex somehow managed to raise his body against the wall behind him, he could see his father standing a few feet in front of him. The man stood with his legs spread, and arms out from his sides. His hands were fully open, and shaking. In the darkness, Alex could not see his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY, WHY, WHY?\" Alex's farther was hysterical, he was screaming madly, and began slamming himself on the floor and walls. Then he seemed to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, I didn't mean to. I just feel so empty sometimes. Sometimes, it's so hard. I just need something to fill me. That's why I take them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis farther came forward, and now Alex could see that he was holding something. As he slowly walked forward, the object was lit up more and more by the overhanging lights. Then, Alex could see it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a head, it looked like the head of a little girl, perhaps from the one that had been screaming. It was marred by a deep cut down the side from which still fresh blood poured, and the eyes were wide open, one looking straight ahead, the other tilted up. As the head dangled from it's hair, which was gripped tightly in Alex's father's hand, the girl's jaw was only barely attached and twisted about a tendon and some strands of badly cut muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They fill me Alex, they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alex sat barely able to understand, his father took the girl's hair into his mouth and bit down on it. With his now free hand, he took his other arm and pulled. Without so much as a flinch, he broke the arm. The delicate bone and muscle below the skin snapped and popped loudly, but he was not done. He rose both arms over his head, and then pulled again. He began to breath quickly, and veins expanded through his skin all over his body. His breaths began beast like grunts as the skin on his arm began to tear. He then reached into the mutilated arm and took hold of the bone. He violently, relentlessly tugged on it, throwing himself back and forth. The shattered bone made a fine knife, and with it, he managed to cut away the surrounding soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex wanted to scream, but his voice was gone. His entire body had shut down, he had only his senses as he lay frozen in shock and terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is so good Alex, I just can't help it. You understand don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's father then took one last tug on the bone. He pulled out the insides of his arm, all the way to the shoulder. All that was left was a sleeve of empty skin that dropped flat against the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can taste her, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the child's head and proceeded to stuff it into the emptied arm socket, as if it was a mouth.. Everything went in, save for the jaw, which finally broke off and fell to the floor. Alex's father quickly bent down and scooped it up. He leaned his head back, with his eyes now bursting out of his head, and slowly parted his mouth. The jaw dropped right in, and he crunched away at it with his own teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand Alex, don't you?\"</span></div></div>",

Forget what you saw here.\"<br>\r\nAlex turned to walk away.  After a few steps, he looked down at his hand.  A blister was forming where the door handle had burned him. He stopped to touch it.  He felt pain.  <br>\r\n\"This doesn't make any sense\" he thought to himself.  \"This is just a dream\".<br>\r\nHe turned around and headed back towards his father, who was still standing outside the door. <br>\r\n\"Alex, I thought I told you to go.\"<br>\r\n\"You can't tell me what to do\". Alex replied.  \"You aren't real.\"<br>\r\nAlex's father began to laugh.  He shook his head to side to side and responded \"Oh Alex, you just don't get it.  You never did.\"<br>\r\n\"Who is that girl?\" Alex asked.<br>\r\n\"What girl?\"  Alex's father peeked through the door and looked back at Alex.  \"I don't see any girl.\"<br>\r\n\"There was a girl crying for help on the other side of this door before you opened it.\"<br>\r\n\"Help me!  Alex help me!\"  It was the little girl.<br>\r\n\"That's her, that's the girl I heard.  How does she know my name?\"<br>\r\n\"Alex, turn around and walk away\" his father yelled at him.<br>\r\nAlex started to turn away and then made a run towards the door, shoving his father out of the way.  He stepped through the doorway and immediately felt the floor fall out beneath him.  He began to fall.  There was no light.  Just a black hole of darkness.  He screamed, but he could not hear his own voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is just a dream...as Alex reminded himself of this, he gave in to the darkness.  And no sooner did he give in, he found himself lying on a cold,damp concrete floor. <br>\r\n\"You should have listened to your father.\" a deep voice spoke into Alex's ear. He jumped back to see who the voice belonged to, but he couldn't see through the darkness.  <br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Alex cried out.<br>\r\n\"Alex!  Help me!\"  It was the girl.  <br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Alex cried out.<br>\r\n\"Let it go.\" the voice whispered into Alex's ear.<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Just walk away.\"<br>\r\nIgnoring the voice, Alex started to walk towards the girl's voice.<br>\r\n\"If you go you will never wake up.\"<br>\r\n\"And if I stay?\"<br>\r\n\"You will have to do something for me\".</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Okay, this is my 2nd Interactive. You may remember the 1st, it was happy and random (The Necklace's Curse). This one is scary and random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe characters are (and feel free to add more):<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex Drake - 17 years old, average person, nothing too special...about to go through some serious insanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin Drake - 23 years old, Alex's older sister<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert Drake - 14 years old, Alex's annoying little brother<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad - Alex's parents<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare - A strange being that appears in Alex's dreams one night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, I don't care what you do with the above characters (except Alex and Nightmare). They're just characters that you can change on a whim if you feel like (and trust me you'll be able to).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's how we do this little dance:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex goes to sleep. And doesn't wake up (though you can wake him in the 24th hour, see below). Nightmare keeps him asleep and puts him through nightmarish scenarios (duh), designed to drive him insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are 24 hours in a day. Every chapter is one hour. So, at the end of the 24th in ANY storyline, you must write a disturbing end for each storyline. You are NOT allowed to end the story unless it is the 24th hour. And yes, he can wake up in the 24th hour, but make it more than \"It was all a dream\", perhaps have him wake to something worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn important note is that before it was stated that you needed to put the hour. That's not needed, since the chapter number is the hour. Chapter Number = Hour. Okay, enough said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are no limits per se, but remember this is a horror story. So...do not turn this into some sexual fantasy or whatever. Be as scary as possible. Thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose that write VERY scary chapters may get bonuses like GP or their handle posted on this page. And sorry, you're going to need more than gore to scare me. (UPDATE: Due to school and personal projects...I can no longer maintain the GP and Handle Posts. I apologize and hope you continue to enjoy the story and add to it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, I want chapters that are NOT one sentence. Those may get deleted. Descriptive, nightmarish chapters please (aim for 3 paragraphs or so to be safe, unless you can describe it in less).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake sense so far? Go start your nightmare now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHANDLE POSTS:<br>\r\nFirst Fright - Steve ~ Friction<br>\r\nClaustrophobia Inducer - evil dude<br>\r\nScary Supporter - cerial</td>",
