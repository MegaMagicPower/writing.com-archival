Tragically, he died when a drunk driver swerved down a residential road and splattered his body against the pavement. I thank God every day that those legends of ghosts appearing as their corpses aren\u2019t true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he\u2019s dead, there isn\u2019t much that Lorenzo can do. He can\u2019t eat, sleep, or do any of the fun things he liked to do in life. So he just kinda hangs around me since we were best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raise an eyebrow. \u201cAnd how can you enjoy anything money can give if you are essentially air?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is an old conversation. I come from old money and have invested it pretty well until now. Lorenzo, being my best friend, feels that I work too hard and that I (we) should enjoy it more together and live a life of luxury\u2013well, an undead life of luxury for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo pauses, biting his lip thoughtfully. \u201cUh\u2026. I\u2019ll enjoy the /knowledge/ that if I was still alive, I would be rolling in riches.\u201d He smiled triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stare at him. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be\u2026.\u201d Sighing, I shake my head. \u201cNevermind. Besides, I don\u2019t help freeloaders.\u201d A slight grin creases my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo narrows his eyes. \u201cNo? Don\u2019t you?\u201d With a sudden spring, he jumps onto my back, hooking his arms around my neck. \u201cI\u2019m a ghost now! You\u2019ll do as I say!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey! Get off!\u201d I start shivering as I reach for him. \u201cYou\u2019re freezing cold!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe holds on tighter. \u201cBut\u2026.. I\u2019m sooooooo\u2026.coooold\u2026..\u201d he giggles playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swipe at him arm, phasing through it. \u201cLet go! I\u2019ll catch a cold!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shivers mockingly. \u201cYou\u2019re so warm\u2026\u2026. Just a bit longer\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Go hug a blanket!\u201d As I try to shake him off, I catch my foot and stumble backwards against a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof!\u201d He lets go as she is pushed through the wall. \u201cWhat the \u2013 How rude!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI huff, pulling away. \u201cServes you right!\u201d I make my way towards the fireplace, my arms wrapped around me as I continue shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo settles to the floor, crossing him arms and huffing in turn. \u201cI was cold!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen wrap yourself in a blanket!\u201d Muttering loudly to myself about the rudeness of ghosts, I start a fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel him sidle up next to me. \u201c\u2026Can\u2019t pick it up\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInching away, I focus on the fire. \u201cUse your ghost\u2026powers\u2026and you know\u2026\u201d I shrug helplessly. \u201cPick it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo sniffles loudly, going for sympathy. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how to. I\u2019m a new ghost!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn and stoop, picking up said blanket. \u201cHold still.\u201d I lift it and try to drape it over him, watching as it phases through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watches it too before turning to stare at me sadly. \u201cSee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Hmm\u2026\u201d I lift the blanket up again to examine it. \u201cHow /would/ a ghost lift up a sheet? Living people can do it physically\u2026 So maybe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo eyes me dubiously, catching my meaning. \u201cWell, I can give it a try, I guess\u2026\u201d He leaned forward and began staring intently at the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, I look around self-consciously. \u201cShould I drop it\u2026?\u201d Starts as the blanket shifts slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo immediately perks up. \u201cLook! Look, look! I\u2019m doing it! I\u2019m moving it with my mind!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can\u2019t help but be impressed. \u201cY-you are!\u201d I grin. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ghostly head pokes through the blanket. \u201c\u2013Not him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo shrieks and leaps away from the blankets\u2013and straight through me. \u201cHELP!!! IT\u2019S A GHOST!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI involuntary shiver as he dives through me, droping the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost falls with it. \u201cOoph!\u2026\u201d It floats back up through the floor, carrying the blanket with it. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo peeks at the ghost from behind me. \u201c\u2026Who\u2019re you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy curiosity and overall irritation wrestled across my face. Curiosity won. \u201cAnd why are you in my blanket?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to my annoyance, the ghost looks beyond me towards Lorenzo. \u201c\u2018Ello, sir.\u201d Pointedly ignoring me, he asks, \u201cWould you happen to be the new ghost in these parts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friend nodded shyly. \u201cVery new. Just joined.\u201d Feeling braver, he stepped out from around me. \u201cNice to meet you, mister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost smiles and holds a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Sean. It\u2019s nice to meet you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo, shaking his hand, smiles. \u201cLorenzo.\u201d He beams and gestures at me. \u201cAnd this is Adrian!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean gives me a contemptuous look. \u201cOh\u2026 Is he the one you\u2019re haunting?\u201d He smiles again at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI narrow my eyes, repressing an indignant huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026. Yes, I suppose we can call it that.\u201d He grins, casually slinging an arm around my shoulders. \u201cIsn\u2019t he adorable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glare disdainfully at him. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean swoops forward, looking me up and down. \u201cEh. He\u2019s okay. What have you done so far to him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo tilts his head to one side curiously. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He looks back at me. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to help myself, I mutter a few things about him being annoying as a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean taps chin, considering us. \u201cWell\u2026 There\u2019s hallucinations, throwing stuff\u2026 Uh.. Voices\u2026And possession.\u201d He starts to grin a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot liking where this is going, my eyes widened in alarm as I protested. \u201cThose are all a bit much, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo frowns thoughtfully. \u201cThey do sound fun\u2026.\u201d He gives a dejected sigh. \u201cBut alas, I don\u2019t know how to do any of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean\u2019s smile grows. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I wanted to see if you needed any help learning the basics.\u201d He floats closer. \u201cI know most of the tricks. Standard possessions, for example, involve floating in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo\u2019s eyes shine as I try to back away discreetly. \u201cReally?\u201d His smile vanishes. \u201cWill possession hurt him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean laughs, patting his shoulder. \u201cOnly his pride if anything. Need a demonstration?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo assumes his child-at-an-amusement-park expression as he turns to face me. \u201cOh, Adrian, you don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flinch and turn to glare. \u201cOf course I do! I\u2019m not a puppet!\u201d Afraid, I make a dash for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean negligently waves his hand, slamming the door shut. He turns to Lorenzo and grins. \u201cReady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI back away, finding myself cornered between the wall and door. \u201cH-hey now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo glides over to me, smiling reassuringly. \u201cRelax. Sean said it wouldn\u2019t hurt!\u201d He dove into my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasp as a cold feeling wells up and spreads through my body. I lurch forward, shivering uncontrollably, before falling back against the wall. After a few moments, Lorenzo\u2019s head pops out of my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeeeean!\u201d he whines. \u201cIt\u2019s not working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean floats to the side. \"Of course it didn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t wait to hear how it works!\u201d He sighs. \u201cNow, I should tell you a few things.\u201d Speaking to him, he settles a hand on my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shudder as Lorenzo suddenly pops out, sending me to the floor, gasping. \u201cN-no\u2026no more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean ignores me. \u201cThree things.\u201d He holds up his hand, counting off. \u201cSize difference, will, and method.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo glances at me before turning to him. \u201cWill and method I kinda understand, but size difference\u2026 How bad can that possibly be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean leans an arm on him casually. \u201cWell, when you possess someone, you essentially put your ghostly form in them, right? If the body is too big, it\u2019s harder to control\u2013though roomier, if you know what I mean. The opposite is true for a smaller body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo experimentally dips his foot into my leg. \u201cOkay, I suppose that makes sense. But how do you stay inside?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean grins. \u201cThat\u2019s where method comes in. First is oral. Observe.\u201d Dropping the blanket to reveal his rounder form, he dived forward into my gasping mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flail on the ground, trying desperately to push him off. He surges forward, entering me in gulps. I choke, my muffled screams dying away as the last of him slips inside. I pant on the ground, holding my bulging stomach and feeling incredibly full as Sean\u2019s bulk shifts around inside me. I groan, grabbing my head as he moves up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo comes forward as I sit up. \u201c\u2026 Adrian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean forms a grin and pats my slightly inflated belly. \u201cNope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo stares, in awe. \u201cIt worked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods once. \u201cThat is oral. It\u2019s good for a quick, quiet possession.\u201d Raising a hand, he begins tracing a path down my chest and onto my quivering stomach. \u201cHuh. It\u2019s not too bad in here.\u201d He gives a cheeky grin. \u201cI might have to come back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe begins shaking and falls back. My body deflates, spasming as he floats out in a long strand. I groan as I come to, my arms and legs splayed out on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean turns towards Lorenzo. \u201cYou can use any orifice to possess. Anus, ear, nose, penis\u2013each has its own benefit. Then there is phasing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo looms over me before looking back. \u201cIs that what I did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean nods again. \u201cExactly. Phasing is the fastest mode of entry, but it involves a battle of wills.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo thinks this over. \u201c\u2026Is that why I failed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean floats over to me. \u201cYes. You didn\u2019t know how to exert your will over his, so you just ended up making him cold.\u201d His grin turns mischievous. \u201cBefore that though, let me show you my favorite method.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Hey\u2013what are you\u2013No!\u201d I scream as Sean undoes my jeans. I try to slap his ghostly hands away, but am unable to connect with him. As I scramble back, Sean keeps pace before finally darting into my boxer flap. I cringe, falling onto my back as I feel his cool ectoplasm surround and begin sliding into my dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spasm as I feel him begin to pool in my stomach, my dick becoming hard around his ghostly form. I moan, feeling incredibly full as he begins traveling up my chest. I thrust my hips once as his tail slips in and moan again, settling on the ground. A dreamy smile spreads across my face as I sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Sean runs a hand down my belly onto my boxers, rubbing it briskly. \u201cAh, definitely my favorite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo stares with wide eyes. \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t think I can do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolls his shoulders in a shrug. \u201cMaybe one day.\u201d He reaches into my boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian clears his throat. \u201cUm, Sean? Right here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flashes him an amused smile. \u201cVery well then.\u201d He lays back and takes a deep breath. Spasming, my stomach inflates as I regain control. I groan in discomfort, turning myself over onto my hands and knees. A hand appears out of my ass, pulling the boxers low. I clench, in pain, as I feel Sean\u2019s grinning head pop out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waves cheerfully. \u201cHad to try each hole as least once.\u201d He slowly emerges, wiggling for emphasis as his tail is sucked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, I try to fix my pants, feeling incredibly violated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friend narrows his eyes. \u201cBack to the topic at hand\u2026 oral possession isn\u2019t will-based?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as much. It\u2019s like putting on a costume and moving it\u2013phasing is entering his spirit. Observe.\u201d He grinned down at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared up in horror. \u201cOh no<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, God\u2013\u201d I scrabble back. \u201cPlease, no\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean lunged forwad, phasing into my chest. I scream, writhing on the ground as I fight for control. All throughout my body, pieces of Sean pop out as he tries to settle in. I claw at my chest and hold my stomach as I feel him move. His face pops out through mine as my back arches. I thrust my hips as I feel him fill me. I feel him click into place as my body relaxes. His face is sucked back into mine as I smirk. I feel bloated. Full, but kinda numb. Rising, I stretch out. \u201cAh, much better.\u201d I look at Lorenzo. \u201cPhasing also let\u2019s us stay in longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo nodded eagerly. \u201cOkay! I want to try!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrug my shoulders, resting my hands on my stomach. \u201cHmm\u2026In a bit.\u201d My hands trailed lower. \u201cOh my.~\u201d A seductive smile forms on my lips as I move to caress my own rear. \u201cNot bad. Not bad at all\u2026~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeeeean!\u201d Lorenzo whined. \u201cI want a turn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wink at him, feeling myself grow hard. \u201cCall me 'Adrian.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares. \u201c\u2026.\u201d Finally, he cuddles up to me with a wheedling tone. \u201cPlease, Adrian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean has me nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding once, I take a deep breath and tilt my head up. Suddenly, my back arches and I feel the large ghost begin to squeeze out. Slowly, parts of him begin to pop out, causing my limbs to flail as he squirms out. With a final push, I feel him detach from my chest and finally get fired out. Gasping and in control again, I stumble back against the wall. Lorenzo quickly follows me, intent to possess me himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groan, half begging. \u201cPlease\u2026 Don\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean then follows him as Lorenzo tentatively slides his arm into my chest. I moan involuntarily again, feeling not only completely drained from Sean\u2019s playing with my body, but by the next invasion I\u2019m about to suffer. Sean reaches forward and guides his arms in, patiently coaching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, you have to align it the best you can\u2026\u201d Lorenzo nods as he adjusts, pressing his back against me. \u201cThen focus on your memories of being solid yourself. How it felt to move your arm and so forth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo closes his eyes. \u201cHow it felt to be solid\u2026\u2026..\u201d I watched as he slowly sunk the rest of his body to align with mine. I feel him fill my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden surge of effort, I thrash about. \u201cNo! Stop!\u201d I stumble away from the wall as my body goes starts to go numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean watches critically, circling around me as I struggle against my friend. \u201cNow finish aligning and seize control!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo hesitates as I dry sob from the pressure and pain, spasming in place. He pops his head and shoulders out of my chest. \u201cNo, maybe I shouldn\u2019t\u2026.. Are you sure it won\u2019t hurt him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean waves his hand negligently. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cause pain.\u201d He places a hand on his shoulder reassuringly. \u201cIt just isn\u2019t a pleasant feeling, I bet.\u201d He grinned and pushed him back in. I fall back against the wall as Lorenzo darts around in my body and tries to settle in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lorenzo slows his movement to shifting around, he tries to move my right hand, but cannot. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean eyes us. \u201cHmm\u2026 He\u2019s a bit big\u2026 You might be too small. If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019ll have trouble aligning properly. Pop your head out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo obeys, phasing out of my chest. \u201cWhat now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean grabs my shoulder and motions towards his own chest. \u201cBreathe. Suck up as much air as possible to expand yourself.\u201d He demonstrated, inflating as his mouth performed a powerful sucking motion. \u201cIt\u2019s good for a small bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo concentrates as begins to inhale. Slowly, as he gulped air, he began to expand. As he did, he got the hang of it and expanded faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean let go, impressed. Immediately, I arched my back and fell backwards repeatedly into the wall, trembling and gasping. \u201cSo\u2013\u201d I clenched my teeth from the enormous pressure building up inside of me. \u201c\u2013Tight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Lorenzo dove back in. Sean, looming over, looked nearly as happy. \u201cFocus on what moving feels like! You\u2019re nearly there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo begins to match his breaths with mine, aligning himself to my body\u2019s rhythms. \u201cRelax, Adrian!\u201d He giggled out in my voice. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurt you\u2013 you know that, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel my breathing begin to slowly be forced to match his. In my last moments of control, I mumble something very uncomplimentary as my consciousness is pushed below his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean inspects me. \u201c\u2026.Well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo awkwardly pulls us up. \u201cI\u2026 Adrian\u2026? Sean, where\u2019s Adrian?\u201d He touches my face. \u201cI can\u2019t feel him anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean grins. \u201cLook in the mirror and you\u2019ll see.\u201d He grabs my arm and pulls me towards a door. \u201cThere\u2019s a bathroom in here with a mirror.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian stumbles after him. \u201cWait\u2013 this body is so\u2026. Difficult\u2026.. To walk in\u2026!\u201d He collides with the door. \u201cOw!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean stops and gives him a sheepish smile. \u201cSorry. Forgot you were new at this.\u201d He steadies him. \u201cSo! How\u2019s it feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo balances himself. \u201cA bit better.\u201d He forms a grin back. \u201cSo, where is he exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean gestures vaguely at my body. \u201cSomewhere in there\u2026\u201d He looks him up and down. \u201cI should warn you that you can\u2019t possess someone forever. He\u2019ll push you out eventually, unfortunately.\u201d Opening the door, he bows. \u201cReady to see your new face?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s good!\u201d His grin turns mischievous. \u201cThat means I can just take him back, right?\u201d He pauses. \u201cHe\u2019s not just not speaking to me, right?\u201d He catches sight of the mirror and gives a teasing smile. \u201cWon\u2019t I just look exactly like him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean shakes his head with a smile. \u201cNo, you just overpowered his spirit. He\u2019s\u2026asleep, I suppose.\u201d He winks. \u201cAnd it is /your/ face now. Not his.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe touches my face lightly. \u201cI look so\u2026 Different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean settles on the counter. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re solid again. He wiggles his eyebrows. \"Still cold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo wraps his new arms around my chest. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Adrian.\u201d He practically moaned in my voice. \u201cBut now I\u2019m so, so warm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean flits through the open door and stares at the clock. \u201cSo\u2026.What will you do now?\u201d He glances back at him. \u201cI\u2019d say you have about six hours before he pushes you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026. what do you suggest? You\u2019re the one who showed me the ropes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives a light shrug. \u201cI\u2019d have fun being solid again. Do whatever you feel like. Eat junk food, embarrass your host, bathe\u2013the list goes on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widen as Lorenzo is scandalized. \u201c/Bathe/!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grin reforms. \u201cFun, right? Sex is even better.\u201d He stops and gives him a slow look up and down. \u201cOf course, if you don\u2019t want to, I just might.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo admires his new self in the mirror. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m not curious about certain things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean looks around suggestively. \u201cWell,\u201d he drawls, closing the door. \u201cYou /are/ in a bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls at my shirt collar and looks down. \u201c\u2026. Huh.\u201d Pulling it off, he raises my hands to grope my pecs. \u201cThis\u2026.is mine now, right?\u201d My hands trail down my stomach\u2026 He snaps to attention. \u201cNo, I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean settles on the counter again. \u201cWhat could it hurt? It\u2019s not like he\u2019ll remember any of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo trails my hands further along to my crotch. \u201c\u2026True\u2026\u201d He looks at Sean. \u201cNothing at all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean, watching him lustily, nods. \u201cNothing.\u201d He drifts closer. \u201cI can see why you chose him. On such close inspection, he\u2019s kinda cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo starts, looks up, and backs away. \u201cUh\u2026Sean? It\u2019s me in here, remember.\"</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m about to teach you the greatest thing about possession: pushing the host body to the limit.\u201d He grins and begins to suck in air, inflating into a much larger ghost. \u201cLet\u2019s see how that body handles me now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo tries to pull away. \u201cH-hey! Stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d With that final word, he pushes my body to the ground. \u201cLet me show you how to have fun.\u201d He dives and slowly sinks into my body, inflating and stretching it to its max as he enters. As he does, Lorenzo\u2019s consciousness is shouldered aside and I feel myself begin to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo starts thrashing about in me. \u201cStop! He\u2019s supposed to be mine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean grins. \u201cSo? First rule of ghosts\u2013possession is 9/10ths of the law!\u201d With a light jump, he plunges all the way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo, still in control, arches my back, gasping; he squirms as Sean stretches and maneuvers inside me, before settling with a sagging look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin appears on my face. \u201cNot bad.\u201d I groan, stretching. \u201cKinda tight with two of us though.\u201d I pat my inflated stomach, giggling. \u201cHow fun!\u201d I feel Sean run my hands over my body slowly, feeling each inflated muscle respond to his delicate touch; eventually he moves from my chest to my stomach and immediately opens my pants. \u201cFeel that? That\u2019s the electric sensation of a body pushed to its absolute limits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019s right. As he plays with member through my tight underwear, both Lorenzo and I feel an overwhelming wave of pleasure rock my body wherever he touches it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo, still fighting, turns my head aside and makes a face halfway between horror and lust. \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean turns it back. \u201cHaving some fun.\u201d He reaches in and grabs my rapidly rising cock. \u201cHuh. Good size.\u201d He immediately begin pumping it, an ecstatic look of rapture printed on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo moans with him. \u201cO-o-oh! I\u2026.\u201d He has me grip my side as they start thrusting. \u201cI didn\u2019t think\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy grin widens. \u201cPrivileges of stealing bodies.\u201d I feel him match his thrusts to Lorenzo\u2019s, raising my hips high above the floor. He continues to pump, going faster as the pleasure intensifies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo breathes heavily as he feels the pressure in my groin increase. \u201cOooooh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel my mouth open wide. \u201cAlmost\u2026.There\u2026.\u201d They thrust once more as he shouts, my dick erupting. \u201cYES! YEEEES!\u201d They continue pumping as it continues to go. \u201cUgh!\u201d They twist my body violently as it slowly settles down. \u201cYes\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a contented sigh, they lay back and look down at my cum-covered self. \u201cWell worth it\u2026\u201d As my head is thrown back, Sean squeezes out, carrying Lorenzo with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blink, groaning as I retake control. My body, after being stretched by two ghosts, feels loose and aching. I look around groggily and stare at my pants. I pale with horror, remembering what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo clears his throat. \u201cAdrian, about this\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes roll back and I collapse, completely unconscious. Sean raises his eyebrows, a grin forming. \u201cHow about another lesson?\u201d</span></div></div>",
