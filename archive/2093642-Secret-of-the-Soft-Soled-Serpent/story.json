S/He had already attracted a small crowd of young locals, who never had the chance to spy on a white person of the opposite sex sunbathing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe HH detective trio - Summer, Chris, and Jamie - were relaxing on the terasse of a high class resort, all three in their swimsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too bad that your parents didn't allow Mouse to come along.\" Jamie said.<br>\r\n\"You don't have to tell me, she was positively steaming.\" Summer replied.<br>\r\nShe scribbled WISH YOU WERE HERE on the back of a postcard in big bold letters and lied back in her chair. The thought of her annoying sister stuck in her room filled her soul with joy. Life was good.<br>\r\n\"But we won't be left without a sidekick - the captain said that a kid of our age will be waiting for us at the next location.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure these guys here are feeling very relieved.\" Chris said.<br>\r\nA couple of guards ran past, and almost knocked Chris' chair over.<br>\r\n\"Hey! What gives?\"<br>\r\n\"They are the sheikh's guards \"Jamie said in a conspiratory tone. \"Apparently there's been a phantom thief going around. But no-body knows how she got in...\"<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nSummer threw herself on the large, ornate double bed (all three kids got their own rooms) with such enthusiasm that she did not even get out of her swimsuit.<br>\r\nShe regretted it then she woke up a few hours later and saw her hands tied in front of her. She realized that she was on her stomach and her ankles were attached to the footboard.<br>\r\nShe heard a figure silently move behind her in the darkness.<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes in case it went away and right enough, in a moment she felt something caress her sole.<br>\r\n\"What do you want.\" she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steady, American girl...All the Serpent wants is the name of your next destination.\"<br>\r\n\"What for?\" Summer was thinking fast - did they talk to anyone on the way here who'd know that they'd be here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the sake of your ticklish feet. Koochie koo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer always hated this - the part when they exploited the fact that her ankles were tied and her feet could only wriggle about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're a mean evil person!\"<br>\r\n\"I am.\" she said and redoubled her efforts.<br>\r\n\"Tickle tickle lil girl. No need to hurry so much, we can do this all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Eeeh<img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">ahaha\" Summer cried out in a ticklish tone. \"Hey stop that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stop when you stop...ly~ing...Kitchikitchikitchi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer made up her mind, what did it matter if she knew? Besides she didn't want to keep this up for the whole night, it wasn't even 11 o'clock yet, so she cried out...</span></div></div>",
