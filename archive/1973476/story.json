Right across from the cafe building is a gym, where he keeps his full attention at a weight-lifting patron. The patron is a large, brawny jaguar, pumping an arm with a heavy dumbbell, and taking his sweet time doing it. The hyena sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha starin' at, Roddie?\" The grey and black-spotted hyena gets interrupted by his friend, a red-feathered parrot, who sits across from at the table with a platter of food. \"You staring at that Tristin guy again?\", the polly asks while taking a bite out of his burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoddie sighs again to himself, while looking away. \"Yeah...I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird replies with his mouth full, \"Ya know, you never told me how you know about him.\" He gulps his food down. \"Or why you seem so interested in him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I never did?\" Roddie was surprised himself. \"Well Tucker, me and Tristin used to be good friends.\" Tucker suddenly spews out the drink he got into Roddie's face. The hyena frowns, \"...Is it really that surprising?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I...just realized this wasn't what I asked for. But still, you were friends with a big guy like him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoddie wipes himself up with a napkin. \"Before he was even big as a matter of fact. We used to talk about stuff amongst each other all the time back when we first entered high school. To others, we seemed like the perfect pair. Of friends that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucker isn't doing a very good job of chewing with his mouth closed. \"Mm. Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyena lowers his head down, \"Then, out of the blue, Tristan decides he wants to start working out, and becoming one of those big guys we used to see on the wrestling team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...\", the parrot awes. \"Sure looks like he's succeeded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did, during our sophmore year. He was really pumped and all about getting big, and got big fast. He was soon getting the attention of other schools, and a few colleges. But...we kinda started to grow apart too.\", Roddie explains sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parrot burps. \"Oh? How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one day, he asks if I wanted to start working out with him. I said no. He said it was okay, but then he started to devote more and more of his time working out, until we didn't talk no more.\" Tucker lets out another unnecessary burp, and sounds more intimate with his food than Roddie's story. \"You know, I was hoping you'd be more interested in my story than all that food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm listening!\", he blurts with his mouth full once again. He then gulps it all down. \"So, you guys hate each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No!\", Roddie yells. \"We just don't talk anymore. Though...I do kinda wish I could be as big as him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe polly burps once more. \"Why not start now? I'm sure you can start working out with him as your personal trainer or somethin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm... Nah... We haven't spoken in years. It'd be kinda awkward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm! Well, why not me? I'd be happy to help you out.\", Tucker replies happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... This coming from the guy who chugged three burgers down in five minutes.\" Roddie gets up out of his seat and puts his backpack on. \"Look, I'm just gonna head home. I'll see ya around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoddie made his way back home and headed straight into his room. He laid on his back thinking what would it be like if he was still friends with Tristan. Roddie wasn't sure how it would turn out but he missed Tristan. Tristan was one of his closest friends and now he was gone. To get his mind distracted, Roddie reached for a comic book on his night stand. On the cover of the comic book was a muscular wolf in black and red tights. There were bold letters over the wolf that spelled \"Muscle Wolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoddie skimmed through the pages seeing the incredible feats of strength that Muscle Wolf was performing inside the comic book. Roddie's mind played tricks on him as Roddie saw Tristan's face in Muscle Wolf's place. Roddie tossed the comic book aside and sighed. He felt so confused. Roddie missed his friend while at the same time felt envious for strength and power. Maybe if Roddie was as big as Tristan they would be friends again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoddie turned his head towards the comic on the floor. It layed opened to the back where all the ads were. Roddie got up and picked up the comic. He then saw an ad that caught his eye. There was a before and after picture of a scrawny lion to a bodybuilder-looking lion. Right next to the picture was an image of a bottle of supplements. The ad said, \"Tired of being weak and scrawny? Try our new 'Growth Spurt' supplements! You won't regret it!\" Roddie looked at the ad with intrigue. Could it really be true? Roddie knew the ads on backs of comic books were fake but he felt so desperate of getting his friend back. Maybe it was worth giving a try. Roddie wasn't sure.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But he heard rumors of a great treasure on this mountain and he couldn\u2019t pass by on an opportunity that could make him rich, especially in his world. His world was a magical and dangerous one. He had no means of defending himself if he ever came across any danger. He didn\u2019t have an ounce of muscle on his scaly body. He didn\u2019t even have wings. Xander always found it ironic because dragons were one of the strongest beings in the world and he had neither muscle or wings. Maybe if he gets the treasure, he can find someone with magic powers and who can make him much, much bigger, and pay them then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, he didn't have much to lose. Literally. He only had a small ax-like weapon, which he could barely lift, a few pieces of gold he scrounged up, the few pieces of clothing (Armor plates that only covered his chest and forearms, and an underwear-like loincloth). He left for his trip to what was known as Acrid Mountain. Properly named because of the hot lava that swelters inside it. He was told no one has ever set foot to the top. When he said he would scour the mountain, he received nothing but laughs and hurtful comments. He didn't care, least not for them anyways, he just wished he could be big and strong, so he could show them who's boss. He had thoughts of going back down once or twice, but he already got this far. Wasn't going to be that long until he reaches the top of the mountain. He had to press on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part Xander came across was a path on the side of the mountain that was broken apart. It was a pretty long gap for him to jump over. Seems the only way he could get across was by jumping for a long tree branch that hung in the middle. He takes a deep breath, even though his heart was pumping awfully fast. \"Well...here goes nothing.\", he gulps. The dragon takes a couple steps back, and then makes a run for it. He leaps for it the moment his foot touches the edge of the cliff and manages to reach for the lone-growing branch. He ends up swinging around the branch a few more times than he expected, but finally swings himself up and about. While in motion, he sees the great a looong way down, and then realizes he wasn't going to reach the other side. In a split second, he pulls out his weapon and quickly uses it like an extra-long arm to reach the other side of the cliff. \"Oh goodness...\", he sweats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe manages to pick himself up, his whole body sweating after his crazy feat. \"That...was close...\" Xander continued climbing the mountain. As he got closer to the peak, the hotter he got. He wiped the sweat off his scales and huffed a few breaths. After what felt forever, Xander finally arrived to the top of the mountain only to be disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Xander looked around, he only saw a pool of bubbling lava, no treasure, no items, not even a monster. There was nothing. Xander couldn't help but feel mad making smoke come out of his nostrils. \"I can't believe it! I came all this way to find nothing! How can this be happening?! Here I am trying to prove myself, only to find absolutely nothing!\" Xander kicked a rock to the side. Suddenly the piece of cliff he was standing began to crumble. Before Xander could even think, the cliff gave away into the lava along with him. Xander wished he had wings until he met what appeared to be his fiery demise.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Xander expected the lava to cook his flesh while drowning. Except, nothing happened. The dragon felt fine. The lava didn't feel hot to him in all. In fact, in felt relaxing. Xander had no explanation as to why the lava wasn't burning him. Was it magical? Xander quickly swam up to the surface and heaved himself back on solid rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander stood up and looked back at the lava pool with wonder. \"What the heck just happened? I should have been dead! I should have been fried alive! I should...I should...\" Xander felt a tingle in his stomach. It felt very unusual. He never felt something like it before. However, the tingle quickly turned into an intense cramp. Xander wrapped his arms tightly around his chest and knelt to the hot ground. He closed his eyes and gritted his teeth. \"Wh..what's happening to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander felt like the lava seeped into his scales and was heating up his entire body. Without realizing, his arms grew thicker showing some slight muscle definition and larger biceps. His chest broadened wider giving him stronger shoulders, thicker pecs, and slight definition in his abs without giving him actual abs. His legs twitched as they expanded more giving him stronger thighs and calves. Xander couldn't explain why but he felt like he was getting taller and stronger but nothing prepared him for what was next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis back suddenly began to feel really sensitive, so sensitive that it ached. Xander thought something was crawling on his back and begged it to go away but instead it provided more pain. Blue limbs with a thick and armored membrane grew out of his back! Bones grew longer, nerves developed, and muscles expanded while Xander was undergoing unbelievable pain. Suddenly the pain just stopped out of nowhere. It mysteriously disappeared as it first appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aching dragon stumbles to get back on his feet, barely even taking notice to what just happened to him. He looks around, feeling a little better now that the pain in his body was gone. He looks around and comes across his weapon on the ground. He sighs. \"Well, best be getting back to town.\" Soon as he reaches for his weapon, he realizes that his arm wasn't as bony as it was just before he fell into the lava. To his surprise, it was much thicker than he thought, thicker than he ever could have imagined. He then takes a gander all along the rest of his muscly frame. It wasn't anything he'd take part in a bodybuilding competition with, but definitely well-built to get enough attention. Plus he can finally pick up his own weapon with east, which is a plus one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was getting pretty excited with his new body and muscles, but then finally takes notice of something fluttering involuntarily behind him. It was his new wings. It seems another dream had come true for him, owning his own pair of wings, and they were fairly large too. He starts test-driving his wings out, making them flutter up and down, in and out. It wasn't long until was able to fly himself a few feet off the ground. Guess being a dragon and all, controlling a pair of wings is just natural to him. \"This is great! I can finally fly!\" The next thing Xander had his eyes set for was town. \"I'm gonna show them what I've got now.\" Just before he flies off, he pulls out a small empty bottle and fills it up with the lava he fell in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuffs the bottle in his pocket and then sprouts his wings to take off. He flew up higher than he expected, but handling was a breeze. In a only a few minutes, he reaches his place of birth and catches everyone by surprise. \"Townspeople, I have come back from atop Acrid Mountain, and survived!\" People of all different species walked up to him as he holds up the bottle of lava he had. Everyone was impressed, though one person speaks up, \"Um, wasn't he a tad skinnier before he left?\" Xander came up with a simple explanation. \"Oh, I, I just got a really good workout climbing the mountain is all.\" Everyone believed him quite easily being that no one else has been known to traverse up there. Although there was someone watching who didn't believe a word of what Xander said.</span></div></div>",

Everyone knew him as Leon, the biggest and strongest warrior in the town. He saved the town a few times from monsters but he was very arrogant and proud. Xander clutched his fist at the sight of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Leon?\" asked Xander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want us to believe that a scrawny guy like you climbed that giant volcano and lived? You can't leave this town for less than an hour without getting hurt! I say you just got a potion that looks like lava and telling a story!\" Despite Leon's behavior, the townspeople looked up to him and thoughts his logic to be true. The townspeople slowly dispersed as Xander pleaded them to stay and show them that his story was true. Before leaving, Leon mocked, \"Grow a few pounds and inches before trying to get yourself killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do, Xander went back to his home with his bottle of lava. As he entered his room, Xander let out smoke from his mouth in anger. \"I can't believe it! After such an experience, a jerk like Leon had to ruin it for me! I don't care if he saved the town a hundred times! He's no warrior! If I was a warrior, I wouldn't be like him!\" Xander let out a big sigh and fell onto his bed sulkily. He then turned his head to his bottle of lava. It made him think. What if the lava made him grow before? If it did it before, could it do it again? Xander got up from his bed and held the bottle in his hand. He looked at it deeply still wasn't sure if his theory was correct. However, after being humiliated in public, Xander thought it was worth the risk. The dragon took the top of the bottle and drank the lava. Once again, it felt pleasant to him. No burning in his throat, just a soothing sensation seeping into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lava's magic starts swirling around Xander's insides. He could feel his body start to swell up from inside, almost as if he was ready to blow. His legs began to explode down below as he drops to his knees. His calves and thighs shred apart and fill out to show more size and definition. He gets knocked back on his back to the floor and his abs start to rise up from the bottom up. He even earns a fourth row to add to his well-sculpted abdomoinals. His pecs start to inflate even more over his powerful chest, and his back starts to spread from beneath. He could feel his back muscles increase in size and make his lats spread out on the floor. His forearms start to increase as the lava's power fills up his bulging arms. He must have earned another five inches to his beefy bi's, as wells as broaden out his shoulders even more. The last to was his neck, which fills out to make even the dragon's throat to attract attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander manages to pick himself off the ground, wiping the sweat off his forehead. \"Whoa...that was intense...\" Another change brought upon the reptile's frame was his voice, which sounded a tad deeper and manlier than before. \"Sweet!\" He then picks up his lone weapon, which felt like a stick in his grasp. \"Hmm...

The caves lighting must have played a trick on him! The puny century still looked extremely hostile towards Xander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, I wouldn't stand a chance against something like this... but now...I can just punch this thing into submission easily.\" Xander thought arrogantly as he punched the tiny centaur once and it fell over, seemingly dead. Xander walked past it's \"corpse\" chuckling to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as soon as his back was turned to the defeated centaur, it got right back up, growing in both height and strength in mass comparable to the force of the punch that was dealt to it. It's upper body muscles  grew to a size comparable to Xander's after his first lava dip and it grew to about his height in Xander's current state. \"Back for more huh?\" Xander said with an increasing sense of arrogance, not realizing that his opponent had grown. Xander punched it multiple times, each with increasing force, all seeming to do little to no damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce exhausted, Xander fell back and watched in horror as the once puny centaur grew at an exponential rate. It's biceps and triceps exploding with muscle mass as a rate much MUCH faster than Xander ever could with any amount of the lava potion, if he had any left that is. It's pecs growing at the same rate. It had even grew four more rows to its amazingly muscular abdomen. It's  skeleton audibly snapping, popping, and overall growing to an defense size. After it's giant spurt, the centaur now stood at over four times the size of Xander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander still in awe, the centaur roared at him and flicked Xander across the cave, Xander hitting the side of the cave with enough force to cause a crater in the wall. Xander barely able to get up he massive blow, he realized that he needed to kill it in one hit, or else it would just get even more massive with each non-fatal blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a F___ing b___h.\" Was all that Xander could muster with the towering sense of grief, hopelessness, and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould Xander fight of flight?</span></div></div>",

Xander decided that his only chance was to fight. The centaur charged at Xander with a mighty battle cry. Xander barely dodged it's attacks and only counterattacking when dodging wasn't an option. But that only made his situation worse and the centaur's job of killing him easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centaur roared again and Xander noticed the large stalagmites shaking from the auditory vibrations. He now knew what he had to do. He had to get the centaur to trip or fall down to he could get one of those stalagmites to fall with enough force to pierce the centaurs thick hide. \"Well how the heck am I going to do THAT?\" Xander thought to himself in panic. Xander was shaken from his plan when the centaur came charging again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centaur came charging at an amazing speed only matched by cheetahs hyped up on speed potions. It was so fast that it even surprised itself and tripped over Xander as it came barreling towards him. The blow still almost knocked out Xander and grew the centaur enough to flick a hole through the city walls. But it also was enough force to cause the stalagmites to come crashing down on the monsters heart and skull. Burying themselves deep into it's heart and brain and effectively pinning it the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander awoke from his unconsciousness, everything hurt, he used his one and only healing potion to soothe this for awhile. \"Holy crap!!!

He pulled multiple items from the dead behemoth, including but not limited to: Armor, Weapons, Gold, and a magical artifact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander equipped all of his new gear but was left puzzled over this artifact.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank sighed in front of a giant poster. The poster displayed a giant tiger and wolf gritting each other as if they were ready to fight. On top the poster said, \"Fist Brawl!\" It was an ultimate fighting competition was going to start up soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Frank was a young alligator, he was always fascinated by fighting. He even wanted to do it himself. However, he never got the body needed to fight. Frank's arms and legs looked like twigs and his chest was flat. Frank rubbed his scales to feel nothing. No muscle, not even fat. He was just average. Frank once tried to bulk up by going to the gym and eating right but he got no results no matter what he did. Frank felt discouraged and gave up on his dream thinking he had no means of achieving it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout having anything else to do, Frank decided to walk back home. As Frank walked, he passed by giant swamp and smiled at it. He had a lot of memories in that place. Back when he was a kid, Frank would just swim around endlessly without a care in the world. However, he didn't make a lot of friends because of that. Everyone thought the swamp was gross and it was crazy for anyone to swim in it. Frank couldn't really explain himself. Being in the swamp felt natural to him. For nostalgic reasons, Frank walked to the swamp and stopped at the small harbor that sat on the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank sat on the harbor and looked at his reflection in the water. The only friends that accompanied him were the fish swimming through the muddy water and the mosquitoes buzzing across his face. Frank looked at himself pathetically. He was small, weak, and lonely. It seemed like nothing in life could go his way no matter how hard he tried.  Still... things would get better eventually... right? How long would life kick him until it finally relented?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank sighed as he dipped his toes into the water below, his clawed digits sinking under the water almost vanishing in the slightly murkiness as his green scales blended with the water's color. The cool water lapped gently at his feet as he scooted forward and sank them in further. He liked the coolness the water brought to his body. It was a nice change heat that plagued the county he lived in. It seemed like everyday nature was trying to steam cook his body, so this was a welcome relief. Even if people did think he was weird, he still enjoyed this water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Frank thought about possibly going for a swim, it had been a long time since he last taken  a swim here, but very little had changed since then. It was still the same place as always. It brought a smile to his face as he gave his feet a small kick, sending small ripples through the water. Today was certainly hot enough for a swim, plus he remembered always feeling better after a swim in the water. It always seemed to have a calming effect and helped him forget his troubles for a little while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank pulled his scaly feet out of the water and leaned forward into the swamp. He stuck out both his hands and scooped up some of the water into them. Even though it was hot enough for a swim, Frank didn't want to get wet because he didn't have his swim suit. Frank splashed the water into his face. Every drop seeped into his pores and it felt great to Frank. Frank felt the refreshing water go into face to wash away the heat and sweat from his brow. The svelte alligator let out a sigh of relief and laid back on the harbor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he the cool water began to feel hot on Frank's face. The heat from his face made Frank think he was getting sick. The heat quickly spread from his face to the rest of his body. Frank thought he was boiling inside a volcano and had no idea what was going on. Frank could feel tension and pain on every flat muscle on his body. He gritted his teeth for a second till it stopped suddenly. Frank rose up puzzled. He had no idea what happened. First he was feeling intense pain then all of sudden it stopped. How? Why? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank figured something was in the water that made him sick. To think he used to play in it. People always told him he would get sick but never did until now. Frank guessed he was too old for the swamp and it was time to leave, so he got up and headed for home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank arrived home feeling exhausted. Without doing anything else he headed upstairs to his room to change and go to bed. The alligator made his way to his room and closed the door behind him. He then reached for his dresser to get his pajamas on. The mirror beside the dresser caught his eye and Frank stood in front of it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe couldn't help but feel sorry for himself. He felt like such a loser and there was nothing to do about it. Frank figured the best thing for him to do was to live with it. As he took off his shirt to change into his sleeping shirt, Frank stood in awe. His chest looked leaner than before. He didn't have any solid muscle but he saw some slight definition on his chest and arms. He had no idea where it came from. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nFrank wondered how did the sudden change happen. He hasn't worked out in a long time and, even if he did, he would never get results this fast. Then it hit him, the sensation he got from the swamp. Frank wondered, \"Did the water do this to me?\" The swamp water did make him feel strange and gave him a sensation in his muscles. It had to have been it. Frank quickly put his shirt back on, slipped into a pair of swim trunks, and rushed back to the swamp.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFrank found himself at the harbor. He wasn't entirely sure why he came back. Maybe out of hope. If the swamp water truly bulked his body slightly when Frank splashed himself, could it do it again if he swam in it. Frank took off his shirt leaving his trunks on. He looked at his reflection in the water again. Hopefully, it would be the last time he would see himself like that. Frank took a deep breath and dove into the swamp. The was a moment where it seemed liked the world had frozen. It was almost an agonizingly slow descent into the water. It wasn't until he felt the cool water engulfing his body that time started picking back up and he burst through the surface of the water into the cold beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt enveloped his body like a thick blanket, seeping into every pore of his body. He expected it to be chilly, but it seemed much colder than it had been before. It wasn't like it had been before, this kind of cold was... unnatural. It dug into every fiber of his being, almost making him screaming and forcing out a great deal of oxygen. His lungs felt like they were going to explode from the air slowly being processed inside, with no means of letting it out. He had to squirm wildly before he actually found the bottom with his feet and he pushed up, tilting his head upwards towards the filtered light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment his head broke the surface, a shrill cry of pain tore through his body as his face burned with an agonizing intensity. It was like he'd started bathing in acids, he could almost feel it eating at his body as he clawed at the wood deck that hung on one corner of the water and he tried pulling himself up with all his might, sinking his claws into the wood as he hauled himself, but with each inch of his flesh exposed tot he air, the burning became far more intense, the air setting his body alight with a fire that burned deep beneath his scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank gasped weakly as the all consuming pain threatened to overwhelm him. This water was contaminated with something, he didn't know what, but it felt like whatever it was had been eating away his body from the inside. His thoughts spun around the idea that he could possibly die from this. \"I... I can't die.... why do I have to die?\" His head slumped back as the burning intensified with each breath and he figured this was the end of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a new sensation. It started off as a light tingle that danced across his scales, almost like someone was running their hand across his body. Wherever the sensation moved across, the burning would dull, as if someone had poured some kind of cooling gel onto his flesh. Suddenly there was this odd sensation a cross between the burning and the tingling, although now it felt like his flesh was buzzing. He had only found enough strength to sit up when he cried out as the sensations spread up his arms, which suddenly began to pop and the bones groaned loudly as his biceps started flexing rapidly in the midst of a powerful spasm.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEvery movement his arms made felt both painful and almost numb at the same time, as he stared down his eyes widened in complete shock as he found his arms actually growing bigger. They had been so lean before and now the bicep was ballooning like someone was pumping it full of air. One in, then two, then four, suddenly ten whole inches of pure muscle rose from what had once been lean and below average arms. Compared to the rest of his body it looked like he'd been taking steroids, except the growth only happened in his arms, making him look deformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he felt a pop in his chest as he ribs shifted around his oxygen supply suddenly cut off and he found himself trying to gasp futily for air. He had to hold back his tears which threatened to spring up as his chest actually started widening beneath his gaze. It looked fairly strange as the bones shifted and moved under his scales, giving him a very bony and unpronounced chest, when suddenly he felt that tingling again burrowing down into the deepest parts of his muscles. Suddenly those bony pecs were rising up like great hills, expanding and spreading wider as his shoulders worked to adjust themselves to his now very large and throbbing biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind couldn't even begin to process what was happening to his body. It was like he was turning into some sort of monster, a seriously buff looking monster. He let out a small cry as he hunched over, his stomach burning painfully, against his now massive chest it felt like his skin was on fire, radiating heat like a furnace and he had to lean back as much as he could before his back rested against a pole that helped steady the dock above the water. His stomach suddenly looked like he had something alive squirming just under his scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea frightened him to the point he was almost crying before the movements began slowing, the stomach suddenly now sporting a very impressive and hard six pack abs. He hadn't even realized his muscles had been developing through the pain. To anyone else his lower body would appear deformed to the rest of him, like he had been physically disabled from the waist down so his lower half looked frail compared to this hulking new upper body, but with this tingling burning down his legs that was about to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank tilted his head back, trying his best to keep his breathing under control, but with the burning that grazed his body like molten metal it was almost impossible. He could feel the muscles in his legs exploding with growth, each second his legs twitched and had a spasm as the muscles thickened, his thighs swelling up with muscles that had once been barely lean. As they grew bigger and bigger, Frank felt a very painful constriction on his waist. It was like his body was fighting off this new and amazing change that was morphing his body. He was scared that his body would suddenly reject this change and he would shrink back to how he was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looked down, he almost felt a smile spread of his cheeks at his own silliness as he realized that it was his swim trunks causing him so much pain. The sturdy fabric wasn't meant to withstand such an immense change in size. These shorts were much too small for this new body, and as his legs suddenly expanded a bit more, there was a large rip as the shorts tore apart. Once that horrible pressure vanished, so did the burning and the tingling that had held his body in it's powerful grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several minutes for his heart to finally calm down, and a couple minutes longer for him to actually move. This body was so much bigger than his old one. The muscles, especially his biceps, would grind up against his chest uncomfortably and he had to practice walking back and forth along the dock before he could figure out how to walk without rubbing his arms against his body. When he paused to look down at the water, the sight almost took his breath away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no longer a scrawny little gator he was staring it. It was if that kid had never existed. His eyes were still the same, he could see his brown eyes reflecting the light into the water, but it seemed like it was a dream. His body looked... incredible. His muscles bulged hotly even when they weren't flexed. It was amazing. nothing ever felt so strange or so wonderful.</span></div></div>",

Thanks to the swamp, he had the body he had always wished for. All those things he wanted to do as a big, buff alligator, he may very well be able to do them all now! He looks down at his reflection again, and then performs a great muscle pose that involved him having to hunch up his enormous back, lowering both his beefy arms against his chest to flex his bi's and tri's, and let out a proud grunt. Just like one of his big favorite fighters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help but get carried away, flexing only harder and harder, until he hears a tear from his trunks. Or at least, what's left of them. His shorts were about to fall, but he ends up having to hold them. Although it's nice having a stunning, muscular body, he isn't ready to be naked in public. At least not in his underwear. Lucky for him, he didn't live too far from the swamp, and with his enlarged, thick legs, he's sure to make it home in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank does just that, and boy did he run. He was sprinting, even though he wasn't aware of it, and before he knew it, he was home. He quickly shuts the door behind him and heads up the stairs into his room. He rips off what remnants of his trunks he had left and tosses it aside. Kind of a waste of a good pair of shorts, but he can always get new ones. He scrounges around his room to find something else he can wear. He apparently had a small assortment of gym shorts and such he thought he would be able to wear after working out for a short period of time. Lucky for him once again, this finally happened. He finds a pair of blue shorts that look like they could stretch if ever he were to grow more. Just as he was about to put them on, he ends up taking a good look at himself in front of a full-length mirror in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he was only in his underwear, he couldn't help but stare into that godly body of his. He looks down at his shorts, and then at himself in the mirror. Hey, why not take the time to see just how big and strong his body is now? He walks up to the mirror, putting on a big grin. No lie he was liking what he sees. Never thinking he could be so big so soon. He remembers a few muscular poses his favorite wrestler did, and decides to do them himself. He gets down on one knee and sets his elbow on the other, giving his big arm a huge flex and making his bicep nearly double in size. \"Incredible...\" He was also do the same with his legs, his thighs swelling out as if they were overfilling his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing he does is gets back on his feet and rests his hands on his hips. Another pose he remembers quite well is one that involved a proud lat spread while standing proud. Frank does just that, his eyes almost couldn't believe what they saw. His pecs were huge, his lats really showed just as he envisioned, even more so, and he could almost visualize himself standing side-by-side when him, holding the same pose. His lat spread was fantastic overall. For the next few minutes or so, he just flexes his each muscle on his body, seeing just how big he is all over, and getting great results overall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea popped into Frank's head. What if he were to become even bigger? Frank felt all this power flowing through his body. He admitted to himself he craved more. He wanted even bigger muscles and bigger body. Besides, if he was going to be a fighter, Frank would have to be the biggest, strongest, and toughest alligator around. Also, with his new gym shorts on, Frank should also be ready for any sudden growths he might encounter. It was settled, it was time for another dip in the swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank made it there in no time thanks to his powerful and sculpted legs. He thumped his way onto the harbor and looked at his reflection in the water. Frank smiled and flexed a bicep to the lake as sign of saying thanks to it. He then pictured his reflection more bigger and muscular. Without hesitation, Frank jumped into the swamp to achieve his dream in the murky depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank swam through the water with ease thanks to his size and his species. As an alligator, Frank felt like he could stay in the cool water for hours without going up for air. He swam across the lake hoping to feel something soon besides the chill on his scales. Then, he felt it. Frank felt something cooking inside his core. It was like a volcano ready to erupt. Last time, Frank endured intense pain during his growth. Frank intended this to be different. He was going to enjoy every minute of this new change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Frank felt his bones crack and shift. His spine popped to make the gator look taller, and his arm and leg bones grew longer and thicker to store the power Frank craved. Frank flinched from the slight pain but he knew it was necessary to be the biggest gator around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank held his rippled stomach as if he was just punch there. In response, he just smiled anxiously. The heat in his gut quickly spread to the rest of his body and Frank felt the change happening to his whole body all at once. The first thing Frank noticed was his arms. His already beefy arms grew thicker inch by inch. He counted 3...6...10 inches of solid muscle shoved into his arms. Veins even began to pop underneath his scales pumping blood and adrenaline to feed Frank's growing muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank's chest was next. His pecs swelled into even bigger mountains on steel. They even involuntarily bounced out of pleasure. His whole chest broadened and grew more defined as both his pecs and abs grew larger. His abs quickly shifted a new row of muscle giving Frank a solid eight pack. More veins slithered across Frank's flesh with their throbbing synchronizing with Frank's heart beat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank's legs grew even more powerful than before. His thighs pumped up against the blue gym shorts making the shorts look like they were painted on Frank's legs. His calves even plumped to match the strength of an Olympic runner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity, Frank's growth subsided and Frank quickly rushed to the surface to see the bigger, stronger and tougher gator that he is now. Soon as he swam to the harbor he picks himself up out of the water. He nearly stumbled on one of his legs, but that was all part of the experience. It did take a bit, but he was able to stand properly on his substantially thick treetrunk legs. He held an arm up and stares into his meaty bicep. It was even bigger than he could imagine, along with the rest of his titanic body. He didn't even need to flex just to see his muscles rise up and down. He flexed his arms down to make his pecs rise up, and he could feel them plump up beneath his chin. An incredible experience indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decides to hightail it back home. Getting used to his house was kind of a chore now too, but again, nothing he couldn't handle. He looks right back into the mirror, standing just as tall as it now. Looks like he'll have to get a bigger mirror too. With a flex here, and flex there, his muscles swell out impressively. He turns around to see his back, taking notice of his neck, which was nearly filled with muscle. His back had that rippling V-shape he had always wanted, all between that display of shredded meat. He could help but wag his large tail like a dog's, almost knocking the mirror down to the floor. \"Oops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a sigh of relief, he looks at his muscular, godzilla-like self into the mirror and thinks, \"What next...?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morning had come to fruition. Frank would normally start to wake up with his alarm clock, but it seems his excitement got the better of him. His eyes peeled themselves open, staring at the roof of his room. It seems he was starting to outgrow his bed, his lower legs now laying in the air. He gets up on the bed and swings his massive legs to his bedside. He lets out a yawn, a bigger, chest-pumping yawn he has ever let out, and that was what completely woke him up. He jumps out of his bed and heads to the bathroom, not before taking a passing look at himself through his trusty full-length, giving his muscular reflection a quick flex of his bulging bi, and a quick wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter washing off a bit and getting himself ready for the day, he heads downstairs and turns on the TV. No doubt Frank was getting comfortable walking his bulging body around the house in only his tight shorts. Hey, even only in his briefs is just dandy. Getting a wondrous, hulking body gave him a huge of confidence he thought he'd never receive on his own. As the daily news went into commercial, there was one commercial that came on. One that he never forgets. It was of a wrestling/fighting tournament that was coming to town. One of the fighters featured was one of his biggest idols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name was Bill. His fighter name Bill the Badger. Ever since Frank was a youngling, he always used to watch Bill once a night for years, ever since Bill got his start as a fighter on TV. And ever since then, Bill has only gotten bigger and bigger, until he was the proud pro fighter he is now. He was what made Frank want to start working out in the first place. Even though that didn't work out, he still looked up to him for inspiration, because Bill always played by the book, and always looked up to his fans. Who could want a better idol than that? Later into the commercial, it mentioned there being a starting program for rookies at the gym, where they can also sign up to start fighting with a surprise fighter for lessons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! Hmm... I wonder who the surprise fighter is gonna be?\", Frank ponders, thinking about all the possibilities. Noticing his sinewy arm again, he gives it a tightening flex to watch his bicep swell out hugely, \"Heh. I wonder what cool moves I can show them.\" He gets pretty distracted with himself, flexing and pumping his muscles and feeling just how solid and robust they had gotten. The last thing the commercial mentions is that tryouts start today. \"Oh shoot! I completely forgot about that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sprints up to his room (thanks to his profound, thickening legs) and quickly grabs his old gym bag that he stopped using. He stuffs a few other gym clothes and some towels inside. He would make himself some protein shakes and stuff like that, but time was of the essence. Plus he can always get some there. Out of his room and down the stairs he goes, but he realizes something just as he was out the door. \"Oh, waitaminute.\", his eyes glance down, seeing he was only in his shorts, \"Maybe a tank-top and shoes would be nice.\" Frank quickly rushed upstairs and put on a tank-top that hugged his chest tightly and defined his pecs and abs underneath. After quickly putting his shoes on, Frank used his Olympic running legs to get to the gym on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan gator arrived at the gym in no time. As he opened the door, the smell of sweat and dedication flew into his nostrils. He missed being into the gym training hard like Bill would but he would always get teased and stared at for being so small and trying to pump iron. It was one of the reasons he had to quit his training. Today was a different story. He met other muscular guys working hard for the fighting tournament and now Frank was being stared at for his godly frame. Frank had to blush as he made his way to the sign up sheet. The sheet was sitting on a table next to a muscular lion. As Frank approached, the lion looked up at the alligator completely startled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ca...can I help you?\" stuttered the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank nodded. \"Yes, I'm here to sign up for the fighting tournament.\" Without saying another word, the lion gave Frank a pen and Frank knelt down to write his name. After he was done, Frank said, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, I'm sure you'll be one of the promising ones to win,\" said the lion. Frank just smiled at the lion and flexed his bicep to him. The lion dropped his muzzle admiring the strength and shape erupting from Frank's scales. Frank left the lion wondering how this gator got so big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank figured that, as long as he was here, he train to find out how much power his muscles had. Before he could even touch the equipment, Frank caught a sight that made his own mouth drop. He saw a giant muscular badger throwing punches and kicks at a punching bag. It was the famous pro fighter, Bill the Badger. Frank couldn't believe it. His hero was here in the gym with him. Frank was completely starstruck. He couldn't move or say anything. Frank just saw Bill's giant muscles throbbing as they impact on the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's muscles put Frank's new body to shame. Bill's biceps were several inches bigger, his chest more ripped and defined, and his legs more chiseled and ready to burst from Bill's shorts. As for his height, Bill was probably at least a foot taller than Frank. If Frank ever got the courage to talk to Bill, Frank would meet him at his bulging pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Frank was happy for Bill, Frank felt a little inferior as if all his muscles disappeared. How could he match up to a guy like Bill the Badger? Would Bill tease him for being smaller than him despite his muscles? Frank felt like the only way for a big star like Bill to notice him was to be as big as the badger...maybe bigger. Frank smiled thinking it was time for a quick \"workout session.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank quickly left the gym and ran to his secret swamp. As he walked to the harbor, Frank could feel the harbor shaking every time he took a step. He saw his reflection again and gave off one last bicep pose before diving into the swamp. The thought of being a bigger and tougher fighter than his own hero excited him so much he didn't bother taking off his tank top and shoes. He just dove head first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank swam through the murky water excitedly waiting for something to happen. He didn't know when it was going to happen but he knew it was and he was pumped for the change to occur. Then Frank felt the familiar bursting inside of him and he smiled. The growths were getting less painful and more pleasurable. The only pain he still endured was his bones popped and shifted while growing longer and thicker to make Frank look taller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank then felt the intoxicating warmth in his body growing bolder and bolder by the second. His already rippling arms grew more several inches as they soaked in the dirty water. Frank watched his biceps throbbed with his heartbeat as they grew. Beat by beat, his arms grew 5...7...12 inches of raw power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank then focused on the tightness in his chest underneath the tank top he still had on. His powerful chest broadened even more making his pecs look more like pillows and his abs bulged more outward. Frank could see clean cut definition in his chest as if the shirt was painted on him. Finally, his abs formed another row of muscle giving him an incredible ten pack before the tank top burst off his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank then felt tingling in his legs. His thighs looked more like steel pipes coiled together and shoved into his legs and his calves pumped outward even more giving him the power to kick down anything and outrun anything. His growth even went down to his feet which grew several sizes and burst out his shoes. His growing legs filled out Frank's shorts but no enough to burst.However, they suddenly looked like speedos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank's body finally cooled down and Frank rushed to the surface to see the bigger titan than he was before. Instead of picking himself out of the water, he decides to leap out of it like a jumping fish, but then lands with a loud thud on the harbor. He stands his body up straight, feeling even more pumped than ever as the sun shines its rays right down onto his strapping, robust frame. He looks down to see shoes were long gone, but that's okay, he didn't mind having to walk on his bare, clawed feet. He also noticed his shirt was gone revealing a powerful body just waiting to be flexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for his body, his flexes one arm, and it was as if watching a peaking mountain rise, as well as his immense tri peaking out underneath. He had never seen anything so huge before, other than on his idol Bill. He takes turns flexing and pumping both arms, watching them grow sinewy and hefty one-by-one for dramatic effect. He then flexes them down and then grunts as he flexes them up to make his meaty pecs stick out, and bounces them a few times with great development. Rubbing his thick palm over his enlarged abs, they felt even more defined than he thought, especially for a 10-pack. Grunting again, he gave them a hard flex and could feel them pop out beneath his clawed hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last he decides to check out are his enormous tree trunks he calls legs. Sticking one beefy, bulgy leg out, he was able to stretch it pretty far. For someone as big as he is, he sure is flexible. Guess that's normal for aquatic creatures. Running a hand along his well-built thigh, he didn't even have to flex it to feel the large amounts of blood pumping through, or even the amount of horsepower stored inside that he could reach. It's no use though, he had to see it. It a heave, he flexes his leg greatly, making his quads, hamstring and calf swell and plump to wondrous proportions, looking so striated and veiny, his shorts sleeve looked ready to pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!\", he yells proudly, giving his inflated calf a good rub. \"Wait till Bill sees me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back at the gym, Bill was getting lots of from the many gym-goers around him, signing autographs, showing off his muscles, even taking a few pics. Suddenly he hears a couple gasps around. He looks up and does the same, watching the herculean gator make his way to the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank puts on a competitive face, \"Bill, the name's Frank. It's a pleasure to meet-\", he sticks out his shredded arm pretty quick, Bill was too distracted by Frank's incredibly defined chest. It was so clean cut Bill thought it was cut with solid diamonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank couldn't help but blush, what with the many looks he was getting of his shirtless and ripped upper body from the attendees around him, even Bill, who puts on a look of approval. He then grabs the gator's hand to shake, \"Pleasure meetin' ya! Been meaning ta see what big guys they had here in town.\", He smirks. Frank chuckled making his gigantic chest puff and ripple with power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" said Bill. \"I'm impressed! Come on, I got a few protein shakes to spare. Let's talk for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure thing,\" Frank did his best to keep his composure. Underneath that mountain of muscle was a fan screaming his head off. Frank and Bill sat next to a table next to the snack bar and Bill pulled out a couple of protein shakes for the two of them. As Frank took a sip, he felt the protein quickly nourishing his body quickly. He was even beginning to feel stronger than he was before. Frank let out a soft sigh after a gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill started, \"Frank, you're probably the biggest guy I've ever seen. I didn't think anyone could pack that much muscle.\" Frank blushed again. He didn't think he'd ever get this type of praise, let alone from his own personal hero. Then Bill asked the question: \"What's your secret?\" All the blood from Frank's cheeks and muscles flushed out of his body. What in the world was he going to say? Frank couldn't just tell Bill that he took a dip in a magical swamp that made him bigger than him. But at the same time, he hated to lie to him. Frank had to improvise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank started, \"I just did my routine, you know, workout. I also had a bit of a growth spurt...A really big one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill chuckled. \"Understatement of the year. Regardless, you look great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R..really?\" asked Frank blushing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you got a great body and I think it'll help you fight big time in the tournament.\" Frank was speechless. He didn't know what to say. Before Frank could say anything, Bill finished his protein shake and got up from his seat. \"So, how about showing me what you can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean sparring. Let's see how fight with those muscles of yours.\" Frank smiled thinking this day couldn't get any better. Frank nodded and followed Bill the ring in the middle of the gym. The two opponents wrapped their hands and feet with bandages to keep them safe from injury. Frank and Bill entered the ring bringing their war faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I'm going to go easy on you because you're bigger!\" said Bill<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you take the first move!\" replied Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what they say, the first punch always wins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove it!\" Frank let out a small snarl as Bill rushed in for an attack. Bill first tried to strike Frank by his side. He only ended up hurting his hand. Frank's giant abs protected him from Bill attack. All Bill did was give him a tingling sensation where the punch was. Frank let out chuckle and looked down at Bill. \"That tickled.\" Bill expected as such so he kicked Frank's knee to take the giant gator to his level and set the advantage to himself. However, Frank's knee was even sturdier than Frank's chest. Frank let out another laugh and grabbed Bill by his shirt. Frank lifted Bill up to his level leaving Bill hanging a few feet from the ring. \"My turn,\" said Frank. Frank slammed Bill to the ground and placed his gigantic foot on the badger's chest. Despite the badger's legendary strength, he couldn't lift the several ton of muscle off of him. Frank counted, \"1...2...3!\" Frank won without breaking a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill manages to sit himself up on the ground, rubbing the back on his head with one hand. \"Dang. You've got some real spunk in ya, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranks kneels down on one blasted leg, holding out his hand, \"Need help there?\", he grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill smiles back, getting a firm hold of the giant's massive palm to help him up. \"Heh, thanks. Not bad for a firm start. Have you ever wrestled before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit, but I learned from the best.\", Frank winks. The truth is he never wrestled much at all, other than those times as a child when he would pretend wrestle with his stuffed animals. If he wants to get better at wrestling he may as well start getting better at it now. \"I'm still a little rusty though. Wouldn't mind getting a few pointers from you, if you're available.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger thinks a bit to himself, \"Hmm... You know what, I like that idea.\", he sneers. \"But as for today, I was just gonna be working out with some of the gym folk. You should tag along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranks wags his tail excitedly, \"Sure! I'd like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walk out towards the gym floor, Bill gives his best pal a nudge against his thick abs, \"Heh. We'll be like a huge workout duo. I'd like to see just how much you can lift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\", Frank screams with motivation. \"Uh, me too.\" Perfect timing. Now he can see just how much he can handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce down at the gym floor it was clear they've been getting some surprised looks from almost everyone in the room. Some of the bigger fellows were just as surprised, but just tried to keep to themselves. Luckily they had the large mirror walls to look back at them. As for the two wrestling buddies, Bill starts himself off with some arm curls. Frank just thought he do the same thing. They are best buds now after all. The badger had a pair of 250's in his hands, but Frank goes for the 300-pound dumbbells. Frank was about to start, while the shredded badger was already getting into it. He made the crowd around him feel mesmerized, just staring at the bulking, hefty peaks that were his guns, and they were about ready to fire after each curl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank was just as impressed, but he knew he can do just as good. The gator got to a slow start but he soon had big guns just like his idol, even bigger as a matter of fact. Bill's arms looked incredibly sinewy and shredded now as his arms were coming to a slowly, satisfying stop, \"98...99...100!\" The badger huffs his chest, sighing with great relief. \"Always great to start off with some good arm curls. He then takes a look at his muscly alligator friend. \"Whoa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill noticed how incredibly pumped and ripped Frank's arms became during the gator's workout. They grew even bigger than before. Bill could have sworn that Frank's biceps and triceps grew between each rep. He was even surprised to see visible veins on the gator's scales throbbing as they pumped blood to supply the giant. Frank paused his workout and looked at Bill. \"Something wrong?\" asked Frank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No..\" said Bill. \"You're just full of surprises. With those arms of yours I bet you can lift a truck!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank blushed again. \"I don't know about that...\" he said modestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do!\" responded Bill. \"You threw me around that ring like I was a rag doll. You even got yourself lifting 500 pound weights!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Did Frank hear Bill right? Frank looked at his weights and looked at the numbers printed on them saying \"500 lbs.\" Frank let out a slight gasp. He thought the weights were lighter. If 500 lbs was light, what was considered heavy to Frank? Not only was he bigger than his own hero but stronger too! \"Wow!\" said Frank. \"Felt lighter than that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill let out a chuckle. \"Guess you don't know your own strength,\" he teased. The badger then turned to the weight benches. \"Come on, let's see what your limit is.\" Frank put his weights back and followed Bill to the weight benches. Frank was so excited about pumping more iron to his already giant frame that he laid back on the bench to grab hold of the bar. Bill slid some extra weight on both sides of the bar and said, \"We're going to try something a bit heavier. Let's see how 750 pounds feels to you.\" Frank gave Bill a thumbs up and began to press.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill saw Frank's arms get pumped even more. Frank felt himself getting stronger after each rep. He didn't feel tired at all, rather energized. Frank did 20 reps after putting it back in place. \"How do you feel?\" asked Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank just smiled and said, \"Like I'm getting warmed up!\" Bill couldn't believe it. This giant gator could withstand 750 pounds! Even professional weightlifters would struggle to lift that and Frank did it without hesitation. Bill then looked at the other weights and wondered if Frank could lift 1000 pounds. Frank was an unbelievable alligator. \"This is going to sound crazy,\" said Bill, \"But I'm going to add up to a thousand pounds on the bar. Think you can handle it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank was too excited about his strength to acknowledge what Bill just said. The gator just chuckled and said, \"Bring it on!\" Bill put on the weights and Frank starts pumping as soon as Bill's done adding. The weight was definitely more challenging than the previous weights Frank lifted. Frank's arms bulged out even more under the stress. Frank ran out of breath at 15 reps and stopped. Frank rose up to catch his breath puffing his chest up and down. \"That felt...pretty good,\" said Frank between breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill widened his eyes. A thousand pounds was Frank's limit. The badger then imagined what would happen if Frank passed that limit and got even stronger or bigger. He then smiled and laughed. He looked at the giant gator and said, \"Frank, you got yourself a future in this field of work!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank felt so pumped. He had a great body, had a great workout, and had great encouragement from his hero. Frank flexed his arms out of all the excitement. His biceps swelled to untouchable peaks with veins slithering from his shoulders to his wrists. Frank even let out a soft growl. Bill smiled and let out a soft chuckle. Frank blushed out of embarrassment and said, \"Sorry, guess I got a little carried away.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No apologies necessary,\" said Bill. \"If I were as big as you, I'd act the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you...do you really think I can be a good fighter like you?\" asked Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill laughed again and slapped Frank's back. \"You already are! You tossed me around in the ring like teddy bear! If you can take on me, you can take on anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take on anyone, you say?\" The alligator and the badger turned to see a muscular rhino standing behind them. \"You sure it was skill, or was it luck?\" Just hearing the rhino's voice made Frank's blood boil. The rhino walked up to Frank meeting him eye to eye and equal in muscle. \"I'll be more impressed if he could take on a much bigger guy, like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a challenge I hear?\" said Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a party invitation.\" Frank curled his hand into a fist tempting to punch the rhino's light out. Bill could see the anger stirring in Frank and got between him and the rhino before anything could start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save your energy for the fight, kid,\" Bill said to Frank. Bill then turned to the rhino. \"You can have your fight, but not today. We just finished training today and if he were to fight now, it wouldn't be fair. We'll settle this tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rhino just scoffed. \"Fine, whatever,\" he then just walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank gritted his teeth as the massive rhino was leaving. Bill did his best to calm him down. \"Don't worry, kid. You'll get your chance. You can take him down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Frank, \"No problem. No problem...at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Frank shakes hands with his idol as they say their goodbyes for the day. Bill takes hi leave in direction and Frank takes his in the other, only it wasn't towards his house, it was towards the magic swamp. In a matter of minutes, Frank was standing at the harbor with his head held up high. He didn't want to waste any time, giving his reflection a quick flex of his bicep before he takes a dip. He bends down, flexing his mega thighs and calves as he jumps high into the air and dives into the mucky swamp. It was only for a few seconds though. After a couple air bubbles float to the top of the swamp, Frank leaps out high and lands on his hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank was still covered with some swamp water, so he decides to patiently sit on his rump while he lets the swamp work its magic. He holds up his left arm, watching the muscles slightly balloon up, his beefy muscles rummaging against each other more than ever. He could feel the stretching, pleasureful effect taking its course along the rest of his body as it stretches to his other arm. He in turn flexes them both, almost looking like he was a muscled freak with disproportionately, peaking arms as large veins flow around his eye-popping biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel his bones pop to adjust to the rest of his growing body as his back muscles shred incredibly, the V-shape he once dreamt about even more noticeable than before under all that bulk! Feeling his chest starting to pulsate, he brings his arms in for a huge, crowd-pleasing flex with himself, even bouncing his pecs to the growing sensation. As it furthers down to his abdomen, his chiseled abs were just getting filled even more, simply filling up with more blood to accentuate his well-defined 10-pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast to swell out were his legs, and boy did they swell. His once stretchy shorts seem to be reaching their limit as they start to tear on the ends over his enormous thighs. His calves plumped up beneath his thighs, and it felt great. His body must have grown another few inches. Just enough to not make that rhino guy suspicious. \"Heh. Just wait till he sees this big guy.\", he taunts, raising his arm up against his head so that he could feel his solid bicep meet against his cheek. Another successful growth spurt, he grins. He couldn't wait to get home and see just how big he had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Frank entered the gym with new shorts and met up with Bill. Bill turned to see his giant friend and smiled not realizing he grew a few inches. \"The rhino's already in the ring. How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank cracked his knuckles and neck. \"Pumped and ready to teach that guy there's only room for one big guy around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill gave a thumbs up. \"That's the spirit! Go get him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Frank walked to the ring, he saw the rhino already standing ready and waiting for him. Frank just smiled intimidatingly and leaped into the ring. The rhino looked pumped and ready to fight Frank. He also didn't realize the alligator's recent growth. Frank just looked at the rhino with fire in his eyes feeling pumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you decided to show up? Figured you'd wuss out,\" said the rhino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank smiled. \"Heh, I thought the same thing about you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rhino had a short temper. Without saying another taunting word, he rushes to Frank to tackle him to the ground. Frank did not cower. He kept his blasted legs sturdy and braced for impact. Except, when the rhino grabbed Frank, it was like hitting a wall made of metal. The rhino tried to move the titan alligator with his meaty arms but Frank did not budge. Frank just laughed thinking the rhino's attempts were pitiful. The rhino grew scared as his fighting moves continued to fail him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank figured it was time to end this fight. He grab hold of the rhino and lifted him above his head. Bill and the rhino were amazed by that feat. The rhino weighed several hundred pounds of muscle and Frank had him in his arms like he was a toddler. The rhino felt like he was on top of a skyscraper and the height between him and the ground of several feet scared him. Frank looked up and said, \"That's the best you can do? Kinda sad...\" With a loud growl, Frank tossed the rhino out of the ring and the rhino landed on the other side of the gym. The rhino stumbled up and ran out of the gym as quickly as he could. The rhino looked as if he just saw a monster, a really big and scary monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank flexed his arms hard in victory. Bill entered the ring to congratulate him. \"That was great, kid! I told you he was nothing to you!\" Frank smiled at Bill and continued flexing his godly body feeling like he was the king of the world. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank continued feeling amazing after his victory over the rhino. He truly felt like the strongest gator in the gym, probably the whole world. To make it even better, he had Bill the Badger right by his side supporting him. Frank let out a giant sigh of pride. \"I gotta say, Bill,\" said Frank, \"I feel amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill smiled. \"As you should! A victory like this is worth celebrating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you want to celebrate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...how about you show off the muscles of yours? I want to see what kind of show they can put on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank liked the sound of that idea. He always loved flexing his muscles to himself and he didn't get a chance to flex after his recent growth. Frank saw the full sized mirrors next the weights and grinned. \"Sure. Let's see these guns put on a show!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank and Bill got out of the ring and walked towards the mirrors. As they stood in front of the mirrors, Bill stepped to the side and said to Frank, \"Okay, kid, show me what you got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank struck a killer smile at his reflection and raised his arms to flex. He pushed his arms as hard as he could and saw his biceps rose high like a mountain and erupt with power like a volcano. Thick veins rushed through pulsating and synchronizing with his heart beat. Frank felt like he could lift a bus with his arms. Frank's biceps slightly brushed against his cheeks. Frank found that amusing since he was that big. Out of fun, he licked his biceps tasting the power they stored. Suddenly, the taste in Frank's mouth gave him more energy to flex every other part of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank gulped a puff of air and pushed his chest forward. Frank's pecs and abs grew more in definition and looked clean cut. He could feel all the blood rushing through to make his chest look powerful. Frank then playfully bounced his pecs and rubbed his abs. He felt so much power in his chest it felt intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank finally stuck out his legs and made his thigh blast muscularly. He ran his finger through the crevices of his thigh enthusiastically. His leg felt so strong he though he could kick a hole in the nearest wall with it. He then plumped his calf under his thigh and saw it as a clean cut slab of meat, a piece of meat that could help him run like an Olympic athlete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Frank finally stopped flexing he saw his muscles still keep their plump shape after relaxing. Frank was thrilled to see his body sturdier and stronger than ever. Bill smiled at each of Frank's poses. \"Looking good, kid,\" said Bill. \"If fighting doesn't work out for you, you could have a promising future as a bodybuilder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank blushed while scratching the back of his head making his arm and chest pump up unintentionally. \"Hehe...thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank suddenly hears another another giggle, one that was too feminine to come out of his muscly chest. Looking into the mirror, he spots a beautiful fox doing cardio on a treadmill. She was facing towards the gator, so she got to see the whole show. Bill does the same, taking notice of the lean, orange fox. \"Heh. Not ta mention you'll be quite the lady's man too.\", he winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tad unexpected, a lady falling for Frank like that, but Frank was sure it was nothing he wasn't prepared for, thanks to his large, bulky frame. He raises up one arm, flexing it in the mirror as if he was flexing it right in front of her. She took notice quite well, giggling again as her cheeks turned a tad red. Frank puts on a toothy grin, \"I think I'm gonna enjoy this.\" He sticks out one meaty leg and turns around, strolling right up to the cute fox and setting an arm on the treadmill. \"Hello.\", he utters smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, he-hello.\", she blushes, not realizing just how big Frank was up close. \"Wow... You're much...much, much bigger than I thought you'd be...\", she giggles, nearly tripping on the treadmill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey thanks. Glad ya like whatcha see.\", he smirks tensing his tight pecs a few times, nearly making her trip once again. Frank quickly turns off the treadmill. \"How 'bout we talk a little more safely?\", he chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lean fox blushes more again, \"Uh, yeah. Um...so what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Frank.\", the expansive reptile grins, holding out his large, meaty palm to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female fox does the same, her hand only about a third as large over the rest of his, \"My name is Erika. It's a real pleasure to meet you.\", she grins happily. That was probably the cutest grin Frank had ever seen. No one ever smiled at him like that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank brings Erika's hand up close to kiss her palm, \"It's a pleasure to meet you too.\", he speaks smoothly. \"Would you like I give you a small taste of just how muscular this alligator is?\", he winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to see that.\", she answers excitedly. Frank takes a few steps back, making sure nothing or no one was gonna be in his way. He starts off with a simple flex of his arms, slowly pumping each arm against his chest one-by-one, each thick pectoral bulging out accordingly with each other. Next thing he does is set his hands on his hefty waist, then giving her the biggest lat spread she had ever seen. His pecs stretched out beautifully, as well as his wide lats and shoulders. The last would be his legs, though he decides to show off only one. Slipping up one sleeve to reveal just how much thigh meat he was hiding under there. With a mere, simple flex, his quads and calf grew overly pumped, as if it were ready to explode! Erika was flailing at this point, unknowingly pressing a button on the treadmill that sets it into high gear, \"KYAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank quickly sprints behind and catches her. She couldn't believe how fast he was. Frank smirks, flexing both of his shredded thighs enough so that they were able to hear fabric of his shorts getting stretched. \"Them's some strong fast legs, eh?\", he winks yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\", was all Erika could say.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So....\" Erika started somewhat nervously. \"Where are you from? I haven't seen you around here before.\" Frank rubbed the back of his head trying to come up with an answer that was too bad of a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. you see I've lived here in town my whole life, but... this is the first time I've been to this gym.\" Well that wasn't too bad and it wasn't a lie. Erika smiled, her gleaming with teeth reflecting a bit of light off the lights from the ceiling, making her beautiful grin even more dazzling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well where is this other gym you were hanging around at? I've never really seen anyone as big as you are around here it's.. a nice change.\" Erika laughed as he stepped away from Frank, realizing she was still standing quite close to him. Frank smiled as he tried to change the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what about you? have you lived here very long?\" Erika nodded her head as she leaned back against a pillar that stood near where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only for about five years or so. I moved here with my parents after my dad got a promotion at work. He was making a lot more money so we decided to try and settle down somewhere different for a time, though I think my parents might end up spending the rest of their life here. Everyone here has usually been so friendly and it just seemed like a perfect place for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank nodded attentively showing that he was actively paying attention to her story. She looked up into his eyes, a smile started to grow again as she took in his muscles again, although they weren't flexed it didn't make them any less impressive. Frank saw her noticing his muscles again and smiled. \"So, you like big muscles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika blushed deep red. \"Umm...yeah. I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank shook his head. \"No, not at all. I like big muscles too.\" Frank then raised his arm to flex his bicep to her. Erika's eyes widened to see Frank's raw power appear right in front of her. She couldn't believe such power could be on a being. She smiled at the big friendly giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill flexing his arm, Frank leans over and asks Erika, \"You want to feel?\" Erika just nodded and stretched out her hands. When she placed her hands on Frank's arms, she thought his power was amazing. She could feel the coolness of his scales while at the same time the warmth the bubbled underneath his incredible strength. Erika felt Frank's arm from shoulder to wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...amazing!\" said Erika. \"It feels like clean cut steel. Incredible!' It was then Frank's turn to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, these aren't just for show!\" said Frank. \"Want to see them in action?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" said Erika. \"I would love to!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank and Erika walked over to the weights. Frank smiled thinking of ways to impress Erika. He couldn't wait to start. Frank pumped his arms to her and said, \"Let's get pumped!\" First thing Frank comes across is a lat machine. He first sets the weight at an amount that he can withstand. Erika was surprised to see him put 850 pounds of weights on the machine. Frank wasn't even sure if he could lift that much, but he feels he can manage. He sets himself up on the machine and starts pumping in no time. The weights actually felt heavy in his grip, but that's just the way he likes it. He started working his lats at a fast pace, but then slows down enough so Erika could see every sinewy muscle being worked on his body. His lats jutted out so much it was as if they were wings. Before he knew it, he had already done over 50 reps. Now, on to the next thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female fox was pretty excited to see Frank go for the bench pressing equipment. She sees him put almost a thousand pounds of weights this time. Erika couldn't believe it! She had thought Frank would be tuckered by now, but he's not tired at all. Just sweaty. Frank lies back and then lets his strapping muscles do all the work. Taking the barbell off its resting place, he manages to lift the with ease. It was pretty tough at first, but it was like he could feel his muscles surging with power from all the pump he was receiving. And that helped a lot. Feeling his arms stretch and heave, and feeling his mountainous pecs rise up and down beneath his chin was astounding. Erika couldn't believe what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next workout had Frank doing deadlifts with 500-pound dumbbells in his mitts. He was doing them while standing away from Erika, that way she could get a great view of the gator's rippling back. He even let her feel it stretch and ripple apart while he was in motion. After that was his legs, which he thought were the most muscular and powerful of his whole body. Now is the time to put them to work. What better way than to pump them up with the leg press machine. He first sets the waits, putting them at a whopping 1250 pounds! This was a sight to behold for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank sits his tight rump on the machine and gets his legs into position. Soon as he starts pressing his legs, the weights started to feel heavier than he expected, but he didn't want to stop there. Not while she was watching! His first press was slow, but he pushes his legs even further, making them swell up to gigantic proportions. Before he knew it, he was doing faster and faster leg presses in a matter of seconds. His legs burned and ached like crazy but he was enjoying it. He loved the feeling of burning, tensing, rippling muscle being pumped and pushed to its limit. His quads, hamstrings and calves were being blasted so much they were looking quite sinewy and striated all around, with a fair amount of pulsing veins to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Frank's mind he counts, \"...96...97...98...come on...99...RRRGH...100!!\" He sets his legs friend, and the weights fall down hard as it makes the floor around them rattle. The tired reptile lounges about, sticking his tongue form exhaustion while he tries to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he feels a pair of long arms wrap around his neck, \"Ohmygosh! That was outstanding!\", Erika yells, giving Frank's head a hug. \"And...you're all...sweaty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... Sorry 'bout that.\", he chuckles. They both look down and see Frank's shorts, which were all torn apart at the bottom from all the commotion. His legs ended up being even more shredded than usual, so much that they just stood there watching his legs pulsate beautifully from all the pump. \"May uh...need to get a new pair of shorts. Again...\", he snickers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today was definitely a good day for Frank. He beat up that rhino bully, met a girl he really likes, and got the one of the biggest pumps he ever received, all in one day. He already said his goodbyes to Bill and Erika, now was the time he tended to one pressing matter: New clothes. Not only is it nice to by new clothes to support his new size, he really needs it. After his intense workout, he was left with nothing more than a shredded pair of shorts. He can't just walk into the clothing store in his current getup. Maybe he can find something to wear at home. His father once gave him a couple pairs of shirts he thought Frank would be able to wear, but didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at his house, he found the pairs of clothes he was given. The only problem was that they were all polos. \"Fine choice of clothing Dad.\", Frank remarks to himself. At least they're the proper type of clothes he can wear at the store. He finds a few pair of khakis next. He should have expected this. His dad is a pretty avid golfer. He felt he may as well gotten a few golf hats <br>\r\nto complete the set. The clothes felt a tad overbearing over his broad frame, but he'll manage until he get his own pairs of workout clothes and whatnot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way to the sporting goods store, he kept getting lots and lots of stares from people walking around him. Mainly because he stood much taller and looked much handsomer to everyone around him. Well, at least these clothes are good for something. Bet his dad was expecting this all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made it to the sporting goods store and already had a basket full of large shirts and shorts that would be perfect for all the workouts he'll be doing. This place also has triple and quadruple extra-large sizes, so that's something he'll have to look forward to. If ever. After about half an hour of shopping he takes his leave with a couple bags being carried around his arms, and not before getting a sweet compliment from the female cashier. It was late into the afternoon, and there wasn't really much else to do. Guess he'll just start trying out these clothes and see how they'll fit on his bulging frame. Let's turn those thought he had in his head of wearing these into a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank returned home and quickly rushed to his room. He unpacked the shopping bag and laid his purchases on his bed. Frank felt proud of his clothing choices and confident that he'll look great with them on his meaty body. Frank quickly changed from his father's clothes into his new ones. He slipped a pair of deep blue jeans and covered his rippling chest with a plain red t shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank turned to the mirror and saw he became even more handsome. His shirt hugged his bulky frame perfectly. He could see definition of his pecs and abs underneath, but the shirt didn't feel tight or look like it was ready to burst. Frank also had to admit that red was a good color on him. Frank playfully flexed his bicep and was surprised to see the sleeve of his shirt match the shape of his giant arm without tearing. Frank smiled out of confidence and relief. He thought he made some decent choices in clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jeans were similar to his shirt. They took the shape of Frank's tree trunk thighs and calves and Frank felt like he could still move in them with ease. Frank even tried tensing to see his jeans refused to tear. He finally had some trusting clothes that wouldn't burst off of him every time he worked out or grew in the swamp. Frank decided to put on a private fashion show for himself thinking his clothes looked great and made him feel great. Besides, he had the body of a super model. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank tried on everything else he bought: denim shirts, casual shorts and pants, and jackets. But he saved the best for last. He pulled out a blue tank top and black spandex shorts. Frank quickly put them on and smiled at the mirror as if it was a camera. The tank top showed off his beefy arms and his steel plated pecs, just the way Frank liked it. The shorts filled his tendon coiled thighs perfectly without tearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank took a deep breath and puffed his chest and arms. He saw his whole upper body swell right underneath his new clothes with clean cut definition. He felt incredible vascular power running through him that he felt like he was going to explode, but he didn't. Frank's clothes kept up with his poses and flexes without showing any weariness. Frank felt very satisfied. He could now go to the gym without feeling half naked without a shirt or worry about his shorts tearing whenever he pumps too hard. Not only was Frank ready for the gym, he was ready for the real world. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank  set down the bags of clothes he had just bought and stopped to look in his mirror. These clothes fitted him so well and made his already massive muscles look even better if that were possible. Everytime his muscles flexed the clothes stretched looking as if they would rip, but they held firm and kept outlined his body so much it could make anyone stare with envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd be the life of any room he walked into with these massive muscles and he thought he might as well show them off the next time he went to the gym. Maybe Erika would take notice of his new outfit. He grinned as he brought his left arm up in a tight bicep flex, stretching his bicep to it's very peak, he could see the outlines of his veins pushing up against his scales. He  pressed his fingers against the veins and he could almost feel his heartbeat thumping as it pumped blood in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his heart was pumping hard, so was Frank's enthusiasm. He wanted not just to show off his muscles but also his new clothes. He thought about the gym but he figured he spent a lot of time there and wanted to do something different. Frank had to think: what would be a good place to show off muscle while wearing non-workout clothes? Then it hit him: the park. The park was perfect. There was plenty of people there to show off to. Without further delay, Frank quickly changed from his new workout outfit to his new t shirt and jeans. He then rushed out to get to the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank walked through the park feeling completely refreshed. The air was crisp and clear, no smell of sweat compared to the gym. Birds were chirping in the trees, squirrels were running across the grass, and people passing by Frank couldn't help but stare in awe of the humongous alligator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank got his head out of the clouds when he saw people beginning to notice him. At first, it felt really awkward people noticing his body but he quickly began to relax and enjoy the attention. Other park visitors noticed Frank when his feet caused slight tremors in the ground every time he took a step. He even overshadowed everyone because of his giant frame against the warm sun. People thought it was amazing to see so much muscle on an alligator. They didn't see him out of fear but of envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank smiled wanting to take advantage of this opportunity. Frank raised his arms to flex to the visitors as if they were his audience. He then puffed his chest to where people could see his pecs, abs, and veins from underneath his shirt. The audience was amazed that his shirt remained intact. Lastly, Frank stuck out his leg and tensed it. His jeans made it look like his whole leg was painted a blue denim color. Even that didn't tear, in fact, it made him feel more flexible. Frank continued his posing show until he saw a nearby tree with a branch close to the ground. He smiled as he got an idea to impress his audience even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe proud reptile walks over to the large tree and eyes its largest branch. The small crowd follows. With great ease, he grabs a firm hold of the branch immediately starts pumping his biceps up. The group was amazed to see such blasted arms. They looked so sinewy and large, like a pair of giant hills rising and falling while accompanied by some snaking veins all over his arms. Even his pecs were getting some attention, flexing and puffing out every time he lifts. Frank starts to hear clapping starting to erupt from all around. It wasn't a lot, but enough to keep the exhilarated gator going as he sweats even more, his lifting only getting faster and faster, his huffs growing more and more prominent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could go on forever, until he and everyone around him hears a loud crackling noise, making the muscular reptile stop while still holding his body up. \"Uh-oh...\" In a matter of seconds, the tree branch breaks off, and there goes Frank falling to the ground. He was a little phased, but nothing even a normal-bodied person could shake off. \"Ow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh! Frank, are you okay?\" That feminine voice sounded awfully familiar. It was none other than Erika, who runs to his side. \"You're not hurt or anything, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" He picks himself up, \"Oh, no. I'm alright.\" He gets up on his feet, his shirt now all covered in grass and grass stains. \"Aw man...\" The group of people then take their leave. \"So, have you been watching this whole time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not all of it.\", she admits. \"I came as soon as I saw you doing pull-ups with that tree. Was that even a good idea?\", she scolds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looked sturdy enough.\", he defends. \"Anyways, did you enjoy the show?\", he smirks, showing his beefy arm to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. You were really good out there. I never doubted you for a minute. Though, I did doubt that tree.\", she remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, enough with the tree.\", he hisses. He does notice how she couldn't keep her eyes off his large, shredded muscles. \"Well, since you're here, care to take a feel of this sexy giant?\", he winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe must have read her mind, 'cause it makes her whole face turn red. \"I...I'd love too.\", she replies softly. Frank then does the honors of tensing and bouncing his meaty chest, which she steps in to feel. It feel like a pile of metal in her grasp. Next thing Frank does is flex up his bicep, but then bends down enough so she could reach that thick bicep and tricep muscle, as well as thickening out his robust forearm. Erika takes her time feeling all around that rounded mountain o' meat and flesh. Her cheeks only turned even redder. Frank would show her more, but the fox had to take her leave. \"Um, that wall all very nice...but, I gotta get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank holds her hands. \"Will I see you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika's eyes widen as she stares into the large creatures beautiful eyes. \"...Mm... Definitely.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Frank woke feeling refreshed and pumped for the day. He sat up in his bed making it creak under his massive weight. He then flexed his arm to make it swell in power and strength. Frank was satisfied to see he was still the big and strong alligator that he truly loved. He stretched his arms making them ripple and his chest puff out in definition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank jumped out of bed and made the floor tremble underneath his feet. Frank just smiled thinking it was great waking up this big. Frank walked to the window to see the sun rising in the horizon. Sunlight shined against his scales it felt good on his body. Frank felt the warm sunlight seep into flesh making his muscles feel more energized and powerful. At this point, Frank needed to exert some energy. He didn't care about breakfast, he just wanted to get started on a morning workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank then saw someone jogging along the sidewalk of his house. The alligator was surprised to see it was muscular badger in a tank top and shorts. Frank's eyes widened when he realized it was Bill. Frank knew he had to catch up to him and join him on his jog. He quickly put on his workout clothes and sprinted out of the house. With his sculpted legs, Frank caught up with Bill in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bill,\" greeted Frank as he began jogging to the badger's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid!\" said Bill. \"What are you doing up this early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you jogging by so I thought I'd join you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill smiled out of flattery. \"Thanks kid, I appreciate the company. I was thinking about jogging another few blocks and stop by to get breakfast. You wanna join?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y..yeah! Sure!\" said Frank excitedly and realizing how hungry he was. \"I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill chuckled. \"I bet you are! Takes a lot of food to keep a tank like you going! I bet you can eat five plates full of waffles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank punches the air, and then rolls his muscular arm to show off that massive peak of his and pats it with his other meaty palm over the hardened muscle, \"Hey, gotta eat big to stay big, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill grins back at the excited gator. \"Right! There's this breakfast place I saw on my trip here. Thought I try it out. Care to tag along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, be happy to!\", Bill replies. \"Where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the other part of town. Thought I may as well jog all the way there. You up for it?\", Bill winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other part of town huh?\" This puts a big grin on the giant reptile's maw, \"Sounds like a challenge.\" Bill nods his head in agreement as well. As the two continued jogging, the badger noticed his running mate was running faster than him. In Frank's defense, he didn't even notice. He just happens to have more immense, well-sculpted legs. Bill took that as a challenge though, putting a smirk on the badger's face. He starts actually sprinting now, managing to catch up to Frank and running past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank takes notice, not sure of why he was running faster, but decides to catch up too. Frank didn't have to do much except kick up his legs faster, and he was almost neck-and-neck with Bill. Soon as the badger took notice, he actually starts to sprint this ahead this time. That's when Frank realizes that this is another challenge he was given, and starts picking up speed all the same. Even though he was the one with bigger thighs and calves, Bill was actually able to hold his own, making it tough for the massive reptile to even catch up. \"Whoa... This guys fast on his feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to catch up to the badger was hard enough, but he wouldn't give up that easily. They were really starting to stir up a lot of attention as a lot of bystanders watched the two muscular beasts running block after block for over a mile. Suddenly, Bill comes to an immediate stop, but Frank just keeps going, almost catching up and running past him until, \"STOP!!\" Frank does just that, standing on one foot, and then a rush of speeding locomotives drive right past him. His toes were actually sitting off of the sidewalk. Frank just stood there with his jaw agape, as if he had seen his life flash before his eyes. Bill then walks up behind him, \"Intersection. You should be more careful there, big guy. I see that you're big, but not big enough to get hit by a passing vehicle and live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank just stood there, frozen. \"...That was close... Phew, I owe ya one. Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the badger's lower body, he takes notice of Bill's searing, sinewy legs. They looked incredibly tense, shredded, and almost ready to blow under all those veins! \"What? See anything you notice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, those legs of yours. They're all blasted, and huge!\", Frank exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill was flattered by Frank's comment, \"Heh, thanks! If there's one part of the body a good wrestler needs, it's legs.\" He spreads his legs a bit and flexes them, almost enough to strain the shorts he wore to their limit, \"And these babies have helped me win quite a few good matches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\", Frank awes, \"No wonder I was havin' a hard time catching up to ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill grins. \"The breakfast place is across the street. Let's go eat!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank and Bill finally stopped in front of a small diner. The muscular duo squeezed through the door and were met by a female raccoon waiter. She was amazed to see huge guys entering the diner, but she was also excited. She knew right away they were going to eat a lot of food, which meant a lot of money for her. Bill looked at the waitress and held out two fingers in front of her. \"Two seats, please,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress smiled and said, \"Right this way!\" She guided Frank and Bill to the front of the diner where a series of metal stools sat across a little bar. The two sat on the stools next to each other and the stools held their giant weights very steadily. There was little chance they would break under them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress came to them behind the counter. \"Welcome fellas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" said Bill. \"My friend and I are ready for a hearty breakfast after a good morning jog. Got anything that fill us up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress nodded. \"Yes sir, and lots of it! Say, aren't you Bill the Badger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please excuse me. I'm a big fan! I've watched  your fighting career with great interest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill felt flattered by the waitresses's kind words. \"Why, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress could barely keep her composure. \"I'll tell you what, for all you do, you guys can seconds for free!\" Bill and Frank were excited to hear that. The next best thing about breakfast was a free breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great!\" said Bill. \"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what can I get you?\" said the waitress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have eggs, bacon, sausage, and toast,\" said Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have what he has plus waffles!\" said Frank. The waitress recorded their orders and walked back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, the waitress returned to Bill and Frank with heavy plates with mountains of food. The two didn't hesitate and started eating right away. Frank started putting as much food as he could in his mouth. As he swallowed and the food ran down his throat and into his stomach, Frank felt so relieved. He felt like he hadn't eaten in ages and he was still hungry. If what Bill said earlier was true, Frank was no where near done eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill finished his plate of food and went on to his second one. As he was eating, Frank was already on his third plate. Frank wasn't aware how much he was eating. He just knew his body wanted more. It was strange, each bite that Frank took seemed to make him stronger. He didn't know why nor did he really care. Frank just kept eating until his stomach was content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill just finished his second plate and smiled at Frank. \"I told you that you needed a lot of food to keep you going!\" said Bill teasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank felt embarrassed while wiping his mouth of food. \"Sorry, guess I didn't realize how hungry I was.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill chuckled, \"It's fine. Eating like that means you enjoyed a good meal. Besides, it looks like it did you some good.\" Bill then pointed at Frank's bulgy arm and Frank looked at it in amazement. His whole arm grew more defined and slightly bigger! Then Frank realized that his chest and legs felt a little tighter against his clothing. As he looked at the rest of his body, Frank saw his body looked a little bigger! He even felt a little stronger than before! It was so strange. Frank felt bigger and stronger without going into the swamp! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like all that food got you all pumped up for today!\" said Bill jokingly. Frank grinned as he brought his arm up in a spectacular show of a bicep flex, he could hear the shirt stretch a little as he hugged his bicep so well. It was almost like a second skin to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than pumped up!\"  Frank took in a deep breath as he turned to look at Bill, his shirt suddenly becoming tight as his chest swelled up, becoming thicker and more pronounced under that thin shirt. To anyone else Frank would have looked quite intimidating, his muscles bulged in ways that very few could obtain. Bill let out a small whistle as he gazed at the almost monstrous biceps straining to burst free of the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel bad for anyone that goes up against you. you could really do a number on them.\" Frank laughed as he brought his arm up, rubbing his flexed bicep against the side of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the plan. I don't plan to lose ya know.\" Bill gave a big laugh as he  patted Frank's back, giving a teasing squeeze to feel out the tight unyielding muscles underneath the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With an attitude like that you better not!\" Frank grinned as the female raccoon from before came back to them with a bill in hand. She paused as he saw the little show Frank was putting on and a blush spread across her furred cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I uh... y-your receipt.\" She nervously outstretched her paw, paper in hand as Bill reached out and grasped it, oblivious of the state she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. the food was amazing I'm definitely coming back here again.\" Bill reached into his wallet and slid out a crisp pair of bills and handed it to the still awestruck raccoon who took a minute to realize what he was handing her before she grasped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-glad you enjoyed it. I'll give your compliments to the cook.. please come again soon.\" With that the raccoon turned around and sped away, trying to resist stealing glances at the handsome pair of large men sitting there.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Knew that place was good. Their meat is pure grade, tell ya what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank does the same, only his was a tad upbeat. \"Excuse me. So, where ya headed now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, just wanted to head back to my place. Need to let all the food settle.\" Bill turns to look at his best pal, \"Say, are ya busy? Would like to come over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I, I'd love to.\", Frank replies excitedly. He felt it was a high honor, of some kind. Getting to come to your idol's house for a visit, that just sounds too good to be true. \"Hey Bill, would ya like to race there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill hesitates for a moment, \"Eh, I don't think that's a good idea. Wouldn't want all that food to come back up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kidding.\", Frank snickers. \"I don't even know where ya live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank's eyes were wide gawks with his mouth gaping open at what he sees in front of him. \"Is that...your place...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house was practically a mansion, only have the size. Bill pats his friend on the shoulder to snap him out of it, \"Hey, it's just a two-story house. Not an estate.\" Bill walks up to open his front door. \"Come on, I'll show ya inside.\" First room the gator gets to see is his living room, and it was much larger than his. Even his TV was bigger. There were even some pictures and medals hanging on the wall. Pictures of his wins and prized moments, and medals as prove of his wins. \"Whatcha think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank takes this time to wander about Bill's place a bit. He even slides his large, meaty palm over one of the badger's couches. \"Well, it's...definitely roomier than my own home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'll show you a few of the rooms.\" One room in particular was his weight room, which he only briefly talks about since he and his friend are still too full from their breakfast. There were weights and everything inside, that's for sure. The next room he shows was his most favorite, his fighting room. Basically it's a room that has a couple weights, a big and small punching back, plenty of mirrors, and a large ring for him to practice wrestling in. \"Whatcha think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both talk a walk inside. \"This place is amazing! Do you...ever get anyone to practice with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...uh, rarely. You're one of the view that I think I'll actually a fun time fighting with. What do ya think?\", Bill asks bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? I'd love to!\", Franks screams. \"Er, maybe a little later. Until I'm not so full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Guess I'll get that rematch with ya after all!\", Bill replies proudly. He then tugs off his shirt and walks up to on of his many mirrors, one that reflected his entire bulging frame. \"Hey, yer not too full to flex a bit, are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank starts wagging his tail, \"Not at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank walked up to the mirror right next to Bill. Frank then stripped off his shirt to reveal his broad and rippling chest. As Bill looked up at Frank, the badger admitted he looked at the alligator's chest in envy. Frank took up most of the mirror as he raised his arms to inflate his biceps and triceps like balloons. The alligator then raised his arms above his head where his biceps rubbed gently against his cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank then put his arms on his waist and began to bounce his pecs playfully. He even bulged his ten pack abs and rubbed them with his giant hand. He gave a soft growl feeling the warmth and power of his chest with his fingertips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank then lifted a leg and then blast it incredible definition. Crevices of his thighs and calves sunk deep into his flesh making his thick tendons look coiled and swollen in power. Frank's legs felt like iron pipes that could stomp a hole in the floor. Frank was incredibly satisfied with his pumped body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill smiled and gave a whistle to Frank. \"Still can't get over that giant body of yours, kid.\" said Bill. \"You got power and you know how to use it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th...thanks, Bill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I have to say, with all your flexing you almost got me jealous of your muscles. I wish I could be as big as you.\" Frank felt a little flattered. His personal hero wanted to be like him? How cool is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure you will if you keep training hard,\" said Frank encouragingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe. So what do you want to do now?\"</span></div></div>",

And train hard.\", Bill winks. \"You're free to train all ya want as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be a pleasure.\", Frank, the muscular alligator, grins. Bill was starting off slow, with simple punches against the sandbag, but then really turned it up. He starts punching the bag harder, making it fly away with every hefty punch he threw at it. He even starts using his shredded legs, kicking the sandbag back and forth. Frank knew they were big and strong, but watching them flex and ripple apart against the sandbag was a real treat! His kicks seemed to be even stronger than his punches. \"Wow! You go, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank wanted to do something that wouldn't take too much attention away from the badger in action. He finds a blue jumprope on the ground. Perfect! He could watch his biggest inspiration AND workout his own legs at the same time. He picks it up and immediately starts his own training. Fifteen minutes into their training, Frank was feeling really good. Nothin' like a good workout to pump you up and make you feel exhilarated. He had been watching punch out that bag for that long as well, the burly, shredded badger not giving in. Say, maybe he can take a crack at that when he's done. Seemed like Bill was about to get a short break anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill sat on a bench to catch his breath. Judging by the look on his face, Bill looked a little discouraged. Frank noticed and went over to help his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Bill?\" asked Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" replied Bill. \"Just a little tired. I...I think I'm getting too old for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank's giant heart dropped when he heard those words out of his hero's mouth. \"What? What are you talking about?! You're at your prime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I keep telling myself,\" said Bill. \"I'm not as young as I use to. I was able to get bigger and stronger every day. I trained the very best way I could. Now, it seems my body just reached it's limit. My muscles got as big as they could and I can't get any stronger. But I hope you can carry on the legacy, Frank. With your strength and power, you'll be the best fighter in the world, maybe better than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank got up and looked down at Bill. \"That's enough! That's quitter talk and I know from watching you while I was a kid that you are not a quitter! You are a legend! You know a fighter like you never goes down! They get stronger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill chuckled and said, \"Yeah? Then how come I can't get any stronger. I've been this way for about a couple years now and no changes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank sighed and thought of ways that could lift Bill's spirits. Then it hit him: the swamp. If it could make Frank big, why not Bill? But would Bill believe him? Only one way to find out. \"I have an idea,\" said Frank. \"Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank guided Bill to the magic swamp. During the trip, Frank told Bill everything about it, how it made him grow, how swam in it, everything. However, Bill was a bit skeptical. They stopped at the small harbor of the swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You serious?\" asked Bill. \"You expect me to believe you got this big by taking a dip in this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank nodded. \"Look, I know this sounds crazy, but it really does work! Just take a quick swim and you'll be bigger and stronger than you ever were!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill just chuckled. \"Look, kid. You maybe comfortable in swimming in dirty water, but I'm not. No way am I...\" Before he could finish his sentence, Bill was pushed into the swamp by Frank creating a big splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill kicked and struggled as he had sucked down a swallow or two of water before his head managed to break the surface sputtering and coughing loudly. Water spat out of his muzzle<br>\r\n and he coughed hard, the taste of the swamp water almost pungent enough to make him gag. The smell alone already had him trying to swim for shore, to get out of this foul liquid.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"W...what the hell Frank? W-Why'd you do that?\" Bill wrapped his fingers around the wooden beam at the end of the pier and started trying to pull himself up. He almost lost his grip a few times because of his wet fur and a bit of slime from the water lapping at the wood for so long. Finally after a few minutes Bill managed to haul himself out of the water and he laid there breathing heavy, his fur and clothes sopping wet. His eyes looked up towards Frank, a very unhappy glare burning right into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you insane? I could have drowned! Why would you do that to me? I already said this water isn't magic, now I have to walk home dripping the whole way.\" Bill shifted forward and sat up, eventually moving up onto both feet and started walking away. Behind him Frank's smile had already worn away as he looked more and more upset. Why hadn't the water worked? He watched with a strong amount of guilt weighing on his chest as  Bill was walking down the pier. when he was about to step off the wooden pier he stopped and made a very strange noise, almost like he was choking on a breath of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clawed at his chest as he sank down onto his knees. His entire chest was burning like it was on fire. Bill's immediate thought was that he was having a heart attack, that the shock from falling into the contaminated had caused his heart to have problems. The burning grew more and more intense and he turned around trying to call out to Frank for help, but he couldn't get his voice to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each passing second the burning grew far more intense and it began spread down throughout his body, from his chest it spread up to his shoulders and down his arms, it pooled in his abdomen and spread down through his legs to his feet. The burning became so excruciating that Bill's eyes started blurring with tears before he felt his spine popped and suddenly, as if suddenly rediscovering his voice he cried out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hunched forward as he fell onto his hands, his arms quivering like they did after an intense workout, but this felt much more extreme. Suddenly he was aware of his muscles going through powerful spasms, inflating to their peak before shrinking back down, inflating again then shrinking over and over. The last time they inflated, it would like someone had punctured his biceps with an air pump and just kept pushing down on the level to add air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne inch, then two, then six, then eight massive inches exploded from his biceps. His eyes almost bulged out of their sockets as they gazed at the change happening to his body right before his very eyes. The growing didn't stop there, even as he drew his next breath he could see his chest starting to expand.  Every time he left out a breath, his chest grew a little more, straining against the clothes he wore which now felt like they were far too tight for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his shirt sticking to him so closely, he could see almost seen the veins in his chest popping right out of the skin beneath his fur. It was a breathtaking sight for sure. He never thought anything were possible, especially to him. When he felt that burning suddenly double in intensity in his gut and he pulled up his shirt so he could see his stomach and he almost fell over from the shock of watch his stomach contort and his abs writhing beneath his fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp, up, up went his abs as a new solid row of abs emerged from what was one smooth flesh and fur. The ridges between each row of abs grew deeper and more defined to the point he was sure he could actually grinding something to pieces against his stomach. It had been a long time since his abs had been that hard. The feeling of his immense power was exhilarating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the burning started bubbling up hotter than ever in his legs he had to lean fully on his new beefier arms for complete support. Even putting a little weight on his legs caused an intense amount of pain and he gasped out loud. His legs began to swell, slowly at first almost as if the change was testing his body to see how far it could go, before suddenly his thighs flared up and the muscle exploded in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud ripping sound as his pants started tearing apart from the growth. With his pants starts to fall off onto the wood below he could clearly see his now magnificently swollen thighs and calves. He didn't think he would ever manage to get them this huge, but there they were throbbing as the veins pumped blood through the grown muscles. As soon as the growth waned in his legs the burning stopped almost altogether and he fell forward, barely managing to roll himself over as his chest heaved in and out with great gasps of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new feeling was intoxicating, he could feel the hum of his muscles down to the very last striated band in his body. When his eyes gazed downward he spotted Frank grinning at him with one of the toothiest smiles he'd ever seen. He almost felt like giving him a punch for what he'd done, but in light of the changes that had just happened. he was willing to let this slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank approached Bill cautiously, even though he was happy to see his idol bigger and stronger than ever he was worried Bill might still be mad at him for pushing him into the water. When Frank stood directly over Bill his eyes widened as he took in the new muscles up close. It was far better than he could have ever hoped for. He looked bigger than he ever did before, even when he was younger.... wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Frank took a closer look, he realized that a lot of signs in Bill's body of age had disappeared, from the slight grey in his hair to the slight wrinkles he'd seen at the corners of his eyes, they'd completely vanished. Replaced with a lustrous shine in his hair and a wily look in the eyes of the Badger that he hadn't seen before. It was if the water had not only made him stronger, but it made him younger too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How are you feeling Bill? A... are you ok?\" Bill's eyes met his and for a long time he didn't say anything. Frank felt those nervous feelings starting to bunch up in the pit of his stomach before a smile spread over Bill's face and he laughed, a deep hearty laugh that sounded richer and more youthful than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel great kid. Like a million bucks.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill needed to take some time to look himself over. Every muscle that he had hoped to pump up on his own actually became bigger after all. In fact, even larger and heftier than he ever imagined! Just watching his muscles pulsate and throb from their recent growth spurt really excited the ol' badger. He raises one arm and flexes it, making his ubber bicep explode right before him. Frank was just as proud and happy for his best friend, seeing him flex and pose as many muscles he could. It was a quite a show, and Frank enjoyed it very much. \"So Bill, what do ya think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill pumps his beefy arm one more time before turning back towards the gator. \"Frank...this is incredible! I've never felt so built and strong in such a long time! I feel just like I did when I started going into the pro league.\" The bigger beast then wraps his arms around Frank's expansive frame, \"Thanks Frank. I can't thank you enough for this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank shrugs his broadened shoulders, \"Hey, I just can't bare to see my biggest idol be all sad and depressed like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill backs away from their hug. \"Heh. You're the only I ever came out to about my age and conundrum. Soon as I saw a big fellow like you enter the gym, I knew you had to be the guy who would take my place someday.\" He blasts his immense bi once again, \"Now that you introduced me to this, it may likely take much longer than ya think now.\", he chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all good with me. I'm just happy to learn from the best.\", Frank grins. \"So...what would you like to do right now? Wanna head back to your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill rubs his meaty paw over his mountainous pecs, \"Well, I am curious to see just how strong I am now. I'd love to punch that sandbag across the room, but I wanna make sure I can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure you can handle it.\", Frank encouraged. \"Though, if you want to make sure, there's a junkyard not too far from here. Maybe you can test out your strength there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good ta me!\" Bill holds up his fist, and then Frank does the same, bopping fists with each other. Minutes later, they entered a junkyard that was just chalk full of heavy metal. Metal from automobiles, scrapped buildings, you name it. To Bill, this seemed like the perfect spot to lift, and lift hard. \"Wow. Just look at all this junk.\" He performs a double-bicep pose for his friend, \"Can't wait ta see how much this body can take!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill first noticed a pile of I-beams sitting next to a broken down truck. Bill cracked his knuckles and knelt down to pick up the metal beam. Normally Bill would not even think of lifting something like an I-beam because he thought he was too old or not strong enough. With his new strength, Bill lifted it above his head with ease. He even tossed it from one hand to another. Bill even bent the beam against his huge and massive thigh. So far, his strength was unbeatable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill dropped the beam and then noticed the truck. He smiled thinking that truck would be easy to lift. Bill grabbed the bumper of the truck and began pulling it up against his massive chest. The truck was more challenging than the beam, but Bill managed to tip the truck over. He flexed his arms in victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his victory party was short lived when a broken down train cart caught his eye. As Bill made his way to it, Frank knew what he was trying to attempt. \"Uh...Bill,\" said Frank, \"Are you sure you can do that? I don't think even I could lift something that big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill didn't even acknowledge Frank's comment. He was too determined to move this train cart. Bill bent over and grab hold of the cart. The train cart was clearly the heaviest thing Bill ever tried to move. Frank saw Bill's arms swelling and throbbing under the stress. His biceps looked like they were going to burst but Bill continued trying to lift the cart. The two muscle men hear a slight creak from cart as Bill finally got the grip and leverage to tilt the cart slightly. After an incredible feat, Bill dropped the cart and then his giant body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank rushed to aid his newly muscled friend. \"You okay, Bill?\" asked Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill was on his back chuckling. \"I'm doing great, kid. I never, ever, thought that I would be able to lift a train cart before. Guess I overdid it a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank shook his head. \"No, you did great! It was stuff like this that made you my hero! I...I'm proud of you, Bill!\" Bill felt flattered but was too tired to blush. He just needed to lie where he was for a little while. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank offered his giant hand to Bill. The badger gladly accepted it and the alligator pulled Bill's giant weight with ease. \"You okay, Bill?\" asked Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill nodded. \"Yeah, I'm fine. Just overdid it.\" Bill looked at the train cart again. \"It was so great I could lift that up some! Would be even cooler if I could lift that thing up above my head!\" Bill let out a chuckle. \"Can you imagine?\" Frank then smirked at Bill. Frank had an idea that could make Bill lift that cart and give himself a nice \"workout.\" Frank pumped his arms in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go back to swamp if you want,\" said Frank. \"Another dip in there and you'll be the strongest badger ever! Besides, I feel like I feel like being pumped again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's eyes widened with happiness. \"Really? We can grow more?\" Frank nodded. Bill said, \"Well, as long as we don't look too big. I don't want to look like a giant muscle monster.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You won't as long as you don't stay in there for too long,\" assured Frank. \"I promise. Come on, I'll race you to the swamp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two tied as they raced to the swamp with their sculpted legs. They walked to the swamp along the harbor, making the wood tremble underneath their steps. Frank and Bill then looked at themselves in their reflections in the water. Bill couldn't believe how much muscle he had on now. He even let out a bicep flex to pleasure himself. \"Okay, on the count of three, we'll jump in and get out real quick so we'll grow only a bit more,\" said Frank. Bill nodded agreeing. \"One...two...three!\" The two jumped from the harbor and made giant splashes in the swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank and Bill felt the coolness of the water as they dove in and quickly raised themselves to the surface. The two then swam quickly back to the harbor. \"So, when does this start?\" asked Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes a while,\" said Frank. \"Give it a minute for your body to soak up the water. You'll get used to it. It's worth the wait. Besides, the growth itself feels pretty good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then felt it, the warmth deep in their cores that slowly grew intense and spread to their muscles. Bill knelt over while Frank continued standing ready to embrace the power growing within them. They felt their bones crack and shift making the titans grow a few more inches. The veins on their arms pulsated faster as their hearts raced. Their biceps grew stronger and powerful as the inches went by 2...4...7 inches. Their chests then broadened and widened making their pecs and abs thicker and bulgier. Both Frank and Bill could feel their pecs almost touching their chin. As their legs grew thicker than tree trunks, Bill grunted, \"You're right...this...feels...pretty good!\" The warmth slowly diminished and Frank and Bill regained their composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both slowly got back up on their feet, and then look at each other just to see how big they got. It wasn't a huge difference, but it was there. Their muscles all over had grown and look bigger, as well as gained a few more inches in height. Bill couldn't help but smirk at his pal, as well as at his own muscly frame. Bill raises one arm and flexes it, seeing his enlarged bicep sear up and rise with power. \"Incredible...\", Bill remarks at his bulging bi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank walks around to feel the badger's flexed bicep. \"Feels great, doesn't it?\", he grins brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea.\", Bill replies. \"Hey, let's head back to the junkyard!\" Before Frank could reply, Bill already speeds off on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank chuckles to himself, \"Hey, wait up!\" Getting back to the junkyard from the harbor took less time due to their stronger, thicker legs. Once Frank caught up to Bill at the junkyard, Bill was already trying his body out with the train cart, slowly lifting it off the ground. \"Whoa, Bill, be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank's jaw suddenly drops, as he watches Bill's pecs and arm muscles pump and plump out with sinewy power as he lifts it up even further, up to his neck height as a matter of fact. If Bill was wearing a shirt over his beefy frame, it would have ripped right off his shredded body. \"Don't worry, I got this now.\", he winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another good heave, the badger's legs start to fill out underneath and surged with great strength, while the ground beneath his feet starts to crack under all that weight. His shorts looked literally painted on now over his strapping thighs. Frank grew a little concerned though. \"Bill...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NNG... I told you...I got it.\", Bill assures, trying to insert a weak smile in there. And then, with one more great heave, Bill manages to lift his sinewy arms up, and lifted the train cart over his his head, \"YEAHHH!!\", he roars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank couldn't believe it. Seeing his idol in all his glory, lifting something he would have never imagined any could lift was a real treat! \"WOW! Way ta go Bill!\", Frank cheers. After almost of a minute of basking in his glory, Bill throws the train cart back and drops it to the ground. The bulging badger drops to his knees, feeling really exhausted. Frank ran to his side, \"Hey, you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill tries to smile at his best pal, \"Heh. Yeah. ...Maybe I wasn't big enough to lift that whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you just rest. You did an awesome job.\", Frank grins. The pumped gator then gets up to crack his knuckles. He hasn't necessary had his chance to show off and feel how much stronger he got.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So kid,\" said Bill between heavy breaths after his incredible feat, \"How strong are you now after our little swim?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Not sure,\" said Frank. \"I was too distracted by you to test my muscles out, but I'm ready to find out!\" Frank cracked his thick neck and smiled at Bill. Bill smiled back in approval waiting for Frank's next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank looked back at the train cart Bill just lifted. Frank was slightly bigger than Bill, so Frank assumed he would have been able to lift the train cart as well. However, he wanted to try something new, something different, something that would blow Bill's mind. Frank then saw the train cart was connected to another train cart right next to it. He then smiled knowing exactly what kind of mind-blowing feat he wanted to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank took the link between the carts and rested it on his neck. The alligator could feel the combined weight on his shoulders. The weight felt intense against Frank's body but that wasn't going to make Frank give up. Bill noticed this and figured out what Frank was trying to do. \"Umm, kid,\" said Bill, \"I know you're a bit bigger than me but don't you think that's a little too much for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout looking back at Bill, Frank hollered back, \"Don't worry, I got this.\" Frank then squatted to the bottom of the carts and placed both his hands underneath them. Frank began to pull, harder than he ever did before. The weight of two carts was clearly the heaviest Frank had ever lifted but refused to stop. Frank could feel his arms burn under the pressure. His biceps swelled larger and larger with veins grew thicker and thicker. He even felt burning in his vascular legs as they kept Frank's body stable under the intense stress. They also grew massive as Frank's clawed feet sunk slightly under the ground. Frank let out a soft growl and attempted a heave only to have the carts move upwards slightly. He kept pushing the carts as high as he could making his chest more defined and bulged. Frank began to growl louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid, it's too much! You're going to hurt yourself!\" said Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can...do this!\" Frank did one final heave and yelled, \"Urrraaagh!\" With all the muscles in his body swelled to new peaks, Frank lifted the two connecting train carts above his head. Frank saw this incredible feat he performed and smiled happily to himself. He just did the impossible. He felt like a super powered gator! After holding it for a few more seconds, Frank let go of the carts. Despite his amazing performance, Frank only felt a little worn out, not as exhausted as Bill was after his lift. Frank pumped his arms in victory and pride and returned back to Bill. \"So, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill had his mouth open the whole time. Who eyes couldn't believe what they had just witnessed. It was incredible! Especially seeing the gator's muscles noticeably bulge and throb out on his shredded frame. Frank was waiting patiently for a reply, but got nothing but awe and surprise. He then walks over to the badger's side, Bill's face still frozen as he watches the muscular behemoth sit right beside him. \"Ah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank closes the awestruck badger's mouth, \"Come on man, can't stand watching you stare at me like that.\", he snickers uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill then wraps his hands over Frank's still-pulsating arm, primarily his bulky bicep and tricep. \"Dude... You sure you're not made up of metal or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank smiles, \"Nope!\" He then flexes for his immense arm for his idol, \"All natural. Aside from the swamp of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are one crazy musclefreak, bro.\", he laughs. \"Honestly, I didn't think you were gonna make it. Then I'd end up having to clean you up from under then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank nudges Bill against his sides, \"Hey, told ya I can do it!\" He then pumps his other arm to watch it swell with power, then gives his peaking bi a kiss. \"I'm not even that tuckered out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Really? Heh.\" Bill crosses his arms over his thick chest, \"Think you can impress me some more?\", he challenges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank hopes back up to his feet. \"Sit there and watch.\" Doesn't look like Bill could do much else anyway. Frank walks up to a nearby wrecked car. It was pretty average sized, but good enough for what Frank wanted to do next. The energized reptile holds up his rugged arms, and then throws them down to sinks his fingers into the roof of the car. Sinking his thick clawed-toes into the ground as he gets into position, his muscles all shred and expand from the calves up to his neck. He starts ripping the junked car apart with his arms, while giving the badger a good show of his chiseled, flexing frame. His pecs swelled out and shriveled apart with his pulsating arms and shoulders as the car was almost in two pieces. His thick tail even seemed to start throbbing, and manages to flex it like it was a third arm. Frank's growling and gritting of his teeth only got louder and more intense, until he gives his rippling body a good heave and... \"RRRAUGH!!!\" The car is now in two pieces, being thrown away from each other in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank pants a bit, letting his beef-up body breathe for a bit. \"Ugh...YEAH!\", he roars proudly, thumping his chest with his fist. He then sits himself to Bill's side once again, even sweater than he was before. \"Okay, now I'm tuckered out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill frowns. \"......Okay, NOW you're just showing off.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank sat down on the ground feeling exhausted now. Bill sat down next to him comforting his friend. Although Bill was very proud of Frank and his incredible performance, Bill couldn't shake off the sense of jealousy in the pit of his gut. Bill was able to lift one cart above his head but that alone was a challenge. Frank, on the other hand, lifted not one but two carts as if they were nothing. Frank even had enough energy to tear a car apart. Bill may have been happy for Frank but the badger craved even more power, enough power to be as strong as his young gator friend.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFrank let out a large yawn. \"You know, I think's time we call it a day and get some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill nodded agreeing. \"Yeah, I think we all could use some rest, that is, if your is big enough to sleep on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank got up chuckling. \"Yeah, right. How about we train tomorrow at your place? I don't think people are ready to see a massive gator and badger yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably so. Okay, sounds like a plan!\" The two walked out of the junkyard and went their ways to their homes. However, Bill had one more errand to make before he went home: the swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill found himself once again walking along the harbor towards the swamp. He didn't waste any time. This time Bill just rushed to the end of the harbor and jumped into the water. Bill swam through the murkiness for a solid 5 minutes before pulling himself up back to shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the worst part: waiting. Bill anxiously tapped his foot waiting for the intoxicating sensation to occur. Just when his patience was about to run out, Bill felt the familiar warmth in his gut and smiled. Even though the change was intense, Bill didn't feel any pain; he just felt power pouring into his body. He remained standing as his growth began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's heart began to pump rapidly as his bones shifted and cracked to make him taller and make room for more muscle. He felt his heart beating through his veins as his biceps grew even larger and rounder. Bill didn't know how big they were getting but he assumed another 10 inches. He then puffed out his chest as his pecs were growing bigger than pillows and almost touching his chin. Below them his abs swelled more outward. Bill could even feel another row of abs forming giving him a ten pack. As for his legs, they grew stronger than redwood tree trunks. As his thighs and calves expanded into even larger proportions, Bill stomped his foot on the harbor out of pure pleasure making the harbor shake underneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill then felt his body cool down and he smiled looking down at his muscled body. He flexed a bicep that grew to a peak similar to Frank's. He then rubbed his pecs and abs to feel the warmth and power that slept inside. Bill was now at the same size and strength as Frank. After a few poses, Bill said, \"I think I'm ready for a rematch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Frank felt very energized and well-rested. He wasted no time getting to Bill's place for another day of training in his tight tank-top and shorts. He knocks on the door (even though his knocks sound like pounding now), and awaits for his badger friend to answer. As soon as the door swings open, he holds up his hand to greet his friend, \"Good mornin' Bill! ...Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill, wearing only a pair of shorts over his plump thighs, does the same to greet the once-bigger reptile. \"He-hey, morning big guy.\" Bill puts on a big grin. Frank couldn't help but the badger's size into question. \"What? Notice somethin'?\", he snickers, lifting up his bulky arm to flex it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look...a little bigger than when we took off yesterday.\" Frank then frowns. \"Did you take a dip in the swamp with my knowing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I? In court?\", he chuckles. Frank crosses his arms. \"Alright, yeah. Ya got me. I was a little jealous, alright? Just wanted to be as big as you.\" Bill shows the gator inside, then closing the door behind them. \"Come on, let's head to the training room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering inside, Frank sets his gym bag on a bench. \"You could have told me you wanted to grow again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? So you can grow again too? I think you've done enough 'growing'.\", he smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should say the same to you.\", Frank pouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, there was another reason I wanted to grow too.\", Bill adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill then walks up to the alligator, looking him in the eye, \"For a rematch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was kinda unexpected for Frank, but he like the sound of that. \"You're on!\" They both sprint to enter the ring. Bill stands on one side while Frank stands on the other, and then tugs of his tank to toss aside out of the ring. They both stared each other down, but Frank rolls his beefy arms and then pumps his pecs. \"I'm ready when you are, old man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill snorts, not liking the sound of that. \"Alright kiddo. ...DING-DING!\" Both muscle monsters run towards each other, interlocking their hands and fingers the moment they make contact. Their arms expand and shred from the amount of strength power out of each other's veins. \"Heh... Now THIS is what I call an even match!\", Bill grunts. Now it wasn't a matter of strength, but skill. Bill manages to turn Frank's hands downwards to the floor as he gains the upper hand, then throws Frank's arms aside as he's left with an opening to Frank's abdomen. Bill rummages towards Frank as he wraps his rippling arms around Frank's stomach and slams him back against a pillar of the ring. \"Hah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof...!\" That hurt. Not much, but it was enough to leave Frank immobilized for the moment. \"Ow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill then wraps an arm around the gator's neck in a hulking sleeper hold. It wasn't Bill's official hold, but one that could keep Frank from doing anything to free himself as Bill's thickened muscles flex and pump around Frank's head. \"Heh. How's this coming from an 'old man'?\" Frank tries his best to free himself, but felt as if he were to pass out. He then pounds his hand against the ring floor, showing he was giving in. Bill soften his grip a bit, then gives his young friend a noogie on his head. \"Alright, alright. Don't be calling me an 'old man' again, or else I'll put you to sleep for sure.\"</span></div></div>",

After growing, lifting, and fighting, I'm ready to take it easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank nodded. \"Yeah, I could use a swim in non-magical dirty water.\" The two headed into the backyard where Frank saw a massive pool full of clean and crisp water with a decent sized hot tub on the side. Bill smiled as he saw Frank's mouth drop at the size of the pool and hot tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank started to make his way to the hot tub and Bill followed. As the two dipped themselves into the boiling warm water, they took a deep breath out. They could feel the water seeping into their flesh without worry of growing any bigger and all their other worries disappeared. Frank just sunk down to where only his head was visible. Bill laughed at the site. \"Feel better, kid?\" he asked. Frank just nodded in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments just soaking up the water with their gigantic muscles, Bill decided it was time to talk. \"So, kid, tell me more about yourself. What were you like before you found the swamp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank sat back up a little surprised. Nobody ever asked him for personal information before. Nobody ever wanted to talk to him. Frank took some pride into that now that he was big but would Bill still like him after telling him? He wasn't sure, but Frank has been honest with him so far. It wouldn't be fair if he stopped now. \"Well,\" Frank started, \"I was...a bit of a wimpy loner. I didn't really have any friends while I was growing up. To be honest, the only thing I liked about my life, was you. Ever since I saw you fight for the first time, I thought you were amazing. I never missed a fight. I even wanted to be like you. So, I trained to be a fighter like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's eyes widened not realizing how big of a fan Frank was to him. \"Really? I'm flattered. What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I trained as hard as I could by myself but couldn't get any results. I was always down on myself. The only thing that made me feel better was a swim through the swamp. Everyone thought it was weird but it just felt so natural to me. I can't explain. It's funny though. Before, the swamp didn't make me grow when I swam in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How does it make you big now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea. I never found that out. Though I'm not complaining.\" Frank flexed a meaty bicep to Bill playfully. \"So what's your story, Bill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you already know that?\", Bill jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant with you became a fighter and all that.\", Frank clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill laughs. \"Ah, how I came to be you're asking. I'd have to say I kinda started out the same way you did. I had a beloved wrestling idol of my own. His name was Albert \"Finn\" Hyde. The Finn was his wrestler name because he was well-known for being a top-notch shark with a killer trademark move that he uses his fin for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...think I've heard of him once. I think from my dad. He used to always talk about wrestlers from the old days, and I think his name came up once or twice.\", Frank adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say.\", Bill replies. \"Well, I fell in love with the guy and his moves when I was very young, because he played by the rules. Just like me! Even back then there was some no-good, two-timing wrestlers who played dirty, but he was always there to set 'em straight. I met him only once in person. I was just a kid entering my teens, and I managed to save up so my parents could take me to a wrestling match between him and another wrestler for the final match of the season. His opponent played it rough throughout the whole game, and I was always there yelling back at him. At one point in the match, just as his opponent was about to knock him out with a chair, which wasn't allowed of course, I ended up screaming at the top of my lungs, 'LOOKOUT'.\", Bill suddenly screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Ahem. He must have heard me, caused he dodged the chair like a bullet, and then managed to punch his opponent's lights out with a good punch to the face. And he won. The crowd was leaving and so were my parents, but I wanted to stay. I wanted to take in as much time I could just sitting in awe of my greatest idol. Suddenly, he turns to look at me, sitting by myself in the stands, and walks over to greet. He asked if it was me who called out to him, and just nodded my head, because my voice was kinda gone after that. He even thanked me for that warning, 'cause he would have been hurt really bad if not for ducking that chair. He also gave me his autograph on a picture we took together after the match. And to this day, it's what gave me the confidence to train hard and become one of the best, honest wrestlers today. The swamp is just an added bonus.\", he chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\", Frank awes, loving the story. \"You still have the photo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! It's right there.\", Bill points out to the wall behind Frank. In the middle of a few photos and other awards he won, was a framed photo of him as a youngling being picked up by Albert as they both smiled for the camera. And on the bottom was Albert's wrestling signature. \"Brought tears to my eyes that night, tell ya what. Hm? Are...you crying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sniff' \"I, just got something in my eye!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank then pictured what it must have been like to see Albert fight. He knew the shark was a good, even legendary, but Frank never knew how he fought. He had to admit, it would have been interesting to have seen that fight with Bill. Frank then remembered all the fights that Bill was in and how great it was. Bill must have felt like Frank when Bill watched Albert fight. Frank was curious. He wanted to know more about this fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Bill,\" said Frank, \"How was Albert as a fighter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill then went into every detail on everything there was know about his personal hero, his fighting style, his strength, his honor, and his moves. Frank could see Bill was very excited to talk about this amazing shark. Frank could relate. He knew he would do the same thing if someone ever asked him about Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want, kid, I have some old videos of Albert's matches,\" said Bill. \"I can show them to you if you want.\" Frank thought that would be interesting. Seeing a fighter that even Bill looked up to must be good. Frank agreed excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two got out of the hot tubs and dried off. Frank took a spot on Bill's giant couch as Bill made his way into the kitchen. Bill sat next to Frank on the couch with a bucket of popcorn. Frank looked a bit puzzled and Bill said, \"Trust me, the show's worth it!\" The badger then got out an old video and put it into the TV. Bill smiled anxiously waiting for the video to start. Frank couldn't help but chuckle a little thinking Bill looked like a kid in a candy store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video started out with a giant ring and two fighters in opposing corners of it. One fighter was a giant muscular shark and the other was big strong hippo. The fighters glared and gritted at each other as if they were going to strangle each other until the bell rang. The two ran at each other and locked hands. Almost immediately, the shark grabbed the hippo and lifted him up in the air above the sharks head. Both Frank and Bill smiled excitedly at the scene and their grins grew wider as the shark slammed the hippo to the ground. The shark won the match instantly. Frank admitted to himself that Albert was a really good fighter, probably one of the best right next to Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank dipped his hand down and grabbed some popcorn, tossing it into his mouth without even looking. His eyes were glued to the television as the next match was about to start The camera shirted towards the left as Albert began making his way across the walkway that led up to the mat accompanied by a roaring crowd cheering for him and chanting his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he stepped into the ring the camera swiveled around to the other side of the arena as the announcer started announcing his challenger. Immediately Bill grabbed Frank's arm as the name was called out. \"This is one of my favorite matches!\" Frank almost laughed at how childlike Bill seemed now. It was so much different to how he was before. Not only did he look younger, but he acted like it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Frank could think more, Bill shook his arm and pointed as the second wrestler came out. This wrestler was a very muscular Lion who had quite a few fans of his own in the arena who were screaming out his name in excitement. The way he walked you could tell he was very confident he would be victorious. He took his time, strutting forward, the lights shining down on him as his fur gleamed with a light layer of sweat that made his large muscles seem even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion took the opportunity to stop and give a bicep flex with his left arm as he looked up at Albert a grin on his face as if he knew he could beat Albert. \"That guy is always a showoff no matter who his opponent is.\" Bill had a big grin etched on his face as the lion climbed into the ring and took his corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bell rang out the shark and the lion ran head on for a collision. Albert went in for a headlock while the lion wrapped his mighty arms around Albert's waist, prevent him from getting a real grip on his neck by making him on able to  bend over to hold him. This power struggle continued on for a couple more minutes until Albert let go of the lion's neck, only to push the lion's hands down and to wrap his arms about the lion's waist and lift him upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd went ballistic as the lion struggled to get free as Albert body slammed him into the mat with a loud resounding thud. The lion's body went rigid as he swept his feet against Albert's leg before he managed to get up and shove him down onto the ground, trying to pin the shark's arms down so he couldn't break free before the countdown was up, but Albert wasn't going down that easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swift jerk of his arms he caught the lion off guard, knocking him flat on his back as Albert sprang up on his feet just as the bell sounded for the end of the first round. Each wrestler went back to his corner to towel off and get a drink of water before turning back to face his opponent. When the bell sounded they went at it again. Their arms locked, biceps and triceps exploding with vascular definition as each one tried to gain dominance over the other. Frank could only watch with a growing excitement as the two struggled and fought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see why Bill held Albert in such high regard, in addition to be extremely muscular, one of the biggest wrestlers out there, he was also extremely skilled with his wrestling techniques. It wasn't until the third round did Albert finally get the upper hand over the lion. You could tell this was a hard match for both of them. Their chests were heaving in and out as sweat gleamed over their bodies as they charged at each other again. This time the lion was the one who tried for the headlock, but Albert wasn't having that at all and he immediately wrapped his arms around the chest of the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment there it seemed like they were going to struggle for dominance again, but Albert took a different stance than what the lion had before. Sliding a leg between the lion's legs and he lifted back, using the Lion's forward moment as he pushed against Albert to lift him up into the air and flip the lion behind him, body slamming him right into the mat and this time the lion did not move, having struck his head against the mat first, he seemed very disoriented and wasn't able to get back up this time. Albert whirled around as he pinned the lion down with his knees and held down the lion's arms as he feebly tried to push Albert off. Each second passed by so slowly, Frank and Bill were practically on the edge of their seats as they watched the video along with the crowd who'd been there waiting with bated breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bell rang at the count of ten, the entire arena erupted into a roar that could have blown out the speakers on the tv. It was loud enough to actually rattle the glass on the windows as Bill hopped up cheering with as much gusto as the people who were at the arena when that match had happened.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank was filled with adrenaline after match. Even if it was on the TV, and recorded in the past. \"That was awesome!\", Frank yells. I didn't even know a few of those moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can teach you them, if ya like.\", Bill smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can? Great!\" Frank hops right out of his seat, excitedly punching the air a couple times. Bill was pretty impressed with the alligator's passion for wrestling. \"You wanna get started? Sorry if I'm rushing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill gets up out of his seat. \"It's fine. That was a relaxing watch, so I'm ready for some muscle-pumping myself.\" With that, the two weight-lifters made it to Bill's training in no time. First thing they both did was step inside the badger's training ring. \"Now, I may be easy on you the first few times, but I'm actually gonna put ya down hard if you don't pay attention after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the heads up, but I can handle.\", Frank grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" For his first move, Bill spreads his legs and his arms as he readies his stance. \"Now, come at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank blinks his eyes. \"Just, run up towards you?\" The badger nods his head in response. \"Well, alright.\" The bulging gator takes a few steps forward, and then throws his arms at Bill's so that their fingers and palms interlocked. Their arm muscles started to bulge out and expand as they were trying to hold one-another down. \"Nng... You know Bill...nng...I kinda already know about this move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not his this. This!\" With that, Bill suddenly rolled Frank's palms upside down, catching the enlarged reptile by surprise. \"You were focusing too much about holding your opponent down. You gotta be ready for when they can turn your moves against you. Like so.\" Bill turns Frank's palms back around and pushes them down. Frank lets out a disgruntled roar of pain as he drops to his knees. After a moment, the badger lets his upstart free. \"There you go. Sorry if I was too hard on ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank puffs out his rippled chest. \"Nah, it's cool. Just left my hands twinging. That was a good move though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember you gotta think about yourself, not just your opponent.\", Bill winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha,\" said Frank. \"Any other moves you can show me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill smiled. \"Yeah, I got one more. Come at me again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank once again spread out his arms and legs in a wrestling stance and let out a soft growl to Bill before charging him head on. As Frank was running, Bill didn't do anything. He just stood there as if he was waiting for the monstrous alligator. Frank wrapped his rippling arms around Bill's thick waist. Frank smiled think he got the upper hand. \"Looks like I got you!\" said Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill just chuckled under Frank's grip. \"You sure?\" Bill wrapped his own arms around Frank and heaved him up in the air. The giant badger then titled back where the two met the ground. Before Frank could recollect what just happened, Bill turned him over. Frank was now on the ground with Bill pinning him there. \"It's called 'the grand amplitude throw.'\" said Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..you hurt yourself...to get to me?\" asked Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill nodded. \"Yeah, sometimes you need to beat yourself up in order to win. It's important that you use your size and weight to your advantage. Focus on yourself. Remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank felt even more excited than when he first started his training. With these new moves he thought he could take down any fighter and he was ready for anything or anyone that could come his way. \"Yeah, I understand,\" said Frank.</span></div></div>",

He never did like riding in a car, he always got sick watching the scenery speeding by so quickly. When the road finally straightened out Frank took in a sigh of relief before he felt a large hand pat his shoulder. \"You ok kid?  You don't seem like you're feeling too good. Do you want me to head back? we can always go another time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank shook his head before he gave his stomach a small pat. \"I am ok. It's just I get car sick easily. Honest I'll b e okay when we get there.\" Bill nodded his head as he popped on his turn signal and began making his way off the main road and down a side road, stretching out for quite a ways on both sides sat a white sand beach with a beautiful blue ocean. Frank's eyes were glued to the water, his tail thumbing against the back seat, making Bill laughing out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really excited huh? We'll be there in a couple minutes, just try to control hat tail of yours!\" A small blush spread over Frank's cheeks as he gave a sheepish grin, trying to stop his tail from thumping the back seat too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that\" Bill only shook his head, the smile not leaving his face as the car swung around into a large parking lot with quite a few cars already parked. As Bill turned in to one of the few spaces left, Frank was already fumbling with the car door to get out before Bill grabbed his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy champ! Or you'll rip the door right off! The ocean isn't going anywhere.\" Bill chuckled as Frank smile abashedly as he unlocked the door and stepped out, stretching his arms up behind his head, feeling the stiff joints slowly stretching out and working themselves loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we get any bigger you're gonna need another car. I felt really cramped in there.\" As bill slid out of the car he nodded, patting the hood of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea. Well it was just the right size for me until you came along, now i'm a few sizes bigger. so it might be time to get a new car for sure, but I can worry about that later. For now let's head out to the beach. I am excited to take a dip.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two musclemen make their way onto the hot sand. Seeing the amount of beach-goers was pretty nice. They were already catching eyes of a couple folks as they walked straight towards the water. The moment the waves hit their toes, they both look at each other and then the small group of people watching them from behind. Most of them were astounded by their muscular size; Bill's mainly since he was thought to be smaller than he is now. Frank pats Bill on his broad shoulder, \"Hey, how about a quick dip first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill shrugs his shrugs his shoulders, \"Hey, fine with me. Won't wanna keep these guys waiting too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pals run into the water, until their enormous calves were covered by the water. They then take a giant leap into the water, leaving a huge splash in their tracks. They both merely lay around underwater for a short moment, letting the water soak their sinewy frames as they relaxed. After a minute, with the help of the swamp increasing their sizes of course, they both reappear over the open waters, and then swam back to shore. The moment their beefy bodies reemerged out of the water, the people watching them were even more surprised with what they see. After a glance at each other's smirking face, they both start displaying their veiny bods for public eyes to see, each doing their own bodybuilding poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of people weren't just impressed, they were overwhelmed with excitement for the flexing duo. Frank and Bill rolled their bodies into distinct positions to make their muscles look like pulsating boulders. As the muscle men tensed their bodies, the audience awed to see their muscles swell to massive proportions. They never saw muscles look so big and strong. Frank looked at his bicep and admired the strength inside it. He felt like he was in the swamp again as he tensed harder to make it bigger. To Bill, the show reminded him of the his early years as a fighter. He would show off to people after he would fight and now he's doing it again, bigger, stronger, and better than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank and Bill finish their show with an epic pose leaving the crowd going wild. They then relaxed and walked to find a spot on the beach. \"I see why you like the beach,\" said Bill smiling. Frank didn't say anything. He just blushed while rubbing the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was quite the show!\" The muscle duo turned around to find a well muscled orca whale standing in front of them. The whale was about a foot shorter than Frank and Bill with a six pack on his chest. Clearly he was no where near as strong as Frank and Bill, but Bill could see the whale was still very strong and had well-shaped muscles to prove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Bill. \"Glad you liked it. By the look of it, I'd say you like to show off yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whale chuckled a little. \"I guess. I just work out because I want be a big bodybuilder. Clearly I still got some way to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, kid,\" said Bill, \"Just keep at it and you'll be as big as us. I'm sure!\" The badger then held out his meaty hand to the whale. \"I'm Bill. The gator over here is Frank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whale took Bill's hand and shook it. \"I'm Lucas. Nice to meet you!\"</span></div></div>",

He had never seen anyone that big before and it motivated him even more to train harder so he could get bigger and stronger. Lucas reminded Frank of himself before he grew the first time. Lucas looked like they could be the same age but was able to build more muscle than Frank could before the swamp. Just by looking at his body and behavior, Frank knew Lucas was a decent fellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you guys want, I packed a few extra snacks at beach spot,\" said Lucas. \"You're more than welcome to join me.\" Bill and Frank had to admit they were a bit hungry after their swim and show, so they happily joined their new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas led the two giants to a big blue towel laying on the sand with a cooler on top of it. Lucas took a seat and pulled out a couple of drinks for Frank and Bill. Frank and Bill took a seat on the towel making the ground shake underneath Lucas. He was a bit surprised but also amazed. The whale couldn't help but be envious their incredible muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say, you two are something!\" said Lucas. \"I never thought anyone could get this big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill took a gulp of his drink and chuckled. \"You can with the right motivation!\" He then flexed a bicep to Lucas. The bicep swelled with power ready to perform an incredible feat of strength as if it was teasing Lucas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of motivation,\" said Frank, \"What's your story, Lucas? Why did you become a bodybuilder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I still got some years of training left before I start competing in bodybuilding competitions. But what really got me started was watching the best bodybuilder of all time: Reginald Thompson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I heard of that guy,\" said Bill taking another gulp. \"He's that giant bear that tilted a tank over, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas nodded. Frank widened his eyes. A bear tilting a tank over? Reginald would have to be a big strong bear to do something like that. Frank was impressed to hear such a feat was accomplished. Lucas continued, \"Yeah, he was my hero when I was a kid. So, I decided I wanted to train hard be as big as he is...maybe bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill chuckled. \"That's the spirit! I like it! Say, I know a few pointers myself and I've been sharing them with Frank. If you want, I can help you with your training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas eyes and mouth widened. \"Wh...what? Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It'll be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be amazing! I would love to! Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" Bill walks over into a white square with certain weights and equipment in the middle, Frank and Lucas following behind. The first thing the badger picks up is a rather large dumbbell, 250 pounds to be exact. Lucas was amazed how easily Bill was holding the two weights up in his arms. \"I usually start with working out my arms. The idea is to start slow until you can get into pain-and-gain mode.\", Bill grins. Lucas watches eagerly as Bill starts slowly pumping his shredded arms with the weights. It wasn't long until his biceps were just searing up with blood and veins. Frank was pretty impressed himself, watching Bill's arms being pumped to the max. After his fiftieth rep Bill slowly lowers his shriveled arms, \"Ahhh... Feels great. Whatcha think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I just don't have the words. Your arms just look amazing!\", Lucas yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's some.\", Bill chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man... I'm just hyped up ta see what you'll do next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Bill eyes is a benching equipment. \"Well, here's an idea.\" Bill simply walks up and lies on the benching equipment and places both hands on the bar. \"Same process, just watch.\" The badger gets started without hesitation, lifting the bar off its resting place and slowly starts pumping his chest and arms. Lucas was in utter shock at how much Bill's pecs were rising up and down, and how his arms plumped. He never checked, but the badger must have been lifting at least 600 pounds. Bill's pumping speeding was starting to increase a bit, \"Yeah...!\", he grunts. \"The moment you get comfortable with your body and the weights, it'll feel like you're getting even stronger from within.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fish just kept his mouth agape, staring intently into Bill's 35-inch pythons. Frank snickers as he slowly inches his maw close to Lucas's, \"He's already at his 30th rep by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only a few minutes more for Bill to reach just over fifty reps. The throbbing badger sets the bar back into its resting place with a loud grunt, \"AH! There we go... How was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas wipes his mouth. \"Sorry man, I'm drooling. I think that says it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank looks up behind them, \"Hey, look who it is.\"</span></div></div>",

Frank just smiled knowing Erika was shy but happy to see him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Frank,\" said Erika, \"I thought it was you so I thought I'd come and say hello. Is it my imagination or did you get bigger the last time I saw you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank chuckled making his chest ripple which made Ericka's face redder. \"Yeah, well, I've been hitting the weights harder than usual thanks to my buds here.\" Frank then teasingly flexed his bicep to Erika. Erika was amazed to see his arm swell to a size bigger than her own head! She could also see veins throbbing across his arm that feed his body more power. Without even asking permission, Erika placed her hand on Frank's bicep and rubbed it. She could feel the warmth of his strength emitting from his scales as if Frank's bicep was a volcano ready to erupt with power. Erika then realized what she was doing and quickly brought her hand back to herself. Frank, and Erika's friends couldn't help but laugh.  \"I'm...I'm sorry,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank waved his hand. \"Don't worry. I was about to ask you if you wanted to feel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill leaned over to Lucas, who was admiring the girls talking to Frank about his muscles, and said, \"Now that's how you pick up girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill and Lucas walked toward the crowd and the girls were even more excited to see more muscular guys coming to see them. Frank introduced them to the girls. \"Nice to meet you guys,\" said Erika. She pointed to her wolf friend, \"This is Leah,\" then pointed to the rabbit, \"And this Becky.\" Bill approached Leah talking and showing off to the wolf girl and Lucas talked to rabbit trying to impress her with the muscles he already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank smiled at Erika and then to his muscle friends. \"Say guys, I think these fine ladies came by to see a show. Why don't we give them one?\" Bill and Lucas grinned at the idea of posing show for the ladies. Lucas was exceptionally excited because he wanted to practice his bodybuilding routines more and women always made the perfect audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great!\" said Bill<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do it!\" said Lucas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three manly fellows stood proudly as if they were in a bodybuilding competition. Frank goes first, lifting both his lengthy arms up against his head, letting his guns show off how large and solid they were. He even shows off his chest and abdomen as he gives a wink out to Erika. Bill kneels down on one knee and then flexes one arm up and flexes the other arm down while puffing out his chest. Lucas stretches out one leg, swelling out his quads, and then does a side chest while swelling out his pecs as well. Their three-count audience were indeed happy with what they see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas let's a proud smile, showing off his sharp teeth, and then goes to his next pose, flexing one arm out and raising his other arm behind his head to make his lats stick out. Bill and Frank looked at each other, and then decided to follow sue. Seems better if they did the same pose together. Lucas turns his upper body around to do a back double-bi, and watches how the three ladies enjoy the show, not even noticing that his two pals were doing the same. He was about to perform another pose, but then finally takes notice of the two and how they were playfully mimicking him. \"Whoa...\" He saw know that the girls seemed more enamored with how Frank's and Bill's muscles rippled apart with their bulky, brawny frames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas decides to do one more pose, and it was a most muscular. The muscles on his back and arms swelled apart fairly well on his shorter frame. Definitely impressed Frank and Bill both, as they watched how hard his body was being flexed, how thick and meaty his arms were getting with his pulsating veins. He got a lot of attention from the three ladies too. Frank and Bill looked at each other with smiles on their faces, and then they lift up their beefy arms to do the same. If they were wearing a tank top it would have torn right off their overly-muscled frames, as their rippling back and traps rose up, their shoulders and arms swelling out greatly, their chests and legs filling out down below to make their herculean frames really show off their stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ladies clap and yell out proudly. Erika runs up to hug Frank's head, \"Wow! That's amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad ya liked it.\", Frank winks, relaxing his throbbing frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so much fun! Thanks you two for the show. Oh, and you too Lucas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orca puts on a weak smile, \"Yeah. Sure thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika and her friends take off but not before waving their goodbyes to the muscular trio. Frank nudges Bill on his side, \"I think Leah was starting to like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Yeah, sure.\", Bill laughs. He then looks over to Lucas, \"Nice job back there, man. Hm?\"</span></div></div>",

Bill and I were following you every step of the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what about the girls?\" said Lucas. \"You saw them. They were more focused on you guys because you're twice my size.\" Frank looked back and remembered the girls looking at him and Bill and no eyes on Lucas. The whale was right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, bro,\" said Frank. \"We didn't mean to hog all the attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault,\" said Lucas. \"You can't help yourself being big. I...I just got a long way to go till anyone notices me and my muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get there,\" said Bill with his hand on the whale's shoulder. \"We all did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it'll take me years to compare myself to you.\" Lucas took a deep breath. \"I'm sorry. I'm just a little frustrated. I've been training for a long time now and it seems like it's not enough despite the results I have now.\" Lucas sighed depressingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill walked over to Frank and whispered, \"Think he needs a dip in the swamp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank's heart sunk. Was Bill serious? Another person knowing the swamp? Bill had to be kidding. \"What?\" said Frank. \"You want him to use the swamp? We just met the kid! How do you know we can trust him? What makes you think he won't tell anyone about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill smiled and said, \"Because he reminds me of you.\" Frank then looked back at Lucas. Bill was right. Lucas tried so hard to improve himself finding little to no results from it, just like Frank did before the swamp. Frank sighed and agreed with Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Lucas,\" said Bill, \"I forgot to give you one more pointer. Follow me and I'll show you.\" Frank and Bill then led Lucas out of the beach and brought him to the swamp. During their trip, the muscle duo told the young whale everything about the magic swamp. At first, Lucas didn't believe them but his curiosity was still lingering on how they got so big. Maybe he gave them a benefit of a doubt because he hoped it was true. Before too long, Frank, Bill, and Lucas walked on the harbor of the swamp and looked down at the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you guys got big just by swimming in this dirty swamp?\" asked Lucas. Frank and Bill answered with a nod. \"No offense, guys, but this is a little too hard to believe. I draw the line in swimming in a swamp. I don't want to get sick or...\" Before he could finish his sentence, Lucas was picked up by Frank. Lucas felt incredibly light to Frank but Frank knew it wouldn't be the case for long. Frank raised Lucas over his head and tossed him into the murky depths of the swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to Lucas being an aquatic creature, he swap back up in no time. \"What the heck Frank!?\" He then swims up to the harbor and picks his mucky frame out of the water. \"Yuck... This stuff is gross...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel anything yet?\", Bill asks, lowering his head in front of the whale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas just wipes the swamp water off of his body, \"No. Except, my arm is starting to hurt a bit.\" Actually his arm was starting to tense, and grow! His eyes open wide as he watches his left arm twinge and expand right before him. \"Urgh..! What in the world...?\", he grunts as his arm bulges out even more. His other throbs out too, starting to inflate and swell out with his growing body. His pecs blast out next, filling up more and more to match his arms. His abs start to pop out by row on his stomach, even giving the fish a fourth set of abs. His bones starting popping and growing to add height to his figure. His back ripples apart and makes the V-shape appear more prominent and defined with his body. He stumbles up to his feet, feeling his upper body muscles pulsate nicely as he held out his veiny arms. The last of course where Lucas's legs, which started to inflate and turn his thighs into tree trunks. His calves explode out underneath to finish off his growth spurt, though the pleasurable sensation Lucas got in return still stuck around for a bit. \"Nng...!\", the enlarged well grunts, \"This...this is incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank walks up to pat Lucas on his broadened shoulder, his muscles still throbbing from his growth, \"told ya. What do you think of your new body now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas watches as he flexes his arm, watching it rise higher than he ever thought before and feeling pumped with power. \"It's, this is, it's great!\" Lucas proudly sticks his arms out in one direction, felling his plump muscles swell out with his body. \"I never thought I'd get this big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our pleasure.\", Bill replies happily. He even rubs down Lucas's bicep as he flexes his arm for show once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys...I don't know what to say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank pats Lucas once again, \"You don't have to say anything, long as you keep this a secret and just between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Don't want the public taking notice of this special swamp.\", Bill adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas just puts on a big grin. \"No problem!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucas couldn't believe what just happened. He just took a dip into a swamp that gave him the body he worked so hard to achieve. He felt stronger and powerful than he ever felt before. However he looked at Frank and Bill again. The gator and badger were still bigger than the young bodybuilding whale. Lucas hated to admit it but he wanted more power. He wanted to be as powerful as Frank and Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys,\" started Lucas, \"This is truly amazing and I appreciate you doing this, but would it be okay if I tried getting as big as you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill laughed out loud. \"I knew that was coming! Of course, man! You're more than welcome to go in again. Just don't get too big...or else Frank and I will try to match you!\" They all laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Lucas. \"Wish me luck!\" Lucas dived into the waters again. After about half a minute, Lucas jumped out of the water and landed on the harbor. Instead of washing off the water off his body, Lucas embraced it hoping every ounce of water got soaked up in his muscles. Then he waited. \"Waiting's the worst part,\" he said to Frank and Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" said Frank, \"But it'll be worth it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lucas felt a punch in his stomach. Something felt warm deep in his core and began to spread to the rest of his body. Lucas smiled but he quickly got on his knees because this growth was more intense than the previous one. He felt his arms pulsate quicker and harder as they swelled into new godly proportions. It was as if someone was shoving diamonds into his body giving him strength and invincibility. His pecs and abs then inflated and broadened outwards making his chest more ripped and powerful. Lucas could even feel another row of abs forming underneath giving him the same ten pack Frank and Bill have. His legs grew wider and longer than tree trunks; they became more like mountains that could support any massive weights set upon it. Lucas then felt himself getting taller as bones shifted again and his back broadened more giving a more defined v shape. The growth finally cooled to a halt. Lucas rose back up to his feet and took a deep breath that puffed his enormous chest. He then looked back at Frank and Bill who were now at eye level to him. Lucas was finally at the same size as them and had the godly body he always wanted. Lucas flexed a bicep and said, \"What do you think?\" in a deeper voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill flexes his beefy over his mountainous pecs, \"You look great! Now it looks like you can give those hardcore bodybuilders run for their money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I've always had an interest in bodybuilding. Maybe I can run up against Lucas someday.\", Frank laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas walks up to the alligator. \"Yeah, maybe someday.\" He then wraps his shredded arms around Frank's waist, hoisting the reptile up so that he was picking Frank up over his head. Lucas snorts, \"Yeah! I can finally pick YOU up now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, watch it man!\", Frank cries. \"Okay, I'm sorry, you got me. Put me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas and Bill laugh out loud, the bulging whale then gently setting Frank down. \"Sorry man. Just be sure to ask next time instead of just throwing me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did!\", Frank cries. \"You said 'no'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he means you could of just lowered him down into the swamp gently instead of throwing him.\", Bill chuckles. \"So Lucas, what are you gonna do know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm definitely considering to take part in that bodybuilding championship now.\" Frank and Bill look at him, puzzled. \"What, you guys didn't know? There's gonna be a championship to see who's the biggest and strongest guy out there. There were posters everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just interested in swimming and showing off.\", Frank replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas swells out his pecs, almost able to feel them rise up beneath his chin. \"With a body like this, I don't think anyone else'll stand a chance. Unless...\" Both Frank and Bill raise an eyebrow at him. \"Hey, would you guys wanna enter? It'd be nice to have some competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gator and badger look at each other, and then think about it for a moment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The whole tournament sounded like a great idea, but Frank and Bill both were aware of another competition they wanted to keep their eyes on. Frank had to let the orca down, \"That sounds great and all, but me and Bill are thinking about entering a different tournament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\", the fish replies sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill pats Lucas on his shoulder, \"But hey, me and Frank'll be there to watch you win. We promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did help bring Lucas's spirits up. \"Really? Great! By the way, what tournament are you guys taking part in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a wrestling tournament.\", Bill replies. \"Me and Frank have been training for days. We even thought about teaming up together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you think you can watch us fight during the tournament?\", Frank asks excitedly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'd love to. Be great to see you guys in action.\" Lucas then walks up to his new best buds to give 'em a hug. \"Thanks for telling me all about his swamp. I promise I won't tell anyone about it.\" They then break from their quick hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, friend!\", Bill replies happily. \"Well, I it's time me and Frank start heading out. You need me to give you ride home or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas nods his head, \"Nah. I think I'll be fine.\" Lucas then stretches out one leg, thickening out his humongous thighs and calves. \"<i>Nng!</i> Besides, I've got a beefy new bod that I'm just itchin' ta try out!\", he winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank and the badger smile back. \"Glad to hear. You take care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank and Bill start walking away, Lucas waving off as they go. \"You too! See ya's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Bill drove his pal Frank back to his place. Frank still felt really uncomfortable sitting in Bill's car, but he promised he'd get a bigger vehicle really soon. At least Frank made it back to his place without losing his lunch this time. \"See? Told ya you'd be okay.\", Bill smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rugged gator manages to get himself out of Bill's car. \"Ugh... Yeah, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill laughs. \"Well, I'll be seein' ya tomorrow then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. You don't have to pick me up though. I can walk to your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill raises an eyebrow. \"Oh? You sure?\" Frank responds by stomping out a clawed foot, swelling out his own tree-trunk thighs, and bulging calves. Frank then smirks while sticking out his tongue, as if Bill even had to ask. \"Alright, alright. You take care then, Frank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too! See ya Bill!\", Frank smiles. Bill then drives off. Frank watches his car drive away for a brief moment, and then he takes in a deep breath, puffing out his meaty pecs, and then exhaling to bring it in. \"Ah...\" It wasn't necessarily close to sunset yet, and Frank's muscular frame was still pretty energized. Maybe he can workout a bit on his own with the weights he has in his basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exhilarated reptile runs straight for his house and down to his basement. Just a quick workout will do for now. Frank first walks up to a rack full of dumbbells just like the ones Bill was working with at the beach earlier. Only difference this time is that he picked up a pair of 300-pound dumbbells, and then stood in front of the full-length he had. Frank starts pumping his arms in no time, and his immense peaks just exploded as they earned some nice snaking veins. His beefy arms were getting worked hard, but he adjusted to the weights, only wanting more and more power to be pumped through his veins. After about 15 minutes of arm curls, he drops the weights and proceeds on the bench. After first setting up the weights, a little more than Bill had once again, he lies down on his rippled back and takes a deep breath before he starts his workout with the bar. Only his first rep was the hardest, because the tensing and straining from his bulging body brought even more strength to proceed on. He lets out a proud grunt as he reaches his 50th rep in no time. He drops the bar into its resting place, and then sits back up, feeling as if his entire upper frame was about to blow. Not that it was a bad thing of course. The last were his legs, and he knew just what to do with those; leg squats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe puts more weights on the bar, and then manages to hoist it up with his back. He starts squatting in no time, blasting out his enormous quads and calves in on time. The warmth and power he was receiving just felt great, as well as the pain and blood rushing through his veins. He lets out another proud grunting noise, his monstrously thick back and unattainable legs flexing incredibly to his advantage. He never felt this good before. Maybe except the time he grew into the strapping alligator his is now, but continuing on, Frank reaches his 50th rep as well. \"<i><b>Nnaugh!!</b></i>\" He drops the bar to the floor with a loud <i>'Thunk!'</i> and then walks his bulging frame in front of the mirror once again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A quick workout gave Frank a \u201cpumped\u201d look and sensation. Frank smiled looking at the giant gator that stood before him in the mirror, standing several feet tall with muscles that made him nearly invincible. Frank lifted his arm and flexed hard to see his bicep erupt with veiny power. He put his other hand on the scales covering his arm to feel his bicep. It was harder than steel, just the way Frank liked it. Frank then curled his arms downwards to puff up his chest where his pecs slightly touched his chin. He finished by sticking out his blasted leg and tensed his thigh and calf to mass proportions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank then took a deep breath and stretched his massive arm in the air. \u201cBig and strong, just the way I like it!\u201d He realized his quick workout and show drained all the energy that remained in him. It was time to take a relaxing hot shower and head on to bed. Frank did as such and slept like a peaceful giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank woke up completely re-energized and ready to start the day. He agreed to meet up with Bill at his place to have a hearty breakfast. Frank quickly got out of bed, put on a pair of stretchy spandex shorts, and rushed out of the house. Frank was in such a hurry to eat, he forgot to put a shirt on. He shrugged at the thought. He thought he looked better without a shirt covering his shredded chest. Frank then started a light jog to Bill\u2019s place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he jogged, Frank felt the burning his thighs and calves thinking they felt good and strong. He turned his head and stopped jogging to see a familiar face. He saw a hugely muscular orca whale flexing in front of a female rabbit. Frank recognized the two as Lucas and Becky, one of Erika\u2019s friends that he met at the beach. The gator chuckled and made his way to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Lucas!\u201d greeted Frank waving as he walked to Lucas\u2019s position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas smiled seeing Frank. \u201cHey, Frank! Getting a jog in before breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! I was actually jogging to Bill\u2019s place for breakfast. You\u2019re welcome to join us if you want to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYeah! Sure!\u201d He then turned to his rabbit friend. \u201cCare to join us, babe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky blushed while still clinging onto Lucas\u2019s bicep. \u201cUm\u2026I don\u2019t think so. I think Erika and Leah might get jealous if I did that. I don\u2019t want to make them mad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said Lucas. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, babe.\u201d Lucas winked at Becky and Becky blushed harder. The muscle whale and gator waved goodbye to their rabbit friend and jogged to Bill\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made it to the house in no time. Lucas could hardly believe the size of Bill\u2019s house. \u201cThis is where Bill lives?\u201d Lucas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank nodded. \u201cYep! Being a professional fighter pays a lot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas chuckled. \u201cSo does bodybuilding\u2026maybe you two should give it a try sometime!\u201d Frank repeated Lucas chuckle, stopped at Bill\u2019s front door, and knocked on the door loud and hard with his incredible strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill opened the door and saw Frank and Lucas standing. Bill teased, \u201cWhen my door sounded like it was about to be bashed into, I knew you guys would be here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank rubbed the back of his head. \u201cSorry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries!\u201d said Bill. \u201cCome on in. I got breakfast ready!\u201d Frank and Lucas entered the house and followed Bill to the kitchen. Bill had a whole buffet table of food waiting for them. There were plates across the table holding piles of various foods, pancakes, bacon, eggs, sausage, fruit, even steak. Frank and Bill\u2019s eyes widened to see such amazing food waiting to be eaten. Lucas couldn\u2019t help but drool a little. \u201cSo what do you think?\u201d asked Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we should dig in!\u201d exclaimed Lucas. The trio didn\u2019t hesitate and began their meal. They all ravenously shoved food into their mouths to fill their endless appetite. They stopped until every scrap was in their chiseled abs. Lucas rubbed his ten pack in satisfaction. \u201cThat was great, Bill!\u201d said Lucas. \u201cThanks\u2026say, doesn\u2019t anyone feel a little more energized\u2026maybe bigger?\u201d Lucas noticed that his muscles looked bulkier and stronger than before, which satisfied him but drew his curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re right! It\u2019s a side effect of the swamp. Whenever you eat a lot of food, your muscles get a bit bigger but it wears off after a while.\u201d Lucas eyes widened again and smiled. He got bigger just by eating a ton of food? It was a dream! With a body like his, Lucas needed a lot of food to feed his muscles but didn\u2019t think he would be rewarded for it. Lucas flexed a bulky bicep to himself with pleasure with Frank and Bill chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill finished his last bite and said, \u201cSo, what\u2019s our plan for today?\u201d    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I say we should see Lucas show his stuff. His competition is starting up first after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas liked the sound of that. \"Oh yeah, sweet! And I'll be sure to see you guys as well!\", he replies excitedly. He gently picks himself up out of his seat, bends on one knee, and arches his upper body to the side while he flexes his meaty arm once again with such muscular grace. \"I'd say I'm 'bout ready to put my muscles on display, and show those other guys who's the biggest and strongest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill and Frank were happy to hear that from their recent friend. They couldn't wait to see Lucas perform on stage. The badger holds up his hand, \"Oh, wait a sec.\" He walks up out of his seat to grab an empty fruit basket and puts a couple different types of foods inside. He then walks up to hand it to Lucas, \"Here. Be sure to eat up every once in a while. Me and Frank wanna see you at your biggest, like you said.\", he winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, thanks!\", the whale replies happily. \"I'll be sure to do that. But uh, not during the strength testing round of course, if there is one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, the bodybuilding competition was just about to start. Frank and Bill had front-row seats thanks to Lucas. Frank happens to scan to seats behind him, and spots Erika and her friends were watching from a few rows back as well. \"Heh.\", the gator chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looks over to Frank, \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erika and her friends are here. Becky's gonna be so stoked.\", Frank snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer calls upon the contestants (five in all), the last one being Lucas, who proudly walks up to stand alongside the others. There was only one person who was still Lucas's height, but the rest of them was pretty close too. Frank and Bill noticed the orca's frame was still bulging out wonderfully just as before, and was getting a lot of attention from the crowd as well. The first round is of each contestant just showing off their stuff. They began by doing some simple poses, pumping and flexing each and every muscle group they could think of. Lucas seemed to be getting a lot of praise, but so did the large eagle who's build and size nearly matched his. The large avian looked pretty intimidating, but he did like the whale's massive build so it was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile holding his pose, the eagle says to Lucas, \"You got some good moves, big guy. Think you can win this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas looks back to the eagle and smiles. \"Yeah, I do. I still got one more trick up my sleeve.\" Lucas released himself from his pose and wrapped his thick arms around the eagle. With little effort, the whale heaved him up to his chest and above his head. The audience gasped at the sight while Frank, Bill, Ericka, and the others smiled excitedly. Lucas finishes his feat by letting his arm down leaving him holding the eagle in one hand and flexing his bicep to the crowd. He smiled as a finishing touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience went wild thinking they had found a winner for the competition. Frank and Bill clapped and cheered wildly for him. Frank leaned over to Bill and said, \"He's a bit of a show off, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill chuckled, \"He's a bodybuilder, what do you expect? Besides, wouldn't you if you were on that stage?\" Frank agreed and continued cheering his whale friend on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas puts the eagle down and the eagle still kept a look of amazement on his face. \"Told you I had one more trick,\" said Lucas. \"Sorry for surprising you like that. You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y..yeah. I'm fine,\" said the eagle. \"Wow! That was awesome! I don't think even I could do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overall show finally came to a close. All of the bodybuilders all lined up for the announcement of the winners. The host of the show got up in front with a trophy as big as Lucas sitting next to him. He called for the top three competitors. \"For third place....Mike!\" a rhino about half Lucas's size came up and was awarded with a medal. \"For second place...Ronald!\" The eagle Lucas picked up stepped forward and was awarded a medal and a big check. \"And for first place...Lucas!\" The audience cheered and clapped as Lucas walked up while flexing. He shook hands with the host, was given a big check, and lifted the big trophy with one hand effortlessly. This was the best day in the young whale's life.</span></div></div>",

They all get together as soon as the large whale steps out of the locker, he receives a big hug from Becky to show how proud she was, even though she was barely able to hug half of Lucas's body. \"Wow! Way ta go Lucas! I'm so happy for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas nearly fumbles his trophy, but sets it down safely to hug the rabbit back. \"Heh, thank Becky.\" He looks around to see everyone else, \"You guys enjoy the show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did!\", Bill roars with pride. \"You did a great job up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whatcha gonna do now?\", Frank asks as he walks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking...of having a party! And you guys are invited.\" The girls cheered loudly, excited to attend a party with an up-and-coming bodybuilding universe winner. \"Hey, why don't you gals head to the snack shack. Gotta talk to Frank and Bill for a bit.\" The three jumpy bunnies do just that. Soon as they were out of earshot, the proud whale walks up to the croc and badger. \"Hey, can you believe it? I won! That swamp was a great help. It even brought back my confidence in bodybuilding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank smiles, \"Hey, that's great. How's your workouts been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas raises his massive, shredded arms to flex, stretching the sleeves of that tight shirt he was wearing to its limit. \"RRGH! Great! I can work out nonstop for hours without breakin' a sweat. Hey, so you guys coming along? I invited the other competitors to come over too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill shrugs his humongous shoulders, \"Eh, ain't got nothing better to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there too.\", Frank adds. \"I'd like to see just how big those other guys are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank, Bill, Lucas, and the girls walked along the sandy shore of the beach. The muscle trio were wearing speedos to show off their incredibly sculpted muscles and had their ladies by their side. They were later greeted by other muscular guys whom Lucas recognized from the competition. All the party goers brought food, music, towels, even a net and ball for volleyball. It seemed like the party was starting strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said Lucas turning to his friends, \"What should we do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said, \"I don't know about you guys but my muscles are itching to some action. How about we play a game of volleyball with the competitors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill swung his rippling arms and flexed them. \"Sounds like a plan! Let's do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank, Bill, and Lucas set up a three versus three match. They were on one team while a tiger, a dragon, and a bull from the competition were on the other. The other team served the ball first and the game was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball jumped from one side of the net to the other. The other barely kept up with Frank, Bill, and Lucas who were working very well together. The muscle trio passed the ball to each other and spiked several points ahead of the other team. Their muscles made the ball go super fast so points were scored in no time. Bill passed the ball to Frank and Frank jumped to it with his amazing legs and spiked the ball hard to the other side of the fence. With that last score, the match was decided. Frank, Bill, and Lucas won the match. They were cheering as the other team congratulated them following their lady friends.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank, Lucas, and Bill all smiled as their fans congratulated them. The volleyball game had been fun, but the 3 didn't want to completely show off, and discourage the others. \"Hey guys\" Lucas said to Frank and Bill, \"Is there something else we can do? I wanna do something that's a real challenge for us\" Bill nodded \"me too, it feels like everything we do is too easy. We need some sort of competition where smaller guys have an advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked around the beach for another activity. Bill thought about surfing, but there weren't any waves to surf on. Then Frank tapped the others and they saw he was starring at something. They followed his gaze to see a little wolf pup making a sandcastle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all broke out in a grin. \"That's just the thing! Building sandcastles will be tricky for us with all our added bulk\" Frank said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But hey lets give it a try. Lets all work on one together\" Lucas said. The 3 fist bumped as they got to work. As ordinary spades and pails were too small to be used by them, They grabbed big shovels and a barrel. They all scooped sand into their barrel, then Lucas used his whale blowhole to spray water and get it wet. \"Sory guys\" he blushed as he saw he sprayed the other 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, its awfully hot\" Bill said. Sweat was pouring down their faces, their backs, and even into their jockstraps. But they dipped in the water once in a while to deal with it. Frank heaved a barrel of heavy mud like it was nothing, and turned it upsidown making a big pillar. Then he set the barrel down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I think we got a good start\" Frank said as they looked over the 4 big turrets they made. \"Next, the walls.\" Bill said. The walls were definetly trickier for them, as they couldn't use any sort of mold. The gator, whale, and raccoon all tried to put them up, but it was slow work as sand kept crumbling. Soon however they managed to get the walls up connecting the turrets. \"Ok, whats next?\" Bill said looking over it. The turrests were 4 feet high, and the wall was 3 feet high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..' Lucas said looking over it, \"It needs an entrance\" The whale closed his hand into a fist and before the other 2 could say anything, he punched straight through, leaving a hole a foot wide. Frank sighed with relief that it didn't collapse. \"ok, CAREFULLY, remove sand to form an arch, and make the entrance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge guys continued on, the biggest trouble now was staying calm enough for their tails to not wag. By now lots of people had noticed them and were walking by to see, Some were even getting pictures of the studs playing in the sand. But they didn't care. Frank was now working on details. He used his claws, as well as his tail to carefully carve out shapes on the wall to make it look better. Then they all heard a noise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them looked up to see that wolf pup they saw earlier. he was....</span></div></div>",

The lieutenant in charge of the center said the young eagle was in no shape to be in the army because he was too small. Michel wouldn't last a second on the battlefield according to the strict soldier. The eagle didn't know what else to say or do except leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel made his feathers droop. Ever since his father told him stories of being in the military, Michel always wanted to be a soldier. He studied hard and worked out as hard as he could. For some reason, he couldn't see any results. Michel trained for a very long time and could not get his muscles in the big strong shape he needed to be a soldier. He didn't know what was wrong. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMichel then stopped in front of a tattoo shop. He made an appointment to get a tattoo for his arms as a reward for getting into the military forces, but now that he wasn't going to be, he wasn't sure if he still wanted the tattoos. Michel reconsidered thinking the tattoos would make him tougher and give him motivation to train even harder, so the young eagle went inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the eagle went inside, Michel could hear the buzzing of needles in all corners of the room. He was greeted by a lean hyena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" asked the hyena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y..yeah, I have an appointment. Name's Michel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena went through the computer at the front desk and found Michel's name. He then said, \"Alright. Right this way, please.\" The hyena led Michel to the back where he took a seat right next to the hyena, who appeared to be his tattoo artist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what'll it be today?\" asked the hyena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" started Michel, \"I was thinking some type of band around my arms, like something that stretches over and under my biceps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem,\" said the hyena. \"What kind of band do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I always liked griffins. How about griffins that go down my biceps and their wings go around them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena's ears perked and his eyes widened. \"That sounds pretty cool! I like it! Let's do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the needle began to buzz, Michel braces himself for the pain. He knew that getting tattoos was never easy. Once the needle hit underneath his feathers, Michel grunted slightly and waited patiently for the pain to stop, even though it wouldn't for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour, the needle finally stopped. \"All done,\" said the hyena. \"What do you think?\" Michel raised his arms and widened his eyes. He saw majestic mythical creatures laying peacefully on his arms. As he rolled his biceps, Michel could see the creatures' wings stretch all around them. The griffins on his arms looked brave and powerful, qualities that Michel envied. With all the incredible details, the griffins looked like they were almost alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These looks great!\" said Michel. \"I love them! Thank you so much!\" Michel went back up front, payed at the front desk and left the tattoo shop. Even though he didn't get into the military, somehow, Michel thought, with his tattoos, things were going to get better.</span></div></div>",

In a matter of minutes, he was inside his house and ran up to his room. He then tugs off his shirt and tosses it aside so he won't have to pull his shirt sleeve up to see his tattoo clearly. He really liked it. It looked really awesome on his feathery skin. That tattoo artist should be getting awards for how clear and realistic these tattoos look. On the downside though, it doesn't seem to support his average frame. He flexed his arm a bit, but it didn't seem to do much with the tattoo. He bets if his biceps were much larger, then his tattoo would wrap around just the way he wanted. He does so by imagining it, being so strong and muscular. Then he'd show that recruiter just how tough he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, he sees the griffon's eyes start to light up in the mirror. \"Whoa! What the...!?\" It didn't seem to do much except emit a bright, yellowy light as it shines in the mirror. \"What's going o-...AH...!\", the eagle grunts. A sudden twinge of pain starts to erupt all over his body, making the avian drop down to his knees. He slowly lifts up his arm to see the griffon, still with it's glowing eyes. The pain was getting pretty intense, making it hard to tell whether or not his arm was starting to stretch and grow right before him. He was. His arms started to tense up, his forearms, biceps, triceps, and shoulders shuddering and inflating with bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could then feel his pecs start to rise below his chin, and feel his chest and lats stretch out between his arms. His neck and back muscles start to take off, growing much more pronounced and rippled all behind him. \"NNGAH...!\", he grunts again. Although the feeling was intense, it was quite gratifying to his growing frame. His once-flat stomach starts to tighten up underneath his thick pecs, forming a chiseled set of 6-pack abs. Michel was awestruck at the growing figure in the mirror, even though it was him. He couldn't believe this was happening to him, in a good way, as he manages to rub his meaty palm over his well-defined abdominals. \"URRGH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part was pretty painful, his bones. They started to elongate and pop to support his growing frame. His wings started to stretch out further on his back, only to support the shooting pain. Luckily it was over before he knew. \"Ow...\" The last was his legs, which were covered by his back denim jeans. His pants were quite loose, and he needed the support of a belt to wear it. Soon as he felt his hips start to widen out, he quickly loosens his belt and slips it off. He then waits patiently as he felts his thighs and calves start to fill out his once loose pants. He sees it was over as soon as his clawed feet started to swell and lengthen out a few inches, until it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heaves a bit for the next couple minutes as he waits patiently for anymore shooting pain. Looks like it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel took a deep breath out of relief making his pecs and abs ripple with power. All of a sudden Michel was full of energy and he became even more energized when he saw his reflection in the mirror. He saw a big muscular eagle standing right where Michel used to stand. Michel dropped his beak to the floor. Could that giant muscle eagle be him. Michel raised his arm and flexed hard making his bicep rise to a fantastic peak with veins pulsating on the top. His reflection did what Michel did. No doubt Michel was now the big eagle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel rubbed his bicep with his feathery hand feeling the warmth and power it contained, but he still had no idea how he got so big. He was so excited about his change he never stopped to think about it. Michel then noticed his tattoos. The eyes of the griffins weren't glowing anymore. With the glowing happening before his growth and stopping after, Michel assumed that his new tattoos had something to do with it. He had no idea how, nor did he really care. Michel was just thankful that he now had the body he needed to start his military career. All he needed to do now was to go to the recruit center again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel waited a few days to go back to the recruit center because he didn't want the lieutenant to be suspicious of him when he returns. Michel entered the center with his new strong body. The lieutenant, a large muscular lion, saw Michel with great interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, young man,\" said the lion, \"You interested in joining our nation's forces?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel nodded. \"Yes sir. I've been wanting to join since I was little and I'm ready to report for duty, sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got spirit,\" said the lion. \"I'll give you that, but it'll take a lot more than that to go far in this career choice. You have to make some tough choices. Are you ready for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" said Michel with no hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" the lion handed him a pamphlet. \"If you're determined, training begins 6 months from now. Be ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel looked at the lion with a grin of excitement. Michel's dream was finally coming true. All he needs to do now is wait 6 months till his training begins. He could hardly wait.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michel was so psyched! He crumples the pamphlet in his hand without noticing as he pumps both his arms in excitement, \"YES!\" His dreams of becoming a army recruit are coming true! He then turns to walk along with pride, kicking his legs up as he walks to head home. One thing suddenly crosses him though, and he ends up stopping right in front of the place that caused it. His slips up his shirt sleeve over his bulging bicep to see the tattoo he got printed all around it. He was so caught up in all the excitement, he didn't realize that it's not normal for a tattoo to grow, or induce muscle growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the window, that hyena fellow was still inside. It'd be nice to get an explanation from him. Michel swings the door open, the bell ringing from above to give notice to the hyena. \"Oh, hey there buddy. Welcome back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. So he still knows who I am, but I wonder if he notices anything different.\", Michel thought. \"Hey.\" The enlarged bird leans in to set his beefy arms one the counter. \"So, you remember me from earlier, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\", the hyena replies gladly. \"I see you're much, MUCH bigger than last time. That was quite a growth spurt you must of had.\" The hyena just kept smiling, almost as if he were in denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel had to raise his tone, \"Don't just smile at me like that. Something's up with this tattoo and I'm sure you know all about it.\", he asserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You don't like it?\", the hyena frowns, but then it comes back again, \"If you want, I can always take it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I like it!\", he assured. \"Although, that's really good to know. Anyway, exactly what kind tattoo did you give me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe it's one of my best designs yet.\", the hyena smirks. \"I'll introduce myself. My name is Oregan. I'm actually just a normal, well-known tattoo artist, who just so happens to have found a way to make magical tattoos grow a person.\", he winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so I'm not the only one?\", Michel speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, you're one of the very few. I've done thousands of regular tattoo designs, but yours is quite magical indeed.\", he assures. \"How do ya like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...well, I love it. Very much as a matter of fact.\", Michel replies. \"But, why me of all people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOregan shrugs his shoulders, \"You seemed to be down on your luck. I saw you enter the recruiting center not too long ago, only to see you come back here looking all sad and depressed. I thought a little touch of magic would help cheer you back up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\", Michel didn't really know what to say, except, \"...thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't worry about it.\", Oregan grins. \"You woulda done the same for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget what I said. Now, there are just a few things you should know about. You can grow more, but since you only have two tattoos, you won't grow as fast. Now, if you were to get more, your growth would erupt much faster, and at a 50% discount. My tattoos also come with a guarantee. If ever the customer isn't satisfied with his tattoo, or just wants to turn back to normal, he/she can always come back and I'll remove it free of charge.\", he proudly grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, now that you're here, why don't you show me what you got?\" asked Oregan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Michel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your muscles aren't just for show! You've also gotten a lot stronger! Do some push ups and show me how strong you are now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel wasn't sure about doing push ups in a tattoo shop but he could feel his muscle itching with energy waiting to be exerted. Besides, he was curious himself on how strong he was now. So, Michel went down on all fours and started pushing himself up and down against the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel could feel the burn in his arms and he learned to love it. In fact, it felt intoxicating to him. Oregan watched as Michel's tattoos swelled in detail as well as Michel's biceps between reps. His arms plumped as Michel pushed up and still kept their strong shape after going down to the floor. Michel lost count at 50 but still continued until he got bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel rose back up still feeling energized. Even after doing several push ups, Michel felt like he could bounce off the walls all day. Oregan was pleased. \"You seem to have a lot of power within you. I'm glad I was able to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel nodded. \"Thanks. I can now pursue my dream because of what you did. Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it! If I can be of any more assistance, let me know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will!\" Michel said goodbye to Oregan and left the shop thinking about what to do now since he still has plenty of energy to burn off. Michel thought the possibilities were endless.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michel left the shop feeling like he needed to test his new strength more. Push ups did nothing but make him want to exert more energy. He needed to burn off some steam and he knew just the place to do it: the gym. It would be a perfect place to see how strong he really was and maybe even make him stronger. Besides, if Michel was going to military training in 6 months, he needed to start training immediately. Without further delay, Michel rushed to the gym.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs Michel arrived at the gym, he quickly made his way to the weights. Before starting, Michel took off his shirt since it was not a workout shirt and didn't want it to get it soaked with sweat. Michel then smiled at his chest feeling satisfied with his solid 6 pack. He was ready for anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel first saw the weight bench and knew that's where he wanted to start first. The eagle saw the bar weight 200 pounds. It sounded heavy to Michel but he was willing to see how much he could take. He lied down and gripped the bar. As he lifted the bar off it resting place and began his reps, Michel felt the weight was challenging. The bar was heavy but enough for Michel to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel gritted his teeth trying to make it to his fifth rep. After doing so, the weight somehow began to feel lighter. After each rep, the bar went from a ton of lead to a single feather. Michel didn't know why it was feeling lighter to him suddenly. He figured his body was finally warmed up for the rest of his training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel then decided to try out the leg press machine. He set the machine to 250 pounds since 200 was getting easier for him. The eagle took his seat and began working his legs. This workout felt more intense than the weight bench. Michel pressed his legs and he felt nothing but tough pressure in his thighs and calves. He then began feeling a burning sensation, but that didn't stop him. In fact, he liked the feeling. After doing a few more leg lifts, the sensation ceased and the weight began to feel light also. 250 pounds felt like nothing to Michel now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel paused his workout all puzzled. He didn't know what was going on. His workouts started out hard at first but then they suddenly became easy. Michel became more puzzled when he saw himself in a nearby full sized mirror. Michel saw himself more pumped than when he first came in! His biceps were larger and rounder, his legs were thicker, and his chest was more defined. Was it his workout regimen, or something else? Michel didn't care. He loved this new pumped up body of his. As he flexed a bicep to himself, he saw the tattoo griffins on his arms glow dimly in their eyes. Michel then knew they were the cause of this new pump. Michel quickly covered the eyes of the griffins with his hands and rushed to the bathroom to investigate the situation further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, no one was inside, except his reflection in a full-length mirror. He sure liked what he was seeing overall. He uncovers the griffon tattoo, and its eyes were still glowing. He wasn't sure what to do at this point, hoping no one comes in anytime soon to see Oregan's tattoo. On the other hand, he couldn't help but give his arm a light flex, watching it swell before him quite nicely. \"Hey, nice.~\", he smirks. It's sure the biggest he has seen thus far, and it was getting bigger. \"...Wait, what the-!?\" To the eagle's surprise, he witnesses his own bicep throbbing up more and more, like blood was being pumped in to increase the mass of his muscles. The same effect spreads down to his tricep, and then up his forearm and shoulder. His arm was feeling heavier, but it looked and felt incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowers and gives his flexed arm a rest, and then raises up his other arm to give it a hard flex. The enticing magical effect from the tattoo does the same, and he watches his muscles fill up right before him in the mirror, and until his arm matches up with his other. Next thing Michel does is raise his arms up and sets his hands on his head, making his chest, lats and back muscles feel a twinge as he flexes them out. He suddenly starts to feel his pecs, lats and upper back rise up beneath his beak. His neck was also being affected with that warm, growy feeling, and it was almost like his head was starting to be engulfed into his body. Soon as those muscles match his enlarged arms, he moves down to his abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't really have to do much, simply tensing them up to make them bulge outwards. The felling then sinks in, making his chiseled abs swell up and lengthen a bit more over his midsection, even getting a fourth row of thick abs added in between there. He almost looked like a muscular cartoon character at this point. You know, big body, small legs. It gave him a light chuckle, but he wanted to even those out as well. He stands his legs up straight against each other and sets his hands against his thighs as he gives them a simple, leg-rippling flex. His quads plump out as each rugged muscle gets shredded to show themselves, as well as his throbbing calves. The griffon's eyes glow still, his legs start becoming like large, sinewy treetrunks. His calves even peaked inward some more as they start pushing against each other spread his legs some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichel felt very proud of himself. He looked almost like a heavyweight bodybuilder now!</span></div></div>",

He ran to reach his mirror, and saw it begin. He was 5\u201910\u201d before the growth, and he watched as he went from his clothes being tight-fitting, to ripping off halfway through the growth. He couldn\u2019t fully fit in his mirror any more, and saw as his clothes were completely torn off him. He was 6\u20197\u201d now, and he watched how he loomed over everything in his house. He hit his head on the doorframe as he walked out of his room, rubbing his head and smiling.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a sunny day. The sunlight shines down a large patch of forest trees, their leaves fluttering in the breeze. Lying against one of the trees was a brown-furred bear, wearing a red lumberjack shirt, blue pants, and brown shoes. He was just lounging about, minding his own business. Until someone drops a small stack of logs right beside him, the thumping sounds making his body jump in response, \"Hey! I was napping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather dark-brown-furred, studly deer in matching clothing (except with a brown shirt), was the perpetrator. \"Come on Burton, it's time to get some work done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tired bear wasn't too buff himself. In fact he seems a little more on the heavyset side. He just turns and faces away from his supervisor, \"Mm... Anthony, do I have to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! You want that college credit, you gotta push your own weight arond here.\" Anthony sighs. \"You've only been here a day. Why would you even sign up for a extra credit course like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt pouts, \"I didn't! That's the thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer crosses his rather thick arms, \"Well, if you had been paying more attention in class, you would have paid more attention at what you were actually signing up for beforehand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear does his best to pick himself up, \"Is it too late to sign up for something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\", the deer replies. \"But it's required that at least one student signs up for every course. And you're the only one here, so you're outta luck.\" Anthony picks up two axes, holding one for his student, \"Now come on.\" Burt let out a loud sigh as he dusted off the dirt from his pants and the back of his shirt before reluctantly grabbing the axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"man this isn't fair...\" The deer gave a small snort as he set the axe he was holding over his shoulder and began walking towards a large copse of unchopped trees with Burt following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life isn't fair. Better get used to it\" Burt almost let out a deep grumble of complaints under his breath, but his bit his lip and simply held it in. It was no used trying to fight something out of his hands. Unless another student picked that course there was no way he could leave. He was stuck and no matter how much it sucked, this is what he was stuck in until he got his college credit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than an hour later Burt was barely able to remain upright. His upper body was practically drenched in sweat as he took one last swing as the tree he was working on fell with a thunderous clatter and he let out a deep sigh of relief. Six trees cut, down not bad at all. As he set the axe down he heard a laugh behind him and he slowly turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six trees only? If you want that college credit you need to work much harder. I won't even consider this day finished until you chop down at least another four or more.\" Burt almost snarled at the smug looking deer behind him as he tried to stretch, but winced at the aching sting of his overstretched muscles. Another four? what was he? superman? He couldn't even lift that axe again, let alone chop down another four trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Four? are you crazy?\" As Burt lifted his head up to look Anthony in the eyes, who only had an almost taunting smile on his face as he shook it head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm trying to whip your lazy butt into shape and really make you sweat for that colege credit. And if you start complaining I'm going to make you cut another five on top of the four you still have to do.\" Burt sucked in a breath to let loose a very hateful retort at him, but he squelched it down and swallowed his anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can.. I at least.. take a break? I am about to collapse from exhaustion.\" Anthony let out an exhasperated sigh before he reluctantly nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, take your break, but you only get a forty minute break. For every minute you are late getting back to work I am going to tack on another tree for you to cut down, so I suggest you spend your break wisely and get back here as soon as you can.\"  Burt had to dig his claws into the palm of his paw not to snarl at Anthony before he gave a small nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt walked in aches all over his chest and arms. He never exercised that intense before. He walked to the edge of a river too tired to admire the rushing water. Burt was tired of feeling weak all the time, tired of being heavy, and tired of people like Anthony picking on him. Burt wanted it all to stop but felt powerless to change anything about his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt turned to his left and noticed a small cave peeping out on the side of a hill. He found the cave intriguing. Somehow, Burt felt like he could relate to the darkness inside the cave by being alone and isolating himself from the world around him. Out of curiosity, Burt walked into the cave to see what he could find. Besides, he had another half-hour in his break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt could feel the dampness and humidity in the air of the cave. He even heard the occasional dripping of water from a random stalagtite. The darkness cleared with sunlight coming from a random hole above him. In the light, Burt noticed capped yellow mushroom with red spots. There were dozens of them scattered over the cave ground and walls. Burt never saw mushrooms like these before. He picked one up from the ground to observe it. His stomach then rumbled. Burt was starving after the intense workout. Burt knew eating random things in nature wasn't a good idea but after the day that he had he didn't care. The bear popped the mushroom in his mouth, chewed, and swallowed. The rumbling in the bear stomach ceased but Burt began to feel a little strange. He didn't know why.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, the ache turned into warmth in his stomach and it somehow started to spread all over his furry body. Burt was feeling warm in his chest, arms, and legs. He didn't know what was going on. He needed to see a nurse to be sure that mushroom wasn't poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt ran out of the cave to rush himself to the nurse's office at school campus. He then passed the trees that he was supposed to chop. Burt's heart dropped like a stone. Burt knew Anthony would let him have it if he just left without finishing. He could fail the course! Burt saw the axe nearby. He felt like his stomach settled and should be fine for a bit. His plan was to cut the trees quickly, head to the nurse, and come back before Anthony ever noticed he was gone. Burt grabbed the axe and starting cutting a tree as rapidly as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt sunk the axe deep inside the trunk of the tree. He thought it was bit strange that he enough strength to do it but he assumed that he recovered from his break. He continued his fast pace to make it to the nurse. Within a few seconds, the tree came crashing down and Burt moved on to his second tree. The same results happened: a few chops and the tree came down. Burt then finished his third and fourth tree shortly. Overall the job took only a few minutes. Burt thought to himself, \"I guess it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.\" He then dropped the axe and continued his rush to the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt sat himself on a doctor's bed, holding his stomach while fearing the worse. A yellow lab soon enters inside. \"Hey, aren't you that one guy that actually signed up for Anthony's course?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear frowns, \"What if I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow canine starts laughing hysterically. \"You really signed up for that?! I'd have felt less bad if you selected randomly, but nope! You actually signed up for it.\" He starts speaking in a baby voice, \"Aww, what's the matter? You get splinter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt looked unphased, \"...Are you really the school nurse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I am.\" To Burt's surprse, the school nurse was a well-muscled bengal tiger, who is just about Anthony's height. \"And I'd appreciate it if my intern didn't make the hurt feel worse. You'll have to forgive Mike. He hasn't been doing very well today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab bows his head, \"Sorry Joel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony's a good friend of mine.\", the tiger continues. \"Hopefully he didn't work you too hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he did.\", Burt replies. \"But that's not why I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel crosses his over his broad chest, \"Oh? Then why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Burt to answer. \"I...I think I ate something I wasn't supposed to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" The large feline bends down, \"So how does your stomach feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt held on to his stomach, rubbing it once or twice. \"It feels...\", Burt's eyes lit up, \"...tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stomach cramps?\", Mike proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. Just...tight.\", Burt adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oookay. So, no stomach ache?\", Joel asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore. ...I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe happy tiger pats Burt on the back, \"Good! Glad we could help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt frowns again, mumbling to himself, \"Yeah. Even though you didn't really do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel laughed as he patted Burt's shoulder. \"Better you come in and we not have to do anything than to perform surgery or pump your stomach. wouldn't you agree?\" Burt shivered at the idea of them cutting his stomach open and he nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yea.\" Joel gave Burt a lookover once more before nodding his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem okay now besides the tightness in your stomach, so I say try to drink some fluids and rest as soon as you get home, but for now you're free to head bed. I know Anthony isn't one to take tardiness, god knows the number of students I've had to bail out because he pushed them so hard that they hurt themselves trying to meet his expectation. Burt gave a very audible swallow at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel gave a reassuring smile before he patted Burt's back. \"Relax, i'm being dramatic, only one kid who to be bailed out that way and it was only because he swung at the tree with the axe head facing the wrong way, he sprained both his wrists because he jarred them so badly. After that most kids avoided his course like the plague, but it's fine\". Burt nodded a little more relaxed now as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I hope i dont have to come see you again for anything serious\" Then Burt began making his way back towards the woodcutting site. Despite what the nurse had said, Burt still really disliked Anthony. He was very abbrasive and outright mean. As he got closer to where he was supposed to be working he saw the familiar form of Anthony standing there. Even from here he could see that he was more than a bit irritated and when he spotted Burt coming in He could almost hear Anthony taping his foot in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Burt finally came within eartshot boy did he want to go back to the nurse's office. \"Where the heck have you been? I didn't tell you that you could leave the area.\" Burt flinched as his ears almost flattened against his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I wasn't feeling good.. I just went to see the school nurse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you five? can't you handle  feeling a little sick until you finish your work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But I did finish my work! I cut down four more trees just like you said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is crap! as slow as you were going before no way you managed to chop them down in such a short time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did!\" Burt pointed to the trees nearest to Anthony. I cut those for right there before I left!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't believe it!\" Anthony handed an axe to Burt. \"Cut that tree over there and let me see what you did!\" Burt didn't want to start an argument or make things worse so he went to another tree to chop. Burt felt like he had energy again. In fact, he felt like he had a lot of energy. Burt felt really good. Without wasting more time, the bear started chopping. Just like last time, his axe ate through the trunk of the tree. Within a several strokes, the tree came tumbling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" said Burt to Anthony. \"I cut those trees like I did with this one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...\" Anthony didn't know what he saw. It shouldn't have taken Burt that short amount of time to chop a tree compared to his earlier performance. It was impossible. Anthony immediately suspected of cheating but he knew he'd get in trouble without any proof. \"That's fine,\" said Anthony. \"We're done. Get out of here!\" Burt didn't know what he did but he was glad he got Anthony to cut him loose. He ran out of the deer's sight before he could change his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt went to the bathroom to look at a mirror. He reflected the whole day back to himself. He gave a big sigh. \"What a day,\" he said to himself. Burt still felt the tightness in his stomach. \"What is going on with my stomach?\" He lifted his shirt halfway and noticed there was less fat around his waist. Burt's eyes widened. He knew he was heavier earlier today. Was it the workout Anthony forced him on? Couldn't be. No one can lose that much weight so fast. Burt then remembered the mushroom he found. He remembered he felt the tightness shortly after he ate it. Could it have been the mushroom? How? Burt knew he needed to get to the bottom of it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, first thing Burt had in mind were the mushrooms he ate. Though, it ain't like Anthony wasn't gonna work him hard throughout the day again. He started out with a little breakfast, and got straight to tree chopping with his teach. It was excruciating. It's like Anthony is giving him overtime because of yesterday. Looks like he wanted to make sure of something too. One thing Burt did notice was that all though the work was hard, in fact harder than yesterday, he didn't feel as tuckered out as he normally would. Still, it was hard to get up on his feet, as he lies sitting against a cut tree. \"Ugggh...\", he groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll though that deer was tough, he's started getting a little impressed. He walks up to Burt with his bulging arms crossed over his chest, \"Hey, I like how you did. Twice as much as yesterday too. It's still not much, but I'm sure half the forest'll be gone once I'm done with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Burt looks around once. He must have spotted over a hundred trees from where he sat. \"Are you kidding me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. If you don't want an A, that is.\", he adds, looking down on the tired bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt groans. \"What'll get me a D?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't give out in-betweens.\", Anthony replies quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\", Burt screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you should be happy. I'm actually starting to whip that body of yours into shape.\" The deer kneels down beside his student, and then pulls up one sleeve of his sweater. \"Wow. I didn't know your arms were that big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't much, but Burt was definitely getting some definition in his arms. This came as a surprise to the bear too, since his arms were flabbier just yesterday. \"Uhhh...neither, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe studly deer stands himself back up, \"You're on your way.\", he winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Whoa. Is he...actually proud of me?\", Burt thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer ushers with his bulging arm, \"Come on. Let's go grab a bite to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich reminds Burt, \"Oh. Uh, I gotta go do something first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok sure. But hurry back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt turned from Anthony and made his way to the river cave with the mushrooms. Burt retraced his steps to the entrance of the dark cave. He took a deep breath and said, \"I must be out of my mind.\" The husky bear went into the darkness once again. He walked through blackness until he reached a ray of sunlight beaming from the ceiling. The sunlight shined on the mushrooms Burt tried the other day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt squatted to the ground and picked a few mushrooms. He looked at them in his paw and sighed. \"I hope I don't regret this,\" he said. Burt opened his mouth and swallowed the mushrooms. At first he didn't feel anything. Then he felt a familiar stomach ache like the one from the other day. The pain was like a stubborn cramp. Burt covered his stomach with both his arms. He suddenly felt a strange warmth coming from his stomach. Burt could discribe it but it was like the pain when from unbearable to soothing. As his paws were still on his stomach, Burt felt something very strange: his stomach was shrinking. The fat around Burt's waist was melting until Burt's arms ran all around the waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as mysteriously as it appeared, the pain was gone. Burt had no idea what happened. He felt completely fine now. Burt stood up completely puzzled. He then realized his sweater was feeling a bit loose. Burt could have sworn it fit him perfectly just this morning. He lifted the tail of his sweater and shirt. Burt was baffled. There was no fat on his waist anywhere. Lean and slightly defined muscle took its place. Burt placed his paw on his stomach to be sure if it truly was his own body. His jaw dropped. He covered with his shirt and sweater again. \"These...these mushrooms,\" Burt started, \"They...they somehow made me stronger, made me build more muscle!\" Burt then rolled up his sleeve to show a bit more defined arm than the one Anthony showed him. The bear curled his arm to bulge a slight bicep. It wasn't much but it was enough to make Burt smile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Man.. what way to start the day. As Burt stepped outside the cave he took a minute to lok back. From this far away he couldn't see the mushrooms growing, but they were still on his mind. \"oh wow... if they can melt fat like this off anyone. I wonder what would happen if I ate more?\" Before burt could ponder that a bit further he looked at his watch and almost gasped. He was going to get chewed out by Anthony again if he showed up late to lunch. That was something he wasn't eager to do. and just when he was starting ot get some respect from him too.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n In a quick burst, Burt began sprinting back towards the area he'd been before. No doubt Anthony would be waiting still.. at least Burt hoped he was. He didn't fee llike getting yelled at again. Burt didn't now why that guy was so full of himself. It really ticked him off, but what could he do? This guy was his boss until he was given the college credit for the course. As he came close to the woodworking site. He was relieved to see that Anthony was still hanging around.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs Burt came in close, Anthony waved his hand and gestured for himt o come close. \"Your eady to go? What took so long? I almost thought you'd gotten lost.\" Burt frowned a bit. Man even when he seemed ot be joking he was a bit of a jerk.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Come on Im not that bad. It's not like I haven't been outside before.\" Anthony had a big smirk on his face and he shook his head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Could have foled me. With that pudge on your gut, It doesn't look like you ever really set foot outsaide except for school.\" Burt almost felt like punching Anthony.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHowever, Burt restrained himself and followed Anthony to the food. Burt and Anthony made their way to the cafeteria, got their own trays of sandwiches and sat at the same table. Anthony was chugging his food down while Burt barely touched his. Burt was still contemplating on what happened to him back at the cave. He grew more scared sitting next to Anthony worried that he might find out his secret. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You okay, Burt?\" asked Anthony.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh, um, yeah,\" stuttered Burt. \"I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Then you better start eating. When we're done here it's back to work.\" Burt gave out a puff of air. Anthony added, \"And if you give me an attitude I'll add more work for you. Got it?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBurt tried taking his time eating but he could only stall for so long. Anthony gave him a time limit to finish his lunch or work hungry. So Burt finished and headed back to the woods with Anthony. Anthony gave Burt an axe and said, \"You know what to do.\" Burt followed Anthony's orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt gripped the axe tightly. It felt lighter to him since he last ate the mushrooms. Burt felt like he had more energy than before. He just hoped that it was enough to get Anthony off his back. Burt took a swing at a random tree trunk and he was amazed to see the axe sunk halfway through the tree! He pulled it out with ease and struck again. The tree came crashing down. Anthony was amazed to see Burt cut a tree so quickly but he assumed that it was the result of pushing Burt. Burt continued chopping the wood at the same steady yet quick pace. At the end of the day, Burt cut seven trees. Anthony was very pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good work today!\" said Anthony grabbing Burt's shoulder. \"See what happens when you stick with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...yeah...\" said Burt. \"I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be modest! You did a good job today! I'm impressed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt couldn't believe what he was hearing. Was Anthony actually proud of him? \"Really?\" asked Burt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I know I push you hard but look where it's getting you! We'll make this cabin in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt turned his ears. \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony chuckled. \"You didn't think I was making you cut this wood for nothing, did you? We're going to build a cabin with the wood at the end of the course. We almost have enough thanks to your hard work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, thanks.\" Burt didn't know what to say. A cabin? How in the world was he going to build a cabin? Burt was too scared to think about it. He just wanted to be done. \"So...am I done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you can go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Burt walked away from Anthony, he couldn't help but be amazed on what he did and what Anthony said (apart from the cabin). He was getting strength and praise from eating a few mushrooms. Burt wondered what would happen if he ate more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater when it was night time, Burt walked into the mushroom cave carrying a flashlight. He reached the mushroom stash which were revealed in the moonlight. Burt place the flashlight on the ground and took off his shirt revealing a tank top that he kept at the back of his closet. Burt reached down and grabbed another handful of mushrooms. He smiled and said, \"Let's see how big I can really get!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Burt gobbled down the handful of mushrooms he had in his paw. Shortly after he swallowed, Burt felt a familiar tightness and burning in his chest. This time, it felt more intese than the last time. Burt knelt on his hands and knees over the pain. He growled slightly as his chest began to fill his tank top. The fat on his waist was quickly melting away. His pecs began to thicken as a six pack began to emerge right below them. His arms swelled to a new size and grew more defined and vascular. Veins began to slither across his arms to deliver blood and power to his new strength. Burt's legs grew to the size huge pythons. The tendons in his legs thickened and coiled as his thighs were shaped into perfect tear drop form. His calves plumped to a new peak. Burt could feel power running through him. He could also feel his bones shifting as if he was getting taller. Burt stood up and let out a grizzly roar at the climax of his growth. After what felt like forever, Burt's transformation was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt took a deep breath of relief and another one in awe as he saw his body. He looked down to his chest and saw clear pec and abs definition underneath his tank top. He looked down further to see his legs grew longer and stronger. They reminded him on the trees Anthony forced him to cut down but Burt's legs were indestructable. Burt then saw how big his arms got and smiled. He raised his right and flexed hard on his bicep. His bicep grew to the size of a melon. Burt's smile grew wider seeing the power he now held inside his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so awesome!\" Burt said. \"I feel incredible! It looks like I'm about the same size as Anthony! Wait till he sees me like this!\" Burt turned back to the mushrooms. A thought struck his brain: why should Anthony see him as the same size when Burt can grow even bigger with the mushrooms. Burt smiled. There was no question. He had to be bigger than Anthony. Burt figured it was time to see how Anthony felt like being the small one. Burt grabbed not one but two handfulls of mushrooms! He licked his lips and said, \"Let's see Anthony pick on me now!\" He then jammed both handfulls ravenously into his maw and swallowed them whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first nothing happened. Burt waited for one minute.. then two.. then ten. Maybe  the mushrooms could only do so much. Burt sighed softly in a bit a bit of disappointment. He had been loking forward to really sticking it to Anthony and showing him that he wasn't a bear to be messed with, but he supposed this size was good enough to prove his point. Even without growing any bigger, he was still a very big bear now. Burt grinned as he  brought up his left arm and flexed, giving the bicep asqueeze before he decided to go on and leave. As he was walking away from the mushrooms he was struck with a sharp pain in his stomach that caused him to stumble and fall to his knees with a loud cry. It was like someone decided to grab his intenstines and twist them all into balloon animals.  His hands pressed hard against the ground, his teeth clenched tightly as he tried to calm down, but each breath brought on a fresh wave of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, did I eat too many? Are they going to kill me?\" Burt  had to hold in a scream as the pain spread down to his fingers and toes. It was immense and he wasn't sure how long he could take it before he passed out. The pain had begun flaring up into an intense heat. It burned his body like he'd decided to press himself against a heated furnace. It burned intensely and a gutteral cry of pain ripped itself from his vocal cords before he felt his bones and joints popping and heard them cracking loudly. As he clenched his eyes, he was aware on a very basic level that his clothes had begun feeleing tighter. Through his blinding paina nd agony his body had actually begun growing. It started in his legs which began swelling up to peaks of unbelievable heights of raw power. The muscles rippling and throbbing, every eartbeat that passed his legs were swelling up like balloons. Unlike balloons though, these legs could kill if he kicked someone hard enough. The raw power and the vascularity would make other men stare in envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the growing began slowing in his legs, it began picking pu in other areas. His abdomen throbbed and coiled, the muscles moving almost like there was something squirming around under his skin and fur and a whole new row of abs formed, giving his a solid monstrous looking Eight pack of abs. Thick snake like veins snakes their way down the abs. You cvou;ld see every heartbeat as the vein vibrated with every pump of his blood from his heart. His pecs almost doubled in size as they were flooded witht he intense energy that was making his bodsy grow. Puffing out, this muscular veins spider webbing across them as they grew into almost pillow sized Pectorals... well if there were such a thing as spider web pillows. His arms were the last to grow, but the change was explosive. The biceps pulsed and flexed of their own accord. Each flex they actually began getting bigger. Swelling up, gaining inch after inch of pure muscular thickness. Ther was not an ounce of fat to be seen on those muscular arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the growing had begun slowing the pain began dying down.  Burt  remained on his hands and knees, panting hard when a loud wild roar erupted from his lungs. He sounded and felt like a wild animal. It took several minutes before Burt wqas able to finally stand up again. He was sweating profusely even as he tok his first step towards the outside of the cave. Witht hat first step came another... and then another. One by one until his paws touched the cool grass and rocks just outside. He breathed heavily for several minutes afterward. Sucking in as much air as he could each time. It was like his body was trying to adjust to taking in enough oxygen for such a massive body now. As he looked down he realized he wasn't wear his tanktop anymore. A look back intot he cave where he'd been collapsed revealed the sweat covered shirt, completely torn apart by his growing muscles without his knowing. As he slowly took int he sight. He found himself  having issues moving because the pants now hugged his legs so firmly. It was like having a second skin over his fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt took in one more deep breath of air as he Brought up his left arm and flexed. As that massive mountain reached it's peak, the familiar snakes that were his veins popped out of the fur. It was an incredible feeling as he used his right hand to squeeze and rub this new monstrous bicep of his. He didn't know that the mushrooms could have such immensely potent results. He'd even managed to get even taller than before. Al int he name of his muscles needing to fill out into a body that worked best. A great big toothy grin spread over Burt's face. \"This is amazing! There is no way Anthony would ever mess with me again.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Burt was filled with happiness and power. He flexed his arms in several different poses and pleased with each result of big thick muscle. Burt couldn't stop but feel his arms and his chest with his gigantic paw. Not only did he look strong, he felt strong. Burt let out another roar of happiness out of his lungs. \"This is so incredible!\" said Burt in a new deeper voice. \"All this from mushrooms! Who would've thought!\" Burt's muscles burned with energy. The giant grizzly thought he could wrestle a giant animal...or a particularly large deer. Burt thew a fist into his hand and said, \"I can't wait to see Anthony's face when he sees me! He'll never tell me to pick up another axe again!\" Burt really wanted to find Anthony and teach him a lesson but Burt had no idea where he could be at night. He then shrugged. There was plenty of time to find Anthony. Right now, Burt thought it was time to have fun with his muscles. Pictures ran through Burt's head: working out at the gym with slightly smaller jocks, flirting with the girls, performing impossible feats of strength, the possibilities were endless for Burt. He didn't know where to start. Then it hit him. Burt remembered that there was going to be a party at the lake near the school. Normally Burt wouldn't go to a party because no one would either talk or look at him. He figured that was going to change with his new size and shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt thought it would be fun to take a swim in the lake, flex for some girls, and maybe even challenge some of the bigger guys. Burt's smile grew along with his excitement. As he took his first step to the lake, he had another thought: what if he encounters another guy that maybe bigger than him? Burt couldn't let that happen. He had to be the biggest, so he ran back to the cave and packed a few mushrooms in his pocket. \"Just in case,\" said Burt. Burt then rushed his new muscled body to the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt ran to the top of a hill that overlooked the lake. As he looked down, he was almost overwhelmed. He heard loud music all the way from where he was standing, saw several people talking and playing, and smelled food cooking on grills. Burt took a deep breath. The old him would have turned around and went back home. Not tonight. This was the night of the new and improved Burt. He flexed a bicep in confidence and walked down the hill to the party. The music grew louder as he got closer and people looked out to see something big and hulky  was coming towards them. They were all amazed to see a giant shirtless bodybuilding sized bear approach the party. No one had any idea who Burt was. Burt assumed no one would recognize him since they did not acknowledge him to begin with. He just smiled waved at some of the party goers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt looked around to see everyone was having a fun time. Some were swimming in the lake and talking to each other on land. He was ready to be part of the fun. Burt looked around and saw a group of three girls sitting next to their own grill. They were a tigress, a lioness, and wolf. Burt smiled thinking, \"Surely they would want some meat from these bones!\" Burt cracked his knuckles and made his way to their position. The girls were lost in their own conversation until a shadow blocked the light from their grill. They all went from fear to awe as they saw a giant muscular bear approach them. The girls looked up and down Burt's body and loved the results: thick strong arms, rippling chest, and powerful legs. \"Mind if I join you?\" asked Burt with new found confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" said the tigress. \"Please have a seat!\" Burt did as he was told and sat on the ground next to the tigress and wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you workout some,\" said the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's was mostly a growth spurt,\" said Burt. He then raised his arm and flexed a big bicep for the girls. They were truly amazed by this powerhouse bear. They could Burt's bicep rupture right out of his fur with veins snaking across his whole bicep. Burt smiled and continued, \"A really big growth spurt!\" Burt let out a loud laugh and the girls followed.  Burt still held out his arm and said, \"Anyone want to feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do!\" said the lioness. The lioness got to Burt's side and placed her hand on his gigantic arm. Her hand covered merely a small part of his bicep but it felt interesting to her. It felt soft and cool with his fur but his muscles felt warm and hard. She stroked feeling every vein and crevice that made it so vascular. Burt thought the lioness's hand very soft against his arm. He never thought a girl would show affection like this towards him. The lioness even tried squeezing the bicep to find that it was hard as steel. She couldn't find any hint of fat anywhere on his arm or anywhere else on Burt's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your arms are incredible! You must go to the gym a lot to get  arms like these.\" A soft red tint  spread over Burt's cheeks as he smiled and shook his head. Even if he told the truth, no one would ever believe him about the mushrooms. So he decided to let them believe what they wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was a painful process I'll tell you that, but the results were worth it.\" Burt gave the lioness a grin as he flexed his bicep even harder than it was one. Thick vascular veins exploding like netting all over his muscles. \"Wouldn't you agree.\" It took a few moments for the lioness to collect herself. She was almost in a daze as her paws slid up and down the bicep. Burt had to admit he really loved the feel of this girl's hands on his biceps. Feeling it as if were some amazing treasure rather than the result of some rather potent mushrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so amazing...\" The next hour or so passed by in a blur for Burt. It seemed there was always someone who wanted to come feel his muscles or admire them. Whether it was girls or guys. Some just wanted to feel those muscles, others wanted to stare in awe at their power. At least a couple times Burt found himself chatting with a couple other males who were rather muscular themselves. It was such a blast receiving so much praise for them. Burt could really get used to all the attention. However before long he began to get a bit tired. Such a drastic transformation had given him some energy, but most of it had been used up with the growth and he excused himself to head back to his dorm room, much to the disappointment of more than a few ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Burt was heading back a Familiar shape heading towards the party. Strong muscular body, that face.. oh  great it's Anthony. Burt bit his lip nervously. So far he'd been pok because no one he knew had been at the party, but if Anthony recognized him, he was really  going to have a hard time explaining what happened to him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as Burt would love to show off to Anthony, the giant bear knew it would be hard to explain. Burt turned the other way and took a detour home. Burt squeezed into his dorm feeling absolutely incredible. He had a new body, some new friends, and a new life. He couldn't wait to see what tomorrow held. Since tomorrow was Saturday, Burt had all weekend to hang out and show off. He was looking forward to it. However, Burt's sleepiness overpowered his enthusiasm. It was time to call it a night. Burt stretched out his arms plumping out his biceps and triceps to mountainous peaks. His chest also puffed up from a big yawn. Burt took off his shoes and pants (leaving his boxers on) and went to bed to sleep soundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight from his dorm window hit Burt's eyes and shined on his fur making his muscles look even more defined and chiseled during the day. Burt woke up feel even more energetic and powerful than last night. All he needed was good night's rest after the intense transformation he took on. Burt got up from bed and looked through his closet for a pair of pants. Most of them wouldn't fit his new thick legs now but he managed to find a pair of elastic gym shorts. It wasn't much but it would have to do. Burt put them on and thought they looked really good on him. The elastic band of his shorts was able to wrap around his waist perfectly. The legs of the shorts filled his ripped thighs completely. Burt could still see tendons and crevices bulging through the clothing. As for a shirt, Burt didn't feel like he needed one. He thought everyone needed to see his great body with no shirt to cover them. He then got on his shoes, grabbed the mushrooms he packed from last night, and walked out on the hunt for some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt walked outside feeling pumped. His muscles were begging for let out some energy and Burt was ready to see what he could really do. He thought what better place to test his strength than the gym. With his new size and strength, Burt knew he could lift a heavy amount of weight. If he couldn't, he always had the spare mushrooms that he brought. Without question, Burt headed off to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt walked in smelling the masculine scent in the air: sweat and hard work. The big grizzly cracked his knuckles ready to take on some weights. He confidently strolled into the weight room ready to use and show off his muscles. Burt looked through the equipment and tried to figure out which one to try first. He then turned to see a rack of various sized dumbbells. The weights went from ten pounds on one end to a thousand pounds. Burt knew he could handle a good amount of weight but he didn't know how much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes looked at the three hundred pound dumbbells. He figured that would be a good place to start. Burt reached for them and pulled them up to his chest. He was surprised how light they felt. For three hundred pounds, the dumbbells felt nothing to Burt. He smiled feeling satisfied that he could easily lift three hundred pounds. The dumbbells were put back because Burt didn't think they'd give him a decent workout. He wanted something more challenging. Burt then looked at the five hundred pounds. As he lifted them up, Burt thought they were just right. They were heavy but enough do a good number of reps with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt loved his workout. He smiled seeing both his veiny biceps swelling and relaxing between each rep. After Burt's fifteenth rep, a burly and muscular tiger entered the room. Burt recognized him as Joel, the nurse. Joel turned and was surprised to see a hulking bear sitting on bench lifting weights. Joel was impressed. He also went to the dumbbells and picked up the seven hundred pound weights and sat next to Burt. Burt was a bit nervous. He was scared Joel might recognize him. Burt didn't know what to say or do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't seen you before,\" said Joel. \"You new here?\" Seemed like Joel didn't recognize Burt after all. That was good. Burt decided to play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah,\" replied Burt. \"I've heard good things about this gym so I thought I'd take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool,\" said Joel. \"I know it did some good things for me!\" Joel put down a weight and raised his right arm to Burt. As Joel flexed, his bicep grew into an even bigger mountain than Burt's. Veins coiled around the tiger arm pumping blood and adrenaline to give Joel more power. The size of the bicep was phenomenal. It was much bigger than Burt's bicep. Then again, after close examination, Burt saw Joel was bigger than him. A seed of jealousy was planted into Burt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like a big strong tiger!\" said Burt trying to be polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well you look like a big strong bear!\" replied Joel. He then handed out his paw out to Burt. \"I'm Joel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt froze for a second. He couldn't give Joel his real name. He had to think quick. Burt reached Joel's paw and said, \"I'm Grant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt continued to workout with Joel. They both enjoyed each other's company. However, it irritated Burt how Joel overpowered him in every way. Joel lifted more and he stood at least a foot taller than the muscled bear. However, Burt did what he could to hide it. After about an hour, Joel said goodbye to Burt and left the gym. Burt huffed a breath. He thought he was the big guy in town only to be proven wrong. Burt then remembered the mushrooms he brought with him and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt rushed to the shower room. He looked around and saw no one was there. For safety, Burt squeezed into the shower stalls and closed the curtain. He then pulled out the mushroom he plucked last night and smiled. \"I'm going to be the big guy here!\"     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Burt chewed on the few mushrooms he carried with him. Despite the results, he hoped that this change won't be as intense as the last one. In retrospect, Burt remembered he ate a lot of mushrooms then. He figured that the amount of mushrooms you eat reflects on how much you grow. Since he only ate a few, Burt thought he wouldn't grow that much but enough to beat Joel's size and strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt waited a few minutes and still didn't feel anything. He knew it would happen; he just needed to be patient. He didn't dare move out of the shower stall. He was afraid that someone might walk in during his growth. Burt couldn't risk his secret being exposed. He didn't want to think about what would happen. Before Burt could think any further, he felt his stomach growing upset. He smiled thinking, \"Yes!\" The change began slow and gradual. As he took in each deep breath the stomach cramps began lessening in pain. Becoming a strong heat that slowly spread from his abs all down from the tips of his fingers and toes to the strands of his hair. As the heat increased over time Burt had to lean against the wall. Each growth spurt took a lot of energy as his body worked to feed it into his muscles and bones to make them bigger, stronger, tougher. As he took in a deep breath, he let out a sharp groan of a pained cramp and a tad amount of pleasure. He was starting to enjoy these growth spurts. Feeling his muscle grow to new peaks of power. At that moment that began happening. His legs, which had already been massive to begin with were now growing even thicker, slowly stretching as he grew taller with it. Sharp cracks as his bones moved, slowly growing thicker and further apart to take in the new height and muscle density.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven while his legs were still growing, the effects had begun spreading up his body. His abs began flexing on their own, thick veins popping up and moving like the twisted winding roads in a countryside all of the rock hard ridges of his eight pack as they grew even larger. Each row looked as chiseled as stone. Burt was almost tempted to see what he could do with his abs with them flexed like this.  He'd love to see how hard a hit he could take with this almost steel like wall of muscle. His pecs began growing as well, although this only grew a little it still was fairly significant. They began puffing out further than before. They didn't look like a woman's breasts though. There was not an ounce of fat in each once as they looked more oval shaped than the roundness of a woman's chest. And these were solid muscle. As he took in great breaths those pecs filled out even more, bulging pythons that were his veins snaked across each one before spreading across his shoulders and down his biceps. As his heart pumped his growing body harder and harder, his biceps begin swelling up. They were big before, but.. dear god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as Burt  managed to stand up, his biceps continued growing, pushing one inch.. then two.. then four.. than a solid seven inches higher than their previous height. He was a true monster of a bear now. There was no one on campus who could compare to these massive guns. Even as his body began slowing down, Burt let out a growl of pure happiness.  Bringing up his newly pumped up arms to his chest and flexing them hard, his body practically exploded with the raw definition. He looked like a true god of muscle. He bet he could easily pump those weights he'd been lifting earlier and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt squeezed his godly frame out of the shower stall still a bit wobbly from his growth. He noticed a full sized mirror between the showers and the lockers and rushed up to it. Burt's mouth dropped but quickly brought back up with a grin almost as big as his new muscles. Burt could see clean cut defined power on every inch on his body. His legs looked stronger and tougher than an iron pillar. Because of his leg's new size, Burt's gym shorts looked almost like a speedo. More muscle to show off, Burt thought. Burt's chest, however, looked more defined and bigger than ever before. His washboard abs looked like an indestructible wall with thick veins stretching from his waist up to his pecs which were like thick boulders shoved into his chest. Burt rubbed his pecs and abs feeling the warm new strength they now contained. His thick fingers followed the bulge and crevice of his chest. Burt pounded his chest with a fist feeling satisfied with his new powerful rock pile of a chest. He then raised his right arm in front of the mirror. Burt pushed his arm as hard as he could and smiled with glee as his bicep grew to a new incredible size. If Burt did his measurement correctly, his bicep now stood at a peak of thirty two inches. He saw how the tendons in his arms coiled into a powerful force with thick veins snaking across from his shoulder to his wrist. Finally, Burt noticed he grew taller from his growth, possibly a foot. Before he was shorter than Joel by a few inches. Now, Burt overpowered Joel in size and strength. The tiger was no longer the big guy on campus. Burt laughed to himself in complete satisfaction. \"This is amazing!\" said Burt in a new deeper voice. \"No way Joel can match me now! No way ANYONE can match me now!\" He raised both arms, flexed hard, and said, \"I'm the biggest and strongest guy in school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" The huge bear turned around to see a lean looking wolf standing next to him. The wolf had some solid muscle on him but he was nothing compared to Burt. It was like comparing a mountain to a hill. Burt felt embarrassed thinking he just heard what he said. He tried to shrug it off with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" said Burt \"I guess I got a little carried away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why!\" exclaimed the wolf. \"You're huge! How in the world did you get so big?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt didn't like lying but he couldn't tell the truth either. So he tried hinting the truth by saying, \"Well, like everyone else, I do my workouts but I also have a growth spurt or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Growth spurts?\" repeated the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt nodded. \"Yeah, really big growth spurts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt raised his arms again to flex his biceps once again. The wolf was amazed. He didn't think arms could get that big. Burt then performed other poses that emphasized his chest and legs, which got the same reaction from the wolf. The wolf grew envious of Burt's body as each pose passed. He wondered what he had to do to get a body like that. Burt could tell just by looking at the wolf he was growing envious but that didn't stop him. Burt kept posing until he felt like he put on a good show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see,\" said Burt. \"They helped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" agreed the wolf. \"Umm...mind if I feel your bicep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt nodded and knelt his giant form in front of the wolf. Burt then took his arm and flexed his bicep in front of his audience. The wolf placed his paw on the thick ball of power and it was unlike anything he felt. He felt warm energy emitting deep inside it. With the veins, the wolf could also see and feel Burt's heart pounding to feed his muscles to stay strong and tough. The wolf's muzzle dropped and Burt's smile widened. Burt figured he could get used to being the muscle god of the school.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Burt walked out of the showers feeling like he was floating on a cloud, a cloud big enough to carry his weight that is. He strolled back into the weight room as other people stared in awe and envy of him. He got a lot more attention than before and he loved it. Burt entered the weight room again to see what his even bigger muscles could do now. He looked back at the dumbbells but the weight bar next to the rack caught his eye. Burt smiled knowing he could take that bar no problem. He approached the bench and noticed only about fifty pounds of weight were on the bar. The extra weights lied on the side of the bench. Burt knew he could handle fifty easily. It would be a feather to him. He needed to put on some more weight on the bar. He grabbed all the weights and slid them into the bar. The bar looked like it had giagantic blocks on each end. Burt didn't know how much the bar weight now but he didn't care. He was full of confidence that his muscles wouldn't let him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt lied his massive body on the bench and placed his hands on the bar. He chuckled softly heaved the bar off the bench. As Burt expected, the giant weight felt very little to him. This made Burt grunt happily as he raised the bar up and down for his reps. Burt's biceps swelled to new huge peaks as the bear raised the bar and his chest puffed up to new definiton and power. The workout felt good. Burt could feel the burning of his workout in his chest and arms and he loved it because the burning was similar to the burning sensation from his growths. Burt didn't bother counting the number of reps he was doing. He felt like he could keep doing it forever and  his muscles would never tire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his hundreth rep, Burt was interrupted by a voice, \"Hey there,\" Burt turned to see it was a familiar face, a lioness. Burt set the bar back into place and stood up on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" greeted Burt. \"You're that girl from the lake party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness nodded. \"I thought I'd get a quick workout and that's when I saw you.\" She then noticed the huge bar Burt was lifting. \"Working hard, I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet!\" Burt replied. He stood up and looked down at the lioness so she could see all his muscle glory. \"Gotta keep this body in tip top shape!\" Burt then curled his arm downward in front of his chest and flexed his bicep in front of her. The lioness lost breath at this sight. Burt bicep coiled into a bigger ball of muscle than she remembered last time when she touched it. Behind his arm was a set of steel cut abs and pecs. They were more defined and chiseled too. She then looked up to Burt thinking he may have grown a bit taller than the last time she saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it my imagination, or did you get bigger from the last time I saw you?\" asked the lioness. Burt got nervous about her suspicion but he knew how to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, well after I met you and your friends, I felt  inspired to get bigger for you!\" Burt then smiled and winked making the lioness blush red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a bit of a flirt, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That a bad thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed with each other. \"You know, I was just about done in here,\" said Burt. \"Want to walk out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of a gym with a bodybuilding bear...the lioness thought it was a dream come true. \"Sure!\" The two walked out of the door and the lioness almost forgot something. \"You know...I never got your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt smiled and offered his meaty hand to her. \"I'm Burt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness accepted his hand which covered her own hand completely in the shake. \"I'm Tanya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt and Tanya wandered aimlessly around campus just talking. While people passing by were staring at Burt, Burt didn't notice them. He got lost in his conversation with Tanya. He enjoyed her company. Tanya was smart, funny, and beautiful. Burt couldn't ask for someone better to talk to. Tanya couldn't stop staring at Burt and his frame. The sun beamed down onto Burt fur making his godly muscles glow. Tanya did her best to keep her composure but Burt knew she couldn't stop looking passionately at him. \"So, Burt,\" started Tanya, \"What got you started on being big?\" Burt didn't know what to say. He didn't want to lie to her but he couldn't say he just ate some mushrooms. He had to hint some truth somehow. Burt had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, would you believe me that I used to be several feet shorter and fat?\" Tanya shook her head and scoffed in disbelief. \"It's true! I was short and fat. People would make fun of me and force me to work out.\" Tanya had trouble picturing Burt as he was before. How could a titan like bear used to be short and chubby bear? It was almost impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding!\" exclaimed Tanya. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, during the workouts I had a bit of a growth spurt and I took advantage of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You definitely did! What do the guys who picked you think now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I haven't seem them since I got big. But I bet they'd be surprised!\" Burt then flexed a bicep playfully to Tanya and she laughed agreeing with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya and Burt grew fond of each other on their walk. They got lost in their conversations that they didn't realized they walked to the lake. Tanya took notice and giggled. \"We're right back where we started,\" she said referencing the party. Burt looked out to the crystal sparkling lake and smiled at its beauty. He then smiled at the beauty next to him. Tanya noticed his smiling at her and asked, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I forgot to do something for you back at the party,\" said Burt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me show you!\" Burt walked Tanya to the shore of the lake and Tanya sat on a spot of grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you want to show me?\" asked Tanya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\" exclaimed Burt.  As Tanya looked on in confusion, she let out a loud gasp as Burt took two steps back towards the water. Witht he sun pouring down on him it made him look like some ancient god, muscles radiating with their power. As he brought his left arm up front front of his chest he stopped. Taking a step forward he pivoted his hips so that he chest remained forward and he flexed his biceps. Those thick mountain like hills of raw muscle exploded with definition. The vascularity at an almost unnatural level as the veins began crisscrossing those biceps. Tanya let out a low whistle and clapped her paws together lightly. \"Oh wow! You really know how to put on a show.\" Burt gave her a wink before a grin spread over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm just getting started.\" As Tanya stared stared on in awe Burt returned to his starting positon and took a step forward. As he breathed out he brought both both arms up in a classic body builder's pose. Raising both arms until his paws were just above his head and he sucked in a breathe and flexed his entire torso and arms. To Tanya, it was like watching a work of art being created right in front of her eyes. The amount of definition that erupted into life was unbelievable. The veins blew out  like thick noodles of spaghetti al over his body. From the  massive biceps that were as hard as granite down to his rigid eight pack that could grind meat into fine slices. Burt, this bear before her practically was a god. A real god of muscle, it was absolutely breathtaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt relaxed his muscles and looked towards Tanya. \"What did you think?\" asked Burt. Tanya stood up, walked up to him, and placed her left hand on Burt's bulgy abs. Her fingers went up and down his washboard chest feeling the unlimited power they contained. Burt thought Tanya's hand felt good on his chest. It was as warm as his own muscles when he felt them. \"I thought you were amazing!\" said Tanya. \"You definitely know how to show off...and how to show a girl a good time.\" Burt's cheeks turned red as he grew shy. For such a big guy, Burt felt wobbly when Tanya admires his godly strength.</span></div></div>",

With the sun's reflection beaming back to their eyes, the lake looked like a pure sapphire. Burt wrapped his vascular arm around Tanya and Tanya hugged his waist. Burt took a deep breath making his chest puff up and more defined. \"This is so nice,\" said Burt. Tanya nodded, \"Yeah, I've had a good time with you.\" She then rubbed her hands against Burt's massive abs making him blush. Tanya giggled, \"For a big guy, you can be a bit shy!\" Burt returned the laugh. \"Only if I see cute girls like you.\" Tanya then became the one who was blushing.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe two continued staring into the lake until Tanya asked a question. \"Say Burt, by any chance, have you ever went professional with your muscles?\" Burt wasn't sure how to answer. \"Uhh, no, I haven't. To be perfectly honest, I've never competed in bodybuilding competitons or anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya looked up to him surprised. \"Really? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't bulk up to compete; I did it to improve myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see...I know! How about I take pictures of you so you can see how improved?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt smiled at her. \"I'm in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya stood up and got in front him blocking the sun. She didn't want glare in the photos. She pulled a smart phone from her pants pocket and held it against her face. Burt stood up and curled his arms. \"Ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya snapped at his double bicep pose. His biceps were just as vascular and powerful as his show to Tanya. Burt then puffed up his chest. His pecs and abs bulged into solid stones of granite with thick veins feeding them even more power. Just for fun, Burt put out his right leg and tensed it. The tendons inside thickened and coiled into clean cut tear drop shapes. It looked like his shorts wouldn't be able to contain it (luckily it did). Tanya took photo after photo completely satisfied with each one. With a body like Burt's, it's hard to get a bad shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt relaxed his muscles and walked towards Tanya. \"How do they look?\" asked Burt. Tanya said, \"Take a look!\" She shared her smart phone so Burt could see there was a big and vascular bear taking up most of the screen on the phone! Each photo seemed that way but each showed a solid pose with clear defined and strong muscles. Burt smiled. \"I love it! I love them all!\" Tanya agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued taking photos until Tanya noticed the sunlight was dimming. A lot of time passed and it was getting dark. \"Well, looks like it's getting late,\" said Burt. Tanya nodded. \"Yeah, I should get this photos uploaded on the internet and call it a night.\" Burt felt nervous about her doing that but at the same time he felt excited. He couldn't wait to see people react to him online.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya stood in front of Burt. \"I really had a good time, Burt. You're...you're a really nice guy...and I'm not just saying that because you're big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think you're great too!\" said Burt, \"And I'm not saying that because you're cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Tanya stood up on her toes and pecked Burt on the cheek. \"Have a good night!\" she said before walking up the hill to campus. Burt fist pumped himself as a sign of accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Burt headed home, he visit the mushroom cave once again. He didn't intend on eating any.

Who would wake him up at eight o' clock in the morning? \"Coming!\" said Burt half awake. He rose from bed, stretched his bulging shoulders and rippling back, and walked towards the door without considering changing clothes. Burt opened the door while wearing just his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Burt heard a whistle from below. He looked down the see a slender looking lion in suit. The lion looked sharp with his clean blazer, brushed mane, and wide smile. \"Man, you are a big fella, aren't you?\" said the lion. Burt was confused. \"Umm...who are you?\" The lion smiled. \"I'm the guy who's going to change your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion helped himself in to Burt's dorm. \"What?\" asked Burt. The lion then explained. \"My name is Edgar, I'm Tanya's uncle and I wish to speak with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt's eyes widened leaving all traces of sleepiness. \"Tanya's uncle?\" Edgar nodded. \"Yes sir! You see, Burt, Tanya sent me those photos of you from yesterday and I just so happen to be a modeling sponsor for Galaxy Magazine.\" Burt's mouth dropped. Galaxy Magazine was the biggest fitness magazine ever! Burt collected those before he found the mushrooms because he would fantasize over how great it would be to be a muscle model. A sponsor from that magazine was in his room! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R..really?\" stuttered Burt. \"I read those!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you do! I'm just going to say it: Burt, I want you be a model for Galaxy Magazine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt's heart sunk like a rock. He couldn't believe his ears. \"Wait,\" said Burt, \"Let me get this straight...you...want me...to be a model?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar smiled wider. \"Absolutely! I'd be crazy not to ask you! I mean, you're huge! You're one of the biggest guys I've seen! We could you use to be an inspiration to others who want be all muscled up like you!\" Burt could see it now, his giant frame on the cover on the biggest fitness magazine and people envying and training to be like him. It sounded like a great opportunity but there was one problem: school. \"Well, that sounds like a great honor, sir!\" said Burt. \"I'd love to! But what about school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar waved his hand. \"Not to worry! We do our very best to keep your schedule as flexible as possible! You can still be a student or you can work full time with us! We pay very handsomely! You stick with us and you can retire early!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt couldn't believe it! This opportunity was getting better and better by the minute! Without thinking, Burt said, \"I'm in! When do I start?!\" Edgar clapped his hands with glee. \"Fantastic! Ok, this is a bit short notice but we have a shooting later this afternoon at the gym downtown. I will see you there!\" Burt nodded agreeing with him. Before Burt could say thank you and goodbye, Edgar made his way to the door and paused. \"Oh, almost forgot!\" Edgar passed a copy of a magazine to Burt. \"Here's the latest issue! Feel free to take a look!\" Burt accepted the gift happily and Edgar left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt spent the rest of his morning sitting on his bed looking at the magazine. He was so excited that he read it several times. He couldn't help but look at the size of the models in the magazine. They were all about the same size as he was. Then it occurred to him, how can he be a famous model if he looked just like the ones in the magazine? Burt figured he needed to stand out somehow. He then looked at the mushrooms that he placed on his desk after picking them.</span></div></div>",

Another bite from these and he could turn in the monster of muscle, a behemoth. Burt wasn't sure he wanted that. Or did he? If he grew more, he would stand out more than the other models (who were at his size). People would look up to him in desire and envy. Above all, Burt would be the muscle god of all muscle gods. No one could compare him to his size and strength. No one. He would be in several magazine issues and be the top model. He could even try bodybuilding and be the top dog without really trying. Burt smiled at this fantasy. He looked at the mushrooms again and gobbled them up.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe wait after eating the mushrooms was probably always the most anxious part of the process for Burt. He didn't know he if would grow a little or a lot. He didn't know if it would be painful or soothing, but regardless the changes were going ot be amazing. A few minutes passed before he finally began feeling that familiar pressure in his stomach. He had already stripped off his clothes aside from his boxers to stop himself from destroying any of his clothes in the growth, so he was reayd for it this time. When that first wave of pain hit, he had to grips the table to steady himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time he made himself grow, the pain seemed to lessen a little each time. Burt had to wonder if the mushrooms would reach a limit and he wouldn't grow anymore once the pain no longer affected him. He gasped loudly as he felt that wonderful heat now flooding through his body and he knew his body was ready to start growing. As usual the growth started in his legs, he wasn't sure why it always began there, but he thought it might be so his legs could support the rest of the body as it expanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing just how much bigger his legs could get. He thought he was massive before, but as he legs throbbed and flexed of their own accord, the muscles began growing even bigger. The teardrop shaped muscles beginning to swell out. It was like a sponge soaking up more liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more his legs grew, the more incredible they looked. Burt had no doubt he could probably crush a steel bar in his thighs now if he wanted to. He could likely run great distances and not even break a sweat. As the veins began spreading down his legs he had to cry out in a deep growl as a wave of nauseating pain hit him. His spine began cracking audibly in the room and he want faintly aware of himself almost rising from the floor, but it was actually his body growing bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his torso stretched further to meet the new height of his body, he clenched his abdomen tightly  and he bent down on one knee to stop himself from tumbling to the floor. His stomach muscle began flexing hard, those thick ridges, which once seemed like unmovable ridges were suddenly pushing downwards and to his surprise another ridge of muscle began pushing forward until he had an unbeatable ten pack. Right now he was feeling on top of the world. Slowly his body was transforming him into a god that would make everyone he came across swoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the heat spread up to his pecs he  had to bite his lip as the muscles began puffing out. Slowly they grew, swelling to the point that I-beams weren't as thick as his rock hard pecs were. As he beat his fist against his chest he was surprised to see they were like steel too. Unyielding even to his own strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then he felt that burning in his arms and his arm dropped almost immediately. Those biceps began expanding. His arms felt like they were straining against the heaviest weights imaginable. Burt like to imagine that he was bench pressing the mountains themselves to get their raw power as his thirty two inch biceps flexed out to their absolute max. Slowly the vascular veins began spreading across his biceps, pumping that burning hot blood through his biceps while they were swelling. Burt could only watch in awe as they grew inch after inch in size before finally slowing to a stop at thirty six inches. Burt had to sink onto his large paws as he breathed heavily when the growing finally stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he could stand again, the results were absolutely astounding. No one would ever be able to compete with his muscles. He felt so powerful now. Burt felt like he could probably bench a mountain or two for real. \"Oh man. Look out world here I come.\"</span></div></div>",

He cracked his neck relieving the remaing tension from his latest growth. He then looked down and around his new godly body and was completely satisfied. Burt placed his right paw on his newly humongous pecs. He could feel they were stonger and tougher than ever. He could even feel his heart pounding harder to feed his muscles with blood and adrenaline.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBurt then reached his abs feeling the bulginess and sheer vascularity they held. He could feel the ridges and veins surrounding his new ten pack abs. He even counted the number of abs to be sure.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLastly, Burt raised his right arm and pushed hard to form a bicep. It was the biggest muscle he ever saw on anyone. It was a furry and fleshy mountain that reached an impossible peak. Burt could even see thick veins pulsating around it. When bodybuilders have guns, Burt had bombs for muscles and his biceps were like atomic bombs. He placed his left paw on his right bicep and felt the warmth and power erupting from it. His power was umlimited and Burt showed no signs of tireness despite his new growth.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBurt chuckled. \"Oh yeah! I'm going to be the biggest model around! I'm the muscle god of all muscle gods! No one can compare to me with this kind of power!\" Burt then noticed the time. It was almost time for the modeling shoot! Burt had to admire himself later when he got to the gym because he needed to go immediately. He went through his closet picking up a new pair of elastic gym shorts and a tank top. After a quick change, he was out of the room.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBurt ran off campus and into town very quickly. With his new golden legs, Burt had enough strength and speed to get to the shoot in no time. Burt finally arrived at the front of the gym. He didn't feel tired at all. He wasn't even out of breath. Burt pumped his arm and walked into the gym to start his new life. Inside, there were a couple furs, scales, etc., working out and getting a good pump. One of them is a bull lifting a 300-pound weight, who is almost as big as he is. Looks like his most recent growth spurt made him just a smudge bigger. He was pretty enticed by how pumped and chiseled the bull looked in his blue tank. His arm shriveled up an swelled with great strength with each pump. Guess this is what it's like to be at an actual gym, Burt thought.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ah! There's the star attraction!\" Burt's ears perked up, hearing Edgar walk up to him. He first takes a moment to check out the hardened bear. \"My, this is unexpected.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What?\" Burt raises up both his beefy arms behind his head, arching his upper body forward to flex out his thick pecs and ridged abs. \"That I may have gotten a tad larger since we last met?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No. That you came here wearing a tank-top. It's not really necessary.\", the lion rebuttals. \"But that too!\" Edgar shows Burt the way, walking up to the center of the gym where a few weight-lifting equipment rested, and where a few cameras stood around. \"Gettin' a good idea of where this is going?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBurt puts on a big grin, \"Sure do!\" A few of the gym folk start to take looks at the rippling bear as he walks up and sits on a benching equipment. Burt knew his body was ready, and couldn't wait to get it to work! \"So what do I gotta do?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh you know, a few poses here and there, a couple weights being lifted a few times, stuff like that.\", Edgar replies excitedly. \"Soon as we get these cameras up and running, you can go ahead and give yourself a good pump.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBurt gives his agent a thumbs up, \"All-right!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"So you must be the new model eh?\" Burt's eyes immediately lit up wide. That voice... He's heard that voice before. With a mere glance of his eyeballs, he takes a good, long, unexpected look at...his old college teach, Anthony. The bear's jaw went limp. Of everyone in town, HE works out here!? Burt was really worried at this point as sweat drips down his fur, seeing that the ol' was taking a good, long look at him. \"You know...you look really familiar. Like an old student of mine.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBurt's eyelid rose higher, his uncertain frown growing deeping. It took him a moment to even mutter a syllable. \"...O-...Oh. I-I do...?\", he stutters, turning his head away.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" He hums. \"You familiar with a kid named Burt Sayer?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBurt froze for a moment. \"......No.\", he mutters. \"Wha-why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnthony's expression started to dwindle. \"Well, it's just that this old student of mine has been gone for some time. He was my only student, but I guess I kinda overworked him a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt continued stuttering hoping to get Anthony's suspicion off of him. \"Well, I'll be on the lookout for him. If I see him I'll let you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar interrupted the two's conversation by talking to Burt. \"I've seen you've met our other model.\" Burt's heart dropped. \"Wait, he's a model?\" said Burt pointing to Anthony. Edgar nodded. \"Yes! And a very good one at that, which is why he's here. If you want, you two can share a shooting and see if we can get some decent shots with the two of you.\" Burt paused wondering what to do.</span></div></div>",

With his muscles, his modeling should be promising.\" Edgar nodded to Anthony and smiled. \"That sounds like a good idea! Is that ok with you, big guy?\" Burt agreed. He would do anything as long as he was not being interrogated by Anthony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" exclaimed Edgar. \"First things first, take off your shirt. We're going to need to see that massive chest of yours for the photos.\" Burt understood. He grabbed the tail of his shirt and pulled it above his head. Edgar, Anthony, and the rest of camera crew were amazed to see how defined and vascular Burt's chest was. It looked like a wall of clean cut diamonds. Burt's abs and pecs flexed without any of Burt's efforts and thick veins pulsated delivering all the power he could ever need. Anthony whistled impressed. \"Wow! That's an amazing chest you got there! Never seen anyone with a ten pack before!\" The deer then turned to Edgar. \"I can see why you picked him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, champ,\" started Edgar, \"We're going to start with simple poses and then make our way to the equipment. Doesn't matter which poses you do. Just show us what you got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt smiled. \"It'll be my pleasure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt raised his right arm doing a simple bicep pose. His bicep swelled to godly proportions as Burt flexed as hard as he could. It erupted with unlimited power and veins snaked across the bicep to insure the power it was losing during the pose. Burt's other bicep showed the same result of vascualrity as he raised his other arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt then grabbed a dumbbell from the rack near his position. He picked one up labed seven hundred pounds and returned to the cameras. Burt held the dumbbell in front of his chest and started doing reps. Cameras flashed when photographers saw not only his bicep swell under the enormous weight but his chest as well. As Anthony and Edgar thought Burt's chest couldn't get any bigger, it was right before their eyes. His abs and pecs bulged under the pressure making the crevices and the ridges even more defined. Anthony and Edgar couldn't believe it and Burt continued with a sly smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt then noticed a weighed bar on the side of the shooting site. He quickly grabbed feeling confident that he could lift it. Cameras began flashing more as Burt did some reps with the bar. Burt wanted to do more. The bar felt incredibly light to him so he lifted it up above his head with ease. Photographers began to blind him so they could savor the incredible feat. But they haven't seen anything yet. Burt then released one hand from the bar and did another bicep flex. Cameras flashed everywhere. Edgar never seen a model perform such a feat before, even Anthony had his mouth dropped. Everyone wanted a piece of the muscle god and Burt was happy to share himself with the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt then put the weight down and stretched his arms and back making his arms and chest puff up even more and the cameras flash a few times. \"Okay! That's enough!\" Edgar yelled to the photographers. Edgar rushed to Burt. \"Th...that was amazing! I've never seen a model as big as you work so well with the cameras! Your poses were perfect! Every last one! You have a future in this business, my friend!\" Burt blushed but he had a strong sense of pride brewing inside him. He knew he could deliver an excellent shooting and he did. Burt was so excited to have such a positive future for himself and he knew it was only going to get better from here. Anthony looked at Burt and gave him a thumbs up. \"You're gonna go far, newbie!\"</span></div></div>",

Burt never thought he would get so much praise before, let alone from Anthony. Burt rubbed the back of his head unintentionally bugling the arm he used to reach it. \"Thanks guys,\" said Burt. \"I'm glad you guys enjoyed the show!\" Edgar snapped his fingers and turned to Anthony. \"Say, Anthony, why don't you get ready for a shoot and show the new guy a few pointers?\" Anthony smiled. \"I would love to!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Excellent, I already got your things in the locker room. Go ahead and get changed.\" Anthony walked away to the locker room and Edgar turned his attention to the titan bear. \"You go ahead, take a rest, and get ready for the show Anthony's going to put on!\" Burt had to admit. Despite Anthony's treatment towards him, Burt was curious on how Anthony works as a model. What kind of poses will he do? How big is Anthony? All his questions would be answered in a few minutes.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnthony came back wearing nothing but a pair of spandex shorts and sneakers. The big deer had a solid defined chest with six pack abs and bowling ball sized pecs. Connected to his chest were tree trunk like legs that could kick a hole into anything and vascular arms that could lift anything. Burt was impressed. Although Anthony was nowhere near as big as Burt, Anthony had a good body to model. \u201cShow us what you got, Anthony!\u201d said Edgar.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nCameras started flashing the moment Anthony put on a smile. Anthony raised his arms and pushed them to incredible feats of definition and strength. Veins snaked across Anthony\u2019s biceps to deliver the energy the deer needed to continue his modelling. Anthony then crunched his chest making his pecs and abs bulge and expand right out of his chest. He then took a deep breath and raised his hands behind his head to show off more definition and vascularity of his chest. Cameras went off like fireworks that Burt couldn\u2019t see what Anthony was doing. Whatever it was, it must have been good because the cameras flashed for a solid three minutes. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cTake five, everyone!\u201d Edgar yelled to the photographers. The photographers mingled as Anthony walked towards Edgar and Burt. Edgar chuckled and said, \u201cYou never cease to amaze me!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI do what I can. What did you think, newbie?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBurt had to admit he was pretty impressed. Even though Anthony was not as big in muscle as Burt was, Anthony performed some great poses which would make fantastic photos. \u201cI think you did good,\u201d said Burt. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely a model.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnthony chuckled. \u201cWell so are you! I\u2019m definitely looking forward to modelling with you someday!\u201d Burt hoped it wouldn't happen anytime soon. He was worried Anthony would recognize him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d started Edgar, \u201cHow about you guys take a break so you can get ready for the party.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBurt\u2019s ears perked. \u201cWhat? What party?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYour party!\u201d Edgar smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re throwing a welcome party for you after joining the magazine! All of the top models of the magazine will be there and I know everyone is looking forward to seeing a big bear like you!\u201d Burt blushed rubbing the back of his head making his chest and arm unintentionally ripple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony grabbed Burt's shoulder and added, \"It's also a pool party! It's at this exclusive penthouse the magazine owns and it has a pool. Perfect place to show off!\" Burt loved the idea of showing off the actual models. With his size and strength, Burt knew he will blow everyone's mind at the party. It was a party for him. Burt never had a party for himself before. He couldn't help but be excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt pumped his arms and said, \"Let's party hard!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> As the car turned into the winding side road that led to the house where the party was at Burt felt a bit nervous. He had never had a party dedicated to him before. It was strange that not that long ago he was just a nameless bear in a crowd of college students and now here he was, one of the biggest bears around with muscles that could rival that of a god getting a party just for being so muscular. At the same time he was excited, he usually never went to parties like this... heck until he started eateing the mushrooms, the thought never crossed his mind, but now he was eager to have a good time and to really show off his body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n As the car passed through a small thicket of trees the house finally came into view. Resting at the end of the street surrounded by a beautiful looking stone fence sat the luxurious looking home. With deep blue walls and a light shade of a color Burt couldn't identify was used for the cermic tiles that made up the roof. It looked like a place a wealthy business owner would live so it made sense for the party to be at a place owned by such a popular magazinePull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling in to an arch the car made a stop next to a few other cars of similar design and color. It seemed like a lot of the models were driven around to parties like this. Though that made some sense to Burt. If they started drinking they would need a driver to take them home instead of getting hurt in a crash. Burt reached for the handle and pulled on it, the lock poping open and he stepped out. Out in the warm sunshine and the crisp clean air, Burt could smell the smoke of burning charcoal and mixed scent of cooking meat wafting on the wind from behind the house. It made his stomach growl with a fierce intensity that came from a need to fuel such a large body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt followed the scent to the backyeard of the house. Burt's eyes and mouth widened from the size of the yard. It was the biggest yard he has ever seen. There were lush green grass and trees following the stone walls of the yard, a massive pool and hot tub occupying most of the space, and a giant patio where hired cooks were preparing food on grills. Burt also couldn't help but be amazed at the guests of the party. There were men and women of various sizes and shapes. There was muscular tiger socializing with other muscled furs and a lean slender looking cheetah girl in a bikini ready for a swim in the pool. Burt knew all the guests were all models just like him. Burt smiled ready to meet them all. He pumped a bicep to himself and walked to the main event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Burt walked across the yard, he noticed Edgar talking to Anthony on the patio. Burt figured he meet Edgar first just to let him know he arrived. Burt walked up to Edgar until his hulking shadow covered Edgar. Edgar knew where the shadow came from and turned. \"There's the guest of honor!\" exclaimed Edgar. \"Glad you could make it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt smiled. \"Glad to be here! I would never miss this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're ready to have a good time,\" said Anthony referring to Burt's swim trunks hugging Burt's massive thighs and no shirt to hide the power in his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! You said this was a pool party and what better place to show off than that?\" said Burt pumping a bicep to the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great to hear!\" said Edgar. \"Come on, let's introduce you to the family!\" Edgar walked to the front of the pool and Burt followed nervously. Burt wasn't used to having so much attention but at the same time he was excited to start a new chapter in his life. \"Attention all!\" yelled Edgar to the other models. The models stopped and turned to Edgar and noticed the giant bear standing next to him. \"I'm glad you all could make it and hope you're having a great time. But allow me to introduce you to a big addition to our model family, and I mean BIG!\" Edgar pointed to Burt. \"This is Burt. As you can see, he's got what it takes to make our magazine even better! I hope you all can welcome him!\" Edgar then turned to Burt. \"Say, Burt, why don't you show them what you can do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt smiled and looked out to the audience. He raised both his arms and pushed his biceps as hard as he could. His arms swelled and grew to impossible peaks with veins stretching across. Burt then swung his arms to below his abs and tensed his chest making his pecs and abs bulge even more in definition and vascularity. Burt could see the male models looking in envy and females looking in desire. Burt finished posing and the models cheered and clapped for him. Edgar yelled to the audience, \"Welcome, Burt!\" Burt felt truly happy and like he belonged for the first time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Burt felt the warm welcome come from everywhere at the party. He thought the welcome was almost as big as his muscles...almost. Burt could see male models hanging out and showing off their muscles while female models were swimming in the pool and chatting on the patio. Burt didn't know where to start. Without knowing what else to do, Burt walked amongst the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt walked by the other party goers. He noticed stares from other models about his size and muscles. He playfully held out his bicep where he could hear small gasps and whispers saying, \"How did he get so big? Where did he come from? How can I get that big?\" Burt just chuckled to himself and continued walking around.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"My, you're a big bear, aren't you?\" Burt turned and almost blushed red in his cheeks. The muscular bear noticed a slender tigress in a bikini standing in his tall shadow. The tigress was not muscular but she had a lean body with little to no fat anywhere. Her stripes wrapped around her waist nicely and her tail playfully jerked from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, um, yeah, thanks,\" stuttered Burt. He held out his paw to her. \"I'm Burt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tigress shook Burt's paw. \"Kim,\" she replied. \"So Edgar got you into modelling, huh? Can't say I blame him. You definitely look that part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. You look pretty good too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, aren't you sweet?\" Kim teased. \"Thanks. I might not be one of the muscular models but I get some decent photos if I do say so myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, I was just about to hang out with some of my friends at the hot tub. Care to join us? I can introduce to some of the models here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt's heart secretly dropped. Being in a hot tub with female models? It was a dream come true for him. \"Yeah, sure,\" said Burt. \"Sounds fun!\" Kim motioned with her hand for Burt to follow her as she turned around and started walking past the male models who were chatting at the wooden table. As Burt passed some stopped to watch and he couldn't help looking away, instead focusing on Kim as she walked towards an above ground small bubbling pool with steam rising off the surface. There were already several female models relaxing in the water or were actively chatting with each other before they came to a stop when Kim arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I asked Burt if he wanted to join us and to relax for a bit, you mind making room for two more?\" Most of the girls shook their heads as they scooted out of the way and Kim took the first step up and over the side and sank into the hot water, a soft sigh escaping from her. \"Yea... now this is how you relax... come on Burt get in.\" Burt nodded his head a bit nervously. He'd never been in a hot tub with anyone before, much less one full of several very beautiful models.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to take a breath to steady his nerves when he finally took a step up and over the side. When his leg sank into the steaming hot water he took a moment to steady himself ont he side before slipping his other leg into the water and he slipped down, although even sitting down the water only came up to his chest. The heat soaked into every pore of his body and he tilted his head back, feeling the bundle of tension unknotting itself and relaxing at the water jets sprayed his back with a soothing pressure. It really was quite an amazing feeling, one he thoroughly enjoyed. It was like getting a massage and on this body it was almost electric in feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt let out a big sigh. \"This feels great,\" said Burt. \"This makes my muscles feel so relaxed,\" he added teasingly. One of the girls with him giggled and said, \"Hope they don't make you feel too relaxed.\" Burt smiled and raised his arm out of the water to flex it. The girls were in awe of the power in his arm. It grew to massive peaks and definition. The female models never seen a bicep that big before. Burt stroked his bicep and said, \"Nope, still very strong!\" The girls giggled and rushed to feel the amazing power surging through his muscles. They touched every peak, vein, and crevice. Burt loved this type of attention. He never thought that usch beautiful women would ever notice him and now they couldn't get enough of him. The big bear felt very proud of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking for a half hour, Kim said, \"I have to say Burt, you're pretty fun to hang out with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt blushed and replied, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Burt, Edgar got me a new photo shoot at the beach next week. He said I'll need a male model for the shoot. You want in?\" The hot tub got even hotter to Burt. Going on a beach with a beautiful model? Who could say no to that? Burt couldn't contain his excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Sure, that sounds like fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! After the party I'll let Edgar know and we'll have a great time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls then said, \"I call dibs on him on my next shoot!\" Burt and the other girls began to laugh.</span></div></div>",

He felt great. However his pride was interrupted with a loud grumbling coming from his rippling abs. All the girls in the tub heard it and giggled. Burt couldn't help but blush. \"Sorry...guess I'm a bit hungry.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I bet you are!\" said Kim. \"You need a lot of food to keep those muscles in top shape.\" Burt excused himself from the tub and got out to get some food. As he was walking to the food tables, Burt noticed a group of male models surrounding a table. Burt walked over to see what was going on and he saw a muscular tiger and lion sitting in front of several plates with piles of hot dogs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt asked a nearby model, \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot dog eating contest!\" said the model. \"You want in?\" Burt heard his stomach rumble again and smiled. \"Count me in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Be careful! It's a lot of food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I got a big appetite!\" Burt walked to the table and took his seat next to the lion. The audience then did the countdown. \"Ready....set...GO!\" The moment it started, Burt had his paws flying over the hotdogs grabbing two or three as a time and simply jamming them into his mouth, his teeth gnashing the bread and meat into a saliva drenched mixture before he swallowed and moved onto the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point he began swallowing the hotdogs in bits and pieces or even whole when he found himself starting to slip behind their numbers. Though it seemed no matter how many hot dogs he ate, Burt was still absolutely ravenous. It was like his body just couldn't get enough food and whatever he ate simply burnt up in his stomach to fuel his ever growing body and it just fueled his desire to eat even more. Beside him he could see that the lion was starting to slow down, his bites were taking longer and he looked like he was starting to have to force himself to keep swallowing. On the other side of the table sat a rather muscular horse that looked almost as starved as he was, just shoveling down two at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt didn't to be outdone by anyone, even if that meant getting a stomach ache later he would push himself as hard as he could. Burt started crushing two or three hotdogs and pushing them in together and started chewing them up as fast he could. This went on for another thirty minutes. In that time the lion dropped out and so did a rather large wolf who had been sitting at the end of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all came down to Burt versus the horse, but it looked like even the horse was showing signs of slowing down, meanwhile Burt continued to push down as many hotdogs as he could his stomach seemingly a bottomless pit as his body hungrily took in everything he swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA model raised Burt's giant arm and shouted, \"We have a winner!\" Burt stood up from the table and posed in victory. The audience cheered as Burt felt a slight warmth going through his body. He could feel his muscles tingle slightly as bulged a little. The audience didn't notice but Burt could feel his muscles growing slightly more powerful. Burt knew immediately that it was the result of the food he ate. All the food went to his muscles to make him stronger. Burt smiled and raised an slightly bigger bicep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the straining of his bed due to his massive weight, Burt slept great. He arose from his bed stretching and flexing his muscled body. He then rubbed his pecs and abs feeling that they were solid as ever. Burt felt energized and ready for the day. He went through his closet to pick another pair of elastic gym shorts and a bigger tank top. As he put them on, they felt like they were a second layer of skin. His clothes felt tight against Burt\u2019s skin, but Burt didn\u2019t mind. He could still see clear definition underneath his clothes, which he thought mattered. Burt then began to think about what he should do for the day. Meet with Tanya? Go to the school gym? Hang out with other muscle guys (but not as big)? Burt felt like he wanted to burn some of the energy his body was storing but with his being the big guy on campus it might be too easy for him. Burt then remembered there was another gym in town where bodybuilders usually train. Surely he would find some challenge and competition there. It was decided. Before leaving to the gym, Burt grabbed the mushrooms from his desk and stuffed them in a gym bag he prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt rushed to the gym with his powerful legs in a matter of minutes. He didn\u2019t feel out of breath at all. In fact, he was more motivated to burn some energy. He stepped in and was surprised to see several muscular guys in the gym training. There were lions, dragons, wolves, even a bull and they were all heavy lifting huge weights that even Burt wasn\u2019t sure he could lift. But he had to take a chance. He walked into the weight room and grabbed an eight hundred dumbbell of the rack. The weight was heavy but Burt thought it was a good weight to train with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt started with one dumbbell. He grabbed it in his right paw and placed his other paw on his right bicep. Between reps, Burt could his bicep swelling and relaxing as the dumbbell was raised up and down.  He could feel a burning sensation all over his arm and Burt smiled. The burning felt good. It reminded of him of his muscle growths. After he felt like his arm had enough, Burt switched to his other paw. Burt thought he was getting a very good workout and thought he might even build some decent muscle without the mushrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you around before,\u201d Burt looked up and found a massive bull standing in front of him. He was about the same size as the big bear. Burt paused his workout and stood up to the bull. \u201cUm\u2026yeah,\u201d said Burt. \u201cI\u2019m new here and I thought I\u2019d give this gym a try.\u201d The bull nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad you did. This gym is occupied by most bodybuilders. We have the best equipment for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never expected it to be so crowded,\u201d said Burt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, everyone\u2019s just here to get ready for a big competition coming up next month,\u201d said the bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt\u2019s ears perked up at the sound of that sentence. \u201cThere\u2019s a bodybuilding competition coming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s in one month and everybody\u2019s trying to get as big as they can for it.\u201d The bull looked at Burt\u2019s muscles and was impressed. \u201cYou look like you could be ready for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt\u2019s heart sunk. \u201cWh\u2026what?! Really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull nodded. \u201cYeah, I think you can do it. I just so happen to be a sponsor for the competition. I can squeeze you in if you want.\u201d Burt couldn\u2019t believe his ears. An opportunity to show off his muscles and win money for it\u2026it sounded like a dream come true! With his body Burt knew he could win. \u201cYeah,\u201d exclaimed Burt. \u201cThat sounds awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, Terry. Don\u2019t get his hopes up!\u201d The two turned to rather large hyena. The bull, which was referred to as Terry, coiled his hand to a fist and frowned at the hyena. Burt wasn\u2019t sure what was going on but he could tell by the tone of the hyena\u2019s voice, Burt didn\u2019t like him. \u201cGo away, Harry,\u201d said Terry. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to intimidate the other competitors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry chuckled, \u201cI\u2019m not here to intimidate; I\u2019m here to tell the truth and I\u2019m telling you that little bear cub doesn\u2019t stand a chance! He\u2019s only a few inches shorter and we know the biggest is going to win the competition, which will be me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle bear cub?!\u201d Burt gritted his teeth feeling his blood boil inside his body. Terry clenched his fist, \u201cHarry, keep this up and I\u2019ll remove you from the competition.\u201d Harry waved his hands calmly. \u201cOk, ok, I\u2019ll see you guys later!\u201d Harry left laughing to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry turned to Burt again, \u201cIgnore Harry. He\u2019s just a cocky hyena who thinks he\u2019s all that because he won last year\u2019s competition.\u201d Terry poked his meaty finger on Burt\u2019s chest. \u201cYou get in that competition and prove that arrogant hyena that he doesn\u2019t own the place!\u201d Burt smiled and nodded. \u201cIt will be my pleasure!\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who did that arrogant dog think he was? Burt knew he was bigger than he was...by a couple of inches. Burt knew he had to beat Harry at his own game. But how can an amateur like Burt beat a champion. Burt's face lit up with a smile as he remembered the mushrooms he packed before heading towards the gym. Time for another growth spurt.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Say Terry,\" said Burt, \"I'm going to the locker room to get changed. I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTerry nodded. \"Ok, I might be gone by the time you get back. If I don't see you, I'll see you at the competition!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBurt waved goodbye to Terry and headed to the locker room to \"change.\" Unlike his last locker room experience, the room was packed with other bodybuilders getting ready to train. It was too crowded to grow. Burt turned to his left and saw a door leading to another room. There was a sign of the side of the door saying \"Sauna.\" Burt walked into the room finding no one inside. Perfect.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBurt took out the mushrooms from his gym bag and stared at them at the palm of his meaty hand. He looked at the mushrooms like a crystal ball as if he could see his future. Burt saw himself bigger than any other bodybuilder, not just Harry. With his new size and strength, Burt thought he could win any competition without really trying. All it would take was a simple bicep flex. He would truly be a muscle god of all muscle gods. Burt shoved the mushrooms in his mouth and swallowed them whole.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe knew he had to wait a little bit for the mushrooms to take effect. Burt felt excitement burning intensely in his gut. He couldn\u2019t wait to see Harry\u2019s reaction of a bigger and tougher bear. However, Burt's burning anticipation was overpowered by another burning sensation in his gut. Burt smiled knowing his growth was about to happen. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe warmth in Burt's stomach quickly turned into intense heat and spread across to the rest of his body from finger to toe. Burt then felt cramps all over making him bend over to the floor on his hands and knees. Though through the intense pain, Burt still held his smile. The power growing inside him was almost intoxicating. Burt flinched when he felt his spine. arm bones, and leg bones shifting and crunching into a new size. His bones grew larger and thicker to make room for more muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt felt his legs first. His already godlike legs bulged into new vascularity and definition. His teardrop thigh muscles thickened and his calves coiled into an even bigger shape. Burt then held his stomach as the cramps moved their way up to his abs and pecs. The crevices between his pecs and abs grew deeper as they swelled. They grew more clean cut defined than a solid wall of diamonds. Burt could even feel new muscles pushing against his skin and fur underneath his abs. A new set of abs was formed giving him an incredible new ten pack. His pecs then blew up like a pair of balloons growing more outward from his chest. They stopped to where they almost reached Burt's chin. Thick snake like veins emerged and pulsated across his chest looking like lightning bolts from a storm. Burt then felt his arms growing hot. He could tell his heart was racing by seeing the veins on his arms pumping blood faster than ever. Burt's biceps and triceps grew more powerful inch by inch. Burt sensed even more strength going into his arms. Back to his previous growth, he thought he could lift mountains. Now, he felt like he lift the entire world on his monstrous shoulders. His arms settled after reaching a solid forty three inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt began to feel his body cooling down. The growth was over but his energy knew no limit. Burt slowly lifted himself up from the ground. As he stood up, he noticed his head almost reached the ceiling of the sauna. Burt smiled at this new size and turned his attention to his arms. He grinned to see they were the biggest and strongest arms in the world. He placed his left paw on his right bicep and flexed his bicep. The tendons in his bicep shifted to a new height and Burt squeezed them to see they were harder than anything on earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt then noticed he still had his tank top on. He smiled wanting to see his newly developed chest. Burt reached for the collar of his shirt and pulled, tearing the tank top right in the middle. Burt gasped to feel a ten pack on his chest and pecs that were the size of mountains. Burt didn't need a mirror to know that he truly looked like a muscle god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt chuckled in a new deeper tone. \"Little bear cub?\" he repeated from Harry, \"I'm thinking muscle god of all muscle gods!\" Burt began flexing his arms and crunching his chest to perform several poses. Burt knew each pose was as glorious as the last one. \"Nothing can truly stop me now!\" said Burt to himself. \"I got this competition in the bag!\"</span></div></div>",

He never participated in a bodybuilding competition. He didn't know how to beat Harry let alone what to do on stage. Burt may look the part but he feared he couldn't deliver the victory.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You ok,\" asked Terry noticing Burt's face of nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Burt stuttered, \"To be perfectly honest, I've never been in a competition before. I have no idea what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry put his hand on Burt's giant shoulder. \"Don't worry, I can show you the ropes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I would love to see you win over that hyena. You're gonna snatch that trophy right from under his nose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? Do you think I can be big enough to beat him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry chuckled. \"It's not about the size of your muscles that win a contest; it's how you display them in your poses. If you show off the right way, not only would you stand a chance at winning but you'll also look bigger in front of the audience and judges.\" Burt never thought of it that way. He always thought that the biggest guy with the biggest guns won. He didn't know posing played a major role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how can I train then?\" asked Burt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to work on your poses,\" said Terry. \"I'll show you the best ones you can do that'll show off all your muscles the right way! Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt followed the big bull out of the weight room and took him to a room that a full sized mirror that took up one whole wall. Terry clapped his hands. \"Alright! Let's do this!\" Terry strutted forward as he took Burt by the arm and moved him closer to the mirrors. \"The first one is very simple, plus it looks great when done right. You'll look like a god among men.\"  Burt could scarely believe he'd heard that from Terry. He know he had been comparing himself to a god of muscles earlier, but to have the bull confirm that and tell him it could be done well.. it realy got Burt excited to learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait ot start! What do i start with first?\" Terry chuckled as he  patted Burt on the back and pinched the shirt ont he collar a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First. you're going to learn about showcasing. A lot of bodybuilders when they first come out to greet the people watching, they like to make a show of it. It helps get he fans excited and doing well here can earn you some major points later on if the fans favor you and what you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!. So what should i do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should practice stripping off your shirt. A slow reveal gets fans revved up to see what's under that tight shirt and leaves them wanting more afterwards.\" Burt moved his paws up and gripped the collar of his shirt and began pulling on it when Terry grasped his paw and stopped him. \"Whoa there, heh take it easya nd slow down some. If you g too fast the fans won't be as rapt in attention as they could be and you'll gain less attention later on.  Try crossing your arms as you grip the shirt from the corners of the front of your shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of his collar, Burt slowly brought his arms down and crossed them, his fingers gripping the corners of  each side of the shirt. The  the he held it felt strange to him, but he wasn't one to doubt somebody much more experience at this than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright perfect. Now slowly.. ease the shirt up. it helps build suspense for the fans. They will absolutely eat it up and will clamor for more from you.\" As Tery instructed Burt began sliding the shirt up, making sure to go slowly as he  revealed his torso a couple inches at a time, untilt he shirt was almost entirely off his body. \"Great job so far Burt! Now as you're bringing it off your head, flex those biceps a bit. Give them audiance a taste of what you can bring and they'll come back for more everytime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt had to close his eyes for a moment as the shirt came up over his head. Whiel the fabric was starting to slip over his ears he began flexing his biceps, pushing them out to their absolute peak, the massive slabs of muscle exploding in their incredibly definition as the shirt finally slide off his head and he dropped he arms. \"How was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry clapped loudly as he  lifted up Burt's arm and gavehis right bicep a nice firm squeeze. \"Very nice! Those are some incredible biceps you have. I can't even squeeze my fingers into them.\" Burt felt a small tinge of pink burn onto his cheeks as he nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. That means a lot coming from you.\" Terry gave Burt a wink before cupping Burt's tricep with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it. I only have one suggestion. When you're pulling off your shirt, don't fully flex your biceps.\" This caused a confused stare to appear on Burt's face as he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you show off everything your guns have to offer, then it won't be as exciting to the fans when the competition really starts.  This game is all about showmanship. You gotta hold back a bit until the end. At the end game you give it all you got and really put on a show that the fans will remember. If you do that I have no doubts you'll win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt felt really flattered and inspired. He felt like he really had a chance to win this competition. \"Thanks Terry. You've been a great help. One question though...does the size of your muscles really matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" said Terry, \"But that's not what it's about. Lots of bodybuilders forget that posing is just as important as working out. That's why people like Harry exist and he only one last year out of luck.\" Terry then poked at Burt's pecs. \"But you have both the looks and the skills. You can do it, Burt....I believe in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt thought his heart grew as big as his muscles. \"Thanks Terry. I'll make you proud.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> <br>\r\nBurt was now filled with support and confidence. He felt like he could take the competition right here and now. He pictured himself holding a trophy above his head. Burt even went so far as to picture Harry pouting on the side of the stage while Burt is still flexing for a crowded audience. Burt had the competition in the bag. He knew it. However, his fantasy was put to a halt when a rumbling noise came from Burt's rippling eight pack. Terry laughed and Burt blushed from embarrassmet. \"Looks like all that training left you hungry!\" said Terry. \"Come on, there's a little cafe just near the weight room.\" Burt looked up to Terry. \"This gym has a cafe?\" Terry chuckled and nodded. \"Yeah, you'd be amazed what's here.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBurt followed Terry to the cafe. As they were walking, Terry said, \"It's also very important that you eat! When you train, you're stressing your body and needs a lot of food to keep it going...and I mean A LOT.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"How much is a lot?\" asked Burt.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTerry turned and observed Burt's frame. \"Judging by your size...I'd say you could scarf down two whole pizzas.\" Burt was surprised to hear that. Two whole pizzas? How can anyone eat that much. He knew if anyone saw him eat that much before his growth they'd call him a \"fatty.\" Now eating that much is essential? Burt smiled thinking to himself how much he loves being big.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTerry and Burt finally made it to the cafe. Luckilly there was no line to stop them from getting their food quickly. Terry ordered two steak specials and they took their spot at an empty table near the window peeking at the weight room. A female otter waitress arrived with two plates and placed them in front of the muscle men. Burt couldn't believe it. He counted four steaks on his plate and on Terry's. How could either of them eat this much. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nTerry already began eating when Burt asked, \"Umm...don't you think this is a bit too much?\" Terry shook his head and swallowed a bite. \"Not at all. Trust me, you'll need the protein to keep your energy up and with this competition coming up you'll need a lot of energy. I don't want you wearing out while on stage.\" Burt cut of piece of his first steak and nodded. \"Yeah, I know. I'm just not used to these large portions is all.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nTerry's eyes widened. \"Really? Then how did you get so big? You must have been eating larger portions to keep in shape.\" Burt didn't want to lie to Terry about how he got so big. Terry was so proud of him and Burt didn't want to crush him by saying he ate some magical mushrooms but he could never lie. \"Umm...I have my own regimen,\" said Burt. Terry didn't bother going further into the conversation as he told Burt to eat all his steaks before they got cold. As long as it meant Terry's not knowing Burt's secret, Burt felt fine.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBurt managed to eat all of his steaks. It was a lot easier than he thought it was going to be. He guess he had a biggeer appitite that he had to deal with for now on. Even after finishing off their food they sat around for a while. Burt assum,ed it was to let his stomach settle, afterall you weren't supposed to go running around after having such a big meal which was fine for Burt. This gave him a good time to get to know Terry a bit more. If he was going to be working with him like this, he had to know more about him. it'd be rude not to ask. \"So... what made you get into bodybuilding?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTerry scratched the back of his head before resting his paws on the table in front of him. \"Just jumping right into it hm? Well.. It wasn't exactly my idea to get into it at first.\" Burt shook his head a bit in confusion.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"It wasn't?\" Terry shook his head as a smal smile spread over his face.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Nope my dad made me when I was younger. Of course it was mainly to 'teach his son to be a man' as he called it.. and more than a little part of that was he wanted a son on a pro football team.\" Burt sat forward  a bit, He was very curious to know how he went from training for football to becoming a very successful bodybuilder.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Did you join the team?\" Terry gave a small nod, though it seemed a little hesitent.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yea.. I did, but I honestly didn't enjoy it. The game was fine, I just felt like I wouldn't get anywhere. In the gym though.. I loved working out, always striving to break my old max and become even stronger. I practically lived at the local gym I had when I was growig up, so it's no surprise I met my first body building manager there. Bryan Harriet. One of the biggest panthers I'd ever seen.\" Burt grin as he flexed a bicep while listening to Terry.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Was he as big as me?\" Terry laughed as he shook his head,<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No he wasn't, but he was pretty close. He proposed an offer to me for competing professionally in competitions. Suffice to say the idea of showing off all my hard work really appealed to me. I quit the football team almost immediately after that first day I met Bryan.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What did your dad think of you quitting the team?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I didn't tell him until after my first competition. Of course it happened to coincide with the first match of the season for my old team. He wasn't too happy to learn at the game that I'd quit a week or so before the game.\" Terry had a big grin on his face as he leaned back a bit. \"Although the look on his face when I came home with a medal and a two thousand dolllar check as a prize was absolutely priceless. I don't think I ever saw his anger fizzle out faster.\" Terry laughed heartily and soon Burt had joined him. It wasn't hard to get sucked into it. Laughter was infectious and easy to spread.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" asked Terry to Burt. \"How did you get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt's heart sunk. He had to tell white lies again. \"Well, believe it or not I used to be a fat kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry's mouth dropped. \"You're kidding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt shook his head. \"Nope! I also got picked on by other kids because I was fat. One guy in particular even forced me into working out because he didn't like the way I look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sucks. What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, while I was working out, I got myself a growth spurt. I saw myself making progress faster so I just kept at it.\" Burt flexed a bicep to Terry. \"As you can see, it payed off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed and Terry said, \"Indeed it has! I must say, you're probably one of the biggest guys I've seen so far. You stay in shape and you'll win this upcoming competition! Who knows? Maybe you'll get into the big leagues!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt blushed. \"You really think I can go pro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt never felt so supported before in his life. It was as if Terry was giving him additional strength to his mountain of muscle. Burt know felt like he could do anything. He was ready for the competition.</span></div></div>",
