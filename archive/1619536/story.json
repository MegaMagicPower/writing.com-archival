Well I guess not really typical, for I am dying. My kind nature to protect people got me shot not once but twice. Yup just my luck. So as my lung is filling with blood and my kidney is bleeding out, let's look at why it happened.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hot summer after noon in the middle of July and the massive super center was trimming with costumers. As the doors opened and a new customer entered the department manager of fresh foods turned to great them. As he did his name tag glimmered in the light. Seeing the word 'Manager' on the name tag the costumer became enraged and pulled a small concealed pistol out from their pants. \"It is all your fault!\" The enraged man yelled as he pulled the trigger. The sound echoed through the store and the heat of the round tore through the manager's side. Still standing after being shot the manager tried to defuse the situation so that no one else would be hurt. <br>\r\nRaising his hands in the air the manager cleared his throat from the pain in his side. \"Why are you doing this?\" He asked the angered man. Taking a few steps towards the man and asking him to keep the gun on him for it was between them now only. He didn't was a frantic customer being shot so was taking up the man's  attention. But he was shot a second time, this one through his chest making him cough out blood. But he kept his resolve to protect and continued to talk it out.<br>\r\nHe was able to get the angry customer to lower their we son and tell him what angered them that drive them to risk their life taking others. It was the chain of stores that fired his wife and they lost their home due to it. His wife got sick and died for he couldn't get her the treatment she needed.<br>\r\nIn the time it took him to talk the man down and the police arrive the manager was next to dead from blood loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So that is how I got to this point. My vision is getting blurred and I can't feel a thing. So who was I? Well not anyone special but let give you a little insight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName again is Ryan<br>\r\nMale in my early thirties but looks like I am fifties.<br>\r\n6'3\" tall and cubby at 230lbs.<br>\r\nthin dirty brown hair with color for cent blue green eyes.<br>\r\nlive alone with no known family to speak of.<br>\r\nno real friends either to be honest. Unless you count the people I play online games with. For they don't know the real me.<br>\r\nI try my hardest at everything I do. I find that I am loyal to those I work for and with.<br>\r\nKind hearted and polite to everyone. Guess that why some call me a loner or a door mat.<br>\r\nwell it not much but that is who I was.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Ryan thought it was his end he was saved by a doctor in the crowd. But the damage was l to much for his living body to take. It seemed he had early stages of lung cancer that was hit by the Bullet making it spread.  So to save his life the doctor performed an experimental medical  procedure that downloaded Ryan's mind into the body of a prototype robot that was designed to look and feel human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPale skin color<br>\r\nLong full volume light brown hair down to it's ankles. <br>\r\nCrystal blue eyes<br>\r\n4'1\" tall and only weighing in at 80 lbs. <br>\r\nGender less<br>\r\nChest 26<br>\r\nWaist 23<br>\r\nHips 27<br>\r\nPersonality  is still all the same.</span></div></div>",

Looking around the room slowly seeing odd machinery all over the place. But not one of them for vitals and no IV feeding  me any fluids. Feeling off about myself I slowly turn on the bed noticing that it seems larger then it should. The blanket falling as I turn to give a better understanding of how off my body was. \"What? What happen to me? This isn't  my body.\" I panic as I sat there on the bed my now smaller and more thinner hands run over the medical gown tracing the outline of my new body underneath. My mind racing to try and understand why I was not feeling my normal body. Why I was smaller and had curves I never had before. \"What the hell? It's gone...\" I screamed as I felt below my waist and there was nothing there. As if I was neither a male any more or even a female now.</span></div></div>",

This body is a machine with no gender, and no growth.\" I mumbled to myself as I was staring down at my body. It looked so human like it was hard to accept that it was a fake body. Flexing my fingers it was hard to accept that it was fake. But clearly this was not my old body . \"Guess I don't  have to worry about getting fat or growing old.\" I tried to look at the brighter side to this and slid out of the medical bed and stood there giving myself a good look over.  \"It could of been worse I guess.  And this skin feels real.\" I examined every curve then my long flowing hair. Seeing some clothes laid out for me I started to get dressed, though the clothes did have a feminine taste  to it. But at this point I couldn't really complain. <br>\r\nI was told I had 'rehab' to get use to my new size and found that I been granted a lot of money from the government  and the company I worked for.</span></div></div>",

I had to readjust myself mentally more then physically. The clothes that they had provided where a mixture of male and female clothing. I grew accustomed to a mixture of the two to form my personal style and taste. I was finally allowed to leave and go home to my small one room apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm home.\" I sighed looking and the poorly furnished apartment that I lived in for the past 8 years. \"Think it time I make a change to better suit my new form and personality I was developing due to it, though not much of a change but enough that I could notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the next week finding a bigger single room apartment across from work and bough all new furniture and painted it to better suit the new me. The washroom was a soft pink with white tones in the towels and mats. The living room was a nice gray tone. The furniture was a steel and white to contrast against the darker color walls. New and old gaming systems and a wide collection of games. A detailed new wardrobe compiled of the clothes I enjoy from both genders mainly in white and black. My intake for food and drink is limited to select things my robotic body can and needs to break down to maintain an energy source and lubrication to it's parts.</span></div></div>",

I can't get up so early in the morning.\" I grumbled as I slide my way out of bed and walked off into the washroom to freshen up. Once I was done brushing my teeth and combing my silky soft hair, I walked out still in a loose flowing night gown that would of only cover my underwear and a pair of PJ pants. Stretching to escape the last of the sleep that was plaguing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dragged myself into the kitchen area and started to fix my self something to consume for breakfast. Considering that robotic body could only break down a few things for fuel my options where very limited. \"Yummy tasteless food. Guess I am happy that I wasn't  a picky eater and didn't  care for taste before.\" I told myself as I was placing the dishes in the sink to be cleaned when I get home after work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back towards my bed I made it and sighed as I pulled out my uniform, which made me look like a kid in high school. I took my PJS off and folded them before placing them under one of my pillows. I adjusted the underwear I was wearing and sighed for in the end female ones where more comfortable the new form and curves my body has. But due to my size they are for preteens so have very cute pictures on them. I pulled my black dress pants on before tugging my arms through the sleaves of my white dress shirt which came to rest over top of the white cami  I was wearing. Pulling my black socks on last I sat on the sofa I now had under my bed looking at the time. Seeing that I have lot of time left and I was wide awake I chose to play a game until I have to leave.</span></div></div>",

I was walking nervously,  I couldn't get this feeling of fear for it been so long out of my gut. As I entered the back and stared at my locker and sighed for I never noticed that the top locker was so high up. \"Was it always that high?\" I asked not realizing two feet and a few inches was that high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you new?\" I heard a familiar voice ask me so I turned to look at Rain one of my bakers ask me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I am your manager. Ryan.  I am returning to work.\" I told her and went about explaining everything to her. After talking for a bit she helped me opened my locker and get my badge so I could punch in. I went of with her learning what I missed in the past month. I was having a fun time talking with her and I was helping her baking things for the floor before the store opened and I went to talk with the store manager and his assistant managers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey seemed surprised by my apperance and we ended up disgusting my recovery and the slow Return to normal duties for things will be very different for me. I went with them to the morning meeting and was reintroduced to everyone . I wasn't surprised that none reconize me and stated I look like a preteen girl. I came to terms with that a little while ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent my day with my fellow department managers and my assistant manager learning what has changed and what I need to be doing. We worked out my return to work schedule. I also worked with my other associates to see what they where doing and meeting the ones that had just recently started and I not meet yet. It was odd being given a new vest for my old one being an extra large was way to big, so now I have a small one. The personal manager gave me a new locker due to my height difficult which I was grateful for. </span></div></div>",

I had an odd desire to do some shopping before going home. Well it not like it something new to do some shopping but I wanted to buy some more clothes and the type of clothes was what made it new. I walked to the front and grabbed a shipping cart and started to head for older girls  and boys fashion. I found some cute my little pony underwear and socks that I grabbed. I found a few cute pokemon tops as well as some mlp ones with my favorite pony rainbow dash on it. I found some plain leggings all in the girl section and in the boys I found some nice jeans and pants. Found a few shirts that have logos of my favorite games like fallout, resident evil, and final fantasy. I ventured into crafts and end up picking out some beads and wire, I had a desire to go back to making bead bracelets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped by the Electronics department  and picked myself out some new head phones. DJ style with rainbow dash on them. During my rehab I ended up watching it with the kids in the hospital and grew addicted to it. I found the new final Fantasy world game and picked that up as well as the new pokemon games. I ended up paying for it all and took it all home. I had changed into a rainbow dash t-shirt and black tight leggings.</span></div></div>",

Though my feet didn\u2019t ache I could say that it was nice to relax from the oddness of the day. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if everyday was going to be like this from now on. All the stares from people and the awkward feeling of them judging me on my new appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I am to work only 4 days a week at 4 hours a day for now and will slowly return to normal hours by end of the month huh.\u201d I sighed to myself as I sat on the small sofa that was under my loft bed. \u201cIt just still all to odd now that my body is like this.\u201d I sighed heavily and shook my head as I was staring at my small hands before taking out all the beads and string I had and started to make bracelets anklets and a necklace that would all match as part of a set as I put a movie on my tv in the background.</span></div></div>",
