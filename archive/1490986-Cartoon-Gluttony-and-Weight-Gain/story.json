Frankie turned to her closet door where Bloo crouched awaiting her reaction still silent hoping she didn't see him. \"Bloo how many times do I have to tell you, I will submit a 'Foster's Trip Request Form' to Mr. Herriman later, I'm busy right now!\" Frankie explained to the closet door before hitting the power button on her computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloo slowly emerged with a frown on his face and picked up the crumpled up flyer from the floor, on it the words \"Greatest chocotastic experience in the world!\" were printed in bright red letters above an image of kids playing in a willy wonka like pool of chocolate with a chocolate waterfall cascading down behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Fraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaankie...\" Bloo whined in a squeal \"I wanna gooooooooooooooo...\" Bloo bellowed waving the flyer around next to Frankie's face \"It's going to be a chocolate festival for the ages, a true cocoa-tastic bonanza, a real sugar sweet shin-dig!\"Bloo tried to entice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloo look, I can't just run you around to every little place you want to go, you know the house has rules about trips and ever since last time Mr. Herriman has been extra crazy about the 'Foster's Trip Request Form', not to mention you're the only one asking for this...\" Frankie started to reason<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Request form....ha!\" Bloo cut in \"This event is bigger than any request form! Things of this magnitude are far to important to fill out paper work for, This is real, drop what you're doing, get your keys, and riiiide, type stuff! So I'll just be waiting in the bus for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Bloo\"Frankie flatly said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But come ooooooooooooooooooooooooon...\" Bloo whined again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie sighed \"Bloo ever since your trip to 'Space Invaders Laser tag' you know Fosters is required to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an isolated incident!\"Bloo cut her off \"The bus would have made a great laser tag assault vehicle if I hadn't put it into reverse by accident!\" Bloo explained \"Besides the county has yet to make it's case that it was my fault the Foster's bus caused a 16 car pile up and that drink stand to spill 90 gallons of super sticky flavored syrup all over the parade route and got the marching band stuck to the street!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well pending litigation, The county has required us to file all planned trips with the authorities before hand so they can take the appropriate precautions, namely warning everyone that we're coming...\" Frankie said with a heavy sigh. \"Anyway like I said you're the only one wanting to go so why don't you go get the required 10 signature minimum for the forms\" Frankie asked handing Bloo the clip board with the forms on it \"And stay out of my hair till you do\" She concluded under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloo took the clip board begrudgingly and walked out into the hall. Bloo looked around for someone to braid into sighing thee form. On queue Eduardo emerged from the near by bathroom still whipping his hooves together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eduardo my main man!\" Bloo happily greeted him \"I got the opportunity for a life time for you here, you'll be the first to make history and help take Foster's to the greatest place on earth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEduardo gasped \"You mean were going to the place with the big castle and the pretty princess and the big mouse guy with the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Bloo stopped him \"I mean this!\" Bloo happily presented Eduardo with the flyer \"Imagine yourself sliding down that chocolate waterfall into the of choco-las-city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmkay\" Eduardo replied at looked up at the ceiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Bloo asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what?\" Eduardo asked surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think about the chocolate waterfalls and oceans of chocolate?!\" Bloo asked getting annoyed \"weren't they great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh\" Eduardo realized \"No\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?!\" Bloo screeched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they got my fur all sticky\" Eduardo explained \"I think I need a shower now\" Eduardo decided and turned around re-entering the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaaaaaaargh!\"Bloo wailed in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Bloo paced the halls looking for someone to help him get his signatures. Coco came around the corner ahead with her tongue sticking out prancing down the hall with a dull look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coco, there's just the bird.. airplane... plant.... girl... that I wanted to see!\" Bloo smiled \"You know with a name like coco I bet you love that bean with the same name as yourself! In fact there is this little get together coming up, nothing big, that happens to feature that same bean and I just know you'll want to be there to support your fellow cocos in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coco\" Coco replied quickly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No? What do you mean no?!\" Bloo exploded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coco co co coco co coco\" Coco answered flapping her wings and posed suggestively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On a diet?!\" Bloo yelled \"You don't even wear a swim suit! How can you be getting in shape for swim suit season?!\" Bloo stopped around before stopping to Coco's right side \"Besides with a gut like that you should have started a lot sooner sister!\" Bloo snapped before realizing his mistake to late. With a swift kick Coco spun around and clocked Bloo upside the head with one of her legs sending him into a near by potted plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Co-coco!\" Coco said angrily and stormed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh what was her problem?\" Bloo wondered dusting himself off and spotted Mr Herriman hopping up the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Herriman!\" Bloo began \"I'm sure you can sympathies with my plight. I've got this little petition to sign here you see and have been fruitless in my endevers you understand. But if you were to sign this here trip request form I'm sure your endorsement is worth 10 of any ordinary house member!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Bloo surely you would not suggest I favor myself in any house rule.\" Mr. Herriman sternly looked down at Bloo \"I can not abide by such corruption. As House President I must hold myself just as responsible for the upholding of our sacred rules even more than I would anyone I would reprimand for breaking said rules. If I were to sign your form it would count for but a single signature, only one, an individual endorsement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure! I couldn't agree more!\" Bloo nodded \"Gotta uphold these rules for sure! So why not start me off right and add your oh so official Jerry Handscock to this form and serve as an example for the other residents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Master Blooregard\" Mr. Herriman replied while adjusting his monicale \"Frankly I shudder to think what you would do on any Foster's trip involving such mass quantities of sugar. Furthermore, I do not like you, and if you're in favor of this excursion, then I am most certainly against it.\" And with that Mr. Herriman hopped away down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloo threw up his hands in anger and screamed. Bloo stormed through the house asking just about every house member for their signature and each time either receive an excuse for why they could not sign or a flat out no. It didn't help that Bloo started most of his requests by demanding the house member sign. By time four o'clock rolled around he was fed up. Bloo stood in the foyer pacing around trying to figure out how he was going to get signatures when Mac came through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Bloo\" Mac happily greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mac!\" Bloo eagerly greeted in response. \"Man am I glad to see you!\" Bloo said rushing up to Mac and thrust the signature form into Mac's hands \"Here sign this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing pal\" Mac said as he placed his backpack on the floor and flipped through the pages to read what he form was for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Bloo laughed nervously \"Don't read it, sign it! Go go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to sign something from you without reading it first Bloo. I'm not signing any more contracts agreeing to be your butler ever again\" Mac shot him a dirty look \"What's this chocolate festival stuff about? Bloo you know I can't eat sugar! Why would I sign a form for a trip to a place like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Maaaaaaaaac!\" Bloo whined \"You don't understand I've asked everyone! No one will sign my form, Even Sheerline The Chocolate Queen said no! And she has the power to command chocolate! You have to sign my form! You don't even have to go, just sign it! People like you, if they think you're going maybe I can get more signatures!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloo why would I sign a form that would allow you and everyone else to leave to somewhere I can't go?\" Mac said thrusting the signature form back into Bloo's hand \"Lets just go play alright?\" Mac asked and started up the steps \"You coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until I have all the signatures I need to go on this trip! I will go to the Festival of Chocolate one way or another!\" Bloo screamed aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you won't Master Bloo\" Mr. Herriman stated as he hopped into the foyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But whhhhhhhhhhhhY\" Bloo started to whine again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you've failed to acquire any signatures thus far and very unlikely to receive any at all\" Mr Herriman interrupted the whining \"In addition I've reviewed your trip and it states quite clearly there is a fifty five dollar admission fee. House rules state any trip that will cost more than ten dollars per participant must be funded entirely by a fund raiser organized by the house resident requesting the trip. Including fuel costs and standard bus maintenance fees your trip will cost sixty one dollars and thirty two cents per participant with the minimum of ten members and you've yet to raise a single cent for the trip you wish to attend. I'm sorry Master Bloo but you shan't be going to your choc-o-late hoop-la.\" Mr. Herriman concluded and took the signature request form from Bloo and returned to his Office leaving Bloo stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" screamed Bloo \"This isn't the end of this Rabbit! If I can't go to the chocolate festival I'll bring it to me! You hear me? This house will be the center of the chocolate party universe!\" Bloo yelled at Mr. Herriman's door \"And I know just how to start...\" Bloo said quietly rubbing his hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Frankie lay sleeping in her bed as the door to her room slowly opened. Bloo peaked inside and checked to make sure Frankie was asleep. When he was sure she was he opened the door fully and started to step inside. As Bloo started to step into the room the floor creaked loudly as he placed his weight on the old house's wooden floor. Frankie stirred slightly and Bloo backed off leaving the doorway. A few minuets later Bloo returned with a hokey stick tied to a pool stick tired to a plastic light saber. Bloo swung his rigging across the room nearly knocking over several nick-nacks off Frankie's shelf and tried to push the power button on her computer with the light saber end. Missing the power button the light saber bumped the PC's casing and the saber made a swishing sound effect and flashed brightly. Bloo panicked and reeled his long pole of a rigging back out the door and hit the power switch on the light saber. After Frankie stopped stirring again Bloo reached in again and this time got the power on. Slowly the computer loaded before coming to the desktop and playing the start of Frankie's start up noise. As the sound of the opening to one of Rod Tango's movies started up Bloo franticly swung his pole at the speakers trying to hit their power buttons but only knocked them off the desk tugging the cord out and killing the sound. The Speakers fell the the floor and landed with a snap as the base of the speaker broke off and rattled across the floor. Bloo leaned the pole against the desk and ducked out of the door frame for cover as he waited for the sound of Frankie's mumbles to die down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloo cautiously picked the pole back up and pushed the computer's mouse around till he had it over the internet browser's icon and tapped the top of the mouse twice opening up the browser. Repeating the process Bloo opened Frankie's list of favorite sites and squinted trying to read the names. He made out the blurry image of Googla in her list and clicked it. Bloo was far less skilled with the keyboard than he was with the mouse as he tried to enter \"Chocolate supplier\" into the search field. Batting at the keyboard Bloo entered \"Chocoplste supplkurr\" Bloo clicked the link for \"Did you mean Chocolate Surplus\" and got to his results page. Clicking the third result Bloo came to a page for \"Mega Chocolate Surplus, the dealer for institutional and standardized chocolate\". Not bothering to read the site's description Bloo knocked the mouse to run the cursor over the products page  and clicked. Bloo tried to read what the items for sale were but had trouble beyond the bold titles over the pictures. Bloo passed up the \"Tiny Malted Delights\" because they were to small for his plans. Bloo didn't bother with the \"Presidential Learning Chocolates\" shaped like each president's head because Bloo didn't want his party to look like a bunch of old dead guys. Bloo paused on the next item, \"At Ease Pudding\", Pudding was perfect for his plans! And the picture of a 50 gallon drum full of it was a good sign he'd have plenty to use. The price tag of two hundred forty dollars a drum was all Bloo needed because the more something costs the better it must be he reasoned. Bloo swatted at the mouse to get it to the \"add to cart\" button and clicked. Bloo tried to calculate how many drums he would need and decided to just buy 2 because to Bloo a hundred gallons was like a thousand gallons. Hitting the keyboard Bloo entered a 2 and 3 at the same time in the quantity slot due to his sloppy typing then went to check out. Bloo fished in his pocket and pulled out a credit card with Madam Foster's name on it. Bloo swung at the keypad trying to enter the credit card number. Bloo didn't enter Madam fosters number due to his bad aim but by some mirical entered a working credit card number. More luck shined on Bloo as Frankie had the Fosters address saved in her browser and all the shipping information entered itself. Bloo moved the mouse to purchase and clicked. With that the order went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Bloo triumphantly cheered before realizing how loud he was. Frankie began to roll over in her bed and grunted as she regained consciousness. \"Oh no gotta turn this stupid thing off!\" Bloo panicked. Bloo just jammed the light saber into the power button until the monitor went black. Frankie sat up suddenly in her bed and immediately looked at the doorway. The door was open and the light from the hall poured into her room but no one was there. Frankie looked around and saw her speaker laying broken on the floor and her monitor power light blinking on and off. Frankie let out a loud scream as Bloo slipped back into his bed and faked being asleep as the house awoke to Frankie's shriek of anger.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bloo waited by the door all morning for his delivery but by time 4:00 rolled around and Mac came in the door there was no sign of it. The next day was the same, Bloo waited all day and still no delivery by time Mac arrived. For five days Bloo waited in vein for his chocolate pudding but it never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Bloo\" Mac greeted coming in the door \"You've really been eager to see me this week haven't you? Every day you're here waiting for me. I'm touched man\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not waiting for you!\" Bloo corrected him \"I'm waiting for a delivery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A delivery?\" Mac thought for a moment then groaned \"Oh no...What did you order now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brace yourself Mac! I am bringing Chocolate fest to us!\" Bloo cheerfully announced and unveiled a crudely drawn banner Bloo made with crayon showing himself swimming under a chocolate waterfall. \"I ordered a hundred gallons of chocolate pudding and it is coming here! Right to the House! And we are going to blow the roof off this joint! With Chocolate!\" Bloo cried out and started dancing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate? A party? A hundred gallons?!\" Mac repeated flabbergasted \"How did you order a hundred gallons of chocolate pudding?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know.... around\" Bloo lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloo...\" Mac began with his skeptical tone \"Where did you get the money for a hundred gallons of chocolate pudding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a credit Card ok?\" I got on Frankie's computer and ordered two fifty gallon drums of pudding. And we are going to have a blast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac groaned loudly \"Bloo! You stole a credit card didn't you?!\" Mac accused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Me?! How dare you say I would actually steal anything ever! I would never do such a vile hanis thing! I am to good of a person to ever steal! How dare you Sir! How dare you!\" Bloo mellow dramatically threw his arms up and pretended to storm around Mac angrily but could tell Mac wasn't buying it. \"You still think I would steal? That I could remove another person's property without their knowing? Never! Never I say! I'd never... Yeah ok I took it...\" Bloo gave up and pulled out Madam Fosters card which Mac promptly snatched out of his hand. \"You wasting your time buddy\" Bloo chuckled after Mac took the card back \"That thing is maxed out, I kinda felt like buying myself taffy last night. You'd be surprised how much taffy you can get with a credit card when you tell the cashier to just \"fill 'er up\"\" Bloo laughed and pulled out a piece of taffy from behind his back and tossed it in his mouth \"Yep that card is useless now.... Want some taffy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a warehouse halfway across the country from Foster's, Bloo's order was  finally being processed. In the tiny shack of an office a printer was cranking out orders faster than the workers could assemble and ship them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Barry what do you make of this?\" a warehouse worker asked as he entered the office area of the distribution warehouse. \"damn machine cut off the name of the address again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foster's Home For Ima-... A foster home? For kids? What would they want the special pudding for?\" Barry wondered aloud \"This stuff is really more for the elderly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless it's for adopting grandparents\" The first warehouse worker laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah I'll put my grandmother up for adoption\" Barry laughed back \"But seriously this stuff has chemicals in it that makes people lazy by blocking the conversion of calories into usable energy so the body will only store it and never use it thus giving them less energy to move around, that's why nursing homes buy it so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't forget the chemicals that block most of the protein going to the brain to slow down thought processes and make them easier to manipulate. I can see where that would help with dealing with kids but anyone under the age of 70 eating this stuff would just turn into a lazy slob.\" The other warehouse worker summed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I don't pay you two to make obvious observations!\" a balding man in a sweat stained shirt yelled from the near by doorway \"Get back to loading up trucks! We got a lot of orders to fill! We're already a week behind on half our delivery's.\" The two warehouse workers got back to work and started loading up the trucks. Bloo's order was left on the counter, forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral weeks later Bloo was once again following Frankie around with a colorful flyer in his hand. Frankie tried to ignore while she folded clothes but it was no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Frankie!\" Bloo begged \"It's a once in a life time chance! Never again will the planets a-line like this and allow such an event take place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie sighed heavily and stopped folding to look at Bloo \"What Bloo? What is it this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The third annual Monster truck and pie show!\" Bloo bounced up and down excitedly \"You get to watch monster trucks crush normal trucks all while eating pie! And they have every flavor you can imagine! I'm getting a blueberry pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloo...\" Frankie said in a quiet monotone voice \"If it's the third annual then it's been going on for the last 2 years and will probably happen next year, it's hardly a once in a lifetime experience\" Frankie looked at the flyer carefully \"It's 60 dollars a ticket, how are you going to raise the money for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raise the money?!\" Bloo exclaimed \"Since when do I have to pay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the house rules remember? That's why you couldn't go to your silly chocolate festival last month\" Frankie explained getting frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate what?\" Bloo tried to remember but drew a blank \"I don't know what you're talking about. If it doesn't involve Monster trucks or pie I'm not interested.\" Bloo shrugged \"All I know is this will be the greatest event ever and I will not miss it!\" Bloo said determined. Just then the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloo you go answer it I have to much work here\" Frankie asked forgetting who she was talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Why me?\" Bloo protested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if you don't I'll make sure Mr. Herriman never approves your little monster truck trip!\" Frankie threatened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't...\" Bloo replied in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me\" Frankie glared. Bloo thought for a moment then slowly backed out of the laundry room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door bell rang again as Bloo approached \"I'm coming I'm coming!\" Bloo called out. Bloo opened the door and there stood the PedEx guy with a hand truck and a large metal drum tipped back on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Have an order of chocolate pudding here for a Ms..... Frankie Foster?\" The man asked looking at Bloo curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloo eyed the drum of chocolate pudding starting to remember his purchase. \"Nope, never heard of her\" Bloo told the PedEx guy and slammed the door before walking upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delivery man rang the bell again with no response. After three more rings each one getting longer and more frequent Frankie came to the foyer grumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloo I told you to get this!\" Frankie yelled up the stairs as she passed them. Frankie reached the door and opened it. \"Yes? How can I help you?\" She greeted shaking off her frustration<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah as I told your little blue friend I have an order of chocolate pudding for a Ms.Foster, you her?\" He said unenthusiastically. And thrust the clip board of paper work into Frankie's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie stared at the clip board in disbelief for a few moments before anger spread across her face. \"BLOO!\" she howled glaring toward the steps \"Get down here right now buster! I am not paying for another one of your crazy schemes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's already paid for mam\" The Ped Ex guy chimed in \"charged to a Mr. Rivers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is?\" Frankie said in disbelief \"Usually he steals either mine or my Grandmother's credit cards for this stuff...\" Frankie signed the form if only to get this mess over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delivery guy took the form and looked it over before giving it an approving nod. \"Alright boys bring them in!\" He yelled behind him. Suddenly a convoy of PexEx guys poured into the foyer setting down drum after drum of chocolate pudding until all 23 containers cluttered up the front door of Foster's. Frankie's mouth hung open in shock as she looked over the massive amount of pudding before her as the PexEx men filed out and loaded themselves back into their trucks. Frankie took a few more minuets of stunned silence before clinching her hands into a fist and turning a bright red. \"I am going to kill him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day after chasing Bloo around the house several times and hours of interrogation Frankie and managed to get Bloo to spill the beans on what his plan had been. Frankie sat in front of her computer digging up the history to confirm Bloo's story of buying 23 drums of pudding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bought em\" Frankie suddenly spat turning to the still detained Bloo \"You deal with them!\" Frankie concluded before storming out of the room to do her chores \"I've had it with cleaning up your messes for you, you're taking care of this yourself!\" she called over her shoulder as she strode down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloo looked out the door and waited for Frankie to walk out of sight before throwing a fit. \"Man what am I going to do with all that pudding?!\" Bloo asked himself \"What if Mr. Herriman doesn't let me go to the Monster truck and pie festival?!\" He began to worry. Bloo had to hide the evidence, He looked around franticly for a place to get rid of the evidence. Then Bloo looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie hummed to herself trying to clam down as she stood in the kitchen preparing lunch. Behind her Bloo rushed back and forth from the foyer to who knows where with drum after drum loaded into a little red wagon. Occasionally Frankie turned as she heard the thumping of Bloo's foot steps charging down the hallway but reframed from asking where he was taking them trying to stay out of it. Several floors above her Bloo was carting the drums to the old Scribble room. Ever since  Mr. Herriman and Mac started giving the scribbles away to the various businesses in town the room was empty most of the time save for every now and then when a scribble was left with foster's for a few days before being picked up. None the less Mr. Herriman kept the room offlimits so he had a place to store the homeless scribbles and Bloo was happy to find it empty today. When Bloo was in Frankie's room he had looked up and recalled the Scibbles room was directly above Frankie's. Bloo placed the last drum into the room and found it stuck out from the doorway several inches. Bloo shut the door hard on the drum trying to stuff it into the room. Bloo struggled to get the door to latch as the drums inside compressed and strained against the pressure. One drum in the corner tipped sideways and took up more room than it should as the pressure built.The drum tipped over but didn't fall all the way ending up pinned half way tipped over against the wall. Bloo heard the click of the door as the knob turned a quarter turn and secured itself. Bloo took a step back and watched the old world's craftsmanship of the door held the sturdy oak door in place despite the bulge of the door showing how much pressure was in the room. Bloo congratulated himself on a job well done and went to find away to con Mr. Herriman into letting him go to his Monster truck show.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night Frankie trudged into her room exhausted. A full day of chores and cleaning up after the house residents had left her worn out. Frankie changed into her nightie and climbed into bed. Frankie placed her head on her pillow and fell asleep snoring slightly her mouth open. In the room above the drum of pudding that had tipped sideways was still under great pressure. The force of the other drums against it had caused the drum to flex and become crushed squishing it against the wall making the shape of the drum more of a long oval. The new shape of the drum forced the lid loose taking the path of least resistance and the pudding leaked out pouring onto the floor. Through the floorboard the pudding flowed seeping down through to Frankie's ceiling forming a large puddle clinging to the ceiling. As the weight of the pudding increased flowing through the cracks in the floor above and ceiling below it started to hang down into a drop and finally it fell. Frankie rolled over in bed leaving her half cocked mouth pointed upwards. The wayward pudding drop fell delicately into Frankie's open mouth melting onto her tongue. Frankie smacked her lips tasting the chocolate, the corners of her mouth curling up into a smile at the flavor. Frankie opened her mouth again instinctively for another as more drops fell. Slowly the weight of the pudding pooling above her and the pace of the drops quickened. Faster and faster they fell into her mouth, without missing a drop Frankie caught them each time and savored the flavor. In her dreams Frankie was the Queen of Fosters, her subjects kneeled before her. They praise her for the years of house work she had done and crowned her queen in recognition. They brought her the silkiest pillows to lay on making her so comfortable she never wanted to move. They gave her hot stone massages relaxing her muscles to the point where she felt like they had turned to jelly. The pace of the dripping continued to increase now falling only half a second apart. Frankie loved the taste, it was choclately like her grandmother's cookie she loved so much. In her dream her subjects brought her these cookies, Frankie's psychological need for them deepening her trance induced by the chocolate taste, Frankie was practically sucking the drops of pudding in now. Frankie closed her eyes in the dream and leaned back, she was to comfortable to get up, to relaxed to move, and all she wanted to do was lay there and let her subjects feed her cookies. Now the pudding was practically a steady stream, Frankie's mouth filled quickly with the pudding and she had to close it every few seconds to swallow. A small amount of pudding was dribbling around her mouth each time she closed them to swallow but it was immediately licked off as soon as she opened them again. For nearly an hour and a half Frankie sucked up the pudding miraculously consuming every drop in her sleep sure not to miss a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night went on the contents of the drum lessened, since it was tipped to the side only about 10 gallons of the pudding managed to leak out and as Frankie licked up every bit that got to her, a good portion of it was just being absorbed by the floor boards. As the drum finished evening out the flow slowed to but a few drips and it wasn't long before the flow downstairs had slowed considerably too. By now Frankie was enjoying her fantasy so much the small part of her brain that knew this had to be a dream was wishing desperately she'd never wake up. As the flow slowed to but a few drops every second or so Frankie began to frown. In her dream the cookie supply was running low, her grandmother had stopped baking them forever she said and Frankie was quickly depleting the remaining surplus unable to stop consuming them at the pace she was. Frankie begged and pleaded with her grandmother to keep baking before she ran out but her grandmother laughed evilly and told her no. All around her the faces of Fosters were laughing at her, soon she would run out and never get anymore. Frankie was to hooked to stop and could only watch in anguish as the pile of cookies got smaller and smaller. Outside her dreams the pudding was slower now, only a drop every few seconds and they were getting smaller as the weight behind them weakened. Frankie's dreams were becoming nightmares as she saw the pile nearly gone. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she relived her childhood when she never got enough cookies. Frankie was almost crying in the real world to her nightmare taking it's told on her. She was no longer queen, she was but a servant again. All around her the Foster residents were getting cookies for themselves, she was lucky to get but a crumb as she swept the floor behind them. Frankie was desperate for the cookies but watched in horror as the pile was completely demolished by the greedy hands of Fosters. The last drop of pudding finally fell into her mouth just as she picked the last cookie crumb off the floor and tried to savor it. For the rest of the night Frankie tossed and turned in her sleep darting her tongue in the air trying to find the chocolaty taste again, none was to be found. In her dreams she swept the house again and again hoping to find a few more crumbs, but there were never any left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie blinked a few times at the bright sunlight peeking into her room. Frankie yawned loudly and stretched out on her bed trying to unstiffen her body. The large brown stain on her ceiling went un noticed as Frankie rocked back and forth in her bed a few times trying to get herself loosened up and awake enough to crawl out of bed. Normally Frankie was used to a little stiffness and exhaustion in the morning from her daily life of endless chores, but this morning she felt like she had just run a marathon. Frankie's body stiffly fought back against her attempts to get up trying to pursued her to take an extra hour or two of rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on body we have a lot of work to do today\" Frankie Yawned She tried to look over at her Alarm clock to see how much longer she could afford indulge her body's fantasy of sleeping in, but it was no where to be seen. Frankie peered over the edge of her bed and saw the alarm clock broken on the floor several feet from the night stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd\" Frankie thought out loud \"Did I knock it off? I don't even remember the alarm going off...\" Frankie tried to recall as she glanced across the room at the clock she had hung on the wall. With in moment Frankie was up and rushing about the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap crap crap!\" She bite her tongue unable to say anything worse due to years of holding her tongue back around child like imaginary friends \"How the frick did it get to be so laaaaaaate!\" She whined tossing her clothes on. Frankie ran out of her room and down the stairs before she even put on her trademark green jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in Foster's Foyer Mr. Herriman paced back and forth impatiently checking his watch as Frankie bolted down the stairs. Mr. Herriman grumbled something as he snapped his pocket watch shut and placed it into his vest pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Francise you are officially two hours fourteen minutes and fifty seven seconds late for your job! Just because you live in this house doesn't mean you're at work by simply living here, you are expected to arrive at your designated post every morning at seven o' clock sharp! Mr. Herriman chastised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but\" Frankie tried to protest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand your duties include setting the dinning hall for the \"friends\" morning breakfast which is to be done by seven thirty...\" He continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but!\" Frankie tried to cut in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were forced to get their own meals today miss Frances, I can not imagine how neglected they must have felt knowing you abandoned your post this morning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but you see...\" Frankie conjectured<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Furthermore you have choosen to arrive to work in a most disheveled state of appearance. Your shoes are not tied, your socks are mismatched, your blouse is on inside out, you are missing one green jacket, your hair is most untamed and you have chocolate smeared all over your face....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I was running late... and the shoes were... and I couldn't find the right socks... and I didn't see the shirt was... and I was in such a hurry I forgot the... and I couldn't find my comb.... wait what?\" Frankie countered at each observation, however the chocolate one threw her off. Frankie ran to the mirror in the foyer, indeed there was light chocolate smears all around her mouth. Her dream came rushing back to her, What the hell happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Frances I am not finished!\" Mr. Herriman called out frustrated as Frankie ran past him to the mirror. \"While I am on the subject of your appearance I must note your shirt no longer fits properly\" the rabbit noted pointing to Frankie's shirt which no longer came to the very top of her skirt but rather left about a half inch gap of skin showing. Miss Frances This is not some \"Hoot-ers\" you can go about showing unclothed flesh in areas that should remain covered, perhaps your new found job neglect has carried over into other areas hmmm? Perhaps you're no longer able to perform the fosters laundry without shrinking some articles of clothing eh? I must say my vest has felt tighter lately, and here I was blaming myself for overdoing it with the carrot juice in recent weeks...\" Frankie tried to pull down her shirt to hide her skin but it was not cooperating very well. \"Oh I told Ms. Foster we should have required a uniform of you... Maybe you'd have taken more pride in your work if you had a strict dress code to adhere to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie glared at the rabbit over his mention of a uniform for her to wear as she stormed up the steps back to her room to get redressed and clean her face off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her room Frank threw her chocolate smeared handkerchief into the clothes hamper and checked herself in the mirror. Hair was combed, her usual amount of touch-up make-up was in place and most important her face was clean of any chocolate. Frankie tugged on her shirt once more, still it pulled taunt against her midriff. Frankie poked her belly once. It might have felt a little softer than usual, or it could just be her now to tight shirt was pressing the fat down into an easy to notice pot belly, or it could be the start of a few extra pounds. Frankie didn't even want to think about her weight being the issue, this house was enough of a chore to manage, managing her weight would be the straw to break the camel's back. Frankie just took a deep breath and assured herself \"The rabbit said his vest was tight, maybe it is just a little shrinkage\" Frankie looked back at her reflection in the mirror her eyes pulled straight down to the reversed image of her belly peaking past her shirt \"It better be...\" she muttered before throwing on her trademark green jacket and heading for her first chore of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the Foyer Frankie was pushing a mop around the floor. A light rain had fallen all morning and the ground outside was becoming damp and muddy in spots. As such numerous smudges and muddy foot/paw prints were scattered every which way across the foyer. Frankie dunked the mop in the bucket again, pushing it through a set of foot prints that were certainly straight out of a very muddy puddle. Frankie's eyes lost some focus as she started to stare past her mop and into space. The color of the mud was brown, brown spots everywhere.... little speckles of brown.... like cookie crumbs everywhere... Frankie shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Frankie muttered pulling herself away from the developing fantasy \"It's mud, just mud\" she repeated. Frankie's dream bore many similarities to this setting, in her dream the foyer was covered in cookie crumbs as selfish friends gobbled down every cookie and left the messes all over. Frankie began mopping again her eye's slowly drawing inward as she looked past her mop again. All around the house the foot prints trailed, Frankie started to work her way out of the foyer into one of the halls following the  foot prints through the house. She pushed the mop ahead of her cleaning the cookie crumbs up. Before her this trial of those delicious chocolate cookie crumbs were leading her to another pile of those wonderful little... Frankie stopped and knocked her head on her mop a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get yourself together girl!\" She chastised herself \"That was a dream, those cookies won't even be made again until winter anyway!\" Frankie's head slumped down, she had depressed herself thinking about how long until her grandmother would be making those cookies again. Frankie's stomach let out a low gurrgle followed by a slight rumble. \"Oh so it's your fault\" She smirked putting a hand on her still flat albeit softer abdomen. This made sense, she was just fantasizing about food because she hadn't eaten yet, understandable. Frankie dunked the mop back into the bucket and went to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost eleven o' clock Frankie couldn't afford a large meal right now since lunch was only a short time away, but she needed something to satisfy her for that short time, everytime she tired to prepare lunch on an empty stomach she'd end up snacking on junk food the entire time she was in the kitchen since it was so easy to access from the pantry. Frankie opened the doors of one of the cabinets, nothing seemed to jump out at her. Frankie check the pantry, aside for the junk food calling out her name nothing in there looked good to hold her over to lunch either. Frankie looked in the fridge. The was a grapefruit in there but as soon as she picked it up the rhine collapsed in her hands. Frankie threw the mushy fruit into the compost and scanned the kitchen. The chocolate cake on the counter beckoned to her. Frankie could almost taste it just by looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid dream\" Frankie bit her lip resisting the advances of the sugary confection \"I love those cookies so much, that dream was soooo real\" Frankie pouted and grabbed a pack of soup crackers from the near by cabinet to stuff in her mouth before her hunger got the better of her. \"I've dreamed about them before but never that real!\"Frankie reminisced \"I wonder if I could have that dream again if I tried...\" The dream was ruining her concentration but given the chance to have it again Frankie knew deep down she would jump at the chance to taste those cookies right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie looked at the clock, 10:53, She should start lunch soon, then once the friends were served maybe she could use her lunch break to take a nap... and try for that dream again, oh she couldn't wait till tonight to see the cookies again! Frankie dismissed the thought, she slept in this morning, there was no way she could nap only a few hours later. Frankie did feel a little tired though... Nonsense! It was just the weather, she always felt like sleeping on a rainy day, everyone did, heck rainy days were made for sleeping in! Frankie was finding the soup crackers most unsatisfying, Absent mindedly she had removed the cover from the cake tray and was looking for a knife to cut it with. Frankie yawned, the thought of a nap was sounding more and more appealing. Pulling a knife from the drawer near the cake Frankie cut herself a generous slice still imagining a cookie filled dream. Frankie took a big bite of the cake and savored the sweet taste. Frankie quickly took another bite, then another, and another. Frankie stuffed the last of the slice into her mouth and licked the frosting off her fingers, but she wasn't satisfied. Something about the cake wasn't enough, it just couldn't compare to her grandmother's cookies. Frankie felt empty now, the cake had gotten her hopes up for more chocolate chip  cookies but couldn't finish the deal. Frankie felt frustrated, grabbing the knife again she cut off another piece only bigger. Frankie crammed the slice into the moth as quickly as she could and wolfed it down. Chocolate frosting dotted the area around her mouth and crumbs decorated her lips. But Frankie only felt more frustrated. Frankie got another slice still unfulfilled in her chocolate desires, Frankie couldn't help herself she had a chocolate itch she couldn't scratch and giving up wasn't an option. Frankie kept stuffing slice after slice into her mouth desperately reaching for that chocolate zin she had felt in her dreams but only felt more hollow as the cake couldn't satisfy her. Soon the cake was gone and Frankie was filled with remorse. Chocolate was smeared around the area close to her mouth only a few crumbs managing to make it further away onto the cheeks. Her stomach felt stuffed with an entire chocolate cake churning inside her but her appetite had not subsided in the least. She wanted the cookies she loved so much, and nothing in this kitchen was going to answer that call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minuets later Frankie was stirring a big pot of tomato soup on one burner and a pot of chicken noodle on the other, It was Foster's tradition to eat big bowls of soup on rainy days, mostly because that's what most kids did and the friends were used to this routine. Digging her hand into the bag on the counter beside her Frankie crammed a handful of chocolate chips into her mouth. She was still full but her appetite demanded more chocolate, Frankie was barely arguing anymore, she just found a bag of chocolate chips, the closest she was going to the real cookies that she loved, she reasoned anyway. Frankie looked like a zombie at the stove, her expression was blank and her eyes seemed heavy and half shut, her stare was unfocused almost dim. One hand methodically stirred the big pots of soup slowly alternating while the other brought a steady pace of chocolate chips to her mouth. Frankie lost track of time until the bag was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much to the extra large bags...\" She muttered in a monotone sigh. Frankie check the clock, 11:46, The friends were probably migrating to the dining room by now. She grabbed a serving cart and piled a few cartons of soup crackers and tossed a platter piled high with grilled cheese sandwiches. And pushed it to the door into the dining room. Frankie then got a second cart with bowls stacked on it's lower shelf and two hot plates installed on the top. Frankie reached for a rope near the stove and gave it a big yank. After a few moments Eduardo walked heavily into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hola Frankie\" He happily greeted \"You called? Oh Frankie you don't look so good\" Eduardo commented seeing Frankie's dull expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Ed...\" She dismissed \"Would you mind getting the soup pans off the stove for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEduardo nodded and lifted the heavy pots onto the serving cart with ease. \"There you go Frankie\" He smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ed, don't know, don't wanna know, what we'd do without you\" Frankie sighed happily a smile returning to her face. \"Ed I know I usually only ask you to help me with the soup pots but today would you mind helping me by serving the soup for me too? I'm really tired for some reason today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problama\" Eduardo agreed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wilt will be in in a sec to help with the other tray, I'm sure you two can handle it, and thanks again Ed\" Frankie smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"De nada\" Eduardo assured her and pushed the cart through the doors<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie started for the door out into the hallway leading to the foyer but grabbed a grilled cheese sandwich on her way. As strange as it felt she was still hungry, however Frankie reasoned she was only going to eat this to get the taste of chocolate out of her mouth, maybe if she had something other than chocolate maybe she wouldn't feel so much need of those cookies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the rain began to fall harder as the long day continued on. The rain made a rhythmic chorus as it blanketed the roof, the sound of the rain on the old roof echoed through the wooden halls of Fosters and traveled to even the smallest nooks and crannies. All of Fosters was bathed in the soft beating of rain on the roof and windows as a reserved silence seemed to follow it. Frankie was almost falling asleep while she trudged back to her room. The white noise of the rain was like a handful of sleeping pills to her mind right now. Frankie's shoulder pressed up against the hallway walls she she tried to keep herself standing as she walked. Frankie's shoulder drug against the wall all the way to her room. Frankie licked the speck of melted cheese off the corner of her mouth, the chocolate tastes was gone but her desire still hung in there strong. Frankie plopped down onto her bed and rolled her feet along with her. Frankie barely had time to listen to the rain rap softly against her window before she was sound asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo rest was found in Frankie's dreams. She tossed and turned listlessly unable to find comfort. The bed felt hard, the air was to cold, worst of all her dreams were completely void of any hint of chocolate. Frankie let out a grumpy mumble as she tried to relax in her bed, she tried fluffing her pillow and wrapping the sheets around herself but all that did was make her pillow lumpy and she quickly started to over heat. Frankie attempted to sleep for nearly an hour before Mr.Herriman came looking for her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though she tried desperately to have that delicious cookie dream again, but that dream never came. In fact, she had the opposite of her previous, she had a nightmare. It starts out good with Frankie about to eat one of her grandmother's cookies when Mr.Herriman shows up and scolds her. \"Miss Francis, no eating on the job!\" Then he takes all of her cookies and hops towards his office. Then a mop appears in Frankie's hand and she automatically knows she has to clean up the floor. Soon things get worse as Wilt enters the room, but it's not the friendly helpful Wilt she knows. This Wilt was wearing a jacket, a monocle, and had even grown a gray mustache. Not only did he have a new look but he had developed a Mr. Herriman like personality. \"Miss Francis, You are taking too long! Hurry and finish moping this floor.\" Frankie began to mop faster, but more sloppily and missing various areas in the room. That\u2019s when Eduardo walks in the room and notices Frankie not mopping properly. He also had gained Mr. Herriman like features, and nagged Frankie. \"Miss Francis, you must be more careful. You can not clean in such a poor manner. I do not care if you are in a rush, clean this floor properly.\" So now Frankie had to go over the spots of the floor she had missed, yet as she did Coco walked in dressed as Mr. Herriman copy as well. She began speaking in her usual verbal utterances of only saying Coco repeatedly, but Frankie understood her and knew she was also telling her to work harder and make her job even harder. Soon many of the friends that Frankie had taken care of entered the room, and were all acting like Mr. Herriman. Each of them were yelling about something and demanding more and more work from her. All the imaginary friends were now as pushy and bossy as Mr. Herriman, except one. Bloo was the only friend who was not a Herriman copy, but that was far from a good thing. Bloo was being even more mischievous than his usual self. Bloo began spray painting the wall and Frankie tried to stop him, but as soon as she got close he disappeared in the blink of in eye. Bloo reappeared across the room away from Frankie and was now throwing Stink bombs across the room. Once again she charged at him, but he vanished just like before. This time he appeared with a sledge hammer and began breaking every object within his reach. Meanwhile all the other imaginary friends continually yell at her to clean up Bloo's mess, showing no sympathy. As soon as Bloo finished smashing everything in the room, he then went to Mr. Herriman's office and took the cookies Frankie was about to and mocked her as he ate her cookies, one by one. Eventually, Frankie couldn't take it anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stress from the dream woke her up with a loud scream. There was no way she was going back to sleep after a nightmare like that. So she decided to get back to work, by seeing if anyone needed help upstairs. Normally the floor above her room was the busiest in the house, so naturally she checked if anyone above her needed help. Though as she walked up the steps her hunger began to return. She tired to ignore but it was more powerful than before. It only seemed to get stronger as she went further down the hall. She started to smell something down the hall. It had a sweet scent and the scent became more intoxicatingly sweet as she continued down the long hall way. Though only Frankie seemed to notice the smell as the other friends just did what they normally did (None of the other friend were craving and desperate for chocolate like she was, so they did notice anything). The scent was very familiar to Frankie, and it helped recreate the bliss she experienced when she had her dream last night. Soon she was no longer walking but running toward whatever the scent was. She couldn't resist whatever it was and soon came across the scribble room. The scent was strongest here and she had to find out what was behind that door. She didn\u2019t care if it was the scribble room and it might let out some scribble, she had to find out what was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened the door she stood in awe as she sees the drum of Chocolate pudding that Bloo was suppose to take care of. At first she was angry that he hid the barrels in this room when he knows this room is suppose to be for scribbles only, yet that feeling of anger faded quickly. Once again she was drawn in by the scent of this chocolate pudding, and had forgotten about being angry at Bloo. She removed one of the lids of the chocolate pudding barrels and dipped her hand in the barrel. As she dipped her hand in the vat of chocolate pudding, she slowly put it towards her mouth. As she did part of her tried to reason that eating this would be fattening and that if Mr. Herriman caught her eating this stuff she would be in trouble, but by the time she processed this thought she was already eating the chocolate. Once she tasted it, she re-experiences the rapture of her dream and didn\u2019t care about the risks. As she tasted more of it tasted better than the chocolate in her dream (because the chocolate that leaked into her room had gone through the ceiling which made it lose a minuscule amount of flavor).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before she focused on nothing but the barrel of chocolate. After twenty minutes she had eaten close to half of the vat of chocolate and was once again enjoying the bliss of chocolate. Every time she tasted the pudding she fell deeper into its sweet trance. She didn\u2019t even notice that as she devoured the pudding more rapidly. About a half hour later Frankie finally felt full and was lying on the floor with chocolate smeared across her face and chocolate stains on her clothes. She just sat there in a daze savoring the sweet taste of the chocolate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie had neglected one important thing during her binge, the door was wide open! If a friend were to pass by and see her in such a state, she would be mocked by everyone in the house. She might even lose all the respect she had gained over the years of working at Fosters. None of the friends had seen her while she was eating, but someone passed by after Frankie had finally felt full and saw Frankie in her current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was\u2026      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eh, really got into the spirit of your music, eh?\" he said somewhat <i>too</i> enthusiastically, considering their audience, venue and performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean whatever wasn't painful static from that terrible equipment you landed us with?! C'mon Kaz, this is <i>embarrassing</i>... We were major rock stars half a year ago! What happened?\" Yumi bemoaned, frowning as she eyed in Kaz's other hand just how little money they'd made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yumi does have a point, Kaz. Weren't we meant to be on a nation wide tour at the moment?\" Ami added, finding it hard to stay optimistic about the dire state of their careers. \"Nation wide tour? Sorry girls, but what do you call this then? We were in the east coast last week, now we're down south, I got a couple more calls for some gigs up in DC-\" \"KAZ!\" Stopping him before he could trail off any further, Yumi pegged him to the side of their van. \"BIRTHDAY PARTIES. FOR TODDLERS. IN A CRAMPED GARAGE. DO NOT. COUNT. AS CONCERTS!!!\" Dropping him down as she caught her breath, Ami continued. \"Be straight with us; are Yumi and I... Are we a big deal anymore?\" Looking down at his feet as he racked his head for a quick answer to keep them happy and sighing as nothing believable enough game to mind, he mumbled \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to each other in case either of them had anything else to hound out of their manager, they started to climb into the trailer, nobody saying so much as a word to each other as they set off down the street, not even sure if they had enough to last the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until the next morning over a questionable breakfast Ami and Yumi finally discussed their situation and their band's popularity; or lack of thereof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwwww, no wonder this cereal tastes so stale and bad... It's been opened over a year ago!\" Ami whinged as she spat out a few brightly colored chunks of heavily processed cereal back into her bowel, Yumi shrugging and pulling it over to her to start digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That really doesn't surprise me. Anyway, I think we need to seriously address our situation here Yumi. Kaz may not be the best of managers, but even he can't of somehow messed up getting us a serious performance in every state. It's like somebody's working against us... I just don't see how we went from sell-out concerts, movie deals and promotional tie-ins to nothing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*URRRRP* Don't see what your problem was with this stuff is, tastes perfectly fine regardless of use-by date. Also don't see what your big mystery is; one day everybody liked our music, next day some new guy comes in with something 'amazing' and 'fresh' and we never kicked back. Hence, everybody forgets we exist and we live on next to nothing.\" Swallowing the last of her huge breakfast, Yumi started to muse over this theory. \"Though I don't see how some dork could've one-upped us without us hearing about it until after we're stuck at some brats birthday party...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, mindlessly  belting out a few simple chords on her bed, Yumi was startled to attention by Ami bursting into her room. \"Hey! What do I ALWAYS say about knocking first!\" Ami ignored her best friend's complaints as she reached behind her and producing a rolled up magazine... In fact, one of the ones the two were interviewing with before their careers mysteriously plummeted. \"Aaaand I'm looking at what?\" Grabbing it out of Ami's hands, Yumi looked over the cover. \"Oh man, check out Captain Lardo on the front page. They crane lift her into that photo shoot!? She looks a wee bit familar though... Can't quite put my finger on it...\" Ami rolled her eyes and points to each relevant blurb and headline to Yumi. After a few moments, Yumi's giggling stopped. \"And yes, before you ask, it's not April Fools day. Our 'mystery rival'... Is 450lbs 'bombshell' as they put it, pop singer Julie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ami said, on the front cover on America's most highly regarded destination for music gossip and news, Yumi's ex-friend and Ami's still-nemesis had finally managed to overshadow the two... Quite literally. Still wearing the same demented smile and her old, now stretched clothes, which now barely clung onto her new immensely plump frame, Yumi took a moment to fully register what she was reading. \"... I KNEW she was trouble since I met her!\" Yumi cried out in anger, teeth clenched at just how stupid a turn their whole financial  situation had suddenly taken. \"What!? You're the one who replaced me with her in the band for a night last time! But there IS a bright side to all this Yumi... Now we know EXACTLY we've both been lacking of in great deals of for the past few months\" Ami started to wear an uncharacteristically sinister smile as she glanced at the cover one more time, then started to stare at Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't quite follow where... Wait... You don't mean... Oh god. I know EXACTLY what you're thinking and it would be freaking <i>retarded</i>. No no no NO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi merely continued to smile. \"Yes yes yes YES! Don't you see? This'll be easy! Obviously Julie just turned to comfort food back in the nut house and Americans being the tubbo's they are wanted a pop idol who was larger and dumber then them to make them feel good about themselves! We... Eh, obviously didn't fit into that category at the moment, but give us a few months and we'll be so big-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Look, Ami; I know how all this looks, but firstly, I don't want to blimp out... Again. Secondly, we don't have enough dough to pig out for months on end. Lastly, this smells exactly like the kind of thing Julie would've spent ages planning just to get at us. At best, to make us look stupid. She probably knows how much you get worked up about her and at worst, another outlandish plot to kill both of us... Through clogged arteries or leaving us too fat to defend ourselves, I don't know, but I can say that none of this is going to end pretty for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi's smile faded as her friend continued to shoot down what she saw as their only plan back to stardom. \"Well fine then, I guess <i>somebody</i> just doesn't want fame badly enough. Hmmmph!\" Crossing her arms Ami turns her back on Yumi, starting to walk to the door. \"I guess it's just me from now on! I'll try and remember to call when I'm living it up back at the top!\" Before she leaves, Yumi finally makes up her mind. \"Ami, look...\"</span></div></div>",

Even if it IS a dumb idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping up and down with glee, Ami turns around and grabs Yumi into a tight hug, only letting her go when she noticed her start to gag. \"Ooooh, I knew you'd see it my way! With me as gorgeous plus-sized poster girl and you as musical prodigy, we're going to take that fatty down more then a couple pegs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back her breath, Yumi started to lead Ami out the door and back into their kitchen. \"Yeah yeah, it's easy enough to <i>say</i> you're gonna beat Julie at her own game, but... Eh...\" As her best friend motions around their kitchen, Ami's glee started to fade a bit, as she realizes with each empty cabinet and piles of month old dishes that they haven't had any decent food stockpiled between the three of them for ages, let alone enough to fatten up Ami. Noticing her pink-haired friend starting to sniffle at her plans seemingly getting dashed before they'd even started, Yumi wrapped an arm around her and comforted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nawwww, don't worry about this! I'll think of SOMETHING long-term eventually... But for the moment, I wanna see how much of a glutton you have in you!\" Wiping a few tears away, Ami still remained cautious. \"Until you think of something 'long-term'? So what do you have up your sleeve at the moment?\" Crossing her arms looking smug with herself, Yumi chortled. \"Weeeelll, seeing as I'm normally the slob of the house I think I'll have the know-how to see if you really have it in you! Fat girl in a skinny girl's body and all that. All I need is for you to get a bit of that pocket change we made yesterday off Kaz and to skip lunch; you're gonna have a very, very, <i>very</i> filling meal tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly sitting down in what were pretty old baggy clothes she normally used as PJ's, Ami looked around at the obscure restaurants surroundings. Barely any other patrons in sight, or workers for that matter, dirt and other filth splattered all over the walls and obnoxious fumes coming out of the kitchen. It would've never been her choice, yet she was remaining hopeful that Yumi knew what she was getting her into. At the very least, she seemed confident as she put her boots up on the table next to her and picked at her teeth, the only words she uttered to a lone waiter when taking their order was \"All of it.\" As he walked away, Yumi started to prep her new student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this place seems kinda... Dodgy, but trust me, if you can get through an All-You-Can-Eat buffet suspiciously priced at $5 on the side of the freeway like this one, you can plow that mouth of yours through <i>anything</i>.\" Noticing Ami taking a few sniffs and then reclining, Yumi continued. \"Eh, ignore the smell.... And taste for that matter! Wonder how come gladly eat stuff like that moldy old cereal? That stupid gag reflex of yours is only there to rob you of more precious food. If you feel like you're gonna hurl, just swallow, and sure enough in a few weeks your tongue's gonna salivate at <i>anything</i> remotely edible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi still looked nervous, the few glimpses she could make out through the swinging kitchen doors doing little to convince her that she'd be eating anything remotely pleasant at this run-down restaurant. When the first few dishes came out, that anxiety turned into flat-out terror, the piles of dark slimy muck quivering and shaking, some hairy while others seemingly melting suggested anything but fine dining. \"Y-y-y-y-umi, that one's MOVING!\" Seemingly undeterred, Yumi raised a fork and quickly stabbed the meal in question with a sickly squelch. \"And now it's not! C'mon, if I were in your shoes I'd of been demanding seconds from these losers by now!\" Ami reluctantly picked up a knife and fork, teeth clenched as she slowly cut up a small slab of... Whatever that particular green crusty blob was. Carrying it closer to her tongue, her hand started to shake, the two girls now waiting with baited breath if Ami was capable of becoming an eating machine to save their careers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLosing patience, Yumi impulsively clamps Ami's mouth down shut on the fork, stroking her throat to force her to swallow. \"Sorry Ami, but sometimes you've just got to start running before you walk!\" As Ami gulped and gagged, gaining her breath as she tries to work out what she felt about the mystery meal...</span></div></div>",

After a few awkward moments, Ami quickly pulls the plate closer to herself, cutting off a much large slab of... Whatever the stuff was, and not even shuddering as she chewed it happily in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Atta girl Ami! See, if you judged a book by its cover you might've been missing out on some great dining...\" Picking up a piece with her bare hands, Yumi takes a large bite, completely taken aback at the strong taste, as if a steak had been left behind the radiator for several months, then re-cooked. \"... *Groan* Oh god I think I'm gonna hurl...\" Holding her stomach and barging past anybody who stood in her way to the bathroom, Ami merely shrugged and downed the rest of the dish, honestly enjoying the exotic cooking this cheap roadside diner had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Yumi groggily came out Ami was still making a heavy dent in the vast quantity of food she'd bought her, managing a smile as she saw her stuffed belly starting to bloat up from underneath her baggy t-shirt. Waddling back to the table she noticed Ami had already adapted some of her own patented pig-out techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Mmpth* Hey Yumi... *URRRRP!* Did'ya know that using you hands...\" She stockpiled another several handfuls of stale blue bread into her mouth, speaking with her mouth full after small gulps, \"reduces the time to bring food to your mouth? *URRRRRRP* Whoops... Excuse me!\" Wiping her mouth clean, Ami admired her handiwork as she robbed her globular basketball belly. \"Awwww, look at it Yumi! Like a bun in the oven... Though it's going to become all doughy by tomorrow!\" Yumi simply gave two thumbs up, avoiding to speak lest she spend another half-hour head down in a public toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you alright Yumi?! You're looking kinda pale there... Oh well, just more for me then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night trailed off, Yumi admired just how far her little piggy prodigy was doing, while Ami ate to stomach's content, which wound up being even more then either of the two could've ever guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two finally returned to the tour bus, the diner behind them nailing shut their windows and moving out furniture and equipment due to a certain customer finally managing to stomach all of their cooking and supplies, let a lone <i>any</i> of it, Ami and Yumi admired her stuffed belly, smiling through the minor discomfort the sheer amount she'd eaten had caused. \"Well Ami, you've made me proud. If you could devour whatever the heck that stuff was and have enough room for seconds, then there's no way you're not going to be able to out-blimp Julie within a few months!\" After the two laugh a bit, Ami snacking even further on the few cans of food they could salvage from the kitchen, Yumi went to her room for the night to hit the hey after a hard night 'testing' Ami's potential to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was going to, until Yumi realized before nodding off in her bed one crucial detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami, wake up! I just remembered- Eh... What's up with your stomach?\" As Yumi rushed in to see her finishing off a simplistic smiley on her belly, Ami tries to pull her PJ top over her stomach and acts oblivious. \"Erm, eh... <i>What about my stomach</i>? Larger then you remembered?\" Shrugging it off for the time being, Yumi quickly pointed out that neither of them had yet thought up of a long-term plan of them gathering enough money to fund Ami's ascension to plumpdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeah, today was fun and all but if we're going to surprise Julie it's better if we don't live off obscure crummy $5 buffets and get some <i>real</i> food. Like boxes of heavily processed cheese balls and a Slurpee machine!\" Noticing Ami had already started zoning out and drooling at the thought, Yumi snaps her back into reality. \"Ami, earth to Ami; concentrate here! That's 5 pounds you gained at most tonight, and we probably only have enough spare cash to do another couple weeks. By the time Julie catches on she'll probably be larger then this bus next thing we know it! She probably already has the fortune to get it done anyway. We gotta do this fast and efficiently, I just don't know how...\" As Yumi thinks to herself, head resting against Ami's belly, the stuffed singer comes up with a plan.</span></div></div>",

I was already stuffed from some old food in a nearby trashcan to even think about eating all these job forms.\" The purple haired rocker gagged a bit as Ami seemed to find little strange about this; she may take pride in being more than a bit of a junk food connoisseur herself, but she'd never think about eating <i>actual</i> junk food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, that's... cool, I guess. About finding a job already, the eating out of a trash thing is kinda gross, even for me.

What\u2019ve you found?\" Grinning mischievously, Ami continued to put on a show. \"<i>Oh my no,</i> somebody so health obsessed and proper like you would NEVER want to work here... Even if it's eating all the greasy, deep-fried and salty junk-food your gut can handle at Greasy Joes after every working day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat certainly got Yumi\u2019s attention, the purple-haired punk rocker eyes widening and tongue falling out as her friend continued with her teasing. \u201cBoy, having to find a decent home-\" Ami comically patted her stomach \"for all those dozens of big, juicy burgers, buckets of french fries and gallons of soft serve ice cream so they can avoid the cost of trashbags for all that left over food would be soooooo BORING for you, wouldn't it~?\" Looking at Yumi to savour her expression, Ami couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing at her glazed over eyes and hanging tongue, a small bit of drool dripping on her shirt. Yumi eventually returned to reality and tried her best to seem indifferent. \"Yeah, whatever Ami. It's YOU who has to be a fatty to upstage Julie-\" \"And wouldn't it be easier with TWO fat rock divas? Look, just try a night with me, they still have a spot left...

Absent mindedly she reached down and picked up a half eaten bag of stale chips and started to munch on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Yumi\" Ami said taking an interest in Yumi's choice of snack \"That bag of chips...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Yumi said snapping out of a trance \"Wha? Oh...\" Yumi said surprised, she didn't even realize she had picked up the chips \"Yeah I did say they were to stale to eat yesterday, weird... They seem fine now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not that\" Ami leaned over towards Yumi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what?\" Yumi asked confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Share\" Ami complained and tried in vein to take the bag from Yumi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi stood and backed away \"No way find your own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Ami pouted \"Then I get those week old donuts Kaz hid under the sink!\" Ami said and raced off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Yumi cried out and poured the rest of the chips in her mouth quickly before running after Ami \"You gotta share!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls reached the kitchen and Ami dove for the sink cabinet. Yumi leapt on top her and started to pulled her out. Ami was pulled out already stuffing two of the hard stale fried dough rings in her mouth and removing another three with the other hand. Yumi grabbed the box and snagged three more trying to bit into the tough exterior. Ami took the chance to grab the last donut left and ran into the living room. As Yumi choked down the nasty donuts she realized where Ami was headed. In the living room Ami threw the seat cushions aside revealing a half eaten hot dog beneath them. It was old and had been sat on at least once, surely a left over from a week or so before that Kaz had clumsily dropped. Ami wasted no time in stuffing it in her mouth. Yumi watched from the door way furious Ami had beat her to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi moved as quickly as she could to the front of the bus into the driver's cab and opened the glove compartment. Lucky for her a partially eaten pretzel had been left in there for a few weeks. Yumi wolfed it down without a second thought. Returning to the kitchen she found Ami hopelessly rooting around the cabinets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still so hungry...\" Ami moaned as she shook an empty cereal box and shook it over her mouth for a few more crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean...\" Yumi sighed as she rubbed her flat stomach which gurgled loudly. \"I've gone without a meal before, I can deal with a little hunger. But right now I would kill for a cheeseburger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd dye my hair puke brown for a plate of fried chicken!\" Ami sobbed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd play disco music to get a chili dog\" Yumi frowned still rubbing her empty gut<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd star in one of those naughty movies to get a slice of cake\" Ami said slumping down into seat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd give up music forever... just for a real meal right now\" Yumi cried out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're that hungry?!\" Ami gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi simply nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... me too\" Ami quietly sighed and looked down at the floor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls! Girls!\" Kaz yelled excitedly \"I think I found it, I think I found the secret of Julie's success!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did?\" Ami perked back up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it?\" Yumi looked up from her gloomy slump<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her music! It's in her music\" Kaz said getting eager<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she is a better musician?\" Ami asked puzzled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell she is!\" Yumi shouted out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, IN the music!\" Kaz said \"Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls followed Kaz to the music mixing room where Kaz had set up. \"I was at a loss for what was different until I ran the music through the filter. I thought maybe if I split it up into each instrument I could listen to just her voice, you know see if there was anything special about it vs you girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" Yumi asked impatient<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got an extra file\" Kaz said \"I had each instrument separated and her voice but their was one more file I didn't know where it came from. The play back on it sounded empty, I thought the computer messed up. Until I changed the frequency!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Ami asked curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it sounded, like this!\" Kaz said and tapped a key on his console. A loud hum vibrated from the speakers making the room shake and Caused Ami and Yumi to howl in pain as they covered their ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it off!\" Yumi screamed over the hum<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaz complied and flicked the button again and the room went silent \"That is her secret\" Kaz announced<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? a faulty amp in their recording studio?\" Ami asked sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Subliminal messages!\" Kaz screamed as he made his eyes turn in opposite directions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Seriously?\" Ami was shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures she needs to hypnotize her fans into liking her giant butt\" Yumi scoffed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that wacky label has been adding this in the background to her music so people will love it no matter what.\" Kaz mused \"So if we used this thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No way!\" Yumi exclaimed \"I do not need this cheat trick to rock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yumi's right Kaz\" Ami nodded \"This would just be cheating, we shouldn't stoop to their level\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But girls!\" Kaz pleaded \"You can't beat her if your fans are being stolen away! If you use it too then she'll be forced to match her skills against yours. This is just evening the odds! Leveling the playing field!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaz...\" The girls sighed</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Welcome to West Virginia<br>\r\nWild and Wonderful<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus flew by the welcome sign as it barreled down I-68 on its way to Ohio. Inside an average looking girl sighed despondently as she watched it pass through the transparent reflection of herself. It wasn't like Daria to be genuinely depressed, normally her melancholy attitude was just her passive aggressive way of dealing with the world but this time she had really landed herself in a mess\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't been as deliberate or vindictive as Principal Li claimed it had been. It was obvious Li was just seizing the opportunity to be rid of her. Even if Daria\u2019s expulsion would cost the school a sizable chunk of their test score average, Daria was too often an obstacle to Miss. Li\u2019s profiteering schemes. For all she cared the school could become a wasteland of brain dead sheep, she\u2019d always find a way to make money either from them or on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Principal's latest scheme to exploit students didn't agree with Daria, as always, and she had voiced these opinions to any who would listen. When that inevitably failed to gather support Daria had to act on her own. The school was hosting a career open house for student\u2019s to gather \u201creal world\u201d experience in working for various local businesses.  What it had really been was a bidding war carried out under the table for the local market to pay for students to come and get a jump start on a lifetime of toiling for little money.  Even the nearby army recruitment representative had put down enough money to snag a half dozen young men for a day of mock training in the base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest contributor had been Cluster Burger. Whatever they had paid had gotten them nearly three busloads of students to be distributed to various locations in the surrounding counties. Their regional manager eager to get a jump start on cultivating a new crop of out of shape greasy pimple faced teens to sling burgers in their restaurants. Perhaps an act of spite by Li, Daria found herself in one of those groups. She watched her classmates lining up to be paid in minimum wage and cheese burgers. While seeing the self-proclaimed fashion club headed for a future of modeling flabby guts hanging out of a tight Cluster Burger uniform had its enjoyment, Daria had to make a stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria figured if she did a bad enough job and several customers ended up with stomach cramps, complaining of bad meat, the school would take enough heat for sending students to work for a day that Li would be in hot water with the super intendant. Once they had arrived and been given their assignments Daria slipped into the freezer to grab a box of patties while Sandi\u2019s tantrum over a broken nail from manning the fryer basket provided the perfect distraction. The idea had been to set the burgers out by the water heater to thaw and sit in a lukewarm box for a few hours. Then when the lunch rush came she\u2019d serve a few burgers undercooked and create a PR nightmare for the restaurant and the school when people demanded answers. After all, a little food poisoning couldn\u2019t be too bad Daria thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more than a PR nightmare for everyone involved, Daria included when an expectant mother ended up in the hospital with a nasty illness from undercooked meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all there were 11 cases of food poisoning not including the soon to be mother who had to be rushed in an ambulance. Her case was mild but it was a media frenzy and the first reports were quick to claim the baby\u2019s life was in mortal danger. This opened far more than just an investigation into why local students were spending a day in a restaurant as employee under school sanction. It quickly became a criminal investigation when the media coverage had pictures of a pregnant mother in a hospital gurney clutching her swollen abdomen and crying out for doctors to save her baby. Over hyped or not public outcry demanded someone be responsible that blame could be cast upon. Naturally it was Daria, who was caught on camera intentionally placing the patties by the water heater then turning down the grille heat before cooking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi jumped at the chance to shift the focus to Daria and away from why she was there to begin with, tossing out her history as an anarchist and general trouble maker, claiming she had been beyond the school\u2019s power to help with their current funding. The local news already enjoying a statewide spotlight for Daria\u2019s victims took the claims a step further calling her a home grown terrorist. Daria\u2019s face was on every newspaper and TV for days debating how a local girl had become so angry at the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria\u2019s mother used her connections to get the PR debacle under control, citing poor judgment and Daria\u2019s past doing charity work as proof she had no intentions of hurting anyone. Daria\u2019s fate was unclear as voices on both sides of the bench argued over what to do with her. When it was suggested she be sent away, perhaps to a school for troubled teens in lieu of prosecution Daria saw a chance to escape the local focus for a while asking she be sent to stay with a close family member such as an aunt. Daria was more than happy to take her exile if it meant she got to go stay with favorite Aunt Amy and let everyone move on to forget about everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like Daria was in luck when the idea pleased everyone who had a real say in the matter. The attorney agreed to let Daria be under probation if she apologized and was sent away for a while. Her parents were happy to oblige her if it meant she\u2019d dodge jail time or some embarrassing correctional facility for criminal teens. And Daria was thrilled to see Amy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Amy was not who she was now on her way to live with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhio welcomes you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few hours away from her new home for the foreseeable future Daria\u2019s stomach knotted up as she recalled the apologetic phone call with her Aunt who simply could not take Daria in. She was two weeks away from a trip to Europe with a business associate and would be there for at least a month. Needing somewhere to dump her right away and Aunt Rita absolutely unwilling to take her Daria\u2019s fate was handed over to her Father\u2019s sister Victoria. Daria had not seen her aunt from her father\u2019s side in years. The last and probably one of the few times she\u2019d met her had been at a wedding for Victoria\u2019s son Richard. Daria didn\u2019t really know much about Aunt Victoria either aside from being a bit spoiled by their grandfather and having a daughter named Ginger close to Daria\u2019s age. Not long after she last saw her Aunt Victoria she had moved to some little town in Ohio and never had any contact with the family until Daria\u2019s father reached out to her to look after Daria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelcome to Chirps Creek Ohio<br>\r\nCoziest little town on the Ohio River<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sign for Chirps Creek was rusted and half obscured by dead brush. Nestled in the preverbal armpit of Kentucky and West Virginia Chirps Creek was smack in the middle of a tri-state area. Daria knew the town was going to be hick city when she passed two bait shops and nearly a dozen fast food restaurants before she saw the first few homes, most of which were doublewide trailers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria didn\u2019t expect anything to be particularly different about her Aunt; it had only been a few years since she saw her, maybe three or four since she moved away. Aside from the basics all Daria knew about Victoria\u2019s career was she worked for one of the biggest snack food manufacturers in the country, \u201cLittle Missy\u201d. She seemed to have a good job judging from how well off a single mother of two lived when last she met her. Perhaps she\u2019d fallen on hard times or gone slightly insane to have moved to this crummy town but nothing major could have changed. However stepping off the greyhound bus in the tiny bus terminal for Chirps Creek Daria saw the face of her red haired Aunt waving to her enthusiastically. The woman that sat there on the hood of her car was a drastically different Victoria than the prissy beauty queen who Daria had seen last.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cDaria! It\u2019s great to see yall again!\u201d her Aunt Victoria gushed as Daria hoisted her duffle bag over one shoulder and picked up a small leather tote she had carried with her on the bus. Her Aunt Victoria slowly lumbered to the step up onto the bus platform but stopped short of stepping up to meet her. Instead she decided to wait for Daria to reach the edge before trying to offer up an unwelcome hug. Daria leaned away but the thick arms of her Aunt caught her pulling her into the fleshy grip. Daria\u2019s Aunt had certainly changed, gone was the gaunt fashion diva, what was pulling Daria into a soft sweaty press was a round tank top and stretch pants wearing pig. As Daria was released from the grip she could see faded stains in the white fabric of the top her aunt wore and trashy makeup with too much eyeliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw it\u2019s good to see you again darlin\u2019\u201d her aunt smiled putting chunky hands on her wide dimpled hips letting them sink in a ways. Daria struggled to pick her duffle bag back up after losing it in the hug assault. Victoria turned her back to Daria as she lifted the 30 pound duffle bag, Daria could detect a noticeable lag time between her aunt\u2019s turn and the rest of her ass catching up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching her car Victoria happily dove in making the shocks squeak in response as the car tilted to one side slightly. Inside she roared the engine to life and turned on the AC. Only after returning to her air cooled haven did she acknowledge Daria once more, motioning for her to toss her bag in the trunk and hop in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you got yourself in a bit of trouble I hear\u201d Daria found her aunt grinning at her as she slid into the passenger seat. \u201cRaised a bit ah hell an got yourself kicked out of the stuffy school you were goin\u2019 to\u201d Victoria threw the car into reverse and turned the car around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m a real lost cause\u201d Daria exaggerated gloomily \u201cThey couldn\u2019t find a book big enough to throw at me so they just threw me out\u201d Daria propped her head onto one arm and stared out the window at the seemingly endless  cycle of trailer parks and strip malls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer aunt erupted with laughter \u201cThata girl!\u201d She paused to take a sip of an oversized food mart soda cup \u201cI didn\u2019t like schoolin very much myself, Got the heck outta there when I was still 16 and hot, then again I suppose I\u2019m still doin\u2019 pretty good in the looks department\u201d Victoria tried to strike a pose but had to put her hands back on the steering wheel when the car suddenly drifted into the dirt shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief she was still alive Daria had to raise a question to her aunt\u2019s claim. \u201cI thought grandma and grandpa sent you to some private boarding school, some really pretentious one they didn\u2019t even send dad to.  You only left early because you got pregnant and they didn\u2019t want to deal with the embarrassment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria was silent for a moment, the car started to drift again \u201cI\u2026 well\u2026\u201d Victoria\u2019s brow creased and she looked down puzzled. Daria reached over quickly to steady the steering wheel, she was sure this was the first time since she\u2019d gotten off the bus her aunt was actually processing thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2026\u201d Victoria chimed again \u201cYeah yeah that\u2019s right!\u201d She said at last \u201cI got pregnant and then I\u2026\u201d she trailed off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had Richard, you tried to be one of the first teen pregnant girls to get a reality TV show but it was the 80s so those didn\u2019t exist yet remember?\u201d Daria led her while driving from the passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I did\u2026ugh this is givin\u2019 me a head ache\u201d She winced and reached for her extra-large soda. She took a long sip and gulped down several mouthfuls before stopping for air. She seemed much calmer afterwards, the pained expression relaxed and she took control of the wheel again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria waited a moment for her aunt to try to resume the conversation but it seemed she had dropped the matter entirely \u201cSo what exactly do you re-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh look there\u2019s the Little Missy sign!\u201d Victoria abruptly burst out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Little Missy snack cake corporation sign was larger than a bus and hung on the side of a tall glass building that loomed over the highway. Behind it a brick building that served as the distribution hub with a line of trucks being loaded up that must have stretched almost a quarter of a mile long. Still further back was a large facility where presumably the many cakes were being made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig place huh?\u201d Victoria smiled back to being in good spirits \u201cThey say it\u2019s their hub for this side of the country. They built that place a few years ago and I got transferred here to be a part of some new customer adaptation thing. We gave jobs to everyone in town. Mostly consultant titles which just means I get them to try new products and we talk for a while about what they think of them.\u201d Victoria waved a hand to the messy back seat crowded with empty fast foot bags and crumpled up soda cups. Tucked between them were some large cardboard boxes with the Little Missy logo on them. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more fun than that boring stuff they had me doing before like uh\u2026 umm\u201d Victoria\u2019s smile faded, her face bunching up tightly in thought again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria watched the glass tower disappear behind the trees as her Aunt took another big sip of soda. \u201cSo what do people do around here for fun?\u201d She tried to find a subject more topical her Aunt might manage to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh lottsa stuff!\u201d She snorted putting the cup back down \u201cWe got a big mall nearby, plenty of shopping there, and there\u2019s a bowling alley you can go bowling at\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrat I wanted to go to the bowling alley to swim a few laps\u201d Daria quipped in a monotone voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Victoria was confused \u201cNo you go swimming at the swimming pool stupid\u201d she shook her head \u201cwe have that too, it\u2019s by the laundromat, you know what a laundromat is for right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria held her quip in this time but judging by her aunt\u2019s current state of dress she could be asking her the same question. The car took a right onto a gravel road leading into another trailer park. Daria\u2019s stomach tied itself into that familiar knot again when she realized one of these must have been her aunt\u2019s, and now hers, home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria grew even more hopeless as they passed a sign intended as a serious reminder to residents that shooting their fire arms into the air for celebration was against the law. Daria\u2019s face soured as she saw dried dead grass, broken down rusted cars in yards, and make shift grills made from oil drums and other trash that could be found likely dumped in the river. Daria started wondering if she could get a reduced sentence for good behavior, she\u2019d actually help Li with one of her plans at this point if it meant going home right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are! My home sweet home!\u201d Victoria proudly sang. It was a double wide trailer and had an actual patio made of wood on the back with non-broken lawn chairs to sit in. A refreshing change of pace Daria thought to herself lowering her standards already. \u201cCome on and lets find Ginger, I bet she\u2019s dying to show you around\u201d</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s great to see you again!\u201d her Aunt Victoria beamed as Daria hoisted her duffle bag over one shoulder and picked up a small leather tote she had carried with her on the bus. Her Aunt Victoria confidently strode onto the bus platform so they could both get a better look at one another. Daria could see her Aunt had certainly toughened up. Gone was her expensive designer blouse and trendy skirt, now she wore a sharp professional suit. Granted the suit still looked very expensive but the confident air about her aunt showed it was intended to be a statement of her skills and expertise, not a statement of how much money she had to spend like her aunt once strived to flaunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere let me help you with that\u201d Victoria offered a well-manicured hand with polished and painted nails to take Daria\u2019s duffle for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Auntie Victoria\u201d Daria obliged in her usual lackluster tone ending on a disingenuous high note. She nearly tossed the bag at her aunt well aware of the weighty books and thick unflattering clothes it was packed with. But to her surprise even her aunt\u2019s strength was clearly new and improved, without flinching Victoria caught the bag with one arm and lifted it easily over her shoulder as she popped the trunk open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father already gave me all the details but why don\u2019t you fill me in on what happened to get you sent to Chirp\u2019s Creek?\u201d Victoria was friendlier than Daria remember too. As she opened the passenger door and slid into the seat Victoria was smiling at her, <i>does she genuinely care about my feelings on this?</i> Daria thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria started the car and backed out of the Bus station parking \u201cThere\u2019s not much to tell really\u201d Daria began \u201cI\u2019m a troubled teen who acted out and put some people in the hospital, I belong behind bars\u201d Daria somberly sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sarcasm wasn\u2019t going to shield her from her aunt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d She tried to sound genuinely shocked \u201cJake said you made a strong statement against your principal\u2019s unscrupulous behavior. I don\u2019t think he fully understood the message you were trying to send but he still stood by whatever it was you did to get yourself in this predicament\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria\u2019s focus on the procession of trailer parks passing by was broken as she gave her aunt a dumbfounded look. \u201cDad said that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo not exactly, you know how Jake is\u201d Victoria looked upward as she searched for the right words \u201cHis emotions and his reactions aren\u2019t always on the same page. He was proud of you but he talked a lot about what a mess you\u2019d created. Oh, this is where I work\u201d Victoria gestured to a very large building on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Little Missy snack cake corporation sign was larger than a bus and hung on the side of a tall glass building that loomed over the highway. Behind it a brick building that served as the distribution hub with a line of trucks being loaded up that must have stretched almost a quarter of a mile long. Still further back was a large facility where presumably the many cakes were being made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the largest hub on the east coast\u201d Victoria explained while Daria had to shift and look over her shoulder to keep taking in how large the facility was. \u201cI work for the consumer adaptation division; we keep the products popular by working with our customers to offer snack cakes that blow our competitors out of the water. We also test new samples and address consumers who need\u2026 more persuasion to buy our products. Let\u2019s just say I make sure nobody can get enough of our cakes.\u201d Victoria looked over at Daria wryly smiling. Daria wasn\u2019t sure what her aunt meant by this but coming out of her shell a bit she decided to ask a bit more about her aunt. \u201cSo why here? Why move out here to this\u2026 cesspool? Wouldn\u2019t a large distribution and manufacturing facility be much more cost effective in a larger city?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria was tight lipped for a moment and Daria felt a chill enter the car \u201cNo\u201d she said curtly, then the smile and warm demeanor returned \u201cChirp\u2019s creek is the best place for us, we sell a little bit of America in our cakes and what\u2019s more American than small towns?\u201d Daria could feel the prepackaged quality to this answer; it was different than the kind genuine aunt she had been speaking to a few moments ago, Daria had touched on a subject that was making her behave mysteriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria shifted back to small talk, the local schools, economy, what it was like living here. Daria found her aunt\u2019s responses were more natural when addressing her opinions of the local, but when the responses were in addressing the actual structure and facts of living here she was more rehearsed in her answers. All Daria could gather was her impression of this town was pretty spot on. It was poor and most who lived here were low income. Despite the rhetoric Daria could tell the entire town had become dependent on Little Missy as a lynch pin for the economy and Daria had her suspicions this was by design for Little Missy\u2019s benefit. Looking at her aunt and the car they rode in it was safe to say only those working in the glass tower built for Little Missy made any real money. Her suspicion was confirmed as they turned into a gated community named Missy\u2019s garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the gates was like going from night to day. Outside it had been nothing but trailer homes and strip malls. Inside it was large homes with wide lush green lawns. Daria saw double car ports, two and three story houses, and most homes had a pool or some other recreational expenditure using a portion of the sizable backyards. Daria was shocked by the change but at the same time inside her head she was breathing a huge sigh of relief that her exile would be spent here and not in the poverty stricken wasteland outside the gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is me- I mean, us\u201d Victoria half sang as she pulled into the driveway of one of the large expensive homes. \u201cCome on in I bet Ginger will want to catch up with you too\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was after supper and she was on her back with her hand stretched out past her head staring at the ceiling. \"Another day where nothing interesting happens\" she moaned at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo rolled back and forth from side to side restlessly as she tried to cope with the boredom.  It had been weeks since the last experiment had gone active and it was the first few weeks of summer, Lilo had no school to go to, no experiments to catch, and a record low in tourism for Hawaii was making for some very uneventful days for Lilo. Jumba was deep in work on more crazy inventions and Pleakley was off to some \"Happy Home Makers\" conference. Lilo could normally find countless ways to entertain herself but even the wildest imaginations have their off times. Lilo was truly bored and not even Stitch could help her. Lilo looked up again at the ceiling rolling her eyes around the room looking for something to do her eyes finally coming to rest on the corner of the room her bed was in. Lilo sat for a moment looking at all the pictures she had hung there before eventually flipping herself over so she could look at them upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sure are lucky\" Lilo sighed as she looked at the pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some time now She had been taking and collecting pictures of many of the tourists who came to their island, Always with one common quality among them.... fat. It was true, Lilo had a strange obsession with overweight people. She never could place it, The gentile curves of their bodies, the soft feel of their fat, the way they could happy lay in the sun for hours just relaxing and eating, it was all so alluring to her. Lilo recalled the lady she saw one summer not to long ago, she must have weighed 400 pounds and wore a skimpy Bathing suit that was clearly meant for a woman half her size. Lilo's jaw must have hit the beach when she saw that woman. Lilo had wanted to run right over to her and bury herself in the folds of fat that hung off and in many cases were bursting out of the bathing suit. Lilo had never forgiven herself for forgetting her camera that day. Lilo must have followed her for hours longing to just touch that soft lovely flesh. Lilo never understood what made her desire these things so much. As she lay there day dreaming about all that fat her hands began to find their way to her mid section and began to slowly rub up and down her body. Lilo smiles as she imagined herself getting bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could just eat all I wanted and out grow my clothes and watch myself grow and grow and gro-\" Lilo cut out. Was that really her? Her mind had begun to wander for sure but how did she get into the topic of being fat herself? Is that what she wanted? To be as fat as the woman? Lilo closed her eyes and pictured herself at that woman's size, a tantalizing tingle ran through her body as she imagined the possibilities. \"Wow...\" Lilo thought as she began to breath heavier. \"That's was... sort of a rush\" she realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around she grabbed her pillow and shoved it under her dress, Lilo began to kneed her pillowy body feeling the plushness. The pillow was easily making her feel like twice her size and Lilo was loving how tight her dress felt stretched across her body. She had been this big before... no... bigger. Yeah she had been big before! When they had French Fry cooking for them they had gotten huge! But it wasn't really fat... They had been bloated by the food, she hadn't noticed her love for this feeling then because it was more of a balloon feeling, but come to think of it despite the fear she had felt at the time over being unable to stop herself and the fact French Fry tried to eat them she had such a peaceful feeling about the whole situation due to her enjoying the size and feel of being so big and soft. If only she could be that big again.... that big... and actually fat this time... Could she? French Fry was great at cooking and making fattening foods but they never made you truly fat, just bloated, and if the intake wasn't kept up it would burn off in a few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Jumba can help me\" Lilo thought. She pulled the pillow from under her dress and rushed down to Jumba's room to find out more. </span></div></div>",

Oh yes, Experiment 062! Ah you and your name for my creations...\" he chuckled. \"Well 062 was never perfected... more of a weekend project to be honest\" Jumba explained as he leaned back in his chair and looked up to better recall the whole ordeal. \"I wanted to make an Experiment to be my personal Chef because I was not a very good at cookink myself, This was natually a bad idea I was having because not knowink how to cook it was difficult to create somethink that knew thinks I didn't. a heh heh\" He mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened\" Lilo asked wishing he would tell her what went wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not knowink how to cook I just downloaded the information 062 required from a galaxy wide data base, somewhat similar to your primitive world wide webbing\" Jumba said dismissively \"062 knew how to do it but had never experienced cooking, naturally he developed his own methods for goink about it. I never knew how he did it but he managed to make the food in such a way that it was releasink all the calories and fats instantaneously, those who ate the food would be filled with a mass quantity of empty calories at an abundant weight. The fat cells became a sort of balloon and got all puffy from the unnatural growth they were havink to go through\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That.... doesn't make much sense actually...\" Lilo trailed off unsure what it meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not quite sure my self little girl\" Jumba admitted \"The fat seemed to become filed with a substance lighter than air. It caused you to get bigger while slowly getting slightly lighter. I can only imagine the process was causink the fat to produce a bi-product that was very light and fluffy. As for the wantink to eat people... Well not all programs are perfect, one of the many bugs in his design was never identifying a proper food source. As a cook 062 developed the need to cook it's own meal and for ingredients 062 viewed it's victims as a helpless potential meal. So 062 would just fatten them up until they were helpless and then chow down. a heh heh heh\" Jumba laughed as he hoped it would satisfy her curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Lilo said \"So you just gave up and put him back in his pod?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wanted to use 062 as a weapon like the others but it had no fighting capabilities, and his methods were so slow, he could only handle a small handful of people at a time and it would take several days of fattening them to be done. He wasn't a very effective weapon.\" Jumba said \"I had created a revision of his program to fix the strange way of making the food and eating people, I was thinking of makink 062 a weapon that would flood the planets market with fattenink foods and making the population to obese to resist an invasion but never managed to test it. After the incident in my lab I was worried installink the new program and reactivatink 062 could cause it to make foods I could not resist. The new program was like the others in makink sure the experiment would not turn on me but as long as 062 was active it would make fattenink foods regardless of the situation since it wasn't forcink them on me. I would naturally get hooked on them again since I would be unable to resist the foods he was to be makink.\" Jumba said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo stood there silent for a few moments thinking. \"but this new program would fix everything except French Fry's need to fatten?\" Lilo said hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes I am supposink\" Jumba said thinking. Jumba turned to his computer and began typing. \"I guess I didn't save it here\" He said before turning around and digging through a drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I see Lilo said disappointed and began to turn to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are going!\" Jumba exclaimed. Lilo turned to see Jumba holding a small blue pill labeled \"062 Version 1.1\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Lilo said starting to feel hopeful again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is the new programink for 062\" Jumba explained \"if 062  took this pill he would be rebootink with the new data\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo reached up and picked up the pill, \"So I could go give him this pill and he would be fixed?\" Lilo said with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was thinkink he was fixed little girl\" Jumba said not sure what she meant \"if you are givink 062 that pill it will revert to trying to fatten people up. The new program would make 062 hate healthy foods and turn him back into his old self but with the revised updates. No longer so easily turned to this good you keep doink to my experiments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh of course!\" Lilo almost squealed unable to contain her excitement \"We wouldn't want that at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course not!\" Jumba said turning back to his work \"Just put that pill back when your done lookink at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"s-sure\" Lilo said opening the drawer and tapping the bottom with the pill to make it sound like it was dropped in. \"well I'll just be going then\" She said Shyly as she crept out still holding the pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh\" Jumba muttered deep in his work again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo rushed down stairs \"Stitch! Stiiiitch!\" She called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your little blue monster isn't here\" Nani called from the kitchen \"He's down on the beach terrorizing Seagulls again I think\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ok I'll go meet him there!\" Lilo called as she rushed out the Door.</span></div></div>",

Lilo was so excited she didn't even realize she was giggling the whole way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile French Fry was in his small shack by the beach serving the last of his Dinner time rush, French Fry handed the customer his big wave fries and super tsunami shake and turned to place the money in the bin. Lilo came running up \"Good no customers, now is the perfect time\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo came around front and climbed up on the counter to remove the piece of wood that held the front window open during business hours and climbed into the shack as it shut. French Fry had taken notice of Lilo's arrival and looked at her puzzled as to what she was doing. Lilo smiled as she tried to think up a way to get him to take the pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey French Fry!\" she said at last \"I got some candy I want you to try!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrench Fry leaned over the edge of the table he was standing on to look at the pill in her hand closer. \"No no no no\" French Fry replied in a french accent waving his hand back and forth and shaking his head \"healthy only\" he summarized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.... uh... oh yeah!\" Lilo recovered \"It's sugar free! and reeeeally tasty, I was thinking you could sell some here. You know keep up the health theme but have some candy for kids?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrench Fry put his finger to his chin and thought about it for a few moments and looked down at her unsure. \"Pweeeeeeeeease\" Lilo said with a puppy dog pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrench Fry finally gave and put his hand out \"Ok, Healthy Candy\" He agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo handed him the pill \"You gotta swallow it all at once.... thats umm... how you taste this healthy candy!\" She smiled trying to pass off her lame excuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrench Fry looked at her puzzled but looking at her only got him another puppy dog pout and with that French Fry gave up the fight and placed the pill his mouth and swallowed. Lilo was practically on the tips of her toes watching and waiting. French Fry smacked his lips a few times waiting for some sort of flavor or sweetness but got none. French Fry turned to Lilo for answerer but she just stood there staring at him eagerly. French Fry went to jump off the table so he could get back to cleaning up from the rush when suddenly his body twitched. French Fry stopped dead in his tracks as he let the feeling pass and tried to understand what it was. He began to look down his body and around for some sort of clue as to what that was but before he could think on it further both his arms spasmed and flopped around a few times. French fry began to get worried and backed up nervously, suddenly his legs wobbled and gave up supporting his weight sending French Fry onto his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnugh uuuugh\" He grunted as he tried to get up but his body was just shutting down on him. Suddenly he skin felt like it was crawling as more twitching and strange movement washed over him. French Fry suddenly felt sick and managed to roll onto his side in time to let a small convulsion in is mid section cause him to spit up some water. And that was it, with the water that activated his pod gone from his body he began to shrivel up and return to pod form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo stood motionless for a few moment wondering if he would pop back out. After 2 minuets of waiting she finally was convinced he was done. Lilo was a little disappointed all this work and anticipation had given her an appetite worthy of girl with such fat dreams. She grabbed french fries pod off the Table and ran to his sink. She climbed up onto a box to turn the handle when a thought struck her, She looked around at the shack, this was no place to start growing. She didn't want to get fat here then have to walk home with all that weight, and what if she got to fat to move? She didn't want to live in a shack she had every intention of growing to big to fit in anyway. What's worse they were in a public place, while she would love to see a beach full of overweight people bursting out of their swimsuits she knew the more people French Fry had to fatten the less food she would get and the slower she'd gain.</span></div></div>",

Lilo couldn't wait anymore, She rushed to the sink and tossed French Fry's pod in and climbed up onto the counter to turn the water on. As the water hit the pod it began to reactivate, French Fry began to return to full size and sat up in the sink. French Fry sat motionless for a few moments as the programming began to boot up and take full effect. Lilo leaned in closer wondering what was going to happen next. Suddenly French Fry's eyes lit up as her came to full awareness and looked around. As he saw Lilo next to him he began to smile a wickedly and stood up. Jumping over to the stove French Fry started cooking up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo wasn't sure what to do, she was overcome with a mix of emotions, most of all she was over joyed it was all working. French Fry began stacking the table with a mountain of food, and looked over at Lilo. Lilo was still in a bit of shock and just stood starting at the feast being built up. French Fry became impatient and came over to bring her to the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon Apatite!\" he said as he sat her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of the meal began to fill her nostrils and Lilo was lost in a world of food...  Hamburgers, Corn Dogs, Fried Chicken, Pies, Hot Dogs, Cookies, Cakes, Tacos, Fudge, Pasta, and of course... Fries. Lilo started grabbing handfuls from each dish and taking samples. Lilo's sense of taste was instantly overloaded by the sensation. The heavenly smells had peaked her appetite but this abundance of flavor was simply too much. Lilo's eyes filled with tears of joy as her lips curled into a broad smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... so..... goooooooood!\" Lilo screamed. Returning to the feast before her Lilo threw moderation to the side as she snapped and gobbled noisily. Lilo was grabbing everything with her hands not willing to waste time with utensils as she got tomato sauce and globs of cheese all over her hands and dress. Chocolate was smeared on her cheeks as they flared out with food, Lilo eating with such force and speed she barely had time to swallow before she shoveled more food in. The meal that loaded the table was taken apart piece by piece and packed tightly into Lilo's gut. Her midsection started to round out the food quickly taking up all available space. It looked as if a basketball was lodged in her belly the floral pattern dress stretched around the mass of food churning inside her. Lilo wasn't getting fatter just yet but she was certainly past the point of being called stuffed. Lilo made a loud obnoxious chewing noise as she ate the last cookie, crumbs spilled out of her open mouth and sprinkled onto her belly. Lilo leaned back from the mess of empty plates and moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh...\" She cried with joy \"I'm too full!\". Lilo rubbed her hands up and down her taunt over stuffed belly. Lilo's belly gurgled and growled loudly as it tried to digest the immense amount of food she had indulged in. \"Oooh... This is much harder when all the food doesn't get turned into fat right away...\" Lilo groaned \"Painful too...\" Lilo continued to massage her swollen mid drift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrench fry watched from the counter rubbing his hands together eagerly. Scanning her body up and down it wasn't herd to determined with her height and weight she was at her limit for now and she needed to rest before serving her anymore. The pale blue experiment somersaulted down to the floor and pattered over to the fridge. French Fry hopped back onto the counter with a half full two and a half gallon bucket of ice cream and jug of milk tucked under his arm. He poured the milk and ice cream into a large  pitcher and added some sugar and cream. French Fry lifted the pitcher above his had and capped the end before shaking it back and forth stiffly. Adding a large squirt of chocolate syrup and some sleep E-Z pills French Fry placed a long straw into the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo had worked herself into a trance as her hands moved up and down the gurgling mass of food in her belly, between the feeling and sound of her own digestion Lilo was lost in her own world till a fuzzy hand grabbed her arm and tugged her off the chair. Lilo cried out in a rush of pain as her packed gut shifted suddenly. Before Lilo could protest French Fry lead her to the couch and hefted her over his head and onto the plush seats. The cold pitched was wedged into her lap. Lilo looked down at the still swirling shake and glanced to French Fry who just smiled at her with fake sincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo put the straw in her mouth and took a sip the sweet taste blasting her taste buds. Lilo's eyes rolled back into her head as her toes curled with delight. Lilo cooed into the straw slurping up the creamy shake with gusto. Lilo began to settle contently into her seat her hands gripping the pitcher as it sank into the softening gut that stuck out so prominently from her petite abdomen. The sweet tasting treat began to fill into the space between food bits that packed her belly and the tightness feeling began to increase against Lilo's stomach. Despite being packed to bursting the tightness made her feel more reluctant to move or act putting her in an even more comfortable sedentary mood. As the sleeping pills began to take effect Lilo drifted off to sleep with a wide smile on her food smeared face, a trickle of milk shake ran down her lip and onto her rounding abdomen. The pitcher was nearly empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrench Fry returned to the kitchen his programing assessed the situation. He had a helpless victim hooked on his food and his priority to is to make her as fat and helpless as possible. However the greater part of his purpose was to turn the population into obese slow moving gluttons. French Fry weighed the current options open to him and decided to move forward with the option most relevant to his placement.</span></div></div>",

We could go to that new restaurant they just opened for tourists. I've heard they've got some great food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo considered her options.

Besides, her main obstacle in the past had been Nani anyway, so with her fattened up she would be able to fatten herself up next. Who knows, she might even gain weight on the way as a side effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo quickly decided to play to Nani's strengths. While she wasn't overly worried about her looks, she also never turned down a compliment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\" Lilo started, \"I think you look good! Even if you gained weight, I think you pull it off, sis!\" she beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pulling out all of her charm for this one, she wanted to Nani to believe her. But that wasn't hard because it was also true. Nani's pudgier form was very intriguing and pleasing for Lilo. She was glad to see Nani's overindulgence visible and on display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNani blushed. \"Really? Maybe I don't have to worry about losing it after all if that's the case!\" she smiled to her little sister. Nani previously felt like she needed to lose a few kilos herself, after all she wanted to set a good example of physical fitness for her little sister. But after hearing Lilo, her thoughts began to change a little. Perhaps a little weight isn't so bad... maybe just be mindful of her eating habits from here on out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo smiled. 'It worked,' she thought 'Now, all I need to do is to get her to really pig out at the restaurant!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving at the new restaurant, it was clear that it was in fact...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lilo and Nani arrived inside the new buffet and saw the typical diner. It was a decent size, not too large, and there were three or four tables scattered around the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo popped her head over to take a look at the buffet and her eyes nearly bulged out of her head. In the center of the diner were two large buffet tables absolutely filled to the brim with food. Lilo couldn't wait to dive in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo and Nani took their seat in a booth not too far away from the buffet. And Lilo became eager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Nani! Let's go! I'm huuungryyy!!\" Lilo whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. Hang on you rascal, let's go.\" Nani said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving at the buffet, Lilo could smell the buffet and it smelt like heaven itself. There were choices upon choices of delicious, fattening food awaiting her eager grasp. She grabbed the biggest plate she could find and started shoveling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloppy Joe's, fried chicken, creamy Mac and cheese, and even some ribeye steak. This buffet had everything you could think of piled in it and even more dessert. Lilo began piling her food on to her plate and eager to eat it all, but just as she got started Nani pulled her away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at Nani who gave her an unapproving look. Her plate seemed empty with only a couple choices on it. \"And what do you think you're doing?\" She asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nani!\" Lilo whined. \"It's all-you-can-eat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that doesn't mean we have to eat it all! Come on, haven't I taught you to be modest?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Lilo started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts Lilo, let's go back and maybe you can get seconds later, but no bigger than what you had for firsts.\" Nani's resolve was strict. Lilo needed to learn these lessons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo begrudgingly went to sit back down with Nani. She began to eat, but she ate slowly because Nani would have yelled at her if she started scarfing down her food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This stinks,' Lilo thought, 'There goes my plan of pigging out. Stupid Nani and her rules...' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSooner or later, both Nani and Lilo had finished their food and sat back. Lilo's stomach soon rumbled and she asked if she could get seconds, which Nani permitted. She's a growing girl after all. However, Nani felt unsatisfied too. She had made a recent habit of overeating and snacking far too much, which led to the unwanted pounds she had currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I really could go for some seconds, and maybe even some apple pie. Mmmmm, apple pie sounds really good right now.' Nani drifted, dreaming about a peice of succulent apple pie. 'No no, no more food for me. Any more and it'll just add to this belly I've going.' she thought and she patted her slightly rounder belly, which wobbled a bit in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lilo was at the buffet. She was struggling to choose what exactly she wanted, since she wasn't allowed too much. The choices were too hard to make. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There's so much good and fattening food here! I have to make a plan so I can eat as much as I can and fatten up, but what can I do?' Lilo thought. She looked over to the dessert section and suddenly it struck her.</span></div></div>",

Time to do some fattening of her own...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNani was still at the table contemplating getting a second plate. She knew in her heart she wanted more but her conscience told her that it was not a good idea. But damn it, those ribs looked so good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNani was soon broken out of her trance when Lilo returned to the table. Her plate was smaller and had two lovely large slices of apple pie on it. Nani started to drool and stare at them, they were calling her name. But she soon snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were hungry, Lilo. What happened to getting seconds?\" She quizzed. This was not like the girl to refuse more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was going to then I thought I wanted dessert so I grabbed some, but...\" Lilo trailed off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\" Nani said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm pretty darn full now that I think about it. I don't think I'm gonna be able to eat another bite! Too bad this great food is going to go to waste!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNani began to sweat, her brows were dripping. Too bad indeed, all that sweet, sweet pie is a real shame to pass up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless...\" Lilo started, trying to play coy, \"you wanted to have them.\" She offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNani was sweating buckets now, her hands were trembling. It took all her effort not to stab her fork into the crust of her pie in an instant. Together, the juicy and soft slices had to be the size of her head and they Rose from the plate several inches. Nani could see the gooey pie filling oozing from beside, and she practically taste the sugary goodness from where she sat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I-I can't, Lilo...\" she shook her head, attempting to stay strong, \"I've been eating a lot as it is, I couldn't possibly...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe that's true, but what's two more slices of pie really gonna do?\" she counter-claimed. Lilo really knew how to drive a hard bargain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNani shook her head. \"It's...I can't...\" She said unconvincingly. \"I have to have the willpower to say no. Always be strong enough to say no when you have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo shrugged, \"Okay, suit yourself big sis. I'll go throw it away then. But just so you know,\" she leaned toward Nani, plate in hand, and whispered in her ear. \"There's also apple fritters over there too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did it, the dam broke and Nani gave in to temptation. \"Give me those damn pies!\" She grabbed them from Lilo and dug into them with gusto, savoring the first few gooey bites with pleasure. She looked over to Lilo, who watched with a big grin on her face. \"And go grab me some apple fritters, too!\" She insisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo ran off to the buffet. The plan worked! Nani's resistance has been broken! Lilo grabbed several plates and filled one of them with several more apple pie slices and tons of apple fritters. She filled the other couple plates with tons of other desserts. Various peices of cake, tons of banana bread lathered in butterscotch pudding, and a bunch of eclairs. She brought it all back to the table. She made several more trips, bringing over more and more food each time. Eventually she ran out of dessert so she started bringing over burgers and hotdogs, and even some creamy thick pasta alfredo. Very quickly the table was full of desserts and dinners and some were even on the adjacent tables since the small booth table only had so much room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNani was too busy gorging herself on apple fritters and apple pie to notice or care. Lilo sat down and began to feast on the food before them. She started with the banana bread, her favorite. Nani soon finished her apple delights, and instead of questioning the appearance of more food, she immediately began to gorge upon the several burgers and hotdogs on the table. Lilo dove into the cakes after finishing the last of the pudding. Faster and faster, the sisters continued to stuff themselves silly, barely aware of their surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bellies were bloated and round, and Nani's outfit did nothing to conceal her potbelly. Several other tables were in awe or disgust at them, but they were too busy to care. They had been feasting for only an hour when they ran out of food. But instead of being done, they both got up and made a beeline for more food. They were both very full, and their bellies made them look several months pregnant at this point, but they were too engrossed in their own gluttony to care. Due to their overstuffed state, getting up was a feat and walking looked a bit more like waddling, but they still made the trek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNani began filling her plates with more and more desserts. Ice cream, blueberry pie, creamy cheesecake. Absolutely anything sweet made its way on to her many plates. Lilo, on the other hand, was attacking the other parts of the buffet. She filled plate after plate with foods like steak, thick lasagna, homemade pizza, and even full sub sandwiches. They hurridedly brought back their food to their tables and began to feast again, hardly questioning why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNani was too far into a hedonistic trance to think about her actions. Her main and only goal was too fill her gob with any and confectionery she could find and want. Nani's gluttony showed no signs of stopping as she tore through her lemon meringue pie like an animal. This was certainly a new experience to her, one that she has yet to think much about. Lilo was in heaven, she didn't think her feast would entail this much food, but as long as it kept coming Lilo was happy to eat. She was long past full to the point it started to hurt, but like a true fattening girl she still ate through the pain with gusto, happy to have such great tasting food. With every bite, Lilo reveled in how much she and Nani would gain from this session alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, both girls had finished eating. Lilo's stomach looked enormous, round and bulging, she looked like she was one month overdue. She sat back and patted her belly in satisfaction, wincing a little due to its sensitivity. Her eyes were beginning to glaze over but she shot awake as Nani let loose a giant belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Nani said weakly. Lilo swore her hair blew back. She looked over at her sister, and it became clear that Nani was the one who ate the most. She was leaning back and even then her belly was still pushing into the table in front of her. It was so round and full of creamy brown flesh. If Lilo looked overdue, Nani looked like she was about to burst with quads in a matter of seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" Nani stuttered, \"What even happened?\" She asked, recovering from her stupor. The last few hours seemed like a haze. She looked in front of her and saw the piles and piles of empty plates that were stacked up in front of her and Lilo. She saw the little girl was sporting a huge stuffed round belly under her floral skirt, and then she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes bulged out of her head, \"Holy moly...\" was all she could get out. She began rubbing her massive stomach. She was beginning to peice together what had happened, and she soon remembered her last three hours of heavy feasting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was *urp*, so good sis! Wasn't it?\" Lilo said while rubbing her overstuffed gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly was, little sis...\" Nani couldn't disagree. The food was heavenly, that she could not deny. While she did feel guilty for making a pig of herself and eating way more in one sitting than she had in her entire life. She couldn't help but feel a certain pride in her, too. She enjoyed the feeling of letting loose for awhile, and this feeling of overstuffed bliss was rather relaxing...for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nani, we have to come back next weekend. Please?\" Lilo begged, jostling her stomach a little too much and wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNani rubbed her belly with one hand and picked up a flyer hiding underneath the dishes in another. It was a flyer for half-off the buffet on the weekends only. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With food like this and deals like that.\" She said. \"We'd be crazy not to come back every weekend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Lilo! Breakfast time!\" Nani called. Lilo stirred awake, groggy and confused. It was a bright morning and the sunlight trickled through her skylight and danced in the air. Lilo stretched and yawned, trying to wake herself up. Lilo's stomach rumbled and she put her hand on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Lilo! It's getting cold!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo shot out of bed. She quickly began to  dress herself The effects of the last few days had had an impact on her body. Ever since that great binge, Nani had been making heartier and unhealthy breakfasts, and dinners were always either take out, or pizza delivery. It almost took her by surprise, she didn't expect Nani to change her diet so soon but they have both been eating almost non-stop since that day at the buffet. Most everyday, she would sit by the couch and snack away all day on various foods she would find in the kitchen. Nani had been working a slow week, she managed to keep a desk job as secretary at the company she worked for quite a while now, but the job was very boring and Nani often passed the time by eating whatever she could find or bring with her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo stripped off her clothes and looked at the mirror. She hadn't changed much, but she has definitely gained at least a couple pounds in the last few days. Her belly had a new curve to it, and it seemed to be fuller and heavier than before, if not slightly so. Her thighs had accumulated some fat, and her arms were definitely getting flabbier. She turned around and saw that some fat even went to her hips and butt too, and she was beginning to get a bit of a bubble butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, 'Its only been a few days and I'm already getting fatter, I can't wait to see where I'll be in a month or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo went downstairs and to the kitchen table. She walked in to see Nani at the sink, fixing a large plate of bacon. She set it on the table and looked at Lilo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning sleepyhead!\" She said. Lilo looked at Nani's body and saw she had definitely gained in the five days too. Nani's arms had previously had tone and some muscle, but that was all gone and beginning to be replaced with flab. Her legs look thick too and some fat had barely begun to gather under her chin. Her breasts had accumulated some growth but not by  any mentionable means yet. Her shorts looked very tight and her hips were flaring out from them, she had noticeable love handles that were sticking from her torso, looking plumper and softer. Her ass had gotten a bit fatter too, and had the slightest wobble to it when she walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNani's biggest feature by far was her belly though. Once having solid abs, her flat trim stomach had been replaced by a small potbelly. It stuck out in front an inch or two, and her usually revealing and short shirt was tight around her torso and her belly peeking out with more flesh than usual. Nani didn't really pay mind to it, but her belly was undeniably chubbier and rounder than it had ever been before. Overall, Nani seemed to have gained at little under ten pounds in the last month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo snapped back into reality and looked at the table. Her jaw gaped wide open. Upon it was the biggest breakfast that she had ever seen Nani cook. There were several plates of bacon, several stacks of pancakes and waffles, tons of hash browns. There were lots of cinnabuns, eclairs, and even strudel, plus many many more fattening breakfast foods layered the table. The breakfasts Nani made recently didn't even amount to this much food; just a lot of pancakes slathered in syrup or enough peices of bacon to make a full pig out of. Nothing with as many choices as this or on the scale of this feast before Lilo; this was definitely Nani's most ambitious meal yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Lilo said, \"Look at all that food! Why did you make so much?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know what I wanted and I was really hungry so I started cooking and baking and ended up making a huge breakfast for us! Looks good, doesn't it?\" Nani grinned. \"Be ready to eat your fill. I won't be able to finish it all myself, and you need some good nutrition in order to grow strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo side-eyed her sister on that one. Good nutrition? There was about as much healthy nutrition on that table as there are in an entire candy store downtown. Lilo enjoyed the change of pace these last few days and the dietary choices Nani supplied, but it was starting to become too much too fast. It was a tad unnerving, even for Lilo, and decided to ask what was up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nutrition? Nani, why have we been eating so much lately. Not that I'm complaining or anything, but ever since the buffet we've been doing a lot of this overeating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNani smiled, \"Well, work has been pretty slow but also pretty stressful, and I don't know, I just thought that I would let us indulge for a little while.\" She shrugged, \"You enjoy it, I enjoy it. Who really cares? It's not hurting anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo grinned, \"But what about eating healthy? You always used to tell me about it...\" She walked over and poked her sister in her round belly. \"Won't we just gain more weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who ever said gaining a couple pounds was so bad? I'm sure we'll be okay. let's just enjoy ourselves, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo was grinning huge by now, \"If you say so...\" </span></div></div>",

With her prize money, she managed to buy her family a brand new house and all the clothes and lip gloss she could buy, and it barely made a dent in her wealth. She would spend her days inviting some friednsfrom school and someof the contestants from TDI like Beth or Leshawna, though she would always get their names wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the middle of the summer when Lindsay was planning her sweet 17. Even though she already had a sweet 16, she thought she deserved another one. She planned on inviting everyone she knew and planned on having the biggest party of the year. She invited Leshawna, Owen, and Geoff over to help plan the party. Of all the people she knew, they were the most fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was lunch time when Owen started to get hungry. His stomach growled so loud it could be heard from two blocks. \"Uh Lindsay, you don't mind if I order some food, do you?\" Owen asked. Lindsay shrugged and said \"Go ahead.\" Owen smiled and dialed faster than anyone has ever dialed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter planning the guest list, Lindsay decided to check on everyone. Her jaw hit the floor when she saw all the food Owen ordered. Their were 26 pizzas, 8 seperate 2 gallons of soda, chinese take out, and 3 bags of Quessidia Chime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OWEN!\" Lindsay yelled. \"I thought you were going to order a little stuff. Not a buffet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I thought it didn't matter.\" Owen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he overdid it, big whoop. You're rich!\" said Geoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on. We got Grape-tastic Pop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay couldn't resist Grape-Tastic Pop. It was her favorite soda. She was reluctant, but she thought that maybe it wouldn't hurt to pig out a little. The only reason she didn't do it before was because she wanted to save money for clothes, so she only ate small meals. Which also gave her a smoking bod. But now that she was rich, she could buy all the clothes she needs and splurge. Besides, she could always use lipo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright. Hand me a slice.\" Owen tossed her a slice of peporoni. She gagged when she touched it. Since she became rich, shre tried to avoid fatyy food and only ate fancy, gorss, healthy meals. She hadn't had pizza since the start of the last season. She took a bite and said.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Raven closed the cover of a red leather bound tome with wispy looking runes scrawled around it like chains. She thumped her fingers across it several times deep in thought. \"Talarok\" That's what he said his name was, Talarok and nothing more. It was a lie to be sure. A demon does not give out it's name for free, knowing a demons name is the first step in binding that demon to your control. What's more, demon names are always much longer, their egos always leading them to include titles like \"The Black Decay\" and \"Ruler Of Death\". But even when they give you a fake name it's a clue to their true identity, eager to brag about their power hubris tends to lead demons into giving away who they are once you start to deal with them enough. But Raven had been talking to Talarok for two weeks now through her relay stone and still he was keeping all his cards face down. Suddenly a knock came from the door breaking her concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey we're here\" Came a monotone sigh of a voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come in\" Raven called out with the same enthusiasm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors spread open to reveal Jinx with Starfire hovering happily behind her. The young walking misfortune and cheerful alien girl entered Raven's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Raven I am so glad we are throwing a sleepover, it will be most fun!\" Starfire beamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Star...\" Raven winced at her friend's misunderstanding \"This isn't a sleep over , I need you two for a minor ritual I need to perform\" Raven explained as she set about laying down pillows for them to sit on around a circle, a small oval shaped stone with a hole in it sat on a pedestal at the center of the circle. Raven handed them both a cup of tea to relax them before they began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you call for me exactly?\" Jinx looked at Raven funny as she was handed her tea \"Just because I'm not with the hive anymore doesn't make us girlfriends you know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven frowned and looked at Jinx skeptically \"I know you're not our ally but I need help and you were one of the few people I felt I could trust that could help me with this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh joyous!\" Starfire broke in \"This sounds like it will be one of those sleep over party games!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jinx choked slightly on her tea \"You'd trust me more than that bossy leader of yours or the green twerp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in a million years\" Raven hissed with a stern glare \"But they didn't fit the requirements of this ritual...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that would be?\" Jinx narrowed her eyes and cocked her head to one side with a hand on her hip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was instructed...\" Raven rolled her eyes and looked away from the two girls \"That to perform the ritual we'd need 3 virgin girls\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo-shhhfff I, bu... WHAT?!?\" Jinx blurted out dumb struck. Starfire just turned beet red and tried to pretend she was too busy drinking her tea to comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...near the apex of their maturity into adulthood to join their hands and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait just a second sister!\" Jinx stopped her \"What makes you think I'm a virgin!?\" Jinx tried to shove her finger in Raven's face and hold the tea with the same hand without blocking her glare at the blue haired sorceress. \"Just because you can't get any doesn't mean I'm in the same boat! Unlike you I actually have a man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please\" Raven grumbled \"an ice queen like you?\" Raven pushed a stunned Jinx's hand aside \"You'll probably keep teasing flash for a year before you actually get serious about letting him go past second base\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh like you know me so well?!\" Jinx boiled \"I'll have you know I've had his hands all over m-\" Jinx began to grow louder and louder until Starfire cut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends Friends! Please let us not bicker about our... purity\" Starfire pleaded \"Can we not bury the tree felling instrument and form new bonds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven and Jinx exchanged heated glances before groaning \"Fine!\" Jinx spat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway...\" Raven sighed and looked at Jinx \"I would have called Bumbblebee or Argent but with the confidence and sass Bumbblebee has... or the way Argent dresses... I was worried they've...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been all the way?\" Jinx huffed \"I still call BS on your assumption that I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but you're still here aren't you?\" Raven replied flatly \"I already told you this calls for young pretty virgins and you're still here so I can only assume...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Fine!\" Jinx growled in frustration \"I'm a virgin ok?!\" Jinx stared at Raven daring her to show even the slightest sign of victory but Raven just held her poker face. \"tck... I'll help with your dumb pow-wow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yay!\" Starfire cheered and hugged a surprised Jinx<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good then next we'll need to apply these markings to your hands and chest, Starfire please take off your gloves and unlatch your collar\" Raven held up a jar of sickly green liquid and used it to paint symbols on each girls palm and back of the hand as well as a symbol over their hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So just what is this ritual about anyway?\" Jinx asked as she adjusted her shirt back up to cover her chest once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm contacting a demon\" Raven said stoically looking away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Raven no!\" Starfire gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx smirked \"Little miss goody two shoes is dabbling in some hardcore evil here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Raven growled at them making Jinx frown again and cross her arms, Starfire's face twisted and turned to a hurt rejected pout as she cringed at her friend's outburst. \"Sorry, I don't mean to sound angry, but I'm being careful ok? I haven't told them anything about myself, they don't know who I am or where I am. But... I have to do this, I need to find out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find out what?\" Starfire asked standing up again and moving close to her friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If my dad is still alive...\" Raven said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still alive?\" Starfire asked in a hushed voice \"I do not understand, did we not soundly defeat him already? Do we still have reason to fear a return?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe maybe not\" Raven sighed \"Demon's don't die, their spirits tend to remain no matter what you do, the only way to be rid of a demon is to bind their souls in some form of prison and hope they never escape for all eternity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... where is your dad then?\" Jinx asked as she moved to sit on one of the pillows</span></div></div>",

I want to know if he is banished or actively seeking power again. If he may be assembling a force in the demon realm to invade our dimension again, if he has a way to return or... if he will find a way to use me again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire sat silently on her pillow staring at Raven unsure how to comfort her friend. Jinx just looked down at what little tea was left in her cup reminded of her own dark past and life of wrong doing. Little was said between the girls for a while as dark pasts and evil intentions weighed on their minds. At last of all people Jinx spoke up in comfort of Raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we'll help you handle this\" Jinx tried to reassure her doing her best to look at Raven with compassion. Starfire smiled brightly in support and nodded at Raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you both\" Raven allowed herself to smile \"Now lets all join hands, I'll chant the contact spell, you both just need to clear your minds and keep focus on the relay stone on that pedestal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three heroine sat around the circle with linked hands as Raven chanted. Slowly a pale light grew inside the hole in the stone larger and larger till it made contact with the sides. As the light reached the sides of the stone it shifted to a dark purple and the stone stood up swiftly balancing on one side. Raven's eyes began to glow too shifting to a lighter shade of purple and the light in the stone shifted to match. As Raven chanted she kept concentrating on the spiritual signature of her contact and leading the stone along with her tuning it to her intended target like a dial on a radio. The Symbols on their hands started to glow as well, the light from each symbol making contact between hands then wrapping around their arms like vines towards the symbols on the chests. The growing lines of light encircled the symbols on the chest without touching them and continued on after making a full loop around the chest runes and on towards the other set of linked hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Stone in the center began to float slightly turning in sync with the speed of the glowing lines wrapping around the three girls. Starfire and Jinx were a little unnerved by the lines progressing across them but held their focus as Raven had instructed. The light in the stone was now a dull pink and a light haze of the same color was emanating from it. Small pink sparkles and a light vapor seemed to obscure the stone slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost made contact\" Raven paused her chanting to inform the girls \"When it connects don't be so alarmed you lose your focus or we'll have to start over\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach girl nodded silently as Raven took up her chant again. The color of the stone and the effects around it shifted to a brighter pink but with a more flesh colored hue filtered in. The vapor around the stone seemed to thicken and grew heavy as the haze seemed to flow out of the stone and down the edges of the pedestal with weight. Starfire and Jinx could start to smell the vapor as it grew thicker in the air. It was a dank pungent smell with an underlying trace of brimstone. Starfire and Jinx were thankful the smell seemed to stay low in the air without clouding it too much as it was difficult to think straight as the light traces of the musky yet heady smell were already making their heads spin slightly. Suddenly a voice broke the deadpan chanting of Raven and make Starfire jump slightly almost losing her focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who dares interrupt the slumber of Talarok the master of satia- eh?\" The voice trailed off \"Little mortal? Is that you I sense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is me\" Raven replied ending her chant \"Pandora\" Raven looked at Jinx and Starfire briefly to remind them to avoid using real names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, Pandora, it is you\" The deep voice mused \"I almost didn't recognize you, there is some interference with your spiritual presence... or is it possibly, you've invited guests...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed\" Raven spoke clearly and flatly trying to show no expression in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have!\" The demonic voice celebrated \"I take it then you have decided to accept my offer to show you more about this demon you are seeking. Then you are also going to tell me why a mortal so young and innocent is so invested in Trigon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not\" Raven's voice grew slightly unable to refute the question entirely monotone \"As I have explained before that information is not being offered at this time\" Jinx and Starfire continued to look at the stone with all the focus they could spare are they kept stealing glances of Raven's stolic flat emotionless face as she communed with the disembodied voice emanating from the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice chuckled slightly \"Little mortal I do not wish to indulge these cat and mouse games forever\" The was a slight pause as the voice continued with a thoughtful hum \"You know if you are going to access the information I have you must start making greater concessions than just the name of who you seek or agreeing to let me share your eyes on these meetings, very pretty friends you have brought by the way\" The voice added with another chuckle. Starfire and Jinx almost looked at Raven in shock as the connection wavered slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax now young mortals\" The voice cautioned them \"I can see this link is tenuous with such easily distracted participants Pandora. I think we can find a new arrangement for greater information however. But first allow me to provide a bit of assistance...\" The voice trailed off and there was some silence for a time. Jinx and Starfire both took the brief pause to each shoot Raven harsh and inquisitive looks respectively for the revelation the demon could see them. Raven didn't respond trying to keep her eyes trained on the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, red\" The voice returned \"you with the green eyes, mind grabbing that mirror on the table beside you?\" Raven's expression grew concerned, she hadn't looked at the table, how could he see the mirror on it. Starfire looked up at Raven questioning if she should. \"It's alright you can break your focus now, I took care of it\" the voice softly encourage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven's expression turned to shock. \"Don't pick it up!\" Raven called out to Starfire who was still wondering if she should do as the voice was demanding. Quickly Raven closed her eyes and turned groping for her bed yanking the cover off it once she found it. Raven turned back and opened her eyes to throw the cover over the stone. \"He established a link on his side so we don't need to focus to keep the link open but that means he can remotely view anything in sight of the stone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"do ho ho ho\" The voice let out a boisterous laugh \"very clever of you my little sorceress\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend Ra---er Pandora?\" Starfire tentatively asked still trying to look at the lump in the covers unsure if she still needed to focus \"What is happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stop focusing, the link is solid now, as I said\" Raven's attempt to remain monotone was faltering as she was flustered by this development \"With the stone active like this he could have viewed my room and looked for clues as to who I am... I should have been more careful and done this somewhere like the basement\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see so you need to be careful not to give him any hints, even outside there may be something he could use as a mirror in view of your eyes to see you\" Jinx put together<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed!\" The voice chuckled on \"Up till now this resourceful little vixen has been very careful to hide anything useful to me even when I tried to fool her by barraging for use of her eyes she was careful not to have anything in her field of vision that gave away who she is or that maybe reflective. Unfortunately the stone only replicates the area surrounding it not spirits within it, and you were quick enough to cover it before I spied any clues... I was too cocky and gave away I had a link...\" the voice snickered harder on that last comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were hoping I'd call one of them by name or have an emotional outburst strong enough for you to overwhelm me\" Raven flatly stated again regaining her composure<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He he... guilty\" The voice replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we be worried here?\" Jinx relaxed no longer needing to maintain the focus \"Seems like you're not as 'in control' as you led us to believe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine\" Raven quickly countered. \"There will be no more surprises\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm not so sure about that...\" the voice returned with enthusiasm. \"I think it's time we get down to business, and since you have put your foot down on my payment of information we need a new bargain if you want to continue from where we left off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it you want?\" Raven kept her clam and stated the question as evenly as she could still anticipating the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you've proven a fun challenge so far, keeping your cards close to your chest, out smarting some of my better gambits, you even fulfilled my request to perform the relay with two guests and still thwarted me using it to spy your identity. And since you are well aware of my intentions and still invited two friends but didn't bother to obscure their faces I can only assume they don't have any magical essence to corrupt or twist so you must not be living with other magic users as I assumed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get to the point Talarok\" Raven demanded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...Ok have it your way\" The voice shrugged \"If you want to continue this deal...</span></div></div>",

Slightly startled by this rather unexpected request. \"Why? You can communicate with us just fine through the ritual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well...\" Talarok mused out loud. \"Maintaining the ritual from my end requires a considerable effort and a great deal of concentration, were I to be able to both view and speak through a more physical channel in the mortal realm, the burden would be lessened. Your pink-haired friend looks suitable-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! N.O. I am not getting posessed by a demon!\" Jinx yelled at the relay stone as Raven shot her a cold look to remind her that getting agitated will only make matters worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear girl!\" The demon said with a laugh and a voice as soothing as a creature of ultimate evil could convey. \"The process could hardly be considered outright posession! It's more like.. becoming a miniature focal point for my esscence. Just enough for me to convey my message verbally-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said no, Talarock.\" Raven said, trying her best to suppress the notion that she was defending her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh seemed to eminate from the stone, temporarily raising the temperature in the room about five degrees<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Pandora. You are the first person from the mortal realm to contact me in millenia; and while I do thank you for the opportunity to conduct buisness once again, you are far to unwilling to pay the price for the information you seek- or any price, for that matter. If you continue to refuse to offer up anything from your side of the table, I'm afraid that your going to have to take your buisness elsewhere. And I assure you, no one in the lower circles is as patient as I am when it comes to these sort of deals-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall serve as the dark one's voice!\" Starfire suddenly spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Raven said, no longer able to fully hide her concern for her companions. \"You don't have to do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Ra- Pandora, Trigon is a terrible foe who destroyed our world once before. If he is able or will be able return, then we might not be able to undo the damage he will surely cause.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red's right, Pandora.\" Talarok added, trying his best not to sound to excited at the surprise presence of a volunteer and finally understanding why exactly Pandora was so interested in learning about Trigon. \"If you know anything about him, which you have proved to me you do, then you must know that he can easily turn the mortal realm to ash and eradicate all life on Earth should he ever return to his full power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven closed her eyes. Shutting herself off from the world while her inner selves rigorously debated the pros and cons about the situation at hand. She had sworn to herself before first making contact that she would not under any circumstances sacrifice anyone to get the information she needed; but Starfire was offering to take on a risk all on her own. She was also no feeble minded fool who would submit as soon as a demon tried to apply any pressure; but at the same time, Starfire was emotional and far too trusting to be dealing with these... creatures. After two intermissions and the Personification of Anger getting thrown out of the meeting for violent misconduct, the Inner Ravens agreed, at a vote of 8 to 7, that the current risk brought on by the situation at hand was outweighed by the need to know if Trigon was making another attempt at invading earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Raven finally said as her eyes pried open. \" 'Red' will surve as your conduit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, friend Pandora,\" Starfire said with a nod. \"I shall not fail you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" Talarok's sudden good mood was causing the mist invading Raven's room to rise slightly, causing Jinx to cough. \"Approach the relay stone, girl. Look deep into the crevices, and clear your mind of all unneeded thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire nodded and began making her way to the stone. As she approached, a litany of unclean words spilled into the room, causing the mist in the room to darken and thicken further. Raven was tempted to destroy the stone here and now before things got out of hand, but she had to know if Trigon was still out there, waiting for the time to be right. The very thought of her father still weilding some level of power forced her to stay her hand, and watch as the seen infront of her played out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, the stream of demonic profanity ceased it's flow, and Starfire turned around to face the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-hem.\" Starfire cleared her throat and hummed a few bars, as if testing the ranges of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose this will do,\" Talarok said, evidentially deciding to stick with the most monotone voice Starfire was capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, you got what you wanted Talarok, now answer my question: is Trigon still powerfull? Where is he? And is he recovering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Pandora, you have earned the right to some answers. First, Trigon is indeed still a force to be reckoned with in the lower circles; though he isn't the policy jaugernnaut that he used to be. Second, I don't know where he is, he's only been acting through proxies. Third, I would deffinately say that he's slowly getting back to the status that he once held-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Raven listened to these revalations in dumbstruck horror, Jinx noticed that Starfire's voice was slowly getting deeper with each word that was said. Not wanting to stay behind long enough for a possessed alien to tear her to shreds, the pink-haired hexer made a move for the door, only to find that the mist had condensed so much as to prevent her from pushing past it to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And fourth! My dear Pandora, you might have the opportunity to meet him very soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azeroth, Metrion-\" Raven attempted to form a shield around herself, but it was already too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarbles!\" Starfire yelled out, summoning an enormous vortex into the room that began pulling Jinx and Raven into the swirling black and red beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your fault!\" Was the last thing that Raven heard before the vile energy overwhelmed her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Dark mist welled up whipping around as the center of the room depressed and slowly split open to reveal a red glowing portal. The Mist shifted and swelled like a tiny sea in Raven's room swallowing Raven and washing her into the vortex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azerath Met-Guff\" Raven tried to cast a spell but the mist surged over her with a mind of it's own determined to keep her from fighting back. A black whip like force pushed back the mist as Raven cracked her magic attack at the dark mass trying to buy herself time \"Shu'kuru H'jara Tu--- Bah!\" Raven began casting once more but the mist returned in greater force swallowing her and tossing her about violently to keep her disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your fault!\" Raven heard before the sea of mist pulled her head under. Talarok turned to the outburst in surprise to see Jinx still unaffected. At her feet the pink energy of her power swirled and lapped at her feet combating the mist from pulling her into the flow as well. Long tendrils of pink and thick patches of mist struck at each other like cobras all around Jinx. Starfire's face now growing dark and sinister smiled and let out a blusterous laugh her voice now exactly like the demon had sounded before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An etheral child! So many surprises you've got up your sleeve Pandora!\" Starfire grinned wickedly at Jinx as her eyes clouded with dark swirls and her pupils began glowing red. \"You're not a witch or even a true magic caster but your power is pure energy tied to your very being that you can manipulate with thought! You'll make a fine servant.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire lifted a hand to cast a spell at Jinx as red glowing runes spread down her arms across her skin to her hands. Jinx was by no means defenseless however and threw up her own attack as a pink blade broke loose from her protective paling and cut through the mist at Starfire. The demon switched it's stance and knocked the attack away with Starfire's bare hand, the stray pink energy cutting into Raven's bed making it crack and fall to pieces with a gash cut into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible!\" Talarok laughed with unrestrained enthusiasm \"You manipulated the object's composition at a level beyond mortal understanding and altered it's fate to one of destruction!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they don't call me Jinx for nothing!\" Jinx quipped and brought her hands together into a clap aimed over the possessed alien girl's head making a pulse of pink energy that flew through the air into the ceiling over Starfire. \"Because whatever can go wrong...\" Jinx smiled. The structure above her cracked and splintered into pieces that began coming apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...will\" Jinx smirked as the room's integrity failed and started to collapse over the demon. However as chunks of steel and concrete began falling onto Starfire the demon simply swung her arms apart knocking debris away and repelling the rest in a wave of force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This girl's power is impressive too, so much strength for such slender arms...\" Talarok marveled for a moment before looking back at Jinx \"So, you say your name is Jinx then...?\" Talarok's voice grew cold and wicked. \"Once I've corrupted you girls with demonic energy you will all make very powerful weapons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx began to sweat, she couldn't attack the demon directly and Starfire's body was too resilient to damage with anything she could throw at her. Jinx's eyes darted around the room for anything she could use against this thing. As Jinx looked the demon began to whisper something too low to make out. However Jinx realized while she couldn't hear the words she was still able to understand the strange babbling as it seemed to be forced into the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx's head felt heavy as the demon started casting some sort of binding on her. Now that Talarok knew her name he was able to invade her mind and started disarming her by arresting her thoughts. All Jinx could hear now was a hushed voice softly begging her \"Jinx, relax, just calm yourself Jinx. Won't you lay down your head and rest now Jinx. You can drop your arms to your sides and stop fighting. That's a good girl Jinx, it's time to rest\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx felt herself growing sleepy, she tried to keep her balance but her knees grew weak. At her feet the pink energy flickered and ebbed away as Jinx's focus waned. Jinx knew her mind was slowly falling to Talarok's influence and even though she wanted to fight it the gentle nature of this voice she heard in her head was so irresistible she couldn't say no. Unable to fight it Jinx took one last shot in desperation at the only weakness she could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx's foot momentarily stamped on the floor and she regained her balance just long enough to take aim and throw up one more bolt of energy. Talarok saw the pink mass race under the mist and swung down prepared to block it. But the pink glow below the mist zipped past her and instead came up like a spike right into the relay stone still laying on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little whore!\" Talarok yelled in anger as the stone shattered and a pulse of energy washed over the room. Starfire stumbled backward clutching her head. \"No no no I almost have control! Just a few more moments! I can keep control over this vessel just a few more mome- AAAAGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire was kicked like a mule by a pink blast and landed hard on the floor. Jinx was breathing hard trying to regain her strength but still standing. The mist began to disperse into the corners of the room. The middle of the room the carpet began to return to normal the portal vanishing and revealing Raven as if she was spit out by the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit Raven do you see what messing with demons gets you?!\" Jinx exploded when she saw Raven's body reappear. Raven weakly propped herself up with her arm and tried to find her emotional center still visablely rattled by her close call with the portal to the demon realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is starfire alright?\" Raven managed to meekly ask once her jitters has subsided enough. Raven's apprehension all but melted away when she heard Starfire's real voice once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Starfire is alright\" Starfire said before her voice dropped low again \"....Raven\" Talarok's voice once more reemerged from her lips. Raven's body felt numb as she heard Talarok say her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my.... Raven, why I do believe that was the name Trigon had for his imppish little spawn... the one that managed to over power him\" Talarok laughed as Starfire's body sat up from the floor \"A child with the power to alter the fate of the world around her with her power, Another with the strength of a hundred mortals at only 16 and both of them brought to me by you Pandora, or should I say Raven, the daughter of Trigon who's raw untamed power rivals his own...\" Talarok roared with laughter now \"It's almost too good to believe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" Jinx screamed and flung another bolt of pink energy right at Starfire's head. Raven screamed in protest but the blast hit Starfire and caused her body to flip over once more as Talarok yelled in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalarok began cursing in a demonic tongue growing angry and fierce. The sound of the unearthly obscenities was so foul Jinx and Raven had to cover their ears in pain and the paint on the walls began to peel. But slowly the voice faded away until it was Starfire's own voice again struggling to form the complex syllables of the demonic speech. Starfire grunted as she tried to surpress Talarok's control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven looked up once she realized the painful utterances had ceased and saw Starfire no longer being manipulated. Quickly Raven rushed over to Starfire and put her hand on Starfire's forehead. \"Al'sha-cor ze'ta!\" Raven gasped in a rush and a golden light seemed to envelop Starfire's head. As the light subsided Starfire's bright green eyes blinked in surprise. A tense few minutes passed as none of the girls uttered a word but only looked on in suspense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is gone friends\" Starfire finally spoke when she was sure she felt no lingering control.</span></div></div>",

Behind her Jinx leaned against the wall still scowling at Raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven sighed heavily again and looked up at her friend eyes full of regret \"Starfire.... really I never meant for any of this.., I-I'm so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Sorry sorry sorry\" Jinx mocked \" You're just <i>so</i> sorry!\" Jinx thrust herself away from the wall with her shoulder and marched over to Raven to look her in the eyes \"But you've said it to Starfire about a hundred times and not once to me!\" Jinx pushed in closer to Raven so she couldn't look away \"I know Starfire is shaken up but I got dragged into this too you know and almost kidnapped by a demon that <b>you</b> summoned!\" Jinx growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven's expression shifted from remorse to pain as she and Jinx locked eyes. Raven tried not to let herself get too emotional but despite her normally impressive composure she couldn't fight back tears beginning to well up. Jinx turned disgusted as Raven tried not to let out a sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god here comes the waterworks!\" Jinx threw up her hands \"You can cry but you still can't say a damn thing about what a major fuck up that was up there, nothing but sorry sorry sorry to Starfire\" Starfire who normally would have come to Raven's defense was still trembling too much to say a word. \"Well if that's all you can do I'm leaving!\" Jinx sneered and spun around towards the door \"Later <i>Pan-dor-ah!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Raven managed to call out wiping away the tears \"You can't leave\" She followed through as her voice cracked and broke still emotional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why not?!\" Jinx got indigent looking back to Raven angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he knows our names now\" Raven's gaze returned to her cup of untouched tea. Raven's voice went lower and she sighed \"I need to be sure he can't make contact with us again and use our names to manipulate us.... so please, stay for a few days while I sort this out and repair what's been-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Jinx hissed and pointed a finger accusing at Raven \"You've done enough already!\" Jinx stomped heavily back towards the blue haired girl \"If that demon tries anything I'll take him on myself! I don't need any more help from you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I...\" Raven tried to explain <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Jinx scolded \"I've had it with you and your damn emo bullshit! I'm gone!\" She stamped a foot once more and started to leave again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please\" Starfire suddenly spoke up causing Raven and Jinx to look at her in surprise \"Please just stay...\" Starfire continued her voice was soft not able to speak without a uneasy tone about it \"Let Raven take care of the demon's threat that looms over our heads\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starfire...\" Raven looked to her friend with a redeemed enthusiasm \"Thank you\" Raven smiled knowing Starfire still trusted her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk.... fine\" Jinx spat \"But only because you're asking me to!\" Jinx reluctantly agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven thought for a while longer in silence before speaking to her firends again \"If you two would like....\"</span></div></div>",

How does pizza sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds absolutely glorious, friend Raven!\" Starfire immediately broke the last lingering vibes from her posession at the mention of the Titans' dietary staple, floating over to Raven and giving her a rib-crushingly strong hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... actually isn't a bad idea,\" Jinx sort of half-mumbled after giving it some thought. \"Cleaning up that mess you made really took a lot out of me, I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it is decided!\" Starfire cheered as her grip on Raven loosened enough for the hooded spellcaster to slide down onto the ground. \"We three shall depart immediately to consume the pizza and drink the sweet carbonated beverages!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the decision now unanimous, Starfire made a bee-line for the nearest window and proceeded to divebomb towards sealevel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" Jinx yelled out after the alien girl as Raven finally managed to pick herself up off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight pause, then Starfire's head reappeared just beyond the windowsill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, friend Jinx?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't fly.\" the pink-haired hexxer admitted, unable to hide the hint jelousy in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry! For I shall help you to fly!\" The alien girl said with a reassuring smile as she reentered the meeting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starfire,\" Raven said as she cracked her spine back into place. \" I don't think that's what she-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaahhhhh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven watched as Starfire grabbed Jinx by the hand and yanked her back out the window with her. An anime style sweatdrop appeared on the back of her hood as she quickly uttered the incantation she used to levitate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just when we had gotten her to stick around...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx wringed her hair out for the umpteenth time as a waitress came by to take everyone's orders; dislodging a crab and a snail or two in the proccess. About halfway between the tower and the Jump City coastline, the hexxer's repeated pleas of \"letmegoletmegoletmego!\" had managed to overcome the sound of the tunnel of air Starfire made whenever she flew at her full speed. Starfire, of course, responeded to her friend's request immediately- by dropping her in the middle of the pacific ocean. Only  thanks to Raven's timely arrival and quick explination was the orange-skinned girl able to see the error of her actions and prevent Jinx from comically getting eaten by a giant squid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would once again like to appologize, friend Jinx. If you had told me that you wished to be returned to dry land, I would have done so imme-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up,\" Jinx snarled across the round table to where Raven and Starfire were sitting, before noticing and quickly punt-kicking the crab that had gotten tangled in her hair off the resturaunt's balcony sitting area. \"If it weren't for the fact that my head might start making 360 degree turns any minute now, I would be out doing something more productive than hanging out with you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for what it's worth, thanks for sticking around long enough for me to insure that nothing else will happen.\" Raven added in, allowing a feeling of sincerity to be conveyed in her voice to make it clear to Jinx that she really appreciated this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx responded with a snort and an indignant raising of her head. After another quick patdown of her hair to insure that all marine wildlife had been removed, the waitress returned with the trio's order: a medium sized pizza that was one-third mushroom and olive, one third pepperoni, and one third chocolate and marshmellow by the request of Starfire. After the drinks had been placed and Raven slipped the waitress a twenty dollar bill to pay for everything, the three each broke off a slice of pizza from their perferred third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed by quickly, almost in a blur as Starfire, Raven, and eventually Jinx after she had cooled off some, began to discuss everything from what movies were coming out this month to the recent rumors that some of the members of the Brotherhood of Evil had escaped from the crippling defeat the Titans had handed them a few months ago and were once again at large around the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Raven,\" Starfire managed to say with perfect clarity through bites of chocolate, cheese, and pizza sauce; a talent she had come to master whilst staying here on Earth. \"Did we not soundly vanquish the forces of evil during our last encounter and imprison them in the solid water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did,\" the blue-haired spellcaster replied. \"But when has that ever stopped anyone? The bad guys always find a way to escape and continue doing what they always do, and they won't stop unless we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill them?\" Jinx added in with a smug grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to say that.\" Raven's face darkend as she took another sip from her soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, sure. First you start summoning demons, and now your thinking about flat out dropping your enemies dead. You didn't switch sides behind our backs did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a fair bit of concentration on Raven's part to resist Jinx's baiting. It would only make the situation worse if she got angry and told her off. If she reacted and drove the pink-haired hexxer away, then there would be no way to insure that she wouldn't get posessed. No, she needed her here for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not answering is the same as admitting!\" Jinx said in an almost singsong tone as she reached into the pizza box for another slice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this thing really empty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing those words, Starfire reached out and inspected the box herself, flipped the box over, and proceeded to eat it, before coming to the same conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend Jinx is right! the pizza has been devoured, and yet I still feel the rumbles within my stomach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd...\" Raven said as she realized that she also felt like she could use another slice or two. \"Normally we don't even get through one of these unless Cyborg or Beast Boy are here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't look at me!\" Jinx said as she slurped the last bit of her cola. \"Maybe the owners made the pizza smaller since the place is losing money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it is decided! I shall order us a second pizza and another round of fizzy drinks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starfire, we haven't agreed on-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of Raven's words were drowned out by the sound of Starfire taking off and flying back towards the counter where orders are placed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, a second round is fine with me. Whatever we don't eat we can just take back to your place for dinner.\" Jinx said as she flicked a snail that had been crawling up her leg off and onto the pavement below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh...\" Starfire sighed contently as she leaned back in her chair and gently patted her slightly distended belly. \"At long last the rumblings have subsided!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally...\" Jinx jeered as she emptied her second glass of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, now that everyone's done, let's head back to the tower. Starfire, can you carry the rest of the pizza back with you?\" Raven said as she dusted crumbs off her robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood!\" Starfire enthusiastically answered before returning her atention to the box- which she proceeded to look inside of, flip upside down, and subsequently eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was gone...\" Starfire said through bites of greasy cardboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys ate two whole pizzas?\" Jinx sighed. Not even the goons she used to hang out with back in the H.I.V.E FIVE ate that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the fact that Jinx forgot to mention that she must have eaten as much as everyone else, Raven merely got up from her seat and turned to face everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter, let's just head back.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took a little coordination to work out the flying arrangements for Jinx before they left. The first few attempts gave both girls tummy aches as they didn't enjoy being held or carried in a way that put pressure on their now stuffed stomachs. The first way they tried to fly had Jinx with her arms wrapped around Starfire's exposed midsection so tight she squeezed out a burp. Now as they glided back to the tower Jinx was riding on Starfire like a horse with her hands gripping her shoulders to balance herself and her rear seated at about the bottom of Starfire's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire had promised to take it easy not flying too fast or erratic but after a few minutes just as the tower was coming into view Starfire began swooping left and right scanning the city around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For crying out loud Starfire!\" Jinx gasped as she clung to the alien girl for dear life when her flying humanoid steed took a sharp curve as she banked left down the main drag of the coastline. \"if you keep this up I'm either going to fall off or hurl!\" Jinx threatened, Starfire didn't respond much aside from a  muffled apology and kept darting this way and that looking at the shops. \"What are you trying to find exactly? <i>-urp-</i>\" Jinx demanded as a small burp of air was released from her shaken up gut packed with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I observed it here once before...\" Starfire pondered and slowed down much to Jinx's relief \"Ah-ha!\" Starfire exclaimed and suddenly dive bombed to the ground with Jinx screaming in terror latched to her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground Raven caught up to them to find Jinx sitting on the ground panting while Starfire admired the selection of an ice cream stand on the boardwalk. \"You nut job what were you <i>-hic-</i> thinking?!\" Jinx spat \"Oh great <i>-hic-</i> now I have the hiccups <i>-hic-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire broke away from her hungry stare of frozen sweets to look back to Jinx \"I am sorry Jinx, I was most preoccupied with trying to remember where I had seen this shop before\" Starfire pouted \"I will treat you to anything you like however, the ice cream shall be above me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, <i>on</i> you Starfire\" Raven sighed \"And how can you want ice cream? We just had two thirds of a pizza each\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I do have nine stomachs\" said Starfire still looking over the ice cream case \"Perhaps I am exceptionally voracious today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven put a hand to her head, Starfire may have nine stomachs but she still had the same abdominal space as the rest of them. \"Well if it's <i>-hic-</i> on you then I'm getting something to fix these Hic<i>-hic-</i>cups\" Jinx decided and marched to the counter to buy a soda. While jinx tried to guzzle as much of the soda as she could in one swig Starfire began requesting flavor samples of each of the 68 varieties available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>-hic-</i> Darn it!\" Jinx grumbled as another hiccup popped out when she expected a burp. She began to pour more soda down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expect this behavior from Starfire but I'm surprised you still have room for that carbonated gas too\" Raven raised an eyebrow at Jinx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me, I was stuffed a minute ago but I still have room for this\" Jinx said between gulps. She began bouncing up and down on her feet while trying to suck down the last of her soda to produce a burp strong enough to beat her hiccups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>-Braaaaaaaaaaaap-</i>\" A loud and uncouth burp suddenly erupted from Raven instead of Jinx. Both girls exchanged surprised glances while Starfire kept requesting samples without noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx began to giggle at Raven who turned red and covered her mouth. \"Hey now that was supposed to be my... <i>-Uuuuuuuuuuuuap-</i>\" Jinx suddenly let loose her own belch. Raven's complexion returned to it's normal grey and she snickered at Jinx who was somewhat stunned by the outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I'm not the only one with no manners\" Raven grinned and started walking over to the counter with Starfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what you want\" Jinx proudly smiled in triumph \"At least my hiccups are gone\" She joined Raven by the counter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it's weird but I could really go for some ice cream now too...\" Raven licked her lips and looked over the flavors in the chilled glass before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Jinx mused walking along the case \"I was just going to get the soda but now I could go for a treat myself\" She said absent mindlessly rubbing her now no longer stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go right ahead friends!\" Starfire smiled as she stuck a small wooden dipper in her mouth to taste another flavor \"As I stated before the bill will be mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven and Jinx suddenly found themselves needing no further motivation. While neither girl often went for the richer flavors Raven was finding the peanut butter and chocolate chip ice cream tantalizing enough to order a large bowl full sprinkled with cookie and cake crumbs. Meanwhile Jinx had her gaze glued to the tub of fudge and cookie dough which she had piled into a bowl of her own with chocolate syrup poured onto it. While they both found new interest in heavier sweets Starfire had finally made up her mind. After a bit of insistence on her part she convinced a few of the clerks behind the counter to assemble a cone consisting of a scoop of each flavor like a rainbow colored tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking along the beach in the night back towards the closest point the coat line made to their tower the girls said little to one another until their ice cream was all gone. They had remained mostly quiet aside from the sound of slurping or satisfied yums occasionally escaping their lips. They were just so infatuated with their new treats they had barely focused on much else. And even as they neared the end of their indulgences their idle chit chat somehow diverted away from just how much they had consumed that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the end of the pier that faced their tower the girls tossed their wrappers and plastic utensils into the nearest trash can and prepared to fly with Starfire leaning down on all fours so Jinx could saddle up. Though they were stuffed and their bellies now poked out visibly fuller than what they were typically, the girls kept laughing and chatting bissfully unaware of just how much they had binged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the tower there was some disagreement that broke the friendly air of conversation they had enjoyed on the beach. Raven wanted to sequester herself to her room and focus on her books in solitude until she found something of interest on this demon they could use. Jinx refused to let Raven keep them cooped up in the tower unless she was allowed to see what Raven was studying and even do some digging herself. Then Starfire's interjection that if a threat was presented to all of them then they must remain together at all times sealed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven moved a large collection of her books into the main commons of the Tower and made a nice fort out of them by the table, she could study in and be surrounded by her texts. Jinx padded around the books for a while sizing them up like she could intimidate them into revealing the answers until an annoyed stare from Raven forced her to simply pick a book to look in and joined Starfire on the couch. Starfire tried to remain upbeat for her friends sake but quickly grew bored just watching them read and turned to the TV to watch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long however until their dinner caught up to them. Starfire and Jinx grew tired, bellies full of pizza and ice cream, nodded off leaned against each other's shoulder. Raven surrounded by her books also found the words beginning to blur as her eyes kept relaxing and going crossways trying to fight off the drowsy feeling creeping over her. Soon Raven was laying on a book like a pillow with a small trickle of drool soaking into the pages.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A burst of excited laughter ecoed around black pillars and gold-encrusted hallways. A figure cloaked in an all-concealing red robe gazed into a black orb from behind a black and gold mask, laughing with immesurable glee at the scene projected before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahaha! Oh this is priceless!\" The demon announced as he looked upon the lulled and content faces of his soon-to-be champions. \"They're so worried about being corrupted, but have no idea that the proccess has already begun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter continued to spread throughout Talarok's lair as he began thinking about his immensely good fortune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to think that I almost spent the entire day sleeping! I was worried I blew my chance at winning those girls to my side when the possession had failed, but this has worked out much better than I thought it would! A slow, gradual corruption is a solid corruption!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temperature in the room continued to increase with the demon's improving mood, to the point that candles flaoting around the room were redued to pools in moments and steam seemed to rise up from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalarok's laughter suddenly stopped dead as a thought crossed his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm, but prehaps this pace is a bit <i>too</i> gradual,\" he mused to himself. \"The old fools that dominate our little parlor games aren't going to just sit around and wait for me to groom three new champions with immesurable potential, I'm going to need my seasonal draft pick sooner rather than later if I'm going to take them by surprise and expand my influence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalarok placed his scrying crystal into a nearby stand and snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Succulance,\" The demon called out in a rather smooth voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, a pool of what appeared to be cake frosting had formed on the ground; and out of it stepped a plump, pale-skinned woman with blond hair and red eyes who was dressed in an extremely tight-fitting white chefs outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Master! It has been so long since you've personally summoned me to your quarters. Shall I prepare for you an irresistable treat? Or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's strained outfit seemed to melt off her like icecream, revealing a transparent nightgown that showed off her generous muffintop and lovehandles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-were you hoping for something more <i>personal</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath his gilded mask, a wide smile spread across the demon's face. \"hmm, prehaps later. Now Succulance, in the past few weeks, I've been in contact with an exceptionally powerful mortal by the name of Raven. It took some going back and forth but a few hours ago I managed to posess one of her friends - I lost that posession, but I managed to plant the tinniest seed of corruption into their minds before I was sent back. Those seeds have taken root now, but I'll need you to travel to the mortal relm and speed things up a little. Have I made myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" The minion cheered as her clothes began to reform around her chubby body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Talarok waved his left hand in the air, and three pieces of paper suddenly appeared in the middle of his palm. \"Here are some pictures of what Raven and her friends look like, along with some personal information I found while digging around in their heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon handed off the papers to his subordinate, before pausing in thought for a moment \"You know what? I'm going to give you some help on this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalarok reached into his robe and pulled out a stringed collection of bits and pieces and selected a black cross. He viewed the object with a vague sense of disgust for a moment, before casually tossing it to the ground a few feet awat from him. As the holy symbol struck the ground, a ghostly image of a medieval templar suddenly took form in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My liege,\" The figure said as it took a knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Zelik, you are to accompany this fair lady here and protect her. Under no circumstances is she to be harmed, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your will be done,\" The armored spirit nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" The demon said with glee as he began twirling his hands and muttering dark incantations. \"Now, both of you hold still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the Titans' common room was suddenly thrown open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, so that's where you guys are. I've been looking everywhere for you!\" Beast Boy said inbetween gasps of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden noise managed to stir the three heroines from their deep slumber. Slowly, Raven groggily lifted her head off her makeshift pillow and turned to face the green shapeshifter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Beast Boy. What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad stuff, what else! Come on, we've got to head downto-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy lost his train of thought as he noticed an extra person in the group of two he had been sent to go track down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hey, why is Jinx here?\" The shapeshifter inquired as a black question mark hung above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story, just know that I'm coming with for whatever's going on right now,\" The pink-haired hexxer mumbled as she removed herself from Starfire's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... okay sure. Glad to have you with us,\" Beast Boy rubbed the back of his head nervously. \"Now come on guys, Robin is waiting for us outside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, reports are coming in about a disturbance on Cafe Street,\" Robin announced to the team as the Titans made their way through groups of panicked civillians who were all fleeing away from the very same situation that they were rushing head first into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea who the trouble maker is?\" Cyborg aked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dudes, my bet's on Control Freak. He used to crash the movie rental place on Cafe Street all the time.\" Beast Boy shot a few glances around at the others. \"Anyone else for betting on who the villian is this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a response, he got a few glares from Raven and Jinx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever this villian is, he or she will soon taste defeat!\" Starfire said with conviction as the sun above her was suddenly blocked by something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a flurry of black arrows descended from the sky. Raven quickly threw up a shield to cover them, while nearby cars, trashcans, and atm machines were pierced by the incoming rounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven lowered the shield once she was sure that the rain of arrows had stopped. \"I believe we we must be getting close now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire floated over to a nearby arrow. She pulled it out of the ground and sniffed it, before biting it in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is the dark chocolate!\" Starfire stated triumphantly as she proceeded to eat the rest of the arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you have got to be kidding me, that's just dumb\" Jinx smacked her face with her palm. \"What kind of lame villian uses dark chocolate as a wea-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother black arrow passed right next to her ear, causing the hexxer to lock up for a moment; before turning to see the dozen or so figures clad in medieval armor that seemed to be made of the same material as the arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Titans, go!\" Robin yelled as he and the rest of the heroes made a charge towards the line of black-colored suits of armor. </span></div></div>",

Azomoth. Deros. Ti'kal. Minoth. Go'el. Azomoth. Tikal. Minoth. Sarbles!\"</i> a voice far to low for the sleeping girls to understand flowed out of the stick as a puff of smoke, which slowly began to whisp its way towards Raven, Starfire, and Jinx, and proceeded to allow itself to be inhaled by each of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend Raven, Where exactly are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... not quite sure, Starfire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wherever we are, this place has some style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio stood on a paved path leading up to an enormous palace made entirely of marble embroidered with gold that stood several stories tall, which sat on top of a hill and was guarded by an endless patrol of classical age Grecco-Roman statues that were lined up along each side of the road. Surrounding the statues and the road was an endless field of pristine grass that achived a shape and color one could only expect in a work of fiction. Above it all hung a perfectly clear blue sky and a sun positoned so nicely as to warm everything comfortably without blinding anyone looking in any particular direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's impressive, to say the least.\" Raven nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Raven? Is this the heaven that the old man in the infomercials described? Have we been vanquished by our foes whilst we slept and transported to your afterlife?\" Starfire said nervously whispered to Raven as she looked at each of the surrounding statues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't jump to any conclusions just yet,\" The blue-haired spellcaster said as she moved forward to examine the closest statue further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this isn't heaven, it aught to be! Just feel this grass! It's so soft and smooth. Makes me want to take a nap on it!\" Jinx said as she took a seat on a nearby patch of green and proceeded to recline on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Raven suddenly blurted out as she rushed forward and yanked Jinx back onto the pavement by her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! The hell was that for, Raven?\" The pink-haired hexxer growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know anything about this place. For all we know, this could be one of Talarok's tricks. Don't. Touch. Anything.\" Raven retorted with the most serious look she felt safe enough to convey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... yeah, your right. We should be careful.\" Jinx nodded in agreement as Raven helped her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this world is a creation of our foe, then how would we go about returning home?\" Starfire asked as she huddled in close to Raven and completely violated the spellcaster's need for personal space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Well, it looks like there's only one way to go, so let's start by heading to the top of that hill,\" Raven answered as she lead the way towards the majestic citadel waiting for them a few hundred feet away. As they approached, the trio saw that there was no formal doorway, only two lines of columns that supported that section of the roof in which a passerby could enter through any gap between the intricately carved pillars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish I lived here...\" Jinx commented as she beheld the arcitectural marvel up close, though a quick glare from Raven was enough to remind her of the potential severity of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other obvious entry point, the three heroines stepped passed the towering white stones and entered a sort of foyer that served as the hub for several branching off hallways and staircases. Other than that, there didn't seem to be anything of interest in their current location other than a sitting area in the center of the room that had two gold embroidered red sofas poistioned around a table that had three trays of tea and cookies resting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have those been there?\" Jinx pointed to the snack platters. \"I can see steam rising from that tea kettle in the middle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps the owner of this very large and intricately decorated home is expecting guests?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, us. There's three platters, so whoever set this up expected us to stop by here. Just leave them there and help me figure out the quickest way to this place's back door.\" Raven said as she moved in closer to inspect the nearest staircase for any obvious traps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on. Who booby traps tea and cookies? I'm starving over here! Feels like I haven't eatten anything in a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I too am feeling a strong case of the rumbles within my stomach. Perhaps if we took a short break and took advantage of our host's hospitality, we would be in a better position to discover a way back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven suddenly felt of jolt of pain in her midsection. Suddenly, she too felt like she hadn't had anything to eat in awhile. She had been meaning to make some tea when they returned to the tower from dinner, and those cookies did look rather good right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the smell finally hit her. It was her favorite brand of jasmine tea. Somehow, whoever set this up had known what her favorite drink was. Which could only mean-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAGH!\" Raven momentarily lost her cool and blasted an enormous shockwave towards the offending snack trays, sending the tea, cookies, table, and sofas flying outside of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend Raven, what is the matter? Why have you attacked the furniture?\" Starfire turned to face the exasperated Raven with a concerned look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm sorry.It's just... the smell reminded me of my favorite brand of tea... the only way anyone could have known what my favorite drink smelled like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was if he had gotten inside your head,\" Jinx finished Raven's sentence, though this time it wasn't as an insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly...\" Raven said as she let out a deep breath and tried to regain control of her emotions, before deciding to take a seat on the stone floor below and enter her mediation pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, look. I'm going to need a minute to regain my focus. Can I trust you two to do a little scouting up ahead? I don't think we should stay here for longer than is neccessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Raven! I shall go on ahead and insure that there are no more troublesome tea sets that might prove be offensive to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Star said. We can handle it,\" Jinx added in as the two headed off towards different pathways that branched off from the entrence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you guys see anything important looking, come back here immediately and let me know.\" Raven called out as she saw the other two disappear down their respective cooridoors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven let out another deep breath and began uttering a litnay of concentration or two as she began diffusing her stress level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't touch anything guys...\" Raven whispered to herself. \"... and please comeback safe.\"</span></div></div>",

There are even reports of pocket dimensions that are in reality traps made by demons to torture and punish innocent users.\" Raven read aloud as she thought about how it was similar to her mind: she created it to her own liking and it had a purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Entering a pre-exisitng dimension is simple so long as you are able to use the password to get in. Some passwords are specific while others are generic phrases. However, the one word to override the password and enter any dimension freely is...\" A series of thuds on the steel door at the end of her room broke her concentration as she placed the book upside down on her bed. Raven walked to her door as Cyborg looked down at his pale friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to bother you Rae, but I need your help calibrating some of the medical computers.\" Raven sighed as she used her powers to grab her cloak as she followed Cyborg out and down the hallway of the Tower. What Raven failed to notice was that she had left her door wide open for anyone to go in and out as they pleased. On this day, there would be no exiting as someone approached the door, their shadow making an entrance before they did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person was...</span></div></div>",

Beast Boy saw this as a prime opportunity to prank Raven like she had never been pranked before. Besides, how often did he get to go into Raven's room? Okay...there was that time when he traveled into her mind and such, but that's aside from the point today. Tiptoeing quietly to the open door like a cartoon villain, a voice from behind caused him to shriek like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beast Boy, what are you doing?\" He turned around as quickly as his petite frame could and saw Starfire with her hands clasped together as she looked curiously at the green mischeif maker and the open door. \"You weren't thinking of going into Raven's room were you? You know she does not like for us to go in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Star, no need to be such a stiff. I just want to see what kind of books she has.\" He grinned with his sharp teeth as if he was the cat that swallowed the cnaray. Starfire was not buying this act as he sighed deeply. \"Look, haven't you ever wondered what sort of crazy magical things Raven has in her room? I do and I want to see them up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....\" Starfire trailed off as she looked at the ground, not wanting to admit he was right. She didn't have time to finish her sentence as she felt Beast Boy grab her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop being such a stiff and come on.\" With an 'eep' Starfire was flung into Raven's room as the two were cautiously looking at various things on her shelves and desks as they did not want to touch anything. Something did catch Starfire's eye though as she picked up a small orange book from the corner of Raven's bookcase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Recipes and Meals for the Refined: 1,000 Steps to Become a Gourmet.\" She did enjoy cooking and flip through the book's extensive library as Beast Boy grabbed the book on pocket dimensions off of Raven's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pocket dimensions. This sounds cool. I wonder what sort of dimensions lie on the other side of things.\" He said as he read the page on passwords and how to create the dimensions. Unbeknown to the two of them, there was someone watching with glaring eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do the two of you think you are doing?!\" Raven yelled that made the two cower in fear on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The door was wide open and we came in and Beast Boy said it was okay and...\" Starfire continued to ramble on like a small child as Beast Boy saw the magic phrase in the book to enter pocket dimensions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beast Boy! Don't you even think of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeg befaler den skjulte doren for a apne!\" In a bright flash of light, the three friends found themselves being sucked into the pocket dimension that existed in...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The light filled the room from the book as Raven cursed Beast Boy as loud as she could as things began to settle down in the room. Beast Boy couldn't really react since it felt that he was frozen in place. By the time he was able to move again, both Raven and Starfire had disappeared from the room. He frantically began to search the room, even under the bed, as he looked at the cookbook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, Raven is going to kill me for this.\" He complained as he knew that he needed to get someone to figure out what he just said as he ran out Raven's room in a frenzy to find a mage who could put together what just happened. As all this occurred, Raven was waking up on a floor that wasn't her own. It wasn't her carpet but something hard and cold. Her eyes opened slowly as if she was waking up from a long nap. Stretching out, she got to her knees to look around where exactly she was. She knew she wasn't in her room thanks to Beast Boy but the only problem was where this place was specifically. Hearing a groan from behind her, she whipped around to see Starfire rubbing her head as she also was getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel so well...\"Starfire complained as she slowly recuperated. A quick look around told her the same thing that Raven concluded in that they were not in her room. Which lead to the secondary conclusion that they were not in the Titans Tower nor in Jump City. Starfire got to her feet, wobbling around a bit as Raven lent her a hand getting steady. \"Raven. Where exactly are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we are in a dimension that was locked inside that cookbook.\" Raven was annoyed beyond all reason at what Beast Boy did. However, this was not the time to get mad at Beast Boy since it was more important to figure out the where, how, and why they were there and the biggest question: how to get back to Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started to look around and noticed a smell. Not a putrid smell or anything nasty. It was an aroma that no one could describe. The lingering scents were a mixture of foods the two girls knew. Chicken, beef, pork, fish, and the smells of vegetables frying on a hot skillet. Not everything was easily identified since there were some odors that were completely alien to the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing they saw was where they were. It wasn\u2019t much but it looked like something akin to a dinning hall that Vikings would have thrown together. Nestled before them in the ground was a long wooden table capable of holding at least fifty times its own weight with seats pushed in all around. Some were elegant chairs with vinyl and silk while others were simple stools. Raven looked confused as a wave of delight washed over Starfire\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis looks just like the set up for ones Glorbnarg. Oh, mine was such a joyous occasion.\u201d She droned on about her bizarre holiday as something rattled in the other room that caught their attention quickly as a figure emerged from the dark doorway. The figure turned out to be a woman that was older than the two teens. Her hair was a dark orange as her palish skin shone in the dim lighting of the banquet hall. The only thing she appeared to be wearing was an apron of sorts as a look of utter delight came across her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness. Visitors. And so young. How did you get here?\u201d The woman demanded. <br>\r\n\u201cWell, one thing led to another, our friend chanted something and we wound up here.\u201d Raven explained as best she could as she looked at the bizarre woman. \u201cYour hair is orange.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour skin is gray.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTouche.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, this is a dimension that was created eons ago. I\u2019ll go into details later but first, you two look absolutely starving. I bet you haven\u2019t eaten today. Come, have a seat. I make the most delicious haggis this side of the spiritual world!\u201d The woman seemed sincere enough as Starfire took a seat, happily awaiting whatever delicious aroma was coming out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven though decided\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They looked around and saw nothing but the crater that they all stood on and the odd orange clouds surrounding them. The crater it self was unnaturally flat and smooth and a couple miles long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEAST BOY!!!\" shout Raven at the top of her lung. \"What were you thinking? Didn't you learn from last time you entered my room not to touch my things. Now we're stuck in this dimension that we don't now anything about.\" said Raven heading towards Beast Boy with rage in her eyes. \"Sorry Raven, I just thought you might have something cool. We probably might not be stuck here if you hadn't freaked me out while I was reading that book.\" said Beast Boy trying to back away slowly from Raven as she stepped closer to him. \"Friends! We should not fight, we must figure out where we are.\" Said Starfire as she stepped between Beast Boy and Raven to prevent her from harming him. \"Raven do you know anything about this bizarre place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven calmed down and began to evaluate this situation. \"Ok, when Beast Boy read from my book, he must have read a spell to create a dimension. Beast Boy when you read the spell, did you see a description of what kind of dimension it was?\" Beast Boy began to sweat and panic before saying \"Ummm...<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">no</font>\" It only took a second for Raven's anger to return. \"<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>What!</b></font> You read a dangerous spell without even reading what it was!\" With Raven's rage increasing a small black lightning bolt created from her powers and rage and almost hit Beast Boy. Beast Boy dodged it but made a small squeal as he dodged the bolt. \"I said I was Sorry! I freaked out when you entered the room and I just read a spell in bold faced letters.\" Soon Beast Boy backed away still expecting Raven to be angry. However Raven realized that Beast Boy couldn't help it and that being angry at him would accomplish nothing. \"Look! I don't know what kind of dimension we're in, but we will soon. Since Beast Boy just created this dimension, it's not complete yet. That's why there\u2019s not much in this dimension. According to my book there are different types of dimensions serve different purposes. I just don't know what type of dimension this is. I haven't read much on what type of dimensions there are yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Raven know was that this was a type of dimension created a long time ago by an evil sorceress from medieval times. This sorceress was rather envious of anyone who was considered more beautiful then her, so she developed her own dimension to get rid of anyone she was jealous of. When ever she sent someone to this dimension, they would come out as obese, smelly, and disgusting slobs that no longer cared about being healthy or their appearance. Eventually people did manage to discover how to recreate this dimension, but soon became over used. Since many people had become slobs, they ignored their health and their immune systems became weak, making them vulnerable to the black plague. Eventually all the sorcerers agreed to ban this spell, all except one who was the sorcerer that wrote the book about creating dimensions that Raven managed to get.          <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Raven how will we get out of this strange dimension.\" asked Starfire with much concern in her voice. \"Relax Starfire, like I said before the dimension\u2019s not complete yet. That means as this place develops, a portal back to my room will appear sooner or later. We just have to wait.\" said Raven with a sigh. \"For how long?\" asked Beast Boy who was also panicking a little. \"Well, I think I read somewhere in my book that dimensions have time space continuums that are slower than the dimension they were created in.\u201d Starfire understood what she meant but Beast Boy stood there perplexed until he said \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d luckily Starfire quickly explained to what Raven meant. \u201cRaven says that this place has a different time zone. One minute in our world could be a day in here or longer.\u201d Beast Boy understood now, but he still wasn\u2019t pleased with this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a bright orb of energy appeared in the middle of the crater. \u201cRaven, what is that?\u201d asked Starfire as she covered her eyes from the bright light coming from the floating sphere. \u201cThe dimension\u2019s starting to develop! It\u2019s creating some thing for us but I don\u2019t know what.\u201d said Raven as she covered her eyes like Starfire. Soon the orb began to morph into an object designed to make the trio into lazy, smelly, gluttons. When the orb finished it\u2019s metamorphosis it was now a\u2026       <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The others were still asleep except for Robin who was outside training. Starfire saw Robin outside and couldn\u2019t help but admire him as he practiced his battle moves. However his training was interrupt as a strange device appeared behind Robin as he was training. It was small and shaped similar to the traditional UFO with bright glowing buttons, but had a small screen near the top. Starfire recognized the contraption and hurried to the front door. It didn\u2019t take long for Robin to notice this strange device and as it got closer he began to pull out his trademark explosive discs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could throw his weapons at the machine Starfire flew in front of him and said \u201cWait Robin! This is not an enemy or a weapon.\u201d Robin put his discs away and asked \u201cOkay\u2026 if it\u2019s not a weapon, then what is it?\u201d Starfire stepped towards the machine and said \u201cThis is a Zorbnoll, a device we Tamaraneans use to communicate long distances between planets. Someone from my home must want to communicate with me.\u201d Then Starfire pushed a button underneath the Zorbnoll and the screen near the top activated. The Screen displayed the face of Starfire\u2019s k'norfka, Galfore (he was Starfire\u2019s guardian, but is now ruler of Tamaran). The recorded message of Galfore began to speak. \u201cYoung Starfire, it is time for the Feast of Famora. The Famora trees are finally in bloom and have the legendary Famora fruit. I knew you would not want to miss such an event. I would like to honor you at the feast for defeating Blackfire and crowning me grand ruler. I hope to you will join us!\u201d soon the screen turned off. Then the Zorbnoll began to hover and flew even higher and eventually blasted off towards Tamaran.<br>\r\n\u201cStarfire, what\u2019s this big feast he\u2019s talking about, and what do those trees he mentioned have to do with it?\u201d asked Robin who never really understands the customs Starfire\u2019s planet. \u201cIt is a glorious celebration on Tamaran and a rare celebration at that. Tamaran is home to the Famora trees. They are gigantic trees that can grow to be as tall as our tower. The Famora trees are well known for there size, but they are more known for their delicious fruit. According to the legends each of the fruits has a succulent taste that can\u2019t be described. Unfortunately, the trees only bloom once a millennium so the fruit is extremely rare. When the trees do bloom, the fruit falls from the trees like rain and then we all have a fantastic feast to enjoy this fruit. Please Robin, may I go and celebrate with my fellow Tamaraneans?\u201d Robin quickly answered and said \u201cSure Star, but try to hurry back.\u201d Starfire was so excited to be able to go back to her home planter and try the legendary fruit for the first time and only time in her life, she let out a scream that the whole city could hear! \u201cThank you Robin, Thank you! Would you and the other like to join me at the feast?\u201d<br>\r\nRobin quickly thought about it and said\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Blff.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe festivities celebrating the end of hostilities had been amazing, and had gone on for nearly two weeks -- two weeks of eating, and dancing, and eating, and fireworks, and eating, and eating, and speeches, and eating, until the little acrobat was sure she would burst from either excitement or dumplings.    Well, she hadn't burst.  But she'd ended up with a little memento of the time all the same.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee had developed a pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was <i>cute</i>, everyone had told her.  You can hardly tell it's there, and anyway, it's a <i>party</i>, Ty Lee, have another bowl of something fattening.   Easy for them to say -- she was the one who was going to be back performing in from of the crowds in less than a week!   Which is why she was up at the crack of dawn, doing a ten mile run on an empty stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nearly missed a post.  Ugh, she was out of condition, too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came to the end of the row of posts.  Hmm... she could hang a right and head towards the palace to visit with Mai, see how life as the Fire Lady was treating her... and maybe have herself a very small breakfast?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee glanced left, towards the Garden, which is what they euphemistically called the facility where poor Azula was shut up.

First Ty Lee had to wait while several of the higher-ups were called to confirm her identity, then she was ushered into a small, secure room to wait some more while the former princess was brought out under guard.  When Ty Lee finally saw her old friend, she wanted to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wretched, half-starved thing in front of her couldn't be the right person.  Surely, even in chains, she would hold herself with the same dignity, the same bold, larger-than-life, egotistical majesty that Azula had always had.   This girl was just ... empty.   Defeated.  Pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she raised her head, and Ty Lee recognized the rage and white-hot anger in her eyes.   \"You!\" she snarled, straining at her restraints.   \"<i>Filthy traitorous slattern! </i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azula, I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula seemed to calm down.  Her wild eyes faded, taking on a duller cast, and she laughed, two short, sharp barks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my, Ty Lee.  Treachery agrees with you, it seems.  You've gotten fat.   Been gorging yourself at the royal trough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReflexively, Ty Lee sucked in her belly, and Azula sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no use, you know, visiting me here.  Lie all you want; I know who's the rightful Firelord and who's a sniveling usurper.\"  She smiled.  \"Enjoy being Zuzu's lapdog while you can.   I know about the resistance.  I know my loyal subjects are even now fighting for the honor of the Fire Nation and their rightful ruler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, Azula</i>, Ty Lee thought sadly.    There was no resistance worth talking about.   Most of her people already referred to her openly as 'Azula the Mad', or with other, cruder epithets.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azula,\" she said again, \"please.  We were friends once.   I hope we can be friends again, some day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unchain my hands, you slimy, ungrateful sow, and I'll show you just how friendly I feel towards you right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that, Azula -- you're -- you're not well, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lies,\" Azula moaned, \"lies, lies, lies, lies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--and please, please, Azula, won't you eat something?  They said you haven't eaten since you arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swore I would not eat until my rightful position was restored.   I have faith in my people.  It will not be long.  Besides, the swill they serve is this rathole isn't fit for a pig.\"  Azula smirked.  \"Perhaps they'll let you guzzle down a bucket or two on your way out, my dear little porker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee sniffed.  \"Maybe ... maybe you're right.   But it might be longer than you think, if you'd only eat a little--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Never!'</i> Azula spat.  \"I would rather starve and <i>die</i> as Firelord than live on Zuzu's scraps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee straightened her back.   \"Azula, if you'll only eat, then while I'm here, you can be my Firelord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you real food.  From the palace.  Food be-befitting your station.  And I will do anything for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" Azula asked.  \"Perhaps we could work something out, if you'll agree to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It simply would not do for the rightful Firelord to be heard brapping out gas like some common peasant or barnyard animal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee had been so deliciously <i>servile</i> all day, kowtowing to her, meeting her every need, and -- more glorious of all -- <i>feeding</i> her.   Azula hadn't wanted to admit just how hungry she had been.  When that first plate of glorious sticky steamed buns was set before her,  it had taken all her willpower not to start stuffing them in her mouth like a ravenous platypus bear.   But she had refrained -- she had!  She had eaten them daintily.  Carefully.  With the delicacy befitting her station.  And then, she had kept eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little acrobat had set dish after dish in front of her, scarcely saying anything except \"yes, Firelord\" or \"no, Firelord\" or showering her with extravagant compliments.  Finally!  Someone in this stinking hole was treating her the way she deserved.    She never, ever wanted this glorious pampering to end.   Unfortunately, her stomach had other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula belched again into the back of her hand.  Burff.   She was absolutely <i>gorged</i>.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did so well today, Firelord!\" Ty Lee chirped, snuggling up against Azula and lightly brushing the girl's distended stomach with a chilled bunch of grapes.  Azula felt the cold, moist fruit against her taut skin and shivered.  \"You'll be your old self again in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already feeling like... better...\" Azula said sleepily.  \"You have served me well.  Very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Firelord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can eat no more.  You may finish the rest of this yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee grinned.  \"Thank you, Firelord, but I'm on a diet, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Firelord's leftovers are a great reward.  You mean to tell me that you refuse this honor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe acrobat's smile grew uncertain.  \"Azula, I -- I mean, I can't, you know?   I'm happy to do this for you, but don't ask me to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would refuse an <i>order?</i>\"  Azula's eyes flashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But -- you can't actually order me to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am your Firelord!\"</i>  Azula snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee sat up ramrod straight.  \"Yes, Firelord!  I'm sorry!\"  She picked up a half-finished bowl of rice and began scooping it out with her hands and stuffing it in her mouth.   Azula smiled.  Now<i> this</i> was how she was supposed to be treated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee groaned as she walked slowly away from the Garden, holding a hand to her aching side.  Why, oh why had Azula insisted on her finishing every last scrap of those leftovers?   She was supposed to be <i>losing</i> weight, and instead she'd been forced to stuff herself to the point of nausea.   All her hard work and exercise had been erased, just like that, buried under and avalanche of calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks burned.  She'd never get in shape now.  She was going to have to go out, in front of some huge crowd, looking like... like... <i>this!</i>  Like a flabby, out-of-shape ball of butter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... but Azula had eaten so well.  And if this was the cost of keeping that poor girl from starving herself, well, she would just have to bear it.</span></div></div>",

Just like at the Boiling Rock.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats not it all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats all it can be!\" Screamed Azula as she flew into a rage. \"You're not here to help me! You just want to mock me with false promises, only to take them away! Well, it won't work! So go back to your \"friends\" and tell them that the monster saw through their little game and that they are fools to think that they could fool me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to humiliate Mai because of my loyalty to you. I won't play into your delusions of entitlement and injustice. You need to stop thinking that you deserve everything you wanted! Thats not how the world works and only be accepting this are you going to get better!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerrrraaa!\" Yelled Azula as she tried to launch herself at Ty Lee, but was held back by the chains that strapped her to the chair. So instead Azula flew into a tantrum like a wounded beast with a leg caught in a trap. Ty Lee even saw flashes of blue flames beneath her muzzle as she attempted to breath fire, burning her own mouth in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she watched Azula cry and moan and scream and rave, Ty Lee was shocked to the point of tears to see how her Azula had gone from a brilliant, logical, and sensible princess to a raving lunatic, broken and locked away. Soon Azula had tired herself out and all she could do was lay her head on the table and sob, and Ty Lee, still upset by her display of madness and pain, walked over and placed Azula's head in her lap as she sat on the table and stroke her princess's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Ok Azula. I'm here.\" Cooed Ty Lee as she tried to comfort the insane Azula. \"And I promise not to leave you again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer promise not leave was not so much directed at Azula, since Ty Lee doubted that she could hear anything she was saying any more, and more to herself. She knew that it was big commitment and that she would have to post pone her own plans to train with the keoshy warriors and rejoining the circus, but after seeing the pain Azula was in she just couldn't leave friend behind in this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when the guards came to carry Azula back to her cell, Ty Lee demanded that on grounds that she was a lady of high standing and the person friend of both the Fire Lord and the Fire Queen that they let her spend the night by Azula's side even if she had to sleep next to the bars. </span></div></div>",

It took her a moment to realize where she was, and why the floor under her was so hard.  She wasn't at home, but in a high-security prisoner, snoozing on the floor next to Azula's cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up, flexing her stiff back. <i> Ugh.</i>  Her aura wasn't feeling particularly pink this morning, that was for sure.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was unpleasantly surprised to see Azula already awake and looking at her -- there are few things more unsettling than realizing that girl's been watching you in your sleep -- but tried her best to look cheerful anyway.  \"Mornin', Azula.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it wakes,\" the ex-Fire Lord sneered.   \"Why are you even still here?  I thought I made myself clear.  You're unwanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guards entered with two trays of food, setting one in front of Ty Lee, and slipping the other through a slot into the cell.  Ty Lee nodded at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked them to make better food -- I hoped you would have breakfast with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that?\"  Azula growled.  \"You didn't do what <i>I</i> asked.   After all that garbage about treating me as your Firelord, you weren't even willing to fulfill the simplest request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee gulped.  Her voice quivered, but she met Azula's gaze and spoke clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azula, I did say you could be my Firelord while I was here.  But being Firelord doesn't mean what you seem to think it means.  It doesn't mean being some sort of -- of god, or something.  You think your brother is spending his time humiliating all his former enemies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.  He certainly did it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azula, he spends most of his time in boring meetings about the future of Fire Nation relations with the rest of the world, or reading piles of paperwork, or--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How Zuzu chooses to waste his time is no concern of mine,\" Azula said coldly.  \"Things will be very different when I regain my throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I'm saying is... I... I just wanted to eat breakfast with an old friend.\"  Ty Lee sniffled.  \"Like we used to, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the fish and bit into it.  It was delicious -- and she could tell the heavenly smell was affecting Azula, whose was starting at her and trying hard not to drool.   Even for a woman of her willpower, keeping up this hunger strike had to be taking its toll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,<i> fine,</i>\" Azula spat.  \"If it'll stop you looking at me with those big eyes of yours.  I suppose if I <i>don't</i> have it, you'll stuff both helping down by yourself, and you're fat enough already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up a handful of rice -- she wasn't allowed to have utensils -- and stuffed it in her mouth.  She ate with as much dignity as she could muster, though Ty-Lee could see that her aura was going mad; she was probably having to restrain herself from just cramming the food in her mouth willy-nilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A step up from the usual slop,\" Azula grudgingly admitted.  \"I <i>suppose</i> it won't do my subjects any good if I starve myself to death...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee beamed.  \"That's great, Azula!  I'm just glad you ate <i>some</i>thing, you know?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ty Lee had been with Azula for a week and already the princess was kind of showing some progress. Really all Ty Lee had managed to do was get Azula to start eating again by letting her convince herself that her subjects needed her to be strong. Dr.De Fang, who had taken on Azula's case, wasn't completely happy about letting Azula continue with this fantasy but since it did get her eating again she went along with it for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this was were the good news ended, Azula still fought the orderlies every chance she got, she refused to talk to De Fang during her sessions except to insult her, and during one of her insane fits Ty Lee had to stop her from making herself throw up what she had just eaten. But still getting her to eat was the step in the right direction and De Fang and Ty Lee hoped to build on that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on the seventh day since Ty Lee arrived and Dr. Fang decided to talk about that during her session with Azula that day, she didn't think she would get a response from her patient but she had to try. So there they were in Fang's office, the doctor in her chair and the princess strapped to the couch. The small room was painted whitish yellow and  the main source of light came from the two windows despite the iron bars. Da Fang herself was mid thirty year old Earth Kingdom woman with wavy heavy black hair that she kept short so that her patients couldn't grab or pull on it, she had green eyes, and was kind of short with a rather large butt from sitting too much in a chair. But she caired herself with such dignity and grace that no one could logically deny that she wasn't a beautiful woman.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Azula, your friend Ty Lee has been with us for a week and I was wondering how you felt about her?\" Asked De Fang starting the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about instead of you asking me about my life, I ask you about yours?\" Came Azula's reply. \"After all, since I'm the one chained up I have the most need to know if my captives are going to kill me or hold me for ransom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDe Fang was shocked by Azula's response, not because she thought they were ether planning to kill her or use her as a hostage, after all it was that kind of thinking they were trying to fix, but that Azula answered with more than a growl and an angry stare or a string of insults. Fang considered asking about this change in behavior but decided not to push her luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to know about me?\" Asked Fang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything.\" Answered Azula. \"Like who gave you that Earth Kingdom wedding band on your wrist? And why is someone from the Earth Kingdom even in the Fire Nation?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok fine. I'm from a town east of Ba Sing Se so we didn't see much of the war. When I was 18 I went to the Ba Sing Se academy for mental health and after I graduated I travelled taking care of the mental wounds caused by the war on both sides. I am now 35 years old and my wife Toph and I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just say my wife Toph?\" Azula asked with confusion across her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I did, and not the Toph who travels with the Avatar. A different Toph.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're a woman, right? How can two women marry?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its allowed back in the Earth Kingdom, in fact it use to be allowed in the Fire Nation as well, until your grandfather outlawed it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for him. Two women falling in love is disgusting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are allowed to have your opinions about the matter same with everyone else. But lets move on. Toph and I moved here after the war because we wanted to settle down and your uncle offered me a job as your doctor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT TRATOR?!\" Screamed Azula in both fear and anger at the mention of her uncle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meet him during his travels after he retired from the Fire Nation army. It was I who helped him get over his son's death. He wanted to make sure that you got someone he could trust to take care of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iroh doesn't care about me. All his so called love and affection goes to his puppet king Zuko. I think he asked you to infiltrate this hospital so you can kill me and make it look like an accident!\" Accused Azula. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not Azula. Your uncle cares and even loves you. He was just...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO MORE LIES YOU PERVERTED FREAK! YOU PLAN TO KILL ME AND TY LEE SO THAT THE TRAITOR AND THE USURPER CAN RULE UNCHALLENGED!\" Azula was now in a full blown tantrum and if it wasn't for the iron chains holding her down De Fang would have terrified, but after seeing the princess pointlessly struggle against these chains dozens of times the affect had worn off. So the doctor simply walked to her door, stuck her head out, and asked for the two orderlies outside the door to come, give Azula a sedative and take her back to her cell, Which the promptly did. De Fang then asked for Ty Lee to come in so they could talk.      </span></div></div>",

Ty Lee of course agreed to this and then after another few minuets of talking about Azula and each other she went back to the cell she shared with Azula.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you returned after talking to that perverted murderer.\" Azula stated through her muzzle as the guards let Ty Lee pass through the heavy metal door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I did, Azula.\" Ty Lee responded in her normal cheerful manner. \"I told you I would never leave you again and so I won't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would you stay? You already betrayed me once before, so I know that your decision isn't motivated by loyalty or friendship. And with this blasted jacket restricting me, you have no reason to fear me. So why do it? Why stay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee instantly recognized the signs that Azula was about to go into one of her tantrums caused by her delusions and paranoia, and since she didn't want to see her Princess return to that dark place in her mind Ty Lee acted quickly to comfort her. Taking the strapped up Azula in her arms, she whispered gently in her friend's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you are my best friend and I do care about you. And like I said before, I only saved Mai because you were loosing your mind and I had to stop you before you did something you would later regret.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LIER!\" Azula yelled as she tried to break away from Ty Lee's embrace, but was unable to do to the straight jacket and her friend's tight grip, so she continued to scream at her. \"It's your fault I'm in here! This is all your fault!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this my fault Azula?\" Ty Lee asked, both astonished and insulted that the princess would accuse her of this. \"I didn't make you banish all of your servants, nor did I make you have a mental break down when Katara and Zuko defeated you, and I'm definitely not causing you to have tantrums or create false memories or have delusions. So tell me, how is it my fault that you are trapped here?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you Ty Lee.\" Azula growled, her unstable mind completely blocking Ty Lee's question when it couldn't come up with an answer. \"I hate, hate, hate, hate, love you Ty Lee!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then retreated back into silence, but Ty Lee could only stare at her friend, dumb struck by what she had said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She couldn't have meant it.\" Ty Lee thought to herself after the initial shock wore off and the worry began to set in. \"I'm mean she sounded so angry that it had to be a slip of the tong. There's no way Azula could have meant it when she said she loved me. She's insane. But... on the other Dr. Fang did ask me to report any strange behavior and it doesn't get any stranger than that. But do I have the right to impose on Azula's privacy when it could have been a slip of the tong. Maybe I should wait until I know that it was more than an accident. Yet what if by doing that I'm cause Azula even more misery? I can't take that chance, I have to tell Dr. Fang first thing tomorrow morning, right after breakfast.\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

If you haven't seen it, do so, its great!) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Four months after the defeat of fire lord Ozai </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Crane Isle Rehabilitation Asylum had seen its fair share of dangerous occupants:A Yu Yan archer who hallucinated targets onto unsuspecting citizens' behinds, a fire-bending chef who thought his dishes should be cooked <i>as</i> they were being savored, and even a rather powerfully built woman who believed herself to be a platypus bear. <br>\r\nHowever, no inmate in the Crane Isle Rehabilitation Asylum was more feared than its newest member.  Not once since her arrival was this patient deemed fit for a non-chilled cell environment or a binding removal. The staff of the Asylum waited in vain for the look of madness in the eyes of former Fire Lord Azula to abate to provide such luxuries. Refusing to communicate during talking sessions and attempting a jailbreak during her first week there, Azula and her reputation as extremely potent firebender kept everyone who came into contact with her on edge. Often refusing to eat, the raven-haired conqueror had slowly become almost skeletal, furthering her reputation as a monster with a girl's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, however, was different. Azula was calm and was quite ready to tell the asylum workers whatever they needed to hear to make them unshackle her. She knew she wouldn't be able to firebend her way out of the asylum, but as of that day, she had another approach.Over the last four months Azula had little to focus on but her own frustration and the sound of her own heart. As days stretched into weeks, Azula became acutely aware that the energy that kept her heart beating and her lungs breathing was nothing more than heat. And where there is heat, there is fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Guard. I would like to speak to my councilor. I hope I haven't frightened him with my behavior. I've done a lot of thinking, and I believe it is time for me to rethink my motivations in life.\"   As one of her guards hurried away from her padded, chilled cell, Azula's lips bent into her devilish smile. No one would suspect that their own inner workings could be bent to her will.She knew it could be done. Her test had been successful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her rage and frustration at being dethroned by her brother and betrayed by her closest friends, Azula had begun to waste away into skin and bones, rarely eating more than a slice of bread or two per day. As of this month, she had grown gaunt-cheeked and skeletal looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula's councilor couldn't explain how his newest patient had seemingly fattened back up to her starting weight over the last week while her food trays still came out of her cell largely full, but at least now he could attribute it to her improving mental condition. A perfectly shapely, smiling Azula greeted him as he stepped into her cell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula's smile intensified as the councilor entered her cell.\"Hello again. I'm ready for a nice, long chat.\" </span></div></div>",

Freeing the messenger hawk from her grasp, she read over the note once again to make sure she understood it correctly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a message for Zuko?\"   Zuko's mother, Ursa, strode across the sizable courtyard of the Fire Nation's royal palace to see what was bothering who she guessed would be her future daughter-in-law.   Banished from the fire kingdom for years for agreeing to assassinate Fire Lord Azulon to avoid having to kill her son Zuko, Ursa had spent her long exile worrying about her son, getting by as a servant at a country inn beyond the Earth Kingdom's borders. She didn't dare attempt to re-enter the fire nation to check up on Zuko, not for fear of her own life but out of concern for what Zuko would do if news of her apprehension reached him. The last thing Ursa wanted was to give Ozai another reason to want to hurt her son. <br>\r\nZuko restored her position upon becoming Fire Lord.  Ursa wasn't worse off for her period in exile, and the only real changes were calloused feet and some weight gain. Her accommodations at the inn were far from fancy but there was always food to go around; Ursa, as bit of a nervous eater, slowly added one hundred pounds to her frame over the course of her exile.  Now once again home and clad in form-fitting fire nation robes, Ursa's extremely full chest and wide, motherly hips made her an extremely recognizable figure on the palace grounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai sighed. \"Azula escaped from Crane Isle.\" The lack of ennui in her voice was testament to her honesty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsa maneuvered her rather large, gently shaking backside next to Mai and sat down next to her underneath a tree.\"That girl...and Zuko has enough on his mind!\" Her face contorted with sadness as she dwelled on what her daughter had become since her exile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai sighed. \"Just when things were going nicely for once.\" Mai truly enjoyed her new life with the royal family. She had been more open with Zuko than anyone else in the world,and his mother was very accepting of her, despite Mai's tendency to make a cold first impression. It could even be said that Mai's life with Zuko was helping her out of her shell; she would sometimes wear her hair down and had become more lenient with herself, even allowing her once carefully watched figure to take on a little extra weight. Most of the roughly 20 pounds seemed to go to her butt, making her behind a more dynamic aspect of her body than her often-stoic face thanks to her lack of a wardrobe update. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsa took the message out of Mai's hand. \"We should go let him know; the faster, the better, even if he won't like it.\"  Mai stood up and offered a hand to help the very plump woman onto her feet. \"You go. I need to get to some fresh messenger hawks. There are others besides Zuko that need to know she's out.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thinking. Don't let this upset you, Mai.\" Ursa smiled, turned, and headed indoors to the throne room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I won't let her change things.\" Mai said to no one in particular before letting the wind carry the parchment into the air. Mai watched it for a moment, the hurled a throwing dagger through the sheet, nailing it into the courtyard wall with precision. </span></div></div>",

Unsure if Aang was still in the Earth Kingdom capital of Ba Sing Se, Zuko figured getting the message to Iroh to spread around would be the safest bet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh received the hawk as he was heating up a row of pleasant-looking teapots for the evening rush with some gentle firebending. Ba Sing Se was a massive city, and the Jade Dragon tea house had a reputation as the best in the world.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear a messenger hawk! If its more royalty askin' for a reservation at <i>my</i> table, tell them its fine as long as they don't expect me to move.\"   Toph Bei Fong was sprawled across the two-person-sized booth closest to the counter in the Jade Dragon, lounging. Not eager to resume her pampered home life, Toph looked for amusement in Ba Sing Se as Aang and the others took slightly more...hands-on approaches to helping rebuild the damage done by the war. Toph thought Iroh was a pretty down to earth guy; he never chastised her for her manners, and Iroh accepted her service to the Avatar as payment enough for a little tea and cake. As such, Toph's bare, rather dirty feet, poking out into view past the table as she reclined, had become almost a fixture at the tea house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA well dressed Earth Kingdom gentleman of about forty sitting at the table next to Toph's gave an audible snort of displeasure at the girl's manners; he had waited an hour to be seated, and some barefooted little commoner was overstaying at her table! Immediately after the snort, his table was immediately jolted upward by something, flipping his tea onto his head and sending his untouched pastry rocketing into the air. The man strode out of the restaruant, half-crying over the damage done to his dress robes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh smiled and calmly walked over to the now-vacant table, re-straightening it. The pillar of earth that had shot up underneath the table to jolt it had settled back into its original formation in the floor without a crack out of place. \"That messenger hawk actually had some serious news.\" Iroh began as he picked up the spilled teacup.  \"...But first, where did that pastry go?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph was now impatient.  \"Don't worry about it! -Burrrrap!- What did the hawk say?\"  <br>\r\n\"Azula seems to have broken out of the Asylum. I can't help but feel like a regimen of gentle, encouraging therapy was not the best fit for calming my niece down.\" Iroh mused in his usual pondering tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph sprung to her feet, a few cake crumbs fall from her clothes. She didn't look much different from four months ago; she stubbornly adhered to the same rather dirty outfit, and still carried with her the slightly strong odor of earth and sweat. All the baked goods she had gobbled up over the months had built up a pooch around her midsection, making her sash pinch her slight potbelly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know if the Avatar is still in town?\"   Iroh asked. \"I haven't seen him in a few days.\" <br>\r\n\"I think everyone went to make sure the farms outside of the city limits were doing ok. Sokka said he wanted to go talk to the guy responsible for maintaining the rail system to expand the tracks into smaller towns for ease of travel and junk.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll alert the messenger system that the Avatar is needed back here for a meeting, then.\" Iroh began walking out of the restaurant.  \"Wait!\"  Toph held out her palm to Iroh. She was silent for a moment, then scrunched her toes.  \"I'd know those footsteps anywhere!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Katara burst into the Jade Dragon, out of breath and with one hair loopy undone.  \"Azula's here! She's fighting Aang in the lower ring!\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Toph, sensing the approach of a monorail, quickly hopped on and gestured that the others follow. \"Get on!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara, who had been sent by Aang to retrieve Toph and Iroh, didn't like that Toph's actions had contradicted her words. Not willing to stay still and put Aang in further danger however, she climbed aboard.  \"What do you have planned?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph planted her feet on the monorail, and even as the earthbenders staffing it began to slide it forward at his normal speed, Toph pushed her hands outward in a bending motion, launching the vehicle forward with a massive explosion of rock. Toph then turned, and with a look of concentration, brought one of her arms to her waist. She took a deep breath, and as she brought it forward, the monorail track peeled from its track into a much steeper upward angle. The blisteringly fast monorail car shot forward off this improvised ramp, sending the group arcing through the air.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?!\" Katara yelled, wondering what Toph had planned for their landing.  <br>\r\n\"What do you mean what now?! Oh! The land-\"   The car slammed into the top of a building in the lower ring, sending it spinning across rooftops, demolishing them. Finally, the car hit the street, tearing up pavement, and skidded to a stop on its side.   Iroh rolled out of the tram only to find Aang over him, a look of worry on his face. \"Iroh! Where are Toph and Katara?!\"  <br>\r\nIroh slowly got to his feet, rubbing his back.  He took a look inside the compartment and saw....a massive hole in the roof. <br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula stood over Katara and Toph, who were extremely dazed from the impact of the monorail and their subsequent kidnapping from the flying vessel. <br>\r\n\"I clearly have lost none of my skill through my incarceration.\"    Azula gloated, proud that she had eluded the avatar and intercepted the rogue monorail car with a well placed bolt of lightning. Katara and Toph had fallen from the hole made in the flying car and tumbled helplessly in front of Azula's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging by those vibrations its not what you<i>lost</i>that you should be worried about.\" The ever-plucky Toph said replied, somewhat hazily. <br>\r\nAzula scowled. Her massive chest, the equivalent of of a C bust size, quivered slightly.  Azula ran a hand down the severe hourglass figure she had developed since her escape from the asylum. Wearing a set of too-tight fire nation robes, Azula was now significantly overweight. The way fat settled on her body only contributed to her regal air, however. Her hips and chest had flared out, giving her a strikingly womanly figure that amplified her domineering presence. <br>\r\n \"This body is the result of my practice. I have developed a superior fire-bending discipline, and I believe it is due time I tried it on someone that can bend!\" <br>\r\nKatara had just begun to get to her feet when Azula pointed two fingers at her abdomen with a look of concentration in her eyes. Waves of pain and warmth coursed through her body, radiating from her stomach.  She felt as if someone had lit a fire in her intestines.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, BURN!\" Azula yelled, and pointed with her other hand. However, as she extended her arm, a rock flung by Toph's earthbending struck it off course. In a rage, Azula's concentration left Katara, who collapsed with a breathy gasp.  Azula repeated the same one-armed motion with  Toph, who bit her tongue to stop from crying out at the feeling.  <br>\r\nAzula readied her second arm once again, when the shouts of Aang and Iroh grew louder in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not before I finish the technique!\"  Azula, frustrated that she would not be able to kill with her new art until some other day, raised her head to the air and let out a massive belch that resounded through the city streets.  Even azula was surprised she did this.  As Azula began to run, her chest shaking and thighs jiggling, she murmured to herself \"This technique has really been messing with my chi...here's hoping it won't get worse as I hone my abilities.\" As she had demonstrated in eluding Aang, Azula lost none of her agility with her weight gain; she swiftly abandoned the scene of her crimes. Azula knew she had acted rashly; she would need to victimize more people with her new bending before she would attempt it against the Avatar. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katara opened her eyes to find Aang leaning over her, wide eyed.  \"Katara!\" <br>\r\nKatara rose to a sitting position and wrapped her arms around Aang. He had brought her and Toph to rest at the nearest upper ring hotel while they called for anyone with some healing knowledge. Her dirty robe had been removed, leaving her clad in her white skirt and tank-top that were layered over the wrappings that served as her undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara felt a pang of guilt; clearly that strange technique made it look like she was killed, at least for a few seconds.  \"I'm sorry if I scared you. I'm not in pain...Azula just knocked me out. I feel fine.\"   The sound of Katara's stomach suddenly became audible; it was growling loudly. \"Well, maybe I <i>am</i> hungry, I guess I was out for a while, huh?\" she put a hand behind her head, blushing a little. She had the strongest urge to eat her weight in chocolate; she wondered if she had been unconscious for more than a day to work up such a ravenous appetite.  Her stomach gave another roar as she slipped on a clean blue robe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang raised an eyebrow. \"Actually Katara....its only been ten minutes.\"   <br>\r\nKatara double-taked. \"Really?!\"   <br>\r\n\"Well, that's the thing Katara...\"    <br>\r\nAang took a glass of water off a stone night table next to the bed. \"Try bending this water.\"  <br>\r\nKatara extended a hand and scooped upward, trying to get the water to mimic the movement. Nothing. Katara gasped.   \"Oh no....that technique takes away bending!\"<br>\r\nHer mind settled on the feeling of helplessness that had washed over her when Ty Lee had blocked her chi, disabling her waterbending. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang scratched his head. \"Well...not exactly!\" He grinned, trying to cheer Katara up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n\"I would have <i>paid</i> that nutjob to mess with my bending like this!\"  Toph was effortlessly terraforming miniature mountains and sending baseball-sized chunks of earth zipping around her head in the middle of the street of Ba Sing Se. Being a sprawling cityscape, the inhabitants of the bustling capital were very used to roadblocks, and the slightly jaded populace quickly re-routed around the street Toph was practicing on. Every few moments or so, she would earth-surf back to a table filled with various sweets and shove a slice of cake or a roll into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Toph got her bending back after she ate?\"   Aang had brought Katara down to street level to observe Toph, who had woken up before her and immediately demanded some food.  \"Yeah!\" Aang replied, glad to see hope back in Katara's voice. Katara stepped outside, which Toph immediately noticed. With good cheer and energy, Toph called out to her friend. \"Hey sweetness, go scarf down something to eat, your bending'll come back with a vengeance!\"  Toph made her flying rocks do a fighter-jet style formation to emphasize. <br>\r\n\"That's great!\" Katara rushed off to the Inn's dining room before Aang could stress one very troubling point; Toph had cleared her steak dinner in the five minutes longer Katara was unconscious for, and clearly she was still hungry enough to have a table loaded with pastries brought out to her..... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara walked up to the person talking orders at the Inn and smiled. \"I would like some fried roosterpig....oooh with a side of potatoes....extra butter...oh! and for dessert , some chocolate mousse!\"  Katara giggled a little to herself and put a hand to her thigh, her way of expressing that vague \"I shouldn't, this will go <i>right</i> to my thighs, but what the heck!\" feeling that many image-conscious young ladies grapple with after yielding to some calorie-laden temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nAs her food was brought over to her, Katara felt fantastic, downright elated. The smell was almost maddeningly attractive, and before she knew it she was snatching the slices of rich, juicy meat from the plate with her bare fingers and gulping them down two at a time. She began shoveling mashed potatoes into her mouth with a spoon, but in a hurry to pack more flavor and more food into each bite, she had dumped her chocolate mousse into her potatoes and began eating the combination. It didn't matter if the butter and chocolate tasted strange with each other, what mattered was that she was <i>eating</i> !<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot bothering to wipe her hands or mouth, she dashed up to the counter and ordered a duplicate meal. She tapped her foot anxiously; her first meal only seemed to intensify her appetite... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her sixth meal Katara realized she could waterbend the milkshakes she ordered, but she wasn't content. Not only was she fairly certain her bending would disappear again if she was on an empty stomach, but she was also sure she was physically incapable of feeling totally full.  Sure, she felt a little better, but her hunger pangs were still an itch; the pounds of greasy food she had consumed had only served to dull the pangs from a scratch. The armpits of her robes had grown damp, and sweat dotted her forehead from her ravenous eating. Grease stains dotted her robe, and her fingers were absolutely covered in food and oil. Her stomach was round and bloated, but still she felt like she could go for another meal. In fact, the thought of another round of fried meat set her mouth watering.  \"What did Azula do to us...Toph?!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph had entered the inn's restaurant again and was at the counter ordering more food, her stuffed belly extremely noticeable on her tiny frame, even through her robes. She simply held up four fingers on one hand, and within a few minutes four whole cowhippo steaks, each one the size of Toph's head (hairdo included!), were being brought out from the kitchen.  \"Freshly imported from the fire nation, miss Bei Fong!\"  the staff member placing the food before Toph remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara realized Toph must be going through the exact same thing as her. Katara got to her feet, wobbling a little at the extra weight now centered in her gut, and ran over to her. She approached Toph as close as she could without hitting her in the face with her distended gut. \"Toph! Whatever Azula's done to us has made us food addicts! I can't get full, and I think we'll lose our bending if we don't pig out all the time!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph had grabbed a steak with both hands and was slowly wrenching a chunk of dripping meat off the bone. With her mouth absolutely full, she turned to Katara and shrugged.  \"So?\" she said in an offhand tone, grease spraying from her lips and into her friend's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three days had passed since Azula had attacked Toph and Katara with whatever strange bending technique she had perfected while locked away. Many healers and academics had examined the girls, but none seemed to come close to finding the root of the girls' need to overeat, nor why this compulsion seemed to directly affected their bending abilities.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toph, wake up!\"  Katara flicked a finger, sending a small but fast moving jet of water launching from a nearby pitcher into Toph's face. \"Wha!Blch, pah!\" Toph sat upright in her hotel bed, using her hands to help herself into the position. Toph had as usual neglected to bathe or change out of her robes, preferring instead to heave herself onto her bed and fall asleep. Katara had just finished a breakfast consisting of twenty-five fried eggs, a whole roast pig, and enough toast to comprise an entire loaf of bread (Which was slathered in over three sticks worth of butter.), so her bending was feeling fine...well, was. Already she felt fatigued and desperate for more food, and she had only walked up the stairs since she ate!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see little miss 'I can't eat like this anymore' has been stuffing her face!\"  sang a triumphant Toph as she wiped the water that had been bended at her off her face. \"I only had a little snack!\" Katara sharply replied, crossing her arms.  \"Little snacks aren't bending fuel.\" Toph patted her stomach, which had swollen outward since her binging began. Toph hopped out of bed, not looking as if she was going to shower or change her clothes.  \"I've gotta get me some meat!\" Toph licked her lips and began trotting past Katara. Katara saw Toph's gut shaking in her robes as she left; she had clearly put on at least fifteen pounds. Everything about her was chunkier. Katara noticed how full Toph's face was becoming, and how seriously her belly was developing over such a short timespan; already Toph had developed a bulging potbelly that squished into tables when she sat down to devour pound after pound of guilty pleasures. Katara figured if Toph kept up her piglike eating habits, it wouldn't be long before she had to waddle to get around!  Katara sighed and followed her friend down to the hotel restaurant; like it or not,she could also go for some food.<br>\r\nKatara sat across from Toph at the restaurant. \"Looking for another 'little snack', madam fussybritches?\"  Toph grinned at Katara.<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just here to talk to you about your overeating!\" Katara growled.  <br>\r\n\"It's not overeating if you never feel full!\" Toph shot back quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelp from the hotel's staff quickly approached the ladies with a smile; the establishment had been gifted with all of the payment for the food they had served to Toph and Katara, thanks to the economic free reign Zuko had granted them. Toph and Katara were now valued patrons, and in this particular restaurant manager's eyes, his path to early retirement.   \"So, what will it be?\" He asked with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you normally place orders up front first?\"  Katara asked.  The manager waved a hand. \"I'm willing to make an exception for you fine young ladies! You are most valued customers.\"    That was all Toph needed.  \"Sweet, can I get a couple of roast pigs, about six dozen raw eggs, ummm, some pie, apple I guess...no....blueberry...umm just bring me all of the pie you've got, and a muffin.\"  Toph was already rubbing her flabby gut, eager to have it feel full for a fleeting second or two.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for you?\" The waiter turned to Katara for a smile. <br>\r\n\"Nothing for me, please.\" Katara daintily waved her hand. \"...Just a fifty egg omelet.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, of course! <br>\r\n\"....with sausage.\" <br>\r\n\"Will that be all?\"<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Katara nodded. \"That's it, just that and like, a brick of chocolate if you have it.\"<br>\r\n\"P-pardon me?\"  <br>\r\n\"Well, you guys serve chocolate right? Just a tiny brick-like sliver please.\" <br>\r\n\"....I'm sure that can be arranged, I guess...\" the manager said, not wanting to offend his gluttonous guests. \"Well, I'll just bring your orders up to the kitchen...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it!\" Toph held out a hand in the manager's general direction. \"Listening to her order worked up my appetite, bring out a bunch of cowhippo steaks too.\"    <br>\r\n\"Steaks? At this hour? I'm sure that can be arranged but how many should I bring?\" <br>\r\n\"Whatever you can manage.\" Toph flatly replied. <br>\r\n\"But we have a whole team of chefs, that much steak would feed the entire restaruant! It'll be too much!\" <br>\r\nToph snorted in laughter.  \"Bahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n\"So how many did you say you wanted?\" The manager put a hand to his face in exasperation.<br>\r\nKatara sighed. \"She's not kidding...bring them all out.....if she doesn't finish them all, I will....\" Her voice dripped with disappointment at herself. Katara leaned her head into her hand, propping it up over the table. </span></div></div>",

Katara would have liked to think she was more refined than Toph, but she ate exactly the same way: as if she were a starved wanderer who had spotted her first food in a week. Toph still managed to put away her food faster than Katara, however. For one thing, Toph was a big eater. If Katara was sure an amount of food would fit down her throat, it was too small a bite for Toph.  Taking her eggs after some tentative feeling around, she cracked three dozen into a large wooden bowl, twirled the mass of protein and fat around a bit with her hand, then drank it in one monstrous chug.    Toph regularly ordered eggs throughout her meal and treated this style of eating them as a beverage. Katara was indeed served a brick of chocolate, and after slapping Toph's hand away from it, greedily immersed herself in rich, creamy, sugar-laden bliss for a few perfect moments. By the end of the meal, both girls hands and faces were covered in food, and neither seemed altogether full, despite their five (six for  Toph, who squeezed in an extra one, having lapped Katara in eating pace once) courses and swollen bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toph, I have -urp-\"  Katara covered her mouth and tried to quietly expel the gas. \"...I have an idea! While I was eating my chocolate-\"<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you didn't let me have a few bites of that!\" Toph shook her fist at Katara.<br>\r\n\"Nevermind the choco-brick, for the last time! I realized that I had experienced this kind of problem before; Ty Lee was able to block my chi by striking my pressure points! Maybe <i>she</i> could help diagnose our problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What problem? Its a new preference, if anything.\"  Toph's bare belly button was poking out from her green robes, stretched and distended from her massive meal. \"Buuuuuuraaaap!\" An extremely loud and rather deep sounding belch issued from her tiny, yet bloated body. Katara pinched her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be so cool with all of this?!\" Katara shouted, her voice odd sounding with her nose pinched.<br>\r\nToph struggled to her feet.  \"This is how! I get to stuff myself silly all day long,\"  Toph raised one hand. The sound of ground being uprooted and launched accompanied by varied screams of surprise from outside the inn were heard. \"and what happens? My bending becomes more powerful!\"    Toph grabbed Katara's arm and pulled her to her feet. Katara let out an \"uuugh....\" As her stomach rubbed against the table and shook a bit from the rapid movement. Her eyes were half-closed with lethargy from the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel me!\" Toph demanded of Katara.<br>\r\n\"Wha?!\" Katara's eyes shot open, no longer dazed.<br>\r\n\"Touch my gut! See how much fat I've got there now? Now all of the vibrations I feel with my feet travel also shake up my gut! This must be how people feel when they get a new pair of glasses! All of the vibrations I feel are amplified and sharpened! And now, the rest of me is starting to get flabby! I'll be able to see even better!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good for you Toph but I-\"  Katara grabbed her left arm with her right hand, clearly embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"Stop being so self-conscious. You can't lie to me and say you don't like it, I'm the same as you! You'll actually have fun with this if you don't grudge yourself a couple of pounds!\"<br>\r\nToph extended a hand to pat Katara's big belly, but to her surprise, it was surprisingly small! Even with the swelling caused by her meal, Toph's hands detected a relatively slender waist wrapped with a thin layer of fat.  \"Wait a sec; my vibrations don't lie, what's going on here?\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara tried to pull away from the little girl that was currently groping her, but she was stronger than she looked. \"If not there....\" Toph mused to herself before putting her greasy hands onto Katara's chest, causing her to jump as she began to squeeze. \"No...definitely bigger, but not what I'm lookin' for...\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TOPH! <b>Stopthatthisinstant</b>\" Katara half yelled, half whispered, trying to find a pitch that would outline her severity but wouldn't draw the attention of the others dining in the hotel restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a second sweetness, I'm trying to find why your vibrations are so big....ooooh, duh!\" Toph grinned. Her hand shot downward to Katara's waist, and clamped down on the round, jiggly flesh that was Katara's rear end.  Katara had gained at least 20 pounds over the last few days, and almost all of it had gone to her hips. Her robe was now fighting to cover  a maternal looking pear shape. The garment was stretched rather taught over her body.  \"You don't need to be able to see to imagine what <i>you</i> look like in motion, <i>sweet cheeks!</i>\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara had blushed so severely that Toph almost saw it.  \".......We. are. going. to. see. Ty. Lee.\"   Katara shoved Toph away from her and stormed out of the restaurant.<br>\r\n\"That's it sweet cheeks! Work those vibrations!\" Toph shouted after her gleefully, wiggling her toes and enjoying Katara's discomfort immensely.</span></div></div>",

By the evening, the responsible young water bender had organized her and Toph's trip to Kyoshi Island.  Not wanting to deprive Aang of Appa or bring him along on an errand that could compromise how quickly he could respond to a report of Azula or some other issue that needed the Avatar's attention, she decided that Aang would see them to the coast of the Earth Kingdom, and from there a ship would be ready and waiting to take them to the island itself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and once we are there, we'll see if Ty Lee can help clear our Chi. Also, the sea voyage will force Toph and I ration our food, so maybe we'll lose a little weight,even if we're only going to be sailing for a few days!\" Katara maneuvered her fleshy rear back to the her booth in the Jade Dragon, smiling at the chocolate cake and milk that was waiting for her.  \"Sounds like a plan, Katara!\"  Aang tried to sound enthusiastic to her without sounding <i>too</i> enthusiastic. The last thing he needed was Katara picking up \"subtle\" (read: non-existent in Aang's case) messages that he was eager to see her slim down or stop eating so feverishly. \"I'm going to go do that stuff you asked me to...no, don't worry, I remember it all!\"  Aang waved and exited the tea shop, a little glad he didn't have to watch the girls scarf down food anymore...it was getting a little boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Katara knew she and Toph just weren't getting any thinner staying in Ba Sing Se. The combined sensation of starvation and the feelings of insecurity that came with blocked bending was hard to willingly accept, especially with the waves of elation that eating provided and the effortless bending that came afterward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That works out perfectly!\" Toph declared as she spooned heaps of sugar into her tea.  Katara's chocolate-smudged lips popped into an appreciative smile. Toph continued  \"...With you cutting back, I can eat your extra portions! <i>Balances perfectly.</i>\" Toph grinned, clearly satisfied with her flawless logic.<br>\r\n\"Well Toph, there isn't going to be any extra!  What I've ordered for the ship is what we've got.\"   She only just finished the sentence when her stomach growled, unsure why her system was no longer being flooded with cake.  Katara resumed eating.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There better be a second ship's worth of food then! There ain't no way I'm going to eat anything less than thirty squares a day!\"  Toph looked genuinely agitated, and began pouring sugar directly into her mouth, skipping the liquid middleman. \"Toph, we need to cut back!  I think I've gained another five pounds just today.  You're so much smaller and you eat as much, maybe even more than I do!\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph nearly growled at Katara. <br>\r\n\"Look. I gave you my reasons. Yeah, I'm gettin' chunky. Yes, its harder for me to walk. But I can see so much better, and my bending is getting so effortless that I don't even know if I want to go ahead and get this Goofy Acrobat Punching Cure you are banking on.\"  <br>\r\nKatara looked a little frightened. \"Toph, if we let this keep changing us, who knows what we'll look like in another week, another month!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph licked a finger to get at a few rogue grains of sugar inside the container as she transitioned into her trademark sarcastic tone. \"Ok, so we buy new robes with the money we'll be making bending mountains and rainstorms with our pinkies\"  Toph put her feet up on the table to recline, her gut, now almost level with her head, hid half of her face .   \"But I won't make you take the trip alone, sweet cheeks. I'll go with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara unclenched a little and resumed her cake eating, figuring it would be easier to convince Toph after their mini-diet. \"Thank you Toph.\" Katara murmured, spraying a few chocolate crumbs at her feet.  <br>\r\n\"Just...lemme know the name of the ship?\" Toph inquired.<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\nKatara had just gotten a gander full of their ship's cargo. The ship was set to sail in ten minutes, and Toph had arranged a few changes in provisions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you!\"  Katara screeched, bringing her head face to face with Toph, forcing her rear end into an extremely conspicuous position.   Toph rested one hand on her corpulent stomach, which was starting to conspicuously attract the attention of gravity.  \"A girl's gotta eat!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara glanced again at Toph's replacement provisions.  \"Pot after pot of oil, bricks of blubber, what looks like a ton of butter, milk, sugar, garlic, and that's it! We can't just eat this stuff for two days straight!\"   Katara's arms shot to her hips. Her fists dug  into her fleshy sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph, round faced and thick-armed, rubbed her hands together, sending her upper body into small shakes.  \"Well, I probably can, but I know that Katara.  You're going to waterbend and fish us as many elephant coy as we want; we are perfectly supplied for a two day fish fry that will go down in history!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but...\" Katara noticed she was now spraying drool in Toph's face as she objected.  Toph didn't flinch at this. In fact, she smiled, aware that Katara's body had surrendered their argument on her behalf. </span></div></div>",

Rapidly tapping her foot, and imagining the rocky shore of the earth kingdom shrinking and disappearing as their ship moved ponderously out to sea, Toph struggled to be nearly as comfortable as Katara. Her excess flab made things better than her last sea voyage however, and the vibrations of the wood and metal of the ship provided meager but adequate vision. The bottom line was that nothing beat solid ground for Toph, and her decreased perception led to increased attention to her hunger pangs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...it's always good to get out to sea every once and a while. You don't need to see to enjoy it Toph, just take a deep breath and relax.\" <br>\r\n\"I'll start taking 'deep breaths' when all we can smell is sizzling butter!\" Toph licked her lips and gave Katara's rear a slap. There was a visible response to the stimulus at the site of impact.  \"Get bending!\" She exclaimed.  <br>\r\n\"Would you cut that out? I'm hungry too!\"  Katara grudgingly glanced around and elegantly sent a few smaller elephant Koi onto the deck.  \"Ok, these will be yours; we need you full so you can bend us up a seafood feast!\"  Toph quickly (though slightly unstably) retrieved some butter and a massive pan, and with a quick fire the fish fry had begun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara ate the first serving and was soon hurling massive catches onto the deck, which Toph aggressively prepared. Toph's robes quickly became a mess as she dropped whole bricks of blubber into the frying pan, coating the fish until it was a sinful, greasy slab twice its normal size. Everything below Toph's nose was pressed into the fish as she tore into each and every morsel, spitting bones over the deck. It wasn't long before she stopped trying to wipe her face and just left grease perpetually dripping off her chin.  As she finished her fifth elephant Koi about two hours later, Toph came to the shocking realization that Katara hadn't eaten a bite since her first snack!  \"Katara? Don't you want some?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara sounded as if she were crying. \"No, I'm fine.\"   <br>\r\nToph realized what she had been doing; making a complete and utter pig of herself and scaring Katara away from indulging. \"Your bending is going to get worse if you don't eat!\" Toph reasoned.  Katara was silent for a moment.  \"I'll...just get one more out, then that will be it for me.\"   Toph nearly gagged at the thought of only having a single Koi for the day. \"Ok, but first get five more for me! I'm still hungry!\"   Toph insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara sighed. \"Ok Toph...can't have you going hungry, I guess...\"   she muttered dejectedly.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nWhen Katara had retrieved six bulky Koi, over the next half hour, she gloomily turned to face a meal she knew would leave her stomach howling in agony all night.  To her surprise, Toph was standing guard over not one, but six fried fish.  \"I'm not going to eat these.\"  Toph said resolutely.   Katara couldn't believe her ears.  \"What?! You, not want to eat? Is the chi-block wearing off?\" Her voice raised slightly with hope.  Toph gave Katara a little punch on the arm. \"No, I want to eat all of these then lick the grease off the deck of the ship, but you need to eat it more, Katara! You'll be cured when we get to Kyoshi, I'm sure, but you helped Aang save the world, and you shouldn't be torturing yourself like this! You should be happy! You should be enjoying yourself!\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Toph.....\"  Katara bend down and gave the plump earthbender a hug...saturating the front of her robes in grease. Toph promptly shoved Katara off (with a little less force than her usual shoves) and pointed in the direction of the food's smell.  She soon heard Katara quietly but rabidly tearing into the food. In a single hour, she was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Burrap-\"  Katara let out a satisfied belch and got to her feet. She sounded much happier, but something was unstable about her voice, as if she wasn't going to take no for an answer to her next question.  \"Up for seconds Toph?\"     <br>\r\n\"Am I ever!!\"  Toph took off towards the hull to retrieve more butter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of frying fish wafted from the ship several hours past sunset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sunrise woke the girls up. Both had collapsed onto the deck in a food-induced coma after dozens upon dozens of fried elephant koi.\"Oh man...we hit the fish pretty hard last night...I feel like there's  agni kai going on in my gut!\"  Toph put a hand behind her head and welcomed the morning with a loud, cloying belch. <br>\r\nKatara got to her feet. \"Same.\"  She took a step,stopped, blushed heavily, and fanned by her backside with one hand. \"We're gross....lets get out of these robes in our cabin.\"   Katara said quickly, making sure Toph was always in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nKatara and Toph had been assigned a reasonably large cabin with four beds. As they entered, they began to notice things.  \"Katara, do you feel a little...bloated? <i>Burrrap</i>\"  Toph lethargically asked.   Toph was no longer just a pudgy kid; she looked as if she had a bulging feed bag stuffed underneath her robes.  Maternal instincts kicking in, Katara bent down and popped Toph's belt out of its notch.   Toph gave a moan of relief as her belly surged forward. Shedding her robe to reveal her half-length cloth pants and yellow tank-top like wrappings, the full extent of her girth could be observed. It could be argued that Toph would have weighed in at less than 90 pounds before her weight gain, but now she was hedging 130.<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Katara's hand went to her nose.  \"Toph, when was the last time you bathed?\"   She began fanning.<br>\r\n\"I got caught in a rainstorm like three weeks ago.\" Toph raised her arms up a little. \"Kinda funky?\"  She sniffed her own armpit.  <br>\r\n\" All that belching you are doing isn't helping either.\"  Toph smelled of damp earth, sweat, and grease of both the hair and food variety. The cabin was filled with her body odor upon her disrobing, and was virtually impossible to ignore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Toph smelled different parts of herself to validate these claims, Katara couldn't help but gape at how large she had become in such a short time.<br>\r\nHer cheeks, spreading outward, finally framed her face in a permanent double chin after last night's binge. Her arms were thick and wide, further adding to the roundness of her figure. Her pants were clearly tight on her, and had ridden up to expose chubby knees. All of Toph's figure seemed to have thickened to better support her tummy, which was exposed. Her stomach was fair-skinned and massively weighty; thick creases in Toph's back fat indicated a significant downward force.  Her gut was loose and jiggly, no longer a circular potbelly. Hanging down to her mid-thighs, Toph's excess flesh was becoming significantly apron-shaped. Her belly button was now at waist-level, with a \"U\" shape of flesh extending further downward, her belly forming a secondary roll.  Toph's body batted against her stomach as she walked, sending her gut shaking with movement. Katara knew her friend was now undeniably significantly out of shape, weighty, and rather slow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph finished sniffing a lock of her hair. \"Ok, ok, so I kind of reek.\"  Toph stuck her finger in her left nostril to clear an obstruction.  \"Though I've smelled you firsthand after you work up a sweat, sugar queen!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara gently pulled off her filthy  robe,  making further visible  her dark blue stretch pants and revealing her white chest wrappings with a similarly colored  half-body top similar to Toph's over them.  Katara's darker flesh could be seen between the wrappings, forming noticeable cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph immediately noticed a change in the stagnant air.  <br>\r\nKatara blushed and gave her left armpit and experimental sniff. Her facial expression went from questioning to one best described as \"yikes.\"  Katara was known to work up a sweat rather quickly, and while she found it useful for emergency waterbending at times, she had yet to find a positive application of the stinky pits that quickly joined her perspiration.  On top of that, Katara's stomach was roiling painfully with gas from her deep fried gluttony.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No wonder you are so concerned about staying all ladylike, once you start sweating you are absolutely ripe!\" Toph laughed.\"So, what's the damage?\"  She slapped her stomach, which triggered a brief but baritone belch from the depths of her belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The damage?\" Katara crossed her arms, getting another potent whiff of herself in the process. Then it hit her; she ate as much as Toph last night! <br>\r\nKatara,  being taller and older than her friend, was likely nearing 175 pounds.  Her own glistening tea-colored belly, dripping with sweat, was beginning to remind her of the way Toph looked when she started showing weight. \"Oh boy...\" Katara cupped her new spare tire in both hands and shook it, then gulped and felt down her hips.  Sure enough, her ass had spread significantly; Katara realized that both sides of her hips had brushed the cabin door coming in.  Her stretch pants still covered her quite comfortably, but it was clear her rear end had begun a process like Toph's belly; it  was now leaving a roundness stage to become more wide and oval-like. Katara felt the cheeks lifting and dropping as she walked now. The sensation vibrated through her body, making Katara mentally assign a \"ka-clunk!  ka-clunk!\" noise to it. Katara's face slightly rounded, and her arms were thickening different from Toph's; while Toph's were more wide and shapely, Katara's flab hung and shook more the the limb, unable to mold around a sliver of muscle tone. Katara's body was now significant pear with a bit of extra chest weight. \"...the damage is...predicable....\" Katara murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I remember having tons of fun last night, do you?\" Toph interrogated.<br>\r\nKatara frowned. \"Yeah...it was fun....\"  She couldn't lie to herself; she had a blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why not have one more girls'  night before Ty Lee fixes us both!\"   Toph suggested.   Katara lit up. \"You'll do it? That's great!\" <i>If I pig out one last time, Toph will get cured with me!\" she thought.</i> <br>\r\n<i>\"If Katara has more fun tonight, she won't want to get rid of this either!\" Toph thought.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph grew serious  quickly after this, however. \"Now, one more thing has been bugging me. We're both being open here, so just let it go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara looked puzzled. \"What are you talking about?\"  <br>\r\nToph smiled. \"I won't think you are any less of a lady, just do it!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara looked nervous for a moment, then looked up, gathered her courage, leaned to one side, and ripped a mammoth fart in the confined quarters.  Katara was pretty sure the temperature in the cabin rose a few degrees. \"heh....pardon me?\"  She nervously blushed.   <br>\r\n\"How long were you holding that in?\"  Toph questioned, letting a smaller fart of her own rip.<br>\r\n\"My whole life, really!\" said Katara, nervously giggling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels good right? Forget a change of clothes, lets get cooking now, I'm starving!\"  Toph began to heft herself out of the cabin with her exposed gut. <br>\r\nKatara moved toward the door, the idea of another day of gluttony intoxicating her and evaporating her inhibitions.  \"Just watch out Toph, that meal is still digesting!\" She gave a small, audible fart to emphasize her volatility.   Toph laughed. \"Ditto, sweet cheeks,and we're about to refuel!\"  Both were salivating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Kyoshi Warriors had only just finished their forms for the day when they received news that a non-trading ship had arrived at Kyoshi Island.  Ty Lee and Suki were both aware that Azula had escaped from her incarceration, making this report more attention-grabbing than similar ones in the past.   Ty Lee began wiping off her warrior facepaint with her sleeve after hearing the news.  \"Ty Lee? We need to go investigate, don't start to undress!\"    Suki was used to a certain degree of ditzy behavior from the Kyoshi Warriors' newest member, but even she couldn't have missed the possible implications of an unannounced ship's arrival.  \"It's not Azula.\" Ty Lee replied with all certainty.  Suki crossed her arms.   \"\"What makes you so sure?\"  Ty lee extended a hand out a nearby window. \"Look. Do you hear screams? Anything on fire? Its not like she can be stealthy after her face has been plastered up and down the world as an overthrown tyrant.\"  Ty Lee smilingly waved her arms dramatically to emphasize the scope of her claim. \"Say, I don't need to keep this armor on when we go into an actual fight right? All this clothing makes me feel so bottled up.\"   Ty Lee effortless flipped herself into a one-armed handstand.  \"See? Look at how all this armor just hangs off me!\"    Suki decided not to fight this particular battle (...again) and began a more practical line of conversation.  \"So if its not Azula, who is it, and what are they doing here at Kyoshi?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph and Katara had disembarked from the ship after another feast. Both had changed their clothes afterward for the sake of appearances, but already the armpits of Toph's robes were saturated with sweat, and Katara was quietly moaning with displeasure at the pounds of fried fish she had heaped into her stomach just an hour ago.   \"Oooh....Toph....you can still smell me through the robe, can't you?....and we only made ourselves worse with that second binge....boy that was silly of us, eating like that right until we saw the island...\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph was in high spirits having set foot on solid earth once again.  \"Dumb of us? You probably would have eaten that dockworker if we didn't have that little snack. I'm with ya on the gas thing, though.  -URRRUUURP!-  Phew.\"    After Toph's belch, the sounds of commotion were heard down the street.  \"I-I think I heard a fire catapult being launched!\" a merchant shrieked.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara and Toph had only grown plumper from their second feast; Katara's rear was marching a step behind her feet, plastered against her once loose robe, and Toph's flowing green shirt could be seen through her poorly-belted outer robe, which was simply under too much strain to fully wrap around her midsection. While the very loose second layer of her outfit still covered Toph's body nicely, her green shirt was known to ride up when she was sitting down, resulting in an exposed bellybutton resting in a layer of fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara put her hands together and squeezed.  \"This is so bad....we can't let Ty Lee and Suki see us like this, they've been training all the time while we've been sitting around and pigging out!\"   Toph, trailing behind Katara, realized her anxious friend had passed gas again for the fourth time since they disembarked a few minutes ago. After taking a moment to remind herself that she was not insane and Katara was at the moment indeed overweight and rather flatulent,    Toph gave her two cents. \"Well, they expect this sort of thing outta me Katara, and its not like you are going to get any thinner without their help.  Just go back to what you were doing before and hold your gas in until you get the fix you want so bad.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara blushed as she earnestly responded to Toph. \"It feels so good that I don't know if I could go back to doing that perfectly! It'll be pretty uncomfortable...\"    <br>\r\n\"I'm liking you more every day, sugar queen.\" Toph jested. <br>\r\n\"Lets just stay at an inn now and go up to the Kyoshi Warriors tomorrow.\"  Katara suggested, hoping her stomach would be settled by then.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katara and Toph located a two-story, 8 room inn that was far enough from the harbor not to be filled with sailors but not quite close enough inland to be in eyeshot of the large statue of Avatar Kiyoshi and the temple that stood beyond it. Katara approached the owner of the inn, an old woman bent behind a wooden desk, returning keys to their proper cubby holes. The innkeeper had no difficulty noticing their arrival without being able to see the front door.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sniff- -Sniff-  \"What in Kiyoshi's name is that smell? and the floorboards are shaking!\"  <br>\r\nKatara was blushing crimson as the old woman stood upright and saw that she had patrons. <br>\r\n\"Oh! Customers! I'm sure the smell and the quill that just fell off the desk are just in my head, don't you worry dearie!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara was no less mortified after this \"encouragement\". \"...One room for two, please.\"  Katara averted her eyes and kept her arms to her sides, desperately embarrassed by her current state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're all settled in; guess we should get cleaned up for our visit tomorrow!\"  Katara's rear rose and fell through the blue fabric of her robe as she advanced towards their washroom. Toph noted how thunderous each of Katara's footfalls were on the wooden floors and figured Katara's clothes were likely growing as tight as her own, albeit in different places. <br>\r\nToph threw herself onto her bed, shaking the posts a bit. \"Well, we should eat first. We'll be starving in an hour and its no use washing up if we're just going to get all dirty again.\" <br>\r\nKatara stopped and turned to face Toph. The faint sound of her rear brushing against a wall was  audible.  \"Sounds like a plan. We should get something light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara and Toph lay on the floor of their room with their robes open, overstuffed stomachs bugling upward and outward.  Bowls that used to contain rice spread out in a sea around them, licked clean.  <br>\r\nKatara groaned. \"Toph...I think this chi-block thing is getting worse...its like I can't even help myself when I start thinking of food...\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph seemed to be on the verge of fainting from a meal that consisted entirely of fried rice. <br>\r\n\"Katara, I'll go get this fixed, I'll do whatever you say, just please, oh please, rub my stomach....I ate....<i>way</i>.. too much....and believe me sugar queen that is saying something.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara belched, wiped flecks of rice and drool off her mouth, grabbed hold of her hotel bed, and heaved herself to a sitting position. \"Wow, you really are out of it, huh?\" Lethargically waddling on her knees over to Toph, knocking discarded bowls aside, she began kneading Toph's distended stomach. It was clear Toph had eaten beyond capacity more than Katara, but all of the fat that had collected around her stomach made Toph soft and doughy to the touch.  However, when Katara put pressure on the flabby looking dollop that was Toph's stomach, she could feel a firmness that clearly indicated severe overeating.   As she began to press downward, trying to find an application for her healing abilities, Toph sighed with relief, perched her lips, and let out a belch like a dainty woman blowing out a stream of cigarette smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm.....huh?\" A third voice was suddenly audible in the room. <br>\r\nKatara whipped her head around to find Ty Lee's head poking through the window of their second-floor room. \"Ty Lee?!\"  Katara gasped.  \"Wait, TY LEE?\" Katara forced her robes closed, realizing that not only was she fresh from pigging out, but that she had been perspiring towards the end of the meal out of effort and continued to perspire out of the exertion of rubbing Toph's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph put both hands on her exposed stomach. \"This isn't what it looks like, ok?\"   Toph seemed thoughtful for a moment.  \"Wait....what <i>does</i> this even look like?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee lifted herself into the room, clad in her favorite red acrobat robes. She was in perfect shape as always, not an ounce of fat on her frame aside from her rather full breasts.  \"I dunno, actually. Maybe the island had an eating contest, and you guys won? a couple times maybe?\" <br>\r\nKatara pulled her robe around herself tighter, noting that even it had sweat stains under the armpits and at her chest. \"No! Ty Lee, I'm sorry you had to see us like this, but we came here because we need your help! Wait, first,  why <i>are</i> you here anyway?!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph clicked her tongue thoughtfully. \"Actually Katara, you n' me could probably completely clean out an eating contest....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara huffed in exasperation.  \"Toph, Let Ty Lee talk!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee took a few steps into the room, smiling. \"Oh, well the Kiyoshi warriors and Suki were getting all anxious over reports of young girls appearing in town, but I know Azula well enough to know that something would definitely be blown up by now if she was here. So I kinda shrugged off watch duty for the night, asked around town, and here we are! Say, you guys are Toph and Katara right? I fell on my head a few times trying to do my routine in Kiyoshi armor....were you guys always this fat and sweaty?\"  Ty Lee asked this of the girls earnestly, completely free of guile or insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara explained what happened with Azula to Ty Lee, blushing all the while.  \"....and that is why we look like this....I really need to wash up I know, its just that we just arrived and we had something to eat first and....\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee interrupted Katara's self-flagellating excuses. \"It's fine! I mean, I think you guys look fine, like if we were to go out together you'd definitely drive so much attention my way! Not that I think you're not pretty, though! And hey, don't worry about the smell, I was a circus acrobat! I spent-so- much time around circus animals I barely even noticed you guys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara put both hands to her softening face. \"Enough! We're going to the temple, we'll tell you what Azula did to us, and you will reverse it and stop this!\"  <br>\r\nTy Lee didn't see why Katara was so stressed.  \"M'kay! Nice seeing you guys again, I forgot to add!\"  Ty Lee put her hands on her hips and beamed at her friends. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    Toph had slung her yellow tunic's belt over her shoulder halfway through their journey to the temple; her stomach was bulging outward enough to make even the first notch aggravatingly tight. The garment now flowed open, revealing her green shirt and the upper portion of her identically dyed pants. Unlike her robe, her green shirt was icing-blotch and grease stain free, having enjoyed the protection of her tunic for all of her previous meals. Katara, noticing Toph's wardrobe alteration, noted that many of the flaps and folds that used to indicate the looseness of Toph's undershirt had disappeared, the extra fabric being employed by her gut.  Katara herself was dreading their arrival; Suki was far less airheaded than Ty Lee, and would surely be disturbed at how porcine she was becoming. Katara also knew she had begun to get used to breaking wind freely around Toph. She wouldn't be so rude around Suki and Ty Lee, but being able to vent her nearly constant stomachaches, even if it was a barely-audible little belch,  was starting to become one of life's little pleasures for Katara. The young waterbender shook her head a little as they approached Kiyoshi Temple. \"<i>Thank goodnessi'm being cured...I seriously think this chi block scrambles your thoughts...\"</i> she considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Ty Lee had grown impatient by the time she, Katara, and Toph had reached the temple that served as the headquarters for the Kiyoshi Warriors. Arguably the most physically fit young lady that Aang had come into contact with during his journeys, her swift and fluid walking pace quickly outstripped her companions, who were moving even more sluggishly than their overweight frames would suggest due to the heaps of rice they had devoured just moments before setting out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main training hall of the temple was empty but lit.  \"Wait, Ty Lee, why aren't there any guards over Kiyoshi's relics?\"  <br>\r\nTy Lee grinned. \"I already <i>told</i> you, I skipped out on watch duty today! Now, you said Azula did this?\"  Ty Lee mimed the motions Katara had demonstrated back at the Inn.  Katara nodded, her chin retracting into the softness of her face a little.  \"That's good, just the last strike was much harder than the first few, and that second pointed strike sort of went in a downwards arc.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee attempted it again, effortlessly converting Katara's vague terms into their closest chi-blocking counterparts.  She was a little  impressed with Azula. \"Y'know I would never would have guessed that this combination of strikes would block someone's chi. Maybe its because she's a bender? I know firebending's supposed to be all stomach-y in its source.\"  Ty Lee wiggled her fingers over her lean and femininely muscular midsection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should give Firebending a shot, then.\" Toph gave her belly a proud slap, jiggling the ever-growing bowl of flab beneath her shirt.<br>\r\nKatara then decided she had heard her last fat-positive comment for a long time. \"Please, Ty Lee, reverse this now?\" <br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara and Toph had stripped off their robes and outer clothes to reveal their midsections and lined up for Ty Lee, who had stepped up to Katara.  \"Ok; this should be easy!\" Ty Lee delivered a series of quick jabs with the tips of her fingers to Katara's doughy midriff.   \"Feel any better?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Burrraaaap-!\"   Katara replied, spraying Ty Lee's face with spittle, making her scrunch up her features.  \"I'm so sorry! Its just that my stomach isn't settled yet from my meal and you kept poking me!\" <br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee had broken a sweat after her fifth try at reversing the chi block. \"Maybe I can't strike the points properly because all that tummy fat you've got....\" Ty Lee mused. Katara reddened, her expression a visage of growing horror . Toph was delighted at the suggestion.  \"Then I guess <i>I'm</i> not losing my appetite anytime soon! Good try Ty Lee! I heard this place has good desserts, lets go raid a restaurant!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara grabbed Ty Lee's shoulder. \"Wait, wait! Maybe you just aren't striking hard enough! I don't care if you bruise me, just fix this!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katara?! Toph?!\" A more mature voice than Ty Lee's rang through the nearly empty training hall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki, clad in Kiyoshi armor and face paint, was advancing up to the girls. <br>\r\n\"It's great to see you....but....are you both ok?\"  Katara could see Suki's shocked expression through her heavily painted features; her eyes kept darting to Ty Lee's, as if begging for an explanation as to why they were both at the temple in the middle of the night, and to why they looked so....different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee looked as if a bolt of inspiration had hit her.  \"I know!\"   Ty Lee gave an aerial flip, landed in front of Suki, and delivered a series of strikes to her abdomen. Suki gasped in surprise, expecting a story from Ty Lee, not an assault,  and promptly fainted after the final blow was completed.  \"Ty Lee, did you just perform the technique on Suki?!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee didn't look satisfied. \"Its easy to make someone faint if you miss a point...maybe I've just been the one screwing up.\"  her briefly downcast expression suddenly sparked back to an inspired grin.  \"You said this technique makes you really hungry? I'll know for sure if I'm getting the points right if I do this then!\"   Ty Lee arced her hand around to her midsection, and delivered the same pattern of blows to her own body.  She swooned briefly, but with an acrobat's talent kept herself steady.  \"Wow. I do feel hungry. This works fast!  I can definitely fix you up Katara, but you're going to have to help. On the count of three, take a fast step forward as I run at you! If the first blow strikes deep enough, that is all we should need to get things going! Toph might be harder, but maybe if I use a staff it can work.  Then I'll fix myself, of course. Oh...and Suki. She's going to be maaaaaad at me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara, standing mouth agape as she watched Ty Lee afflict both Suki and herself with a chi block, could only nod.  Ty Lee took a few steps back.  \"Ready?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am.\"  Katara was smiling, confident that this would be the end of her problems. However shoddy Ty Lee's methodology may be, she had absolute confidence in her abilities; she was always a formidable opponent while working with Azula.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee charged, beginning her count.  \"One, two, -\"   Katara took a steady step forward. Bringing all of her weight to bear, she stomped up a pace...uprooting a floorboard with her bulk as she did. Ty Lee tripped over the sudden hurdle, flew laterally across the room, and came down hard onto her side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara spun around.  \"Ty Lee!\" she willed her out-of-shape body to run, feeling like she was moving with a couple of sandbags saddled below her hips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think I fractured my wrist....\" Ty Lee whimpered.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katara hefted herself over to Ty Lee. Having just recently stuffed herself full of oily rice, her bending powers were somewhere close to their full capacity. Katara let her hand rest on Ty Lee's wrist. A clean blue light briefly came to life underneath her hand, and Ty Lee's expression relaxed. \"Wow!\" Ty Lee got up and flexed her wrist back and forth in front of her face, completely free of pain.  \"Now Ty Lee, you need to undo the chi blocks on yourself and Suki! It starts out innocently enough but the next thing you know you're a total food addict!\"  Katara tried not to stand too close to Ty Lee after the treatment, aware that she still hadn't bathed since before the boat trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee's joy at being healed seemed to fade a bit upon hearing this.  \"That's terrible! I'll get right to it!\"  Ty Lee's exposed stomach growled behind her words, and her expression glazed over a bit, as if she was smelling something savory.\"....umm...but first a snack break! I'm starved!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara's eyes widened. \"Ty Lee, no!\"  Toph, now more than ready for another meal, quickly cut Katara off.  \"Now you're talkin'! Take me to the best restaurant in Kiyoshi!\"   Ty Lee licked her lips and shook her head. \"Forget dinner! A big plate of Kiyoshi desserts for me!\"   the acrobat then lithely sprinted from the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey! Wait up!\" Toph began to waddle out of the temple after her, worked up over the idea of another pile of food to gorge on. <br>\r\n\"Ty Lee! Wait!\"   Katara shouted and also gave chase, concerned that it would only take a short time before even they were too plump to reverse the chi block on themselves.  Katara also made a beeline for the temple's door.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara and Toph reached the standard single-frame door at the same time, and both attempted to heave themselves through it at the same time. Toph attempted to get her bare, shaking belly around Katara's jutting rump by turning sideways, but this was exactly Katara's idea. The waterbender's rear end squished into the doorframe, pushing her flabby but mostly unobtrusive gut into Toph's much more developed midsection. Their momentum only served as the push needed to get into such a tightly-packed position, and both girls grunted with discomfort as their sweat mingled, their respective girths jamming them against each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off, sugar queen!\" Toph tried to wriggle her hips to unwedge her stomach. \"Toph, you are <i>not</i> going to sabotage this because you like to overeat!\"  Katara raised her arms and tried to pull back against Toph's bulging midriff.  \"Quit stinking up the place!\" Toph spat.  Katara inhaled sharply, extremely agitated. \"We wouldn't even be stuck if you didn't let yourself become such a dirty little piglet!\"   Katara brought her hands to her rear and tried to shift some of the doughy flesh through her stretch pants. Toph scowled. \"Look who's talking! I hope Ty Lee grows a nice big potbelly right off the bat like me! If she's going to get a bad case of hippocow-butt like you it'll take forever for you to get off her case!\"  Katara snapped back with her usual gripe.  \"You can't possibly think we should live our lives like this?!\"  Beads of sweat poured down Katara's forehead, slicking strands of her long hair against her cheek.  Toph, no longer calm enough to have this conversation yet  again with Katara, craned her neck forward, and belched directly into her uptight friend's  face.  Katara coughed and stuck her tongue out, recovering quicker than before, having unknowingly grown more accustomed to her friend's lack of manners.  \"Real mature! How would you feel right now if I decided to rip a huge.....\" Katara stopped and turned her softened features to the interior of the temple.  \"....wait...where did Suki go?!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph heaved her stomach out of the doorframe, tumbling outside.  Planted on the ground with a cloud of dirt around her, Toph grinned at her friend. \"Where do you <i>think</i> she'd be at a time like this?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Toph gestured to the gentleman working behind the counter, and  another elephant koi was slid into the makeshift fat friar that Toph had helped the restaurant build. This one would be all  for Suki; if she wasn\u2019t sporting enough blubber to make her immune to one of Ty Lee\u2019s over-the-top poking sprees before Katara got in the way, all of Toph\u2019s hard work would have been for naught.  And if Suki and Ty Lee stayed skinny, Toph might be forced to do the unthinkable and try and drop a few pounds!  Toph ran her fingers down her midriff, proud to feel that her belly button was poking out from underneath her once extremely oversized green shirt. Not the artificial bulge that came with overeating; this was the real deal, genuine fat that shook floorboards and halted conversations. In fact, since Toph left Ba Sing Se, not a single person had called her \u201clittle girl\u201d! On top of how fun eating had become and the impossibility of keeping up with basic hygiene,  Toph was convinced this was the life, and she intended to keep herself and her friends on the path to gluttony, even if they didn\u2019t see the perks of the deal right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You\u2019re seriously picking up the tab for all of this, Toph?\u201d   Suki, now without her armor and makeup, was eyeballing the frying fish and licking her lips.  She had woken up in a bit of a daze, and while she wanted to find Ty Lee to make it clear that she would have be once again treated like one of the ten-year-old trainee Kiyoshi warrior girls for her behavior, she wanted something to fill her stomach even more. She had dashed out for a bite to eat, and found herself staying for more than a snack.   Toph had arrived a few minutes later, riding a small wave of dynamically bended earth. By then,Suki had eaten a three course meal, complete with dessert, to her great satisfaction.  However,  Toph insisted that she stick around the restaurant for a lfew more minutes while Katara searched for Ty Lee. As Toph went behind the counter, threw money at the employees, and began creating an oil-frying device with her metal-bending, Suki found herself getting a little peckish again. Fast forward and hour, and she was still going strong!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cSo...don\u2019t take this the wrong way Toph, but you\u2019ve put on a little weight since I last saw you...\u201d  Suki, unlike Toph, took the time to cut into her fish with a knife before eating it.  Toph had hopped onto the stool next to her, grunting as she reached over her stomach to get at the next hunk of fried fish.  Suki finished another few bites, and continued speaking.  \u201cMphg. That\u2019s good. So there\u2019s no chance I\u2019m going to go through the same thing you are if I binge for a bit? Katara\u2019s really out looking for Ty Lee, and she\u2019s going to fix me up? The situation didn't look good, from what I last remember...\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cYeah,don't sweat it!  I mean, you might as well feel good while we track her down, if you don\u2019t eat you\u2019ll feel awful! I'm payin', so eat as much as you can handle!\u201d Toph belched, spraying flecks of fish onto her stomach, which was squished up into the counter. Thankfully the stool she was sitting on was made of metal; its small diameter still made her fleshy rear end uncomfortable, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Suki watched her friend devour yet more food, and knew that Toph clearly didn\u2019t care if Ty Lee wasn\u2019t found. However, something kept her rooted to her stool. The more fish she stuffed into her sleek frame, the better she felt. Paradoxically, now that she had picked up her eating pace, she found that she felt less full.  \u201cWell...when I\u2019m done eating I\u2019m going to try and find her myself...she\u2019s technically my responsibility....but for now, I can really use another one of these guys!\u201d  Suki held up a few fish bones, stripped clean.   \u201cThis kind of stuff is terrible for my complexion, but what the heck!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Toph smiled, her second chin quivering a bit as she began to lick her fingers clean. Suki wouldn\u2019t take long at all to develop. That fact, on top of the way she left Katara, reassured the flabby earthbender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Katara heaved herself through the village of Kyoshi Island, sweat darkening her robes under her arms, below her neck, around her waist, down her back, and just around the area where her rear end\u2019s flab began to smush together. Despite taking long, nourishing gulps of air, Katara could barely catch her breath as she searched every inn and restaurant she could find for the missing Ty Lee. Kyoshi Island was by no means big, but a girl with her body was in no condition to run around town looking for an acrobat with a sweet tooth, especially when it was getting annoying to squeeze into single-frame doorways. As the pear-shaped waterbender labored down the main road, Katara realized she was leaving an invisible trail of noxious gas wherever she went, her body more used to flatulence than exercise.  Her face reddened as she noticed plenty of townspeople staring at her, watching her rather impotent progress through the town.   All the while, Katara pictured Toph bending her way into town with no physical exertion whatsoever, headed to fatten up Suki, and Ty Lee indulging in pastry after pastry, her perfectly thin body beginning to soften...</span></div></div>",

This didn't dissuade Ty Lee from starting on another pastry, but she did turn to check out what was making the bakery smell like the Kiyoshi warriors' laundry room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I found you!\"   Katara stood erect, clearly out of breath and exercised past her comfort zone.  Her chin seemed to recede into her soft face every time she inhaled, making her double chin wax and wane in thickness. \"Ty Lee, you need to reverse the chi block on yourself and Suki!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will! As soon as I'm done eating, Katara!\"   Ty Lee gestured towards the twenty or thirty pastries sitting on her table.  Ty Lee's exposed stomach had rounded out into a firm ball, clearly bloated by the dense cremes and doughs she had been scarfing down for quite some time. \"You also need to stop eating!\"  Katara reached out and grabbed an elongated pastry covered in chocolate fudge, and crammed it into her own mouth. This instantly made Ty Lee pout.  \"Hey, I can always order more, y'know! Eating my sweets won't make me stop!\"   Katara shook her head.  \"No, I'm eating your food because I just can't resist! I'm starving! That's exactly my point Ty Lee, you may feel good now, but it's like stopping your acrobatic routine; the longer you relax, the harder it is to come back from it!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...I get it.\"   Ty Lee put a half-eaten pastry down on her plate. She seemed somber for a moment and put a finger to her lip.  \"This is gonna <i>stink</i> when I stop in a week or so.\"  She snatched up the half-eaten pastry and gulped it down without fanfare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara grit her teeth.  \"A week is too long! You'll be way too far gone! What are these called by the way?\"  Katara had grabbed another pastry mid speech and was now pointing toward it.   \"Oh, those are chocolate-frosted flaky rolls!\"     Katara gestured to the baker, a cheery looking woman who couldn't have weighed less than 300 pounds,  called out an order for thirty chocolate covered flaky rolls, and turned back to Ty Lee.  \"Forget I just did that and stop eating!!\"   Katara knew Ty Lee's childlike naivete  would try her patience, but she was so frazzled from her waddle through town that she could barely keep her thoughts coherent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baker soon had Katara's order ready. Placing a bamboo tray filled with fattening delights onto the counter top, she beamed at the two girls that had quickly become the day's best customers. \"Excuse me sweetheart, may I ask where you got your outfit?\"  Katara looked up at the baker as she grabbed her sweets.  \"Oh; my grandmother made them for me...why do you ask?\"  The bosomy woman smiled warmly at Katara.  \"You must have the same dress size as my oldest daughter, and your robe is just beautiful!\"   <br>\r\nKatara blushed slightly.  \"Oh...thank you...but I'm embarrassed, I'm kind of outgrowing it...\"   <br>\r\n\"Well, that's only natural!\" The baker replied, still smiling.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Katara returned to Ty Lee, Katara felt oddly soothed.   <i>\"Maybe I'm not such a freak after all...just a little full figured...\"</i> she thought.  Katara saw that Ty Lee had gobbled up the last of her 10th round of pastries.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm -so- up for elevenths!\" Ty Lee shouted, waving at the baker, who went right to work.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she hefted herself into a sitting position inside her Inn's room, Katara remembered stumbling back to her hotel room in the dark, too exhausted to search out Toph and Suki after finally tracking down Ty Lee.  She had no real way of keeping Ty Lee put, but she hoped that the stern talking-to she gave her after  received after they had eaten through the entire stock of the bakery...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I kidding. She's probably bigger than I am by now.\" Katara frustratedly murmured to herself. Putting her index fingers to her temples, Katara tried to silence her hunger pangs long enough to to make a guess at how long she had slept. She certainly felt refreshed. She noticed she had never changed out of her old clothes, which were discolored with frosting and the buckets of sweat they had absorbed since their journey began.Her sheets were as damp and frosting-blotched as her clothes. Katara guessed was so exhausted she probably just fell face-first into her bed. Katara noted her morning breath was probably the most pungent it had ever been in her life, which must mean she had probably slept for a prolonged period of time. The whole room was almost humid from the smell of her unwashed body.   It was daylight, but only just; it seemed to be the crack of dawn.  It all clicked at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I've been asleep for like thirty hours!!</i> Katara gasped, granting herself another unpleasant whiff of her breath.  She was frightened for Ty Lee and Suki, but even more frightened for what her appetite would be like once her stomach woke up...Katara decided if she was even going to function, she'd need to gather as much butter as possible and get to the beach so she could fish up some elephant koi.  She would -try- and cook it all but chances are she wouldn't have the time, as she could already feel a void deep within her stomach and an itch growingstarting in the back of her mind. She would have to eat whatever she came across from the vendors along the way to work up some semblance of bending power, then cram as much seafood down her gullet as possible before the real withdrawals started to kick in.  As she threw herself to her feet, hearing a small tearing noise from one  leg of her stretch pants, Katara had cleared from her mind of all other priorities. Already sweating from anxiety, Katara stumbled out of her room without any further thoughts towards her friends, a cure, or taking care of that terrible morning breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toph, I'm not kidding! I need to hand out watch assignments!\"   Suki was contentedly slurping down a plate of fried eggs heaped on top of a buttered roll, the first course of her breakfast. Despite her heavy binging over the last day, her soldierly discipline managed to keep her internal clock razor-sharp. If Toph hadn't heard her trying to get her chest plate back on, Suki would have strolled right out of her house, back to exercise and drills! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decided to crash at Suki's place for the night, and Toph had outright declined Suki's offer to draw her a bath. Not wanting to make her too uncomfortable (or expose anyone less tolerant than Katara to a full night of her flatulence), Toph slept on the floor of the main room of the one-story village house.  After getting woken up by Suki, Toph had managed to gather enough breakfast to keep her from bolting back to the Kiyoshi warriors.   Toph had managed to keep Suki supplied with enough food to keep her from scrutinizing her increasingly dubious excuses for a whole day, but she had almost slipped through Toph's puffy fingers this morning.  Lucky, they stumbled across Ty Lee last afternoon, eating her way through a wedding cake she had purchased.  A complete sugar-addict, Toph had little trouble getting Ty Lee to keep Suki distracted with her. The last thing Ty Lee wanted was a tongue-lashing from Suki when she was back on the job, and the longer she could postpone that, the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Which brought Toph to her current situation. Ty Lee gave a knock at Suki's front door and entered without waiting for a response. Suki looked up. The acrobat had a bag in one hand, which she promptly reached into to retrieve a sweet roll. \"Ok, the second in command is in charge again for the day! I went and told 'em!\"   Suki's glare was no less intimidating without her makeup, even with bedhead.  \"I told you not to do that! I said I was going to get up on time, and I did! See!\"   Toph cut in before Suki let her anger stifle her appetite. \"We'll work it out after breakfast.\"  Toph tried to visualize Ty Lee's extra weight. She didn't seem any more lethargic than she did two days ago, but she definitely was far less of a waif, her vibrations proved it. To Suki, Ty Lee's  body seemed to have been stretched horizontally at first glance. There were no visible rolls, but her stomach was wider and rounded out, making her acrobat's clothes look more like a belly-dancer's. Her bloated chest further suggested the archetype.  Her arms were thicker, and her hips had a new wiggle to them. Her lean muscle had done a good job supporting her first thirty pounds, but she certainly didn't look like she could pull off the most rigorous of her acrobat techniques with that extra baggage. Ty Lee gave her sweet roll a big lick before shoving the entire thing into her mouth.  Toph grinned. \"No wonder you're so energetic, all I ever smell around you is sugar!\"  Ty Lee just sighed with dreamy pleasure as she pulled out the next roll. \"It's just all so good! Melt-in-your mouth is the best kind of melting, and you know that's a big deal coming from a Fire Nation girl!\" She flashed a smile at Toph, even though she knew she couldn't see it.  Toph's senses were acute enough to tell she was getting a grin, though. She could just make out the sound of Ty Lee's lips parting with her heightened senses, and could detect a sugary puff of breath doing a good job of covering up the fact she hadn't brushed her teeth in two days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki sighed. \"Fine. One more day. Then its back to work. I better go grab some off-duty clothes...then seconds.\"  She gratefully accepted another plate of fried eggs from Toph and returned to her room.  <br>\r\nSuki wasn't as lucky as Ty Lee when it came to how her weight was settling. It seemed her body was hellbent on making her look as tubby as possible with the smallest amount of adipose;  her thirty pounds had puffed out her cheeks, thickened her arms, pushed out her chest, and given Suki a potbelly that looked less like a soft extension of feminine curves like Ty Lee and more like an oblong bowling ball jutting out from her midriff.  Her butt was certainly bigger, but her hips were too small to outrace her belly, destroying the last semblance of feminine curves on her already tomboyish body, even with the extra weight in her breasts; they looked more wide than round and perky like Ty Lee's girls' did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph turned to Ty Lee when Suki disappeared into the other room. \"So, is Katara -still- asleep?\"   Ty Lee scratched her head with a sticky finger, pulling a few hairs askew on the top of her head. A tiny lick of hair above her forehead remained upright, gelled in place by liquid sugar. \"Yeah, I could hear her snoring from outside the inn. She was -really- exhausted looking for me. I guess I could have checked back after I dropped off the orders for the Kiyoshi Warriors, but I just had to swing by that bakery for breakfast!\" Toph didn't think the ditzy acrobat had eaten anything other than sweets since she started overeating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph shrugged and shoved a fist-full of bacon into her mouth. When her mouth couldn't hold another cubic centimeter of greasy, crispy perfection, she offhandedly remarked,   \"Wughen shugurh queen wakes uph, shesh gonna be <i>starvhingh!</i>\"   The final word was accentuated by a spray of saliva and bacon chunks, some of which landed on Suki's eggs. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning ,Katara was pleased to discover the massive stomach ache from yesterday's raw seafood and butter binge was staring to lose its edge. She admitted to herself that she  had succumbed to gluttony for the better half of the previous day. She grew ravenously hungry waddling down to the beach, and all the exercise it required didn't help any either. She wasn't turning heads with her flatulence this time, as, without food for a day, her gassiness plummeted in frequency and no longer sounded like gunpowder being ignited.  Even that irritated Katara, though. Part of her had grown accustomed to the warmth and gentle wave of relief she felt every with every few steps since she decided she was physically unable to hold back due to politeness' sake anymore. Upon arriving at the beach, she fished out anything and everything she could after downing a few sticks of butter for bending fuel. (Thank goodness the market opens pretty early on Kiyoshi Island, Katara thought!)  She indiscriminately chowed down on koi, raw oysters, occasional tufts of seaweed, some puffer-crab, and what she figured must have been a jellyfishsquid.  After eating just about everything the tide brought in with block after block of butter, she let herself collapse into the sand like a bloated sea-mammal and collect her thoughts.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara was banking that Suki would see past the euphoria of her first calorie high and order a search for Ty Lee, as she knew Suki possessed pristine sense of motivation and a clear sense of duty to the Kiyoshi Warriors.  However,  Katara had also once thought she herself had large stores of willpower. At the very least, she considered herself <i>polite</i>. As she lay there, listening to her body churn the mishmash of seafood and oil into more body fat and noisome bursts of gas originating from both her  mouth and rear end, she knew the last thing she could call herself at that moment in time was well-mannered.  She experienced the harsh sting of her guilt once more, though she was quick to defend herself this time.  \"<i>It's not like I have a choice; my body needs to process all this food I...can't help but...yeah that sounds right, can't help but eat.</i>\"    But something about her self-talk made Katara even more nervous. She hadn't felt any guilt <i>as</i> she was stuffing her face, only when she was full to bursting did her body seem to let her have thoughts independent of her urges. Even worse, she couldn't help but have a bit of a craving for some chocolate, even as she winced against the stomach cramps that had rapidly developed as she ate and ate and ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Katara knew that both Suki and Ty Lee,who had the willpower of a child when her acrobatics and other attention-seeking antics weren't involved,may very well be too enraptured by their new urges to fight them, rendering themselves at this point (or at whatever point Katara decided to move her gelatinous butt off the beach to resume the search) too chunky to reverse the chi-block. Katara guessed they must have gotten at least twenty pounds heavier, maybe more. Offhandedly, Katara wondered what parts of them were getting the biggest, as her and Toph had been growing equally soft in very different ways.  \"Ty Lee's probably going to have boobs as big as my head, judging from those times I saw her in a swimsuit...\"  Katara muttered half-jealously.  At that point Katara's eyes widened as she realized she was sidetracking herself yet again.  Knowing that her friends were probably now in the same boat as she had been, Katara decided that there was only one option left;  find Azula. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun began to set, Katara felt light(ish) enough to heave herself to a standing position. Her back ached from the exertion, but not as much as her stomach. All the fat that was collecting on her thighs made her feel like she was walking waist-deep in pudding compared to her old, fit self.  Smiling to herself as she felt the familiar and comforting bursts of flatulence once again sounding off from her rear as she walked, Katara began her search for the easiest way to contact the government. When she heard that a fire nation steamer was docked at Kiyoshi Island, she immediately decided on a plan.  She would inform Zuko that they had been cured of their \"affliction\" and that they wanted to join in the chase for Azula! She asked for an army-sized battleship, but with only the barest skeleton crew. She also requested to be informed of any sightings of Azula by any of the Earth or Fire kingdom forces, just as if the ship was an on-duty patrol vessel. After the message was given to a fire nation soldier, Katara leisurely made her way down the row of merchant ships, purchasing an armada's worth of provisions for delivery within the week. After all, not having a regiment of soldiers and tanks on board made that much more room for snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that it was a new day,Katara examined herself and  guessed she had hit 200 pounds, as her belly was now hanging over the upper part of her groin. She definitely added another six inches or so to her hips, and when Katara stopped to pick her underwear out from her doughy butt cheeks, she noticed a couple of small dimples amidst the once smooth light-coffee tinted flesh of her posterior.  A few flecks of cellulite that Katara had kept her eye on since she first started plumping up were now beginning to spread; her rear wasn't quite affected by much of it yet but that looked like her future; her inner thighs sported a generous strip of the slightly bumpy flesh, especially in the region -just- under her butt, by the banana rolls. It seemed likely her body wouldn't be able to differentiate her thighs with her rear as it continued its development into what looked like saddlebags.  She felt flesh starting to creep under her chin when she looked down, as well. Katara also readjusted her cloth wrappings; the amount she had on could only cover the lower two thirds of her bust now; her breasts had jutted out further and were wide enough force a slit of cleavage through her multiple layers of clothing. Katara noticed her elbows seemed to disappear when she held her arms straight, and her knees seemed to be slowly sinking into their own cradle of flesh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Katara figured she would finally wash herself up now that there was nothing to do but wait...as soon as she grabbed breakfast. Of course, if she spotted Toph and the girls on the way, she would regrettably have to postpone her hygiene yet another night. Tragic, Katara tried to tell herself. Very tragic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sunlight streaming through Suki's bedroom window illuminated Toph's triumphant grin.\"Nope, I didn't slip anything into your food! You slept in and missed drills today all by yourself, Suki!\"  She wasn't lying, either.  Suki had become particularly invested in the day of gorging Toph had laid out for her when it finally clicked with the gluttonous earth-bender what  her \"favorite\" foods were; anything that she was denied as a child growing up in the Kiyoshi warriors!  Anything that make Suki spout a line like \"Oh, I can never eat that on duty, it makes me lethargic!\" or \"That's terrible for my complexion, its all fat, no nutrition!\"  was a food Toph made sure was readily available 24/7. She seemed to have a particular week spot for cheese.  After the seventh cheese-steak of her ninth meal of the day, Suki fell into a gluttony-bolstered sleep that not even her discipline could override. Three hours after sunrise, Suki finally began to stir. Toph wasted no time heaving her uncooperative, gassy body into Suki's room to tell her the good news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki, clad in just a pair of green linen shorts and a baggy white night-shirt, moaned with frustration and brought her pillow over her head. After some squirming she eventually got  herself to stand up, her bare feet getting the slightest chill as they touched the floor. She scratched at a tiny pink pimple that had appeared on her cheek overnight and let out a heartburn-tinged belch, which Toph couldn't help but inhale deeply; cheese-steak smelled great, and she never smelled anything outside of her own cloud of flatulence lately, so it really didn't register as much different from the real thing to her.  Suki winced with slight discomfort.  Her hand automatically went to her stomach, which was bulging enough to be outlined in her night-shirt.  \"I guess I'll go in tomorrow then...I'll have to say I was sick, coming in late will only give the girls wrong ideas.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph, still grinning,  put her arm around Suki's waist, almost pulling her into her kitchen.(except at doorways, which Toph couldn't fit through with someone else in tow)   \"Sounds like a plan, bright and early tomorrow you'll be back on track! But for now, you've gotta try what I've got going for breakfast, -uuuurp-!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Toph had had a pleasant morning making sure Suki ate her fill. The more wildly inappropriate the food Toph presented her with, the more her complaints and calorie intake seemed to increase. By the time she had begun deep-frying pastries Suki was in her own little world. Not even bothering to get out of her pajamas after engorging herself, Suki now reclined in the main room of her house on a cushy futon-like piece of furniture that would be able to seat three if Suki hadn't stretched her body across its entirety, one hand on her bulky midriff, a dazed but pleased look in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph's own stomach demanded more food with an audible rumble and a gassy string of belches. She had of course eaten several pounds of sausage over the course of Suki's meal, but her bustling around the kitchen for Suki gave her fewer opportunities to stuff herself, cutting her consumption down to somewhere around what a normal person would eat in a day's time. She felt a little wrong about this; playing the mommy was much more Katara's deal. In fact, despite the circumstances, Toph guessed Katara would have been a little proud of what she had accomplished over the past few days; she had nurtured a sword-straight (and rapier-skinny!) soldier into a state of immature complacency. It takes a certain degree of doting to accomplish that! The more she thought about it, the happier she was Katara wasn't around to see it; she worked hard to let everyone around her know that she was by no means soft. Even now, she would rankle at the thought of someone using that adjective for anything other than her body. Even then, Toph (all five feet of her) would vastly prefer being called \"huge\" or \"gigantic\". Whenever she'd pick up the gossip whispered behind her generously wide back with her acute hearing, she absolutely loved when \"pudgy\" and \"chubby\" got drowned out by \"big as a house!\" and \"mammoth!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph's small body had swelled and swelled, placing her in the neighborhood of 175 pounds. For a girl of her height, that much poundage smothered every aspect of her body with a thick slab of fat. Of course, her stomach, which was nearing her knees, was the star attraction. Her baggy green shirt was now skin tight, and still released two inches or so of her snowy-looking flesh to exposure to the outside world. Perhaps more impressive was how wide her stomach was; Toph's upper legs pushed against the curtain of flesh as she walked, so often mid stride she would switch to a waddle, or if she was able to, a little earthbending mobility that required no actual movement of her body aside from a few hand gestures (which Toph found tedious with the bulk that had swallowed up her upper arms, but at least her stomach didn't get in the way...much). Her new chin was a thick U-shaped slab under the natural contour of her face. Whenever Toph turned her head, excess flesh would push to the left or to the right, slightly reducing her head's range of motion. Toph was thankful for her crystal-clear vibrational vision, as if she tried to look down with her eyes, she was sure her double chin would stop part of the effort and her belly would obscure whatever visibility she'd have left. Her lower body was thicker, but Toph guessed one of Katara's legs was almost (but not quite, thanks to Toph's devotion to her gluttony) thick enough to account for both of hers. All in all, Toph's body was wide, almost round, and very cumbersome. Her stomach stopped her from scooting her chairs too close to tables, which frustrated Toph as much as being expected to sit on something like a stool frustrated Katara. Of course, Toph had no problems with just sitting on the floor and eating, legs beginning to splay to make room for her stomach fat. It was the position she had assumed after making sure Suki was properly gorged to gobble up all remaining \"leftovers\" (Toph rarely made it possible to truly run out of food, even before she started working on Suki). It was also the position in which Katara and Ty Lee found her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara stomped over to Toph quickly, causing plate-rattling vibrations on the nearby table. Toph could feel that Katara had, like her, put on a few since their first night at Kiyoshi Island.<br>\r\nShe steeled herself for a tongue-lashing, but instead received an extremely level tone of voice from her friend. \"I don't need to repeat myself. I think Ty Lee's probably too fat to get cured by now, and Suki didn't sound any better, from her description.\" The acrobat chimed in, slightly offended. \"Hey, I've gained like, half a pound at most! Look, I can still do a cartwheel!\" Ty Lee steadied herself, rocked her upper body back and forth, giving her chest a small, rhythmic bounce, and then stumbled a bit, resting her hand on a wall. Ty Lee frowned. \"I'll show you guys when I haven't eaten in a while, I can't do it on a full stomach.\" Ty Lee bent over into a nearby bag, giving Katara a look at her now doubly-wide buttocks, and picked up a danish to nosh on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara put a hand on her cheek shook her head. Turning her attention back to Toph, she calmly explained her plans for Azula's manhunt. Toph raised an eyebrow. \"Y'know, that's a good idea. If she can \"fix\" us, I want no part of it, but I've always wanted a real peace of her, especially with my new bending strength!\" Katara nodded, not wanting to say anything to revoke the first agreement they've had that wasn't steak-related in a long time. Ty Lee, who had finished her danish and had taken to sucking on her fingers one-by-one, also gave her assent. \"If she looks anything like you guys, she's probably sitting on defenseless townsfolk while pillaging towns of their candy supplies. She's a meanie when she's trying to carry out one of her little plans.\" Suki, hearing Katara's voice, wandered into the kitchen, hair mussed and feet bare. \"I'm coming with you, and so are some of the Kiyoshi warriors; we've gotten good at hunting down that particular menace, I think. Katara's eyes widened; she'd never seen Suki so slovenly before. She also noticed her shoulders and head were inclined slightly past her waist; Suki was slouching! Katara figured it had something to do with her figure,a generous gut and wide, heavy looking breasts, but Toph was quite large around the middle, and even she had the presence of mind to put in the slightest bit of extra effort to hold herself upright. \"Of course you both can come. I want you all to review these supply lists; I ordered plenty of food, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls simultaneously darted for the list in Katara's hands. Toph got there first and tried to snatch the list, with the intention of impatiently holding it up for someone to read out loud to her. Ty Lee had already started to demand an array of sweets, and wanted desperately to write \"lots of bags of sugar!!!, Oh and sugarcane!\" across Katara's neatly printed items. Suki realized cheese might not have shown up on the list, which was now unacceptable to her. All three girls had plowed into Katara, resulting in a rather gassy, wriggling pileup, the force of which knocked a potted plant from the kitchen windowsill. Toph had rolled across Katara's back, making her buck under her weight, pushing her rear the highest into the air as she tried to get her upper body to lift against Toph's stomach, which was now resting on her head! Ty Lee, who had tripped and kneed Katara in the side, fallen into Toph and had pressed her chest into her face. Suki had been almost been thrown clear of the wreckage, but was close enough to dig her hands into one of Katara's generous butt cheeks as a handhold to help her get to her feet. Her shirt had ridden up, revealing her jutting stomach. She couldn't help but cringe a little at the smell; being anywhere close to Katara's butt was comparable to being behind a particularly flatulent mother elephant. However, noticing Katara's ponderous rear end had compressed and adhered to a greasy piece of ham, she couldn't help but peel it off and indulge, her slouch returning once she finally righted herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee spoke first after the human crash. \"Girls , I wish I could say you all look and smell better up close, but I think we should just put the list on the table. No huddling over it either!\" Toph chose this moment to belch into Ty Lee's cleavage, releasing a noise that sounded much like a raspberry and sending a ripple through her chest's fat reserves. Ty Lee jumped back, a little startled by the force of Toph's point-blank belch. </span></div></div>",

Cancel their supply orders and get me my armor!\u201d   Zuko\u2019s vehemence was enough to prompt Mai to stroll almost lazily into the chamber, barring his exit from the room directly in front of the doorway.  Her voice had little more enthusiasm than her body language.  \u201cSo\u2026you\u2019re going off to stop Azula from taking over the fire nation.\u201d  Zuko stopped short and raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou can put it that way.

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As  Zuko and Mai discussed their options, the outskirts of the fire nation were burning to the ground.  The aged, pristine forest in which Aang and Co. had thwarted the rebel Jet\u2019s terrorism against an Earth Kingdom settlement had become immolated, the flames spreading so quickly that in a few moments the sight of the conflagration would be visible to anyone in the surrounding geography who happened to glance in the forest\u2019s direction.  The wall of flame seemed to malevolently wall off the previously-threatened earth kingdom settlement, denying its inhabitants escape in either direction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the flames stood still.  The smoke seemed to die down, making the fire harder to see from a distance. The fire itself did not extinguish; the forest town was still encircled by a noose of hungry flame. While the town had been heavily flooded during Aang, Katara and co\u2019s encounter with Jet, the state of peace that existed since the defeat of Ozai and Azula had allowed for a speedy reconstruction. The town had grown quite populous with Earth Kingdom citizens who grew tired of  city life, but were not inured to living in a desert or port town.  As Azula stepped out of the burning foliage into the town, she was glad for this.  Amongst the crowd she could glimpse potbellied diplomats and doughy housewives, fearfully clutching the arms and shoulders of pudgy, spoiled children.  The last town she had hit had been closer to the desert, its inhabitants largely miners and explorers. When she and her followers had scoured the town for crops and virtually anything else edible, they found barely enough sustenance to qualify as a successful raid. However much Azula delighted in seeing an entire town\u2019s population cower in fear and flee before her might, if she wasn\u2019t able to find a way to get any fatter from the venture, it was a self-indulgent waste of time as far as she was concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of Azula stepping through the archway into town added to the surrealism of static ring of burning trees; unless the lone, armored girl approaching the frightened populace was fantastically strong, she should not have been able to step so surely and so quickly, as she appeared almost too fat to stand, let alone march.  While the sight invited puzzlement, the approaching figure also very much radiated malicious intent.  The town watch, a dozen soldiers led by a trio of earthbenders, stepped forward in warning to the invader.  When she raised a hand and began a bending gesture, the guards quickly sent a flurry of arrows punctuated by a hail of razor-sharp rocks manipulated by the bending guardsmen.  Without breaking stride, a gout of blue flame leapt from the porcine girl\u2019s lips, filling the cone of space directly in front of her with roaring flame that was  not only stopping the arrows by setting their shafts aflame but incinerating everything that had been directed towards her; not even the rock remained when the fiery breath dissipated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain of the guard, having once seen a truly powerful firebender during his tour of duty in the Earth Kingdom military, shouted to the nearby townspeople to flee towards the southern walls as quickly as possible, then ordered his men to fall back, confident a direct encounter would be the end of them. <br>\r\nBy the time the town scattered, Azula had reached the settlement\u2019s main plaza, where the soldiers had launched their assault from.  Putting a hand to the generous sac of fat that had replaced her chin, she clicked her tongue. \u201cI need to widen my breastplate again\u2026though that was effective\u2026if not completely dignified.\u201d  Unbeknownst to the town guard, the deadly-hot fire breath she had produced had in fact been an unintentional belch. The tightness of her otherwise perfectly-sized armor around her midriff did not help with the frequency of these outbursts, though if she concentrated she could typically avoid sending forth a gout of fiery death from her lips (or, if she wasn\u2019t careful, her hindquarters).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese unintentional bouts of firebending were a testament to the effectiveness of her newfound calorie-bending.  She could use her own body\u2019s caloric  reserves to amplify her bending powers, even going so far as to manipulating the metabolic processes in her body.  Her body\u2019s muscles were still those of her fit and lean physique, unused to carrying extra weight. By burning up calories at a faster rate however, she found she could renew her body\u2019s endurance. Her muscles were constantly refreshed and regenerated, though simply standing now burnt calories as if she was engaged in a brisk run.  Azula was confident she could create a fireball strong enough to breach the nigh-impenetrable outer wall of Ba Sing Se, but doing so would likely leech two hundred pounds of body fat from her frame in a matter of seconds. Such power was intoxicating but short lived\u2026unless she had a very, very large supply of calories.  <br>\r\nThat was why Azula had begun to ravage town after town, port after port. She would shed a few pounds crushing any resistance and spreading fear and confusion amongst the populace, much as she had done today with her forest fire (control of which had already whisked away ten pounds of precious softness from her body, but did little to alleviate her painfully tight armor) then take back her investment in force by stripping the settlement of any and all edible materials, cooking cattle into steaks where they stood and pouring entire bags of sugar down her gullet one after the other,  too consumed by her new bending style to ever feel anything close to contentment with how much she had eaten.  By the time she was through she\u2019d be several pounds heavier than when she began, sometimes managing to swell by nearly one hundred pounds.  Getting to her ideal weight was harder than this would indicate, however. She\u2019d often lose twenty pounds simply traveling from place to place as it took more and more energy to keep her body mobile. Even with this caviat, Azula\u2019s  natural cunning had allowed to her balloon to over 500 pounds using these tactics. The fugitive princess knew she needed to be much, much heftier to ensure a clean victory against the combined forces of the Fire nation military, her traitorous family and friends, and the Avatar, bolstered by his gaggle of followers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of growing so large troubled Azula not one whit; it was simple fact that her beauty was unparalleled. If she chose to drape herself in a few extra thousand pounds, every ounce would amplify her regal beauty. <br>\r\nWhere things stood now, her rear end doubled Katara\u2019s in width, supported by thighs that put tree trunks to shame (Azula knew this well, as she often found herself  having to squeeze her majestic legs between two closely situated trees just to have a way to move through the forest). Before today\u2019s attack, Azula noticed she could now grab a thick handful of fat from her ankles, of all places. Of course, it wasn\u2019t surprising considering the pace at which the rest of her \u201cbeauty\u201d had been developing.   If it were not for the extra energy she was expending bracing her muscles, her breasts would leave her Azula nearly unable to walk in their own right. They rested in her armor, jutting forward with her stomach, the rigid lining of her crimson chestplate keeping them from simply resting against her gut, instead pressing them together and keeping them relatively supported, sculpting a cleavage line that likely outstripped a foot in length.  Her arms had thickened past what even the most well-muscled earthbender could ever hope to achieve, creating delicate wings of hanging flab whenever she raised her arms. Her elbows had disappeared into delicate creases several days ago, lagging behind the disappearance of her knees. Her stomach had widened, then drooped, unwilling to completely overthrow dominance of her hips in terms of width, choosing instead to sprout generous lovehandles then venture outward, never achieving the jut and heft  of Toph\u2019s midsection in favor of a thick, flawless  curtain of jelly that hung like an apron over her upper thighs.  Her footfalls often cracked the delicate tile of the bakeries and restaurants she raided. Azula had come to love the sound of her heavy footfalls; to her, the bassy crashing rhythm spoke of power.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her generous bulk, Azula had  appeared at every invasion fully armored, clad in a deep burgundy and gold one-piece suit of that covered the entirety of her truly massive rear end and even managed to gently wrap around her stomach with an extra extension of the plating  that was separate from the \u201cskirt\u201d portion protecting her hips and upper thighs. Underneath this she wore massive crimson-dyed silk garments that covered her arms and legs completely, sewn from the entirety of a looted bolt of cloth.  Her armor was custom-made, a series of interlocking metal strips and hexagons bound together by tiny catches. Using a special tool that \u201cunlocked\u201d an armor segment through an almost imperceptible slot on its face, she could undo an offending portion of her armor and reconnect tit with wider angles, allowing space for yet more armor strips.  The end result was protective gear that cradled her body perfectly, growing bigger and bigger with her body. She had held a fire nation metalworker\u2019s family hostage, denying him sleep and food for over 24 hours until she was sure she had enough armor-tiles to make twenty normal breastplates.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nAzula did not hesitate long in the town square. Even as she stood she felt her precious fat stores slowly leeching away. It would take days before her body would noticeably begin to slim down in this manner, but the thought of her power bleeding out, squandered on keeping her standing and holding up all her beauty, was maddening. Azula knew her discomfort would be short lived, however,  for as she gleefully devoured every last consumable worth a calorie within the town\u2019s confines, adding pound after pound of bending fuel to her body, she would be paving the way to a world whose sole purpose was keeping her fed. She wouldn\u2019t have to spend any calories at all; the throne room of the Fire Nation\u2019s palace would be filled with cushions and become her new throne. The civilized world would grow rail-thin as they labored in fear and awe, providing Phoenix Lord Azula with her Endless Feast.  Grinning to herself, she awaited the arrival of those loyal to her, so that she may properly pluck and devour her newest fruit of victory.  The hunger that came with her bending style was a powerful thing, and if properly administered, Azula found it was more effective than outright mind control; any young lady she brought under her spell would stare longingly at her obese body, willing to do whatever she asked in return for a seat at her endless feast once she was in power.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapidly, a pack young women around Azula\u2019s age, armored as well as their eclectically out-of-shape bodies would allow,  had followed Azula into the town, fanning out to begin a pillage.  The entirety of the group had been \u201cbroken\u201d by Azula using a combination of intimidation, overwhelming bending prowess, and a desire to indulge their newfound gluttony. All of them had once tried to stop her, or had the misfortune of being in her way during her travels. Watching their plump bodies disappear into the city,  Azula knew that if she wasn\u2019t around, her little raiding party would indulge a bit on their own as they started gathering up food for her. While she didn\u2019t want her troops getting too fat too quickly, knowing only the firebenders in the group would have any ability to artificially enhance their mobility with her bending techniques, she knew they would surely lash out at her if they weren\u2019t able to indulge their growing inclination towards gluttony in some small way.  Even under Azula\u2019s watchful eye, the most seasoned of her raiders were getting rather porcine; former Earth Kingdom soldiers who had been with her since her escape from Ba Sing Se had been on enough successful raids to swell themselves into obesity. Some were almost half as fat as Azula, which was, by all means, an accomplishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with how smooth the raid was going and the prospective size of her coming meal, Azula indulged in a drawn-out gust of flatulence. For all of her willpower and bodily control, she couldn\u2019t help but enjoy the sensation, especially with her armor needing an alteration, the metal plates pressing uncomfortably into her stomach through her silks. Her eyes flicked to a now-abandoned restaurant across the plaza. She set off on a brisk march, the swaying of her rear end hidden by her armor. A dull swoosh-thud accompanied each step as her thighs rubbed against each other intensely, then gently struck the underside of her armored belly.  As Azula grew closer and closer to the first bite of her city-spanning binge, her regal composure began to crack.  Distracted by the sweet smells of coffee and fresh-baked bread wafting from the eatery, Azula\u2019s caloriebending began to slip from lack of concentration. Her breathing became more and more audible, eventually becoming gasps as she grew increasingly out of breath.  Beads of sweat began to sparkle on her forehead, and she unconsciously began licking her lips as her mouth flooded with saliva. She practically stumbled into the restaurant, stopping to rest against a wooden table, nearly snapping it in two with her bulk. As her back flared with pain from holding up so much weight, Azula refocused her bending, waddling into the kitchen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restaurant was picked clean in ten minutes flat. By the time Azula stumbled out from the establishment, her thighs holding  her in place for one maddening moment at the doorframe, several barrels of butter, salt, and sugar had been located and placed in the plaza so that Azula, half-senseless with hunger, would not grow displeased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nAfter two hours of feasting, Azula couldn\u2019t take it anymore.  \u201cSomeone pull their face from their trough and unclasp my armor for me!\u201d Azula\u2019s hands were otherwise occupied with bending a light flame over a basin filled with sticks of butter, melting the sticks into over a gallon of fatty oil.   \u201cIf I don\u2019t get some help right now I\u2019ll consider it an assassination attempt! It\u2019s practically strangling me!\u201d  Her orders sent saliva flying from her lips, her cheeks and chins remaining quivering long after she stopped barking at the half-dozen girls who had completed their food collecting jobs and had taken to gobbling down whatever food they could before Azula inevitably reached their pile.   A shapely, but noticeably overweight figure rose up from behind Azula and deftly unclasped her armor, freeing an ocean of crimson-wrapped flab. Azula\u2019s breasts fell heavily onto her stomach with a wet slap, no longer pressed together by the unyielding metal of the breastplate.  Her entire garment was saturated with sweat, deepening the reds of her outfit to a near-black. Azula sighed with pleasure, letting more noxious air vent from her rear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t pay or feed me enough to be your handmaiden.\u201d  June, a bounty hunter once tasked with capturing the Avatar, rounded Azula\u2019s bulk to make eye contact.  Azula grunted, unhappy that someone\u2019s insolence was between  her and  her current bowl of butter. She had sat down in front of the pile of food and deactivated her bending as well, which did not help with her patience; she was riotously hungry, and without her bending control she just couldn\u2019t stop sweating. June returned Azula\u2019s icy stare with the eye that wasn\u2019t covered by her waterfall of raven-black hair, letting out a gong-strike of a belch as she did so.  \u201cI\u2019m taking a few extra bags of sugar, okay? I still don\u2019t know what you did to me, but I need them to scratch an itch.\u201d  June gestured to her double-belted leather vest. One belt had snapped long ago, the other creating a monstrous muffin top around a midriff that seemed to be dying to escape. Despite this, her gut did not dominate her figure; that job was left to her breasts. Despite only gaining about a hundred pounds in Azula\u2019s service so far, they had already begun to pull downward, too weighty to rest perkily in her clothes.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula\u2019s temper flared as June turned away from her, displaying her meaty but not oversized buttocks and thick (impressively so, for someone so top-heavy) thighs. From within the generous flesh of her face, the firebender\u2019s voice turned remarkably icy.  \u201cYou\u2019re working for me because you can\u2019t stop eating, and because I overpowered you and burnt the noise hairs off that disgusting animal you ride around.<i> You\u2019re \u2018working\u2019 for me because you would be a pathetic wreck without me by now</i>!\u201d   June stopped and turned. A hint of sadness played across her relatively slender face, but was quickly erased by her long training as a bounty-hunter. She tried to act natural by using a plump arm to wipe some sweat off her forehead  before  giving her damp armpit a sniff. She then turned back to Azula.  \u201cTrue, but you can\u2019t deny it. Even with all this extra weight, I took care of those guards after you scared them away with your\u2026uuuuuraaap\u2026womanly charms.\u201d June fanned the air in front of her own face, partly for emphasis, partly because she realized she kind of smelt bad nowadays. Azula snorted (this expression came very easily to her at this point).  \u201cThe less work I do, the faster we win our eternal gluttony. Take your bag of sugar, and if you use that tone with me again, I will show you the true extent of my \u2018Womanly Charms\u2019 as you call them.\u201d   Azula mimed blowing June a kiss, letting a lightning-fast fireball escape her lips as she brought her hand away, caramelizing a the bag of sugar that June had been (awkwardly) bending down to pick up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026still good\u2026\u201d June simply uttered, her expression unfazed.  Grabbing the smoldering hunk of gooey sugar and using her prodigious strength to cram her cream-colored breasts deeper into her leather vest,  June began enjoying her spoils of war as a delightful river of butter washed down Azula\u2019s gullet. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In addition to Katara, Toph, Ty Lee, and Suki,  fifteen Kiyoshi warriors were rounded up by their commander.  Suki managed to reassume her aura of leadership to assign the Kiyoshi warriors a job rotation on the ship, then set them to work as the steamer un-docked. This was not before Suki declared that keeping a ship running was difficult in full body armor, and declared that the frontal plate armor worn by the Kiyoshi would only be mandatory if they were warned of an approaching, unknown vessel. As her charges dispersed, Suki let her posture curve into a slouch, and unbuckled her breastplate, her gelatinous gut no longer in a vise. Suki then waddled up to Toph, who had taken several fifty-pound blocks of clay aboard and was busy bending them into a recliner.  Toph lifted up her green shirt over her belly after realizing it was only covering half of it anyway in a reclining position. Suki wondered how Toph was capable of walking...or even if she was. She walked up the ramp to the ship, sure, but she took breaks and often leaned against Katara (Much to her chagrin, but she wasn't moving any faster, albeit without leaning on things). Toph used her earthbending to haul herself  around Kiyoshi in the days following the letter's return to Zuko, sometimes supporting her gut with a mobile shelf of rock, other times just plopping herself down and letting a wave of earth ferry her about. Katara, often lagging behind her and sweating bullets, chastised Toph plenty for not getting any exercise, but Toph was never the most attentive when it came to corrective advice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph sluggishly shifted on her makeshift throne. \"Heya Suki.\"  Suddenly, a coil of moving clay appeared behind her and shaped itself into a wide, plush looking chair. The clay on the seat, arms, and back was bended so that it was just slightly soft, leaving the softness coating Suki's body unmolested by sharp corners or hard surfaces. Suki guessed Toph's throne was also Mattress-soft.  She put her feet up, and Toph produced a clay footstool within a second.  Knife-thin clay fans began to hover around Toph's bloated frame, fanning her face, chins, and the peak of her belly, which was large enough to partially shield Toph from the sun.  The fans kept a steady stream of Toph B.O. coming her way, especially when she got gassy or when the fans approached her feet, but even that was growing on her.  \"So,  I've gotta say, you really are packing it away lately, Suki!  I thought you'd put up more of a fight.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki thought fondly about the fifteen additional pounds she had put on just while the supplies were being delivered. \"Well, all my life things have been discipline, discipline, discipline. When I saw Katara so big, I realized that there was no way letting myself go a little would ruin my life. So, here we are!\"  Toph grinned. \"You took to it like a duck to water! Open wide!\"  A floating clay bowl began to tip a pile of chocolate-covered vegetables into Suki's mouth. Suki cringed a little. \"Veggies?\"   Toph cocked a thumb in the general direction of the supply hold. \"Katara is still trying to get me to drop a few.  Anything that didn't want to make you lick your fingers afterwards I doused in chocolate. I figured you might be able to stomach some of it before I order it all thrown overboard, that way we can pick up more lard at the next port. Waste not!\" <br>\r\nSuki shrugged. \"Well the chocolate's good...\"  \"-It's extra rich!\"  Ty Lee called from across the deck, enjoying some of the choco-veggies herself.  Suki let a grunt of flatulence out. Ty Lee had also put on a good 15 pounds, but her hips and chest swelled faster than her belly, making her look thick but perhaps less bulky than she really was. \"...but it gives me gas.\"   Toph emitted a belch of her own. \"You know you're doing something right when <i>everything</i> starts giving you gas!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Katara was cursing herself. She wanted to be mad at Suki and Ty Lee for gaining so much weight in just two days, but she had thrown on nearly thirty pounds after she had sent the supply letter away. It was legitimately difficult to walk, bordering on painful for her leg muscles. She kept at it, but it definitely wasn't helping her figure. If anything, the futile attempt at exercise only fueled her appetite. She wondered if she could even do anything now to stop herself or Toph from completely losing themselves to their new-found desires. Katara felt numb whenever she wasn't eating, and truthfully she had hundreds of opportunities to bathe in Kiyoshi; its just that the thought of soap scum and scalding water washing away the lubricating coating of sweat from her body or exposing her nostrils to air that wasn't infused with her own body's concoctions had managed to become disgusting to her. She also took a quiet joy in letting herself be freely flatulent; every time she passed gas, it was as if she was a little lighter, and her stomach that much less achy. Thinking of all this, for the first time, she looked on at Toph with admiration rather than disgust.  It really was quite nice to lay around, no matter how quickly it would disintegrate muscle,  and really there was no problem with being a little...pungent if everyone around you didn't care....Katara tried to pull herself out of her daydream, realizing her urges were taking over again when she began to envy Toph's belly, wondering how much she would need to eat to get it that big and soft and...hilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara bit her lip. \"Gotta get a grip....I guess I have no choice, time to gorge a bit more, shut these urges down for a little...\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The steamer was a week into its journey, and for the sailors and Kiyoshi warriors accompanying Katara, Toph, Suki, and Ty Lee on their hunt for Azula,  the upper cabins of the steamer ship were fast becoming the only tolerable place to rest. Many of the lower holds had been packed wall-to-wall with crates of food, Even though the main cabins were more spacious, Toph and co. taking up residence in a few was enough to make the entire level foul smelling and uncomfortable. Most of the time they were also choked with smoke from the near-constant food preparation taking place in the galley and on the main deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one Kiyoshi warrior in particular, the whole setup was borderline unbearable.  Liu, a short, almost ghostly-looking enlistee of 15, had to blink back tears whenever her shift for patrol or food transport was up. Being an exceptionally lithe and patient, she was often the first assigned to scouting duty and the last for any head-on confrontations. The work made her willowy arms pulse with burning pain, and more often than not she was seasick and prone to skipping meals, which only made her constitution worse. She didn't want to blame her best friend, but she definitely did not jump at the opportunity to board the ship when it was presented by commander Suki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them having left Kiyoshi,  her closest friend  and fellow warrior Song, two years her senior, insisted they take the opportunity to see the world. Song wasn't much more imposingly built than Liu,  but her sun-kissed skin, bright hazel eyes, and shoulder-length, slightly tangled brown hair instantly marked her as the more assertive of the pair; Liu's inky-black bangs covered part of her face when not clipped up for duty, and she had a bad habit of staring at her feet when not at attention.  It had been Song's idea to go on the trip, but Liu knew that she only suggested it because she thought they both would enjoy time away from Kiyoshi Island.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiu grit her teeth and marched down to the main floor to meet Song before going to work hefting crates of provisions up to the main deck. What little color she did have drained from her cheeks as she inhaled the smoke, salt, and lingering flatulence in the air of the main holds. Song, possessing a sounder constitution, was quick to strike up a conversation. \"So, Rou Lan and Wen were ordered off their night shifts, so I'm stuck hauling boxes for the next four hours.\"  Liu's eyes widened. \"How did that happen? And I'm sorry to say it but better you than me, I would keel over hour three.\"   Song gave a dismissing hand gesture.  \"When I asked them in the flesh, they just shrugged at me and gave this -annoying- little giggle. They must have weaseled an early lunch out of the commander too, I saw them waltzing down to the kitchens. \"    A large wave pounded the side of the steamer, and Liu's stomach gave a little flip.  \"....Don't talk to me about lunch break.\" Liu murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a back-breaking two hours of hauling up butter and preserved meat, Liu's shift was over. \"I'm heading up to my cabin Song, want me to bring you something to drink while you finish your double-shift?\"   Song, slightly winded but still in command of her wiry strength, shook her head. \"Nah. This is what we get for stopping to take on even more supplies at Omashu for two days; what is our commander thinking? Urgh, anyway, I'll be up when I'm done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiu was beginning to drift into a sound, exhaustion-fueled  sleep when the door to her cabin gently swung open.  \"Hey Liu, I figured out how to get those extra breaks from the commander!\"  sang Song's voice from the doorway, after a little belch. </span></div></div>",

Even at night multiple cookfires were active, giving Liu no relief.  \"At least let me get my overcoat back on Song, I'm just in my bedtime clothes!\"  Liu's quiet voice was muffled by the sound of a large amount of meat sizzling blasting from the galley doors at the end of the hall.  Song finished the fried bread she had been munching on as she lead Liu down into the ship.  \"That smells so good!\"  she couldn't help but utter.   Liu felt a stab of anxiety. \"Song, you hate meat! You've been on a steady veggies and fish diet since you were seven...\"  Song seemed reluctant to speak for a moment, then shrugged. \"I dunno. Acquired a taste for it today, I guess.  The commander's been spreading the word that capturing Azula won't be any trouble at all since she dosen't have any nation's military backing, so she's been encouraging us all to let loose a little. You just need to let Ty Lee adjust some pressure points to help with circulation, and you get full access to the galley, plus half shifts!\"   Liu noticed they were heading toward the upper deck, where commander Suki, Ty Lee, and her rather heavy friends were fond of staying. \"This doesn't sound like the commander, Song..\"  A voice she recognized answered before Song did.  \"Suki's turned over a new leaf!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing in from the deck was Fei Lin, an older Kiyoshi warrior  who could kick like a mule and out-eat most of the men on Kiyoshi Island.  She had always been a tall, muscular, and slightly thick-waisted girl, but the Fei Lin that stood before her now was far bigger than the girl of recent memory.  Her already somewhat round face and thick thighs had widened severely, and the bottom of her stomach, which resembled a big, squishy pillow stuffed underneath her robe, had become so tight she could see her bellybutton through the cloth.   The large girl's silverish eyes darted to Song.  \"Woah, looking good there!\" Fei Lin stepped forward and gave Song's stomach a slap. It was only then that Liu noticed her friend seemed to have eaten to the point of pushing her stomach out, making a distinct shape inside her loosely fitting sailor's shirt.  Her look of approval died swiftly when her eyes turned to Liu.   Fei Lin stepped into Liu's path, putting her face to face with a pair of swollen, heavy looking breasts.  Liu's back hurt just looking at them.  \"You better go see Ty Lee fast, before you're given <i>all</i> the extra work we're being relieved of!\"  Liu found that Fei Lin smelled strongly of perspiration and fried food. Her breath was no more fragrant.  \"Hey, lay off her Fei Lin, she's gonna go now!\"   Fei Lin belched into the air, gave Song a nod, and hefted her new, more cumbersome body down into the bowels of the ship.  Liu blushed watching her weighty rear end heave back and forth through her robe as she  descended the nearby set of stairs to the holds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSong cracked open the door to the deck. It was dark, but torches and hanging lamps had illuminated the front deck. A cool breeze danced through the hall, but the \"fresh\" air smelt of grease and salt, and did little to calm Liu's churning stomach.  \"Listen, Song, I'm not feeling so good, I'll see her tomorrow morning!\"  Song put a fist to her mouth to belch.  \" -Urpmgh- Well, whatever you want Liu, here's hoping you don't get morning watch!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     Liu absolutely did not  visit Ty Lee the next morning. In fact, she had purposely avoided that doorway for two days now. Fearful by nature, her mind darted to the most fatal scenarios. The commander, normally so fast to get a new recruit into fighting shape, was letting more and more of her command off their duties. What could be the reason for this? What were so many of the Avatar's former companions doing on a fire nation steamer without the Avatar himself?  Azula had reportedly kept the commander locked up as a prisoner under her personal watch during the war; could Suki, upon hearing of her escape, become overwhelmed psychologically? Was the entire steamer to be delivered to Azula, once everyone aboard the ship was bedridden, shoving food into their faces with arms that had so much fat and so little muscle that they struggled to transfer handfuls of bacon and pastries to gaping, slobbering mouths?The idea of it was ridiculous...a week ago, before she saw Suki's friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon their arrival aboard the ship, Liu knew Katara and Toph had gained a monstrous amount of weight since their victory over the Fire Lord, but she wouldn't deny their  right to a life of leisure after putting their lives at risk for so long, after fighting so hard. She almost envied them; they had become heroes, and let their bodies make sure the world knew that they had paid whatever debt to society they may have had, and were now occupied solely with enjoying life.  That life was not for her, however. She had always wanted to make a difference in the world. She needed something practical. She ended up turning her back from the family bakery to enlist in the Kiyoshi warriors. It was her life's purpose to stay in prime physical condition to be able to uphold order and keep her family safe from harm.  Liu wondered if she would feel the same way if she had made her goal in life perpetuating the family business; if she didn't join the warriors and instead chose to help her family, would she let herself grow a little softer every day on mouth-watering pastries as a reward for her hard work?  The more responsibilities her older sister Lan Wen took on at the bakery, the closer she came to being able to fit in their mother's dresses. Even little Kaien, turning 12 next month, was growing in a tummy as she became an expert at frosting the many cakes and buns that they nurtured into dessert perfection every morning. While Liu patrolled the island in the cold seaside mornings, the rest of her family were sipping through mugs of drinking chocolate and sopping up the dregs with warm breakfast rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiu thought her plump (-ing) family was perfectly natural given their occupation, but now, she was starting to see <i>warriors</i> with  baker's bodies.  She heard whispers about how large the commander was becoming, but she was too fearful to go see for herself. What was she going to do, tell off her commanding officer?   The thought of Commander Suki weakening up the ship for Azula kept crossing Liu's mind, but she just couldn't bring herself to voice her fears to other Kiyoshi Warriors. It was becoming harder to look for clues as well; she had been assigned an extra  half-hour of daily work both nights after Song had tried to bring her to Suki and Ty Lee.   Song herself hadn't come up to visit Liu in her cabin again, and was no longer spotted at work. The only time Liu saw her since that night was in the mess hall, and even then she didn't try and speak to her. Song was sitting at table packed with gorging Kiyoshi Warriors. Song had looked up from her honey-drizzled moo-sow and gave Liu a friendly wave. Liu would have sat with her to eat, but there were a number of ample rear ends at the table, which made it difficult to locate a spot to squeeze in. Liu tried not to look at her friend too closely, lest she notice fuller cheeks or  a more jutting bosom pressing at her shirt. <br>\r\n--- <br>\r\nLiu's paranoia hit an unbearable crescendo three days later.  After a back-breaking 7 hours of duty, Liu only wished to stumble through the smoky bowels of the ship to get up to her cabin. However, before she could get out of the supply holds, she heard shouting. After a minute of navigating past crates of salted bacon and preserved butter, she spotted Eyri, a 16 year old Kiyoshi Warrior who Liu was now very familiar with; they had both found their workloads swelling by the day, and had taken to trading shifts when one was too tired to work with the heavy boxes of the cargo hold in exchange for a less strenuous job, such as kitchen duty (though the number of dirty plates seemed to multiply by a power of 2 every day, and the never-ending cooking made the air nearly un-breathable) When Liu found her, she had tears streaming down her face. Her confusion was quickly slaked as an even heftier Fei Lin stepped into view, flanked by Athe, a soft spoken and elegant Warrior of 18 years, known for her knack for hurling war fans with accuracy, her noble upbringing that could be noticed through her polite speech, and her head of  beautiful silver hair which flowed down to her hips. (Which had widened considerably since Liu last saw her.)  At Fei Lin's left hand was Song.   Fei Lin looked like she had run out of clothes that fit her; she was clad in her green robe, which was open and revealing her undergarments, which were barely holding in sac-like breasts and a stomach that hung down enough to gently slap itself into her body when she walked, undulating slightly.   Song was more conservatively dressed, except for a big, round stomach which had  escaped the confines of her shirt. Song's body reminded Liu a little of her older sister's. While Song was slimmer, she had a coating of fat everywhere, giving her form a sense of wideness and inertia. Fei Lin licked her lips.  \"We've been waiting <i>fifteen minutes</i> for the salt pork! We got so hungry we came down here ourselves, and here we find you, lazing around, half asleep!\"   Eyri shook her head; her copper-colored bangs flopped a bit.  \" I was just so exhausted; I've been at this for hours!\"  Fei Lin grabbed her by the shoulder, bringing herself close enough to ram Eyri slim body with her gut. \"All I know is that I'm hungry, and you abandoned your duty of keeping the main floor well-stocked.\"   Fei Lin waddled toward the crate in question, which looked to have been slid across the floor in an attempt to push it to the stairs. Fei Lin's flabby arms strained to slide the lid off. When the smell hit her, she immediately began stuffing its contents past her plump lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[[ <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/2043/avaslob3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/2043/...</a> ]]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiu glanced back to Eyri, who was now pinned to the floor - Athe was sitting on her!   Eyri was pressed to the floor by a considerable pair of buttocks, growing out past her delicate but girthy thighs.Athe's face was expressionless, as if she were doing a boring chore.. Softly, she explained the necessity of what she was doing: \" You've been very silly for not going to see Ty Lee yet...all this exertion will make you just barbaric in time, all rough and full of  callouses. You need to start to enjoy staying put. I'm sorry if I'm a bit heavy, but t I tend to put on the most weight in my rear, so my weight should be nicely distributed across your body, I'm obviously not trying to hurt you, just practicing what I preach. You'd barely  feel this if you were a little heavier yourself, you know. Also, please excuse our flatulence. We can't help ourselves, but it really turns out to be a lovely sensation after a bit.\"   Eyri was red in the face, too shocked to respond.  Song grabbed a crate of her own and brought it upstairs, pretending not to notice Eyri's little punishment, which Liu thought was downright wrong; Song always stood up to bullies.   Liu watched from the shadows, numb to the resolution: the trio grabbed crates of food, leaving a gasping Eyri on the floor. Before Liu could bring herself to approach, Eyri was running up the nearest flight of steps, weeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Liu saw Eyri sitting with Song, Fei Lin, and Athe at their sagging mess hall table the next evening, laughing at Song's jokes and gobbling down pudding with chocolate chunks embedded in it, Liu knew it was time for a confrontation. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liu gathered all the courage she could muster, ate more than she should have for breakfast out of fear that she would faint in a panic during the confrontation, then proceeded to march out onto the decks.  The waifish Kiyoshi warrior pondered what Katara and Toph now looked like.. She had seen Toph and Katara when they boarded the steamer, and they were already a sight to behold. What surprised Liu most was how cumbersomely they walked, as if their flab was finally outstripping their muscle, making each step strenuous exercise. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img508.imageshack.us/img508/1083/avafatties.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img508.imageshack.us/img508/1083/...</a><br>\r\nBut now? It had been two weeks. Ty Lee and the Commander were also always up there...could they be eating as much as the bulky pair she watched feed on the endless offerings brought up from the lower deck?  Liu bounded through the corridor and into the sunlight of the main deck. <br>\r\n----<br>\r\nKatara watched another one of Suki's soldiers get approached by Ty Lee, whose physical condition had deteriorated immensely since they boarded, but was still eager to perform her favorite new ki block on willing young ladies who could still see their feet. Every time she watched one pick up her bad habits, she felt a pang of guilt down in the depths of her gut, momentarily distinguishable from the gnawing hunger. Katara had shoveled far more high fat, high carb, low nutrition meals into her waiting stomach than she could care to admit these last two weeks, but every meal had been the pinnacle of restraint. She would never let herself indulge as much as she wanted, and as a result her body swelled at far less aggressive rate than Toph these past two weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her hard work, Katara figured she had only hung another 100 pounds of flesh onto her frame. Her face had ballooned into a doughy, constantly blushing confection like Toph had developed, her limbs were gently buried in miniature lakes of adipose, never again to form a harsh angle, and her stomach was now an ample apron that rested on thighs that resembled tree trunks when she sat (which was nearly all the time.) Her new floppy stomach had surprised her; it had grown in bit by bit every day, and truth be told, she thought the blob of coffee-tone flesh now occupying her lap looked quite nice on her; it was better than all of her inevitable weight gain going straight to her hips.  While she now took up the space of seven skinny girls instead of five when she brought her bulk down to rest for hours upon hours at a time, she had been expecting at least nine by now.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph's voice rang out from across the deck. \"Hey Katara, -Ooooooarp!-  this is rich! She's not here to relax with us, actually Ma- Maduuurraaaap! Madame broomhandle here thinks Suki should cut back on the calories! She sounds just like you, except she doesn't have her mouth full all the time!\" Toph had craned the huge ring of fat that was her neck, causing her face to squish deep inside the softness piled up around her.  Toph bended her imposing clay throne to lift up her stomach, letting her stretch her legs out enough to put the slightest bit of weight on them. Clay disks also under the sway of Toph's bending pushed up against each arm to support the waves of fat that had draped them, and that, along with the entire throne levitating a bit to slide her off into a standing position, allowed her to stand on own. \"Look, I know we look kinda lazy, but let me tell you, Suki hasn't been happier in her entire life! She finally has a chance to be appreciated for all her hard work, and  you should be too!\"Apparently standing up with the weight of her arms and belly supported by bending force was still just a tad uncomfortable, as Toph reformed her throne facing Liu and let her body tip heavily back into the sitting position, her sweat-drenched body making a sound similar to a baby whale slamming onto the deck after an ill-timed jump from the ocean. It took Toph a moment to bend a loving cradle for her stomach, lifting it a bit so that it wouldn't flop over her bare, exceptionally filthy feet completely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee shoved the lollipop she was eagerly slurping  on into the imposing cleavage line she had grown during the last fortnight. Ty Lee still insisted on wearing her old acrobat's clothes, and while they were form fitting and elastic, they still cut severely into her new gut, which was as taught and perky as a keglike potbelly could get. Even her belly button seemed to wink good naturally when her body vibrated. Her mouth now free for the first time this morning, Ty Lee gave her two cents. \"Liu, I know you're bugging out, I guess I would be too if I didn't have a body like a sculpture model!\"   Ty Lee gave a little pose.\"But, the whole idea is we don't want anyone to have it bad! We want everyone to relax and have a blast!\"    Katara wondered if the were any rear ends with that much...jut...immortalized in stone, let alone Ty Lee's perky, super-potbelly.  She had a point on the chest thing though.  Katara felt her own tugging at her back muscles, resting against her stomach within the quadruple-wide coating of wrappings she applied nowadays. Sure they were big, but they loved gravity a little too much to be statuesque.  Ty Lee's genetics were unparalleled;  her boobs jut out, her gut jut out, her butt jut out, her personality jut out.  She was too hefty to do acrobatics, her hips too wide and her breasts too bulging for proper aerodynamics, but she certainly acted like she could still perform her whole routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scared-looking Kiyoshi warrior kept looking over to Suki, as if she couldn't believe her commander was napping on mattress-soft clay slab Toph had bent up for her.  Katara had watched Toph spoil Suki rotten, feeding her with some of the worst junk to  ever come out of their binging then goading her to sleep her days away. Suki's chin disappeared, her limbs became weak and burdened with shackles of softness far quicker than Katara or even Toph had grown them in, and her big, unwieldy gut rose like leavening  bread day after day until  Suki's chunkiness made it impossible for her to see over her stomach when reclining.  It was like she had hand-picked all the girls' attributes most suitable to laziness and grew them in; her belly was as exercise-hindering as Toph's jutting gut was when she was still in the honeymoon phase with her gluttony, while her rear end had developed the saddlebags that made Katara feel like so beastly when walking about. Her breasts were growing in as fast as Ty Lee's, though they had none of their friend's buoyancy.  Instead they rested heavily within her ill-fitting clothing, adding another two mounds of flesh between her head and her feet.  Suki had developed a truly cringe-worthy slouch after week one; Toph quickly weaned her off the idea of walking after that.  <br>\r\nOf course, Toph didn't like the idea of her soldiers getting wigged out by their new butterball commander, and naturally came to the solution that Suki should still lead, only on the front of gluttony, and with that, the new chi-blocking program had begun, loading up the laziest of the pack with luxuries while those who wished to keep their fitness were given extra duty and sometimes even hazed. Katara could overhear Liu's pleas to Toph and Ty Lee, for she had raised her voice in an attempt to wake her dozing commander up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...then she ran crying out of the room!\"    By the end of Liu's speech, Katara was seeing red; the benefits alone were unfair, but now some of the fattest of the bunch were becoming cruel, and Toph and Ty Lee seemed to find it funny!  Katara heaved herself to her feet, and felt her flab come to life as she waddled over to Liu.  Her stomach was hanging freely, butting against her groin. Her thighs rubbed past each other reluctantly, shaking each other up as they tried to force themselves past each other like  badly-oiled factory parts. She felt butt cheeks rolling from side to side, spitting gas and quivering in myriad frequencies. The powerful -pop- jiggle that sprang into life whenever she finished a full step, the aftershock quiver that traveled up from her shaking thighs, the gentle opening and closing of the rolls of fat on her back, the perky shake that her hindquarters gave whenever she let out a particularly powerful burst of gas, and the gentle rock that was her body returning to a massive state of inertia as she stood in one place. Her breasts were too heavy to bounce but they were saturated enough by her constant perspiration to rub against each other gently at all times when in motion.    <br>\r\nKatara stopped in front of Liu, noting the sensation of her extra chins quivering was new. She saw her grow even more pale than she had been previously; she knew instantly it was because of her smell.  By the moon, their hygiene!  All of them had grown used to a constant flow of flatulence, terrible breath, and a bad case of underarm odor carefully nurtured by weeks at sea without bathing, but even beyond that Ty Lee was such a sugar addict most of her body was sticky at any given time, Suki had cropped up patches of zits on her forehead and cheeks, with a few finding purchase on her wide, ungainly breasts,  Toph had the terrible habit of of spraying flecks of food at whomever she was speaking to, and Katara found rivulets of drool flowing from her food-deprived lips whenever she didn't actively tried to control it.  The stream often pattered against her breasts, sometimes forming a little pool if she was in a position that formed cleavage.  To someone who hadn't been made into something similar to them, they must be revolting!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But would it be a bad thing to get the ship used to us? You'll never lose all this weight, better make due.\"</i> A voice whispered quietly in the back of her mind, desperately trying to assuage the guilt over what she had become. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katara knew Liu would never convince the girls to budge on their pro-gluttony policies. Instead, she decided to try and make headway with Suki using language she could understand. \"Suki, you're responsible for the well-being and discipline of your crew! I'm pretty sure you're bound by law to get up (Suki seemed ) and address these complaints!\" Suki rubbed at her sleepy eyes and forced her unfit body into an uncomfortable sitting position. She was already wearing her flab very loosely; her body's muscle tone was well on its way of being outmoded by lack of use, leaving her midriff to flow into jelly-rolls on top of jelly-rolls that creased deep enough to hide smallish objects in. \"I guess that's true Katara...\" she tried to use a commanding voice, but it came out more like a whine.  Katara knew her body would seek revenge for this promptly, but she went ahead with the plan. \"But...if you want to stay in bed, you could officially appoint me second-in-command, and I could go check everything out for you!\"  Suki would have noticeably relaxed, but her body was already in a tension-free state. \"Good plan Katara! I'll go take a look myself tomorrow...\" Suki snatched up a jarful of honey and let the sweet, sticky liquid pulse down her throat, banishing the memory of her little fib from her conscience, which to Suki's pleasure had grown as content and flabby as her body, more or less leaving her to indulge guilt-free.  Katara turned to Liu. \"Let's go have a talk with these troublemakers.\"   Liu smiled up at Katara, and began to stride back down below decks.  \"Oh! Liu! Before you go, grab me a jar of that honey, please?\"   Katara meekly requested with her sweetest smile. <br>\r\n----<br>\r\nThough she had to breathe through her mouth as Katara managed squeeze herself  below decks by bending bacon grease all over the sides of her hips, Liu was glad to have company. The waddle down the hallway was painstaking; Liu had to run and get refreshments for Katara six times, and for every ten paces she got herself, she brought her ponderous body to a halt to catch her breath. The way she scarfed down the sweets Liu ferried to her, the little Kiyoshi warrior couldn't help but wish she was back at the family bakery to show her thanks for interceding with Suki; her mother always doted on girls with big appetites, being one herself since youth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Katara caught Liu staring at the way she shoved her whole hand into her mouth to lick her digits clean. Her excessively cherubic face reddened. \"You must think I'm disgusting...this all happened on accident you see, I never wanted to become like this...\" Liu shook her head so fast it made her dizzy. \"No, please!!  I don't at all; you can enjoy yourself, you did your job! If I was a war hero I'd probably be back home getting huge with my family!\"  Now it was Liu's turn to blush. \"I-I mean my family owns a bakery and I don't think fat is ugly, I just can't get fat, I have a job to do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt clicked with Katara; she had seen this girl's eyes before. \"I think I met your mother! Runs a bakery on Kiyoshi yeah? She was so sweet to me; working in a place like that is every girl's dream at least once in their lives, I think!\"  Katara forced herself to stop thinking of the bakery; she was starting to make herself hungry again.  <br>\r\nLiu shrugged. \"I guess I felt like I taking the easy way out, joining the family business and the like, especially watching Commander Suki and so many of my other peers train so hard...I sorta guilted myself into this.\"  Katara nodded understandingly. \"Well, if your heart tells you to bake, listen to it, if you ask me!  It's not any worse than Suki, who just has been listening to her butt, which likes to remain planted lately.\" Katara cracked, giving  Liu a gossipy little smile.  \"Thank you...maybe I'll think about a break from duty when we get back from this assignment...and I really do think you look lovely, not gross. I just don't like how coercive all these girls are getting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair had reached the metal double doors of the mess hall, Liu in front. She would have to enter first, as Katara was wide enough to seal her off from the rest of the hallway, and there were no other doors this far down the ship. Liu stepped in and admired the elegant, shifting flesh of her new friend as she heaved herself into the mess hall, gulping down the greasy but breathable air and exhaling piping hot clouds of oxygen-poor putrescence. <i>\"Could I ever be that brave?\"</i> Liu wondered, imagining herself just as big and clad in baker's clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Doorways had become a bigger reminder of her failures of willpower than Toph could ever be; Liu simply strolled through the portal while Katara had to use her now pitifully weak and flabby arms to squeeze the dough of her hips and buttocks through the unyielding metal frame. Not only did it chafe, but Katara knew she belched and broke wind whenever she exerted herself. All in all,  the waterbender was certain she already had the room's attention by the time she was through.  Consoling herself with the thought of doing something good for Liu and the rest of the currently block-less crew, Katara began to scan the mess hall for a good podium. As the her footfalls sent out quasi-earthquakes rattled cutlery and shook the mess hall's massive metal tables and benches, the elephantine waterbender's progress was halted by a dozen or so Kiyoshi Warriors...most of which looked a little overfed.<br>\r\n    Katara steeled herself for a confrontation only to find looks of admiration and goodwill on the young faces around her.  The most porcine of the crowd, so fat that she let cellulite-ridden thighs and loose stomach hang out of her robe out of clear inability to close it, seemed almost reverent.  \u201cCommander Katara, what can we do for you? Thank you for taking the time and effort to walk down here to grace us with your presence!\u201d Katara was unable to hold in a belch which muted the last few words of the warrior\u2019s sentence, but if it offended her, the warrior\u2019s double-chinned face gave no indication.  On closer inspection, the girl looked not only flabby but sort of worn-out; her robes were stained with sweat, and she breathed heavily.  \u201cWell, I\u2019m here to talk to you all!\u201d  Katara\u2019s eyes fell to the Kiyoshi\u2019s body;  her thighs were flabby but showed some evidence of musculature underneath the cellulite and knee-dimples; she had certainly been very fit, up until recently.  The thighs rubbed against each other and her belly collided with hers. Katara barely felt it.  \u201cOf course! But no use standing, please, take a seat! Commander Toph bent this place into shape; all the benches will accommodate you in both width and durability!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara was led to a bench by the crowd and bade to sit; as the heavenly sensation of inactivity began to seep into her body once more, Katara turned to observe Liu watching patiently from the other side of the mess hall, unwilling to be detected by the mob.   As soon as she was seated, the noose of girls around her quickly slid their own meals in front of her; many of them half eaten and on dirty plates.  The hefty Kiyoshi spoke up again, her belly slapping breifly against the table as she sat down.  \u201cEnjoy! You need it more than we do! I\u2019m Fei Lin, by the way!\u201d   she jovially slid her own plate to Katara, toppling a tower of mashed potatoes saturated in gravy off onto the table.  \u201cOh, no thank you!\u201d  Katara politely responded. Or at least she wanted to; the words seemed to stick in her throat.  She swallowed hard, allowed more foul air to escape her rear end, then tried again.  \u201cThanks! I\u2019m famished!\u201d  she shouted, spraying Fei Lin with drool (which she was very slow to wipe off) and grabbing the handful of spilled mashed potatoes off the table before scarfing down the partially-eaten lunches of a dozen sailors. After she finished, Katara couldn\u2019t help but lick the plates clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon burying her hunger pangs, Katara realized how embarrassing her actions were. Before she could apologize for being a hog, Fei Lin casually remarked \u201cI\u2019m hoping my butt will fill in like yours, though it\u2019s probably wishful thinking.\u201d   A refined looking girl with a profound hourglass figure two seats away gave a proud snort.  \u201cBut, I\u2019m already developing some great belly hang, which Toph says is just as comfortable when I get over the three hundred pound hump; by that point your butt\u2019s nicely padded even if you\u2019re a total stomach gal like Song here.\u201d  A chunky looking girl with a potbelly sitting to Fei Lin\u2019s left blushed and tried to pull her shirt over her gut. \u201cFei Lin, I\u2019m not even close to two hundred  yet! You\u2019re embarrassing me!\u201d  She turned to Katara apologetically.  \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m a twig! Just give me a week, I\u2019ll get myself to one seventy-five  at least and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cENOUGH!\u201d Katara shouted, spraying Fei Lin with another stream of saliva. This time she caught her licking a little of it off.  \u201cLook; all of you are going to stop this, right now! I never asked for this, I don\u2019t want to be this way! Its unhygienic and a surefire way to make sure you\u2019ll be a food addict, like a real, legitimate  addict who can\u2019t think of anything else but what they\u2019re going to gorge on next! You need to struggle to even think about doing anything else, and it gets harder and harder to even mind! You could wake up one day and suddenly the only thing you care about is how fat you can get yourself, then the next thing you know you start wanting everyone around you to be the same way to make sure that you\u2019re never uncomfortable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Song cut in.  \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the commander so content, and you look just beautiful!\u201d<br>\r\nKatara\u2019s thoughts swam. She was only just getting fat, how could she be so eager to pile hundred of pounds of extra weight on to her figure? Could she actually be making a mostly-conscious decision?  She saw the girls in front of her, and herself, back to their own thin selves, traveling and running and breathing fresh air instead of clouds of their own gas....then she saw herself luxuriating in a peace of mind that only a devotion to gluttony could bring, surrounded by people who thought she was beautiful and made sure she ate her fill, no matter how impossibly ravenous her hunger grew...</span></div></div>",

The Kiyoshi warrior had slid off her clay-recliner and with immense effort pushed her drooping body onto its feet.  Toph felt a twitch of anticipation; if it wasn\u2019t important, Suki certainly wouldn\u2019t go through the trouble bringing herself to attention to react to it. \u201cDid the girls slack off and let your pile of food run out?\u201d Toph guessed.  \u201cPirates.\u201d  Suki yawned, shuffling over to the massive alarm gong on the main deck. Upon reaching it, she looked down mournfully at the large hammer she was supposed to lift to strike the brass instrument.  Even as she saw the large, metal-plated ship advancing on their starboard side, a crew of what looked like ruffians armed with bows and swords waiting on the decks, Suki slouched inactively by the instrument, scratching vigorously at her behind,the motion making the entire flabby shelf of her buttocks wobble. Her hand came back rather wet; the back of her robes were soaked through with sweat.   \u201cHey Toph, mind shooting a little clay over here? It\u2019d be a pain if I had to bend all the way over, pick the stick up, lift my arms, and actually hit the alarm  long enough to make noise...I don\u2019t think we have that kind of time.\u201d She yawned loudly again, slipping her hand into her robe to play with her belly button. Toph\u2019s puffy little hands wiggled for a moment, and the alarm gong began to shake. The impish Earthbender had no intention of using it to call for help, however. Toph bent  the brass disk away from its frame, rotating it so that it was whirring like a sawblade above the deck of the ship. \u201cSuki, could you just walk over to the direction the ship\u2019s coming from and give me a signal? I need a direction to aim this bad boy in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Suki looked across the deck.  \u201cReally? That\u2019s kind of far...\u201d  If it didn\u2019t make her uncomfortably out of breath, Toph would have sighed. Instead, she bent her throne into a more upright shape, allowing her feet to touch the clay she had spread out around her. She had to invest considerable effort in reforming her throne; standing was downright disorienting if her body wasn\u2019t properly supported; since she was too fat to lift her arms or position her legs, she needed two pillars that ended in bowl-like depressions to comfortably hold up her arm flab  as well as a few arches that braced powerfully against her ankles, upper thighs, and knees. She extended the seat of her throne between her feet then upward to provide a platform to rest her stomach on; without any support, she\u2019d simply tip over.  Her breasts were heavy but bearable, though Toph brought the back of her throne forward to lean her generous buttocks against.  Toph thought her neck would immediately began aching holding her flabby face upright, but she was pleasantly surprised to find her chins supported her head just as comfortably when \u201cstanding\u201dThe pressure of the supports made Toph\u2019s form dimple and flow, rerouting the pitter-patter of sweat running down her limbs. The flesh around her midriff shifted into differently-shaped rolls every time the young bender took a gasp of breath. Her flesh rocked gently with the kinetics of the ship, which Toph compensated for by imperceptibly shifting her earthy supports with the bending talent of a master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Toph\u2019s dripping, flabby body was imposing despite its short stature; Suki had no doubt Toph\u2019s gong-saw was capable of piercing the hull of the approaching ship.The Kiyoshi moved almost directly in front of the incoming ship on the horizon, leaning against the sides of the ship to catch her breath; Suki made sure to bend forward so that her stomach and breasts would be shored up by a side-rail. \u201cAlright, just shoot that to my left!\u201d   Suki shouted, trusting Toph not to lop her head off with the impromptu missile. Toph adjusted her earth pillars a bit so that her arm slid forward and upward, and with a complex finger movement the disk was gone in a blur. Suki watched the glinting projectile grow miniscule against the horizon, then become a comet of sparks as it tore across the side of the pirate vessel, scoring a deep gash through its side; the jagged metal scar was above sea level, but the waves lapping against the vessel were already splashing into its holds.The barbaric crew snapped into a panic, and it was clear they were no longer concerned with pursuing their ship.  <br>\r\n    Ty Lee emerged onto the deck with a sack of cookies in her hand  just as the damage was done; still yet to change from her old plainclothes outfit.  Watching the acrobat approach, Suki was quite certain that her own figure was not nearly...perky enough to keep inside a top like she wore. Not even Ty Lee\u2019s figure could save her some excessive bouncing, however, and her stomach looked flabbier than ever. Ty Lee quickly noticed the commotion going on out at sea; she jiggled over to the side-rail of the ship, the fabric of her leggings swishing as her thighs rubbed against each other. \u201cWoah, hey! There\u2019s a sinking ship!\u201d   Ty Lee looked rapidly between Toph and Suki. \u201cGuys, sinking ship! We\u2019ve gotta save them!...Woah, our alarm gong\u2019s gone! Come on, we\u2019ll have to go get them ourselves! It\u2019s our duty!\u201d   <br>\r\n    Suki\u2019s eyes widened as she lifted her gut from the siderail. \u201cNormally yes but-\u201d<br>\r\nTy Lee confidently vaulted over the side of the steamer, ready to swim across a half-mile of ocean and carry the passengers back.  She began a confident breaststroke.  Suki sighed and began to fetch a rope, truly disgruntled about having to move about more.  Toph belched, then grinned. \u201cDid she just do what I think she did?\u201d<br>\r\n     \u201cYes\u201d.    Suki replied, distinctly unsurprised.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Ty Lee made it about twenty-five feet from the ship. \u201cOw! Cramps!\u201d She cursed as she stopped paddling began to sink beneath the waves, only to be immediately carried to the surface again by the buoyant flab wrapped around her midsection and chest. Her cleavage line reappeared above the surface of the ocean as she bobbed about without treading water.  \u201cHey guys, look! I float!\u201d  she giggled.  Suki sighed and tossed out the rope, shaking up her sore, flabby arms in the process.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    Two days later, Suki was jarred awake by a savage blow to her midsection. Her snoring turned into a sputter as she snapped back to consciousness. She habitually reached for her war fans, instead grasping a handful of soggy noodles in broth. Now in control of her senses, Suki brought the noodles to her lips, no longer worried.  \u201cTy Lee, you need to stop doing that without my permission.\u201d  Suki warned, sternly.  The former acrobat was lounging on Suki\u2019s exposed stomach like a bean-bag chair. Ty Lee sighed. \u201cOne day I\u2019m going to be able to do this without waking you up. You never <i>look</i> like you\u2019re going to wake up.\u201d  Ty Lee crossed her arms, pushing her bulging breasts upward. Still possessing a fair amount of agility for an extremely overweight girl, Ty Lee reached down from the height of the belly/throne and scooped up a wheel of pungent cheese as Suki swallowed down her noodles.  \u201cO-pen wiiide!\u201d Ty Lee sang as she brought the disk horizontally to Suki\u2019s mouth. It was bigger than her head, but Suki speedily began boring through the unexpected treat, smacking her lips in between overzealous bites.  \u201cYou won\u2019t make a good chair if my butt gets as big as your stomach...you should really consider loosening up and putting on a few more pounds.\u201d Ty Lee observed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Toph hung her (full)  mouth open after hearing this. \u201cHow did you give us so much trouble when you were bugging us with Azula? I\u2019m going to take a leap of faith here and say that it\u2019s plainly visible Suki\u2019s getting in plenty great shape under my care!\u201d  <br>\r\nTy lee nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit Toph, project! I had trouble hearing you before when you were explaining the pirate thing.\u201d  As if on cue ,Toph\u2019s rear end erupted in another gaseous barrage. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural! I\u2019m building a healthy earthbending physique.\u201d Toph contested.  Suki finally finished chewing. Because they were there and sticky with dried sugar, Suki ran her tongue across Ty Lee\u2019s fingers while they happened to be so close to her mouth. \u201cOh, hey, that tickles!\u201d Ty Lee pulled her hand away and gave it an experimental slurp herself.  \u201cHey, you are right though Suki, tastes like my delicious breakfast!\u201d she shoved her pointer into her mouth and caressed it with her tongue.  She cringed a bit. \u201cAnd a little like <i>your</i> breakfast, now...\u201d  Suki was beginning to feel out of breath with the acrobat\u2019s flabby behind pressing on her midsection.  \u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re still on top of me?!\u201d the commander barked. \u201cOh, right! It\u2019s time for inspections, Suki! You\u2019re supposed to go around and check on how the rest of the ship is doing, since you haven\u2019t already, for once.\u201d Ty Lee pulled a lollipop out of her glistening cleavage and put her tongue to work again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Suki groaned.  Toph stopped her incessant gorging for another moment to be protective. \u201cShe doesn't have to move a muscle of she doesn't want to! Any of those Kiyoshi who think good commanders need to do stupid things like stumble around nitpicking at their crews all day can answer to me! Let Katara do the worrywart stuff, she'll do it even if you don't ask, trust me!\"  Toph tried to cross her arms, but it was simply too much flesh in one place. Toph figured taking the time and effort to slide her arms a bit was intimidating enough, anyway. Suki thought about it for a moment. \u201cI suppose it would help with morale, maybe get a few more of the crew to try out the chi block...and once that happens, they\u2019ll all see the..practicality of my new style of command!\u201d Suki reasoned.  Ty Lee hiccuped. \u201cYeah! I wanna pick up more sweet buns from the kitchen anyway. Let\u2019s go!\u201d  Suki\u2019s eyes rolled back in pleasure as Ty Lee\u2019s weight vanished from on top of her. The acrobat\u2019s feet hit the deck with a loud thud, sending her belly quivering and her chest into a massive up-then-down jump that made a few chubby Kiyoshi in the process of dropping off more food look mournfully down at their own figures.  Ty Lee caught girls lapsing into those kinds of expressions around her pretty much her whole life (at least in those precious moments away from her sisters), and was generally invigorated by the attention.<br>\r\n    \u201cHey, you still aren\u2019t up?\u201d  Ty Lee complained.  Suki was gleefully accepting a river of melted cheese with strips of kebob meat floating in it via a drain formed by clay, courtsey Toph and the massive bowl of soup she ordered up from the kitchens for the next segment of her breakfast.  \u201cTy Lee, you know what happens when you walk around too much? You get skinny! She\u2019s not leaving until she has some energy food! -Burraap-!\u201d   <br>\r\n    Ty Lee desperately wanted to go into the holds of the ship where sugary bliss awaited her.  Her eyes caught a pair of chi-blocked Kiyoshi emerging onto the decks; one was delightfully bottom-heavy, though the other was barely paunchy. \u201cOh hey...Eyri right? You let me work on your chi just a few days ago!\u201d  The small girl blushed and nodded. \u201cThank you again...I have more friends now...\u201d she squeaked out sheepishly. The heavier girl put her arm on Eyri\u2019s shoulder.  \u201cSorry she\u2019s still so skinny Ty Lee! Tell the commander Fei Lin is starting to give the new girls quotas to meet so that their appetites ramp up faster than normal, since the process is so slow in the beginning...\u201d  Eyri nodded, looked like she wanted to say something,  but instead belched in Ty Lee\u2019s face, causing little reaction from the acrobat.  Eyri grew immediately apologetic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2019ve been eating big breakfasts...\u201d she looked downcast.  Ty Lee put a hand on her hip and angled her eyes diagonally upward, as if she were feigning ignorance of the event. With a childlike smile she ripped a boisterous fart, batting her eyelashes in mock femininity. \u201cWhat were you sorry about?\u201d Ty Lee asked, still smiling.  Both girls smiled while Eyri giggled, relaxed by their fellow warrior\u2019s guileless attitude. \u201cSay, would you guys do me a favor?\u201d Ty Lee asked.  The pair of them nodded before they heard the request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to the mess hall first!\" Ty Lee called back as Suki walked across the deck, supported under each arm by a Kiyoshi warrior.  \"My back still aches.\" Suki lamented. She turned to Eyri, who was already red in the face from how much weight the flabby but perfectly mobile commander was putting on her body. \"Eyri,right? Could you hold out your arm and kind of prop up my chest?\" Suki asked.  Eyri's knees trembled, her breathing reluctant from her proximity to the commander's damp armpit.  \"I...I don't think I can, commander.....\"  the small-boned Kiyoshi mustered.  Suki gave another long sigh. \"Well, let's hurry to the mess hall then, at least we can sit and eat there.\"  The party's stomachs, even Eyri's, collectively growled at the thought. </span></div></div>",

If I spend all day scrutinizing each and every part of the ship i\u2019d never get anything done!\u201d Eyri suddenly felt heavy footsteps slam rapidly up from behind her. \u201cWhat are you doing questioning the commander? Have you even eaten anything since you\u2019ve gotten here, anyway?\u201d  Eyri  turned and stood up anxiously to come face-to-chest with Fei Lin.  \u201cWell, I am hungry...I just didn\u2019t want to leave the commander\u2019s side...\u201d  Eyri felt nauseous again; she had just gotten used to the commander\u2019s pungent self, but Fei Lin\u2019s breath was making her reel all over again. \u201cSit down, the commander wants a healthy crew. The improvements to your Chi won\u2019t help if you don\u2019t hurry up and eat.\u201d Fei Lin snatched a half-eaten sweet roll out of a nearby Kiyoshi\u2019s hand and drove it into Eyri\u2019s mouth, then pinched Eyri\u2019s nose with her grubby fingers, forcing her to swallow or cease to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the cafeteria Ty Lee was observing this spectacle with a few of her closer Kiyoshi friends.  \u201cSuki gets all the attention when she\u2019s down here...is it her zits that everyone likes? The sleeping all the time thing?\u201d  Ty Lee took a scoop of sugar and piled it on top of her fried eggs and bacon. After an experimental bite, she added two more.  Her friend Tasanee gave an empathetic shrug.  \u201cI don\u2019t know! I guess it\u2019s like a fashion trend, like all the rich women in Ba Sing Se follow. I never thought the Kiyoshi would be up for it, what with the facepaint and all...I guess that\u2019s not really a rule anymore though, huh. Not that I\u2019m complaining!\u201d Tasanee indicated to the bright green hair ties that created a pair of chestnut pigtails above her lightly tanned face. A spoiled rich girl from Ba Sing Se, Tasanee\u2019s somewhat misguided ambition for adventure and fame eventually led her to the Kiyoshi. Upon Ty Lee\u2019s arrival, they had become fast friends in any environment where they were not competing for attention with their buxom figures and easy-going attitudes.  Ty Lee often shielded Tas from the wrath of Suki for her somewhat lackadaisical approach to her duties while Tasanee in turn let Ty Lee borrow her clothes and provided the choicest gossip when they met off-duty.  Ty Lee watched her friend add a pile of sugar to her pancakes.  \u201cOoh, that looks good!\u201d   Ty Lee commented.  Tasanee nodded, giving her exposed, softened stomach a slap. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who gave me the idea.\u201d  Ty Lee nodded with a big smile, then opened one eye. \u201c Wait a sec, I never Chi Blocked you, did I?\u201d  Tasanee shrugged. \u201cNo, but I\u2019ve never been asked to!\u201d  Ty Lee glanced over to Fei Lin, who was now pouring fish stew into Eyri\u2019s mouth as she kicked impotently at her broad, doughy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve been eating the same things all this time!\u201d Ty Lee glanced down at Tasanee\u2019s wide thighs and swollen breasts. She was at least twenty pounds lighter than her friend, but she had still gotten rather chunky in a short time. Tasanee shrugged. \u201cYour meals looked tasty, is all! But yeah, a bunch of girls have been really pushy with all that chi-blocking stuff...they never bothered me though! I think Fei Lin\u2019s still mad at me from that time I told her her legs were too thick to wear my chenogsam correctly back when we were all training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee wasn\u2019t listening anymore; she was too busy watching Eyri\u2019s impromptu force-feeding get interrupted by Fei Lin floating off her feet towards the center of the cafeteria. The massive Kiyoshi turned, revealing the strong, muscular arms of Daiyu, a rustic earth kingdom girl who was easily the best fighter of the Warriors next to Suki when she was at her prime.  Despite the dress code being lifted, she wore the traditional Kiyoshi face paint; a white base with reds and orange around the eyes. She was a wholly good hearted girl, but packed a temper and a sense of personal justice that occasionally led her to clash with Suki\u2019s strictly disciplined teaching style. She had clearly not been chi blocked; she was as fit as she ever was, which was strikingly so.  Using only the strength of her arms she brought the roughly two hundred and fifty pound Fei Lin down onto a bench, causing her to flinch as her weight combined with Daiyu\u2019s downward force bent the thick metal inward until it was a few inches above the ground.  Her voice was mature and her words direct. \u201cThere. You sit here and stuff your own fat face, let everyone else worry about their own for once, yeah? I for one have to get to my triple shift hauling cargo up to the kitchens...and I think I will do so in my armor, which <i> I </i> still fit into.\u201d There was more than a bit of insult in her tone. Fei Lin was clearly enraged and ready to lash out to salve her wounded ego, but it looked as if the ride on Daiyu\u2019s shoulder upset her stomach.  She got unsteadily to her feet, gave the fit Kiyoshi a withering glance, then stormed off to gorge herself.  Eyri crept up to Daiyu, rubbing her distended stomach with one hand. \u201cThank you...you didn\u2019t have to do that though...I really am kind of skinny...\u201d  Daiyu plucked at her now filthy robe. \u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, eat. If you\u2019re not, don\u2019t.\u201d she turned without looking at the chi-blocked little Eyri and strode out to the cargo bay, leaving the mess hall pin-drop silent for a long moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrp!\u201d  the entire mess hall turned to the source of the noise.  Suki scratched at her oily cheek. \u201cHey, no fighting, okay?\u201d Suki murmured as if both of the girls were still in the mess and standing next to her. \u201cCome on, I want to get a nap in today, let\u2019s finish the inspection...plus, Toph should have dinner ready for me soon\u201d Suki said, a little more decisively. The Commander held up her saggy arms to let her compatriots lift her.</span></div></div>",

Suki merely belched; she was stone tired from walking around the entire ship looking for problems she knew didn\u2019t exist.  As they descended down into the cargo bay where the majority of the surplus of food was stored, Suki\u2019s pleasant thoughts were halted; a delicious smelling Kioyshi warrior had blocked their path.  \u201cCommander Suki!\u201d  Daiyu, clothes dirty from long hours in the cargo bay, was dripping with what smelled like a gravy of some sort.  \u201cI\u2019m here to report Fei Lin for unsanctioned disciplinary action against other members of the Kiyoshi warriors,\u201d her voice raised in pitch and volume dramatically as she continued, \u201c ...and <i>for opening the valve on a tank full of gravy while I was pushing it across the cargo bay</i>!\u201d   Suki made a gesture to her aides that she wanted to sit down. The small group of Kiyoshi that had been pandering to her since the mess hall stopped walking as their commander was brought down onto some comfortable-looking food crates.  The plumper of the two set her down without a problem, but Eyri\u2019s legs chose that moment to give out, sending her crashing down with the commander, pinned under her ripe underarm.  \u201cOh...just be patient Eyri...\u201d Suki decided, not feeling up for exercise as strenuous as lifting her arm.  \u201cNow, Daiyu, you\u2019ve always been a little hasty in your accusations...\u201d Suki began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/6956/avaslob4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/6956/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaiyu grit her teeth and practically growled at the commander. \u201cI knew it! You\u2019re no better than any of them; I was stupid for even trying to settle this diplomatically! This is a ship full of coercive hogs!\u201d   Tasanee, who was watching events transpire a few dozen feet away next to Ty Lee, gestured towards the open doors to the cargo bay. \u201cLook Ty Lee, here comes Fei Lin again with....wow, is that Maki? She\u2019s really let herself go lately.\u201d  Ty Lee was concerned; the whole point of this chi blocking thing was to make everyone happy, not stressed! Daiyu continued her rant.  \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m not fatter than you right now is because I\u2019m strong enough to defend myself against the mob of girls who <i>have</i> let themselves become complete hogs!  The ultra-refined, large-hipped Athe made a disapproving noise. \u201cA hog is an undignified creature, I resent that.\u201d  The kind-spirited Song chimed in as well, breathing heavily from all the stomach weight she was putting on. \u201cYeah, I understand Fei Lin can have a bad sense of humor sometimes, but is this really something to bug the commander about?\u201d  As if confirming Daiyu\u2019s accusations, Athe succumbed to a fit of belches while Song proceeded to pour heavy cream into Suki\u2019s waiting mouth at the sound of a sleepy murmur.  \u201cCommander, I\u2019m giving you an ultimatum....you can....Commander! Wake up! I\u2019m speaking to you!\u201d  The cream had made Suki sleepy, and she had fallen into a nap almost immediately after it stopped pouring down her gullet.<br>\r\nShe started awake again, a stream of drool pattering onto her shirt.  \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem, again?\u201d she asked Daiyu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee watched the gravy-covered hellcat of a Kioyshi shoulder-check her way past Fei Lin, then disappear into the bowels of the ship.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiu stumbled into the mess hall, where she knew Katara would likely be at this hour. She saw the massive waterbender gorging none too reluctantly on plate after plate of whatever food was ready and prepared from the kitchen; she wasn't very picky.  \"Katara! This is really bad; that girl I was telling you about, Daiyu, she just told off Suki...and now I think she's-\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara stopped stuffing her face, already guessing what Liu was going to say. \"That's a terrible idea....a really, really terrible idea! -Urrap!- \"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph was savoring the myriad smells of her dinner-to-be, letting drool and sweat drip from her obese body freely. A series of hasty footsteps grew close, then suddenly the sound of her dinner being smashed, spilled, and otherwise being rendered less edible was all around her.  An unfamiliar voice met her ears. \"You're the one responsible for making Suki into a sack of dough, aren't you?\"  A furious girl asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\"  Toph responded, proudly. \"Got a problem with it? I really hope you do, since you just smashed my dinner.\"  The mighty Earthbender wiggled her chubby toes eagerly and began to grin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The events of both will remain canon in one another with possibility of paths crossing however the stories following their travels up until the final showdown will be separated.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More! Bring me more!\" Azula howled in anger drool cascading over her lip. Azula wasn't angry at anything that had happened but the mere fact there was still food left and she was being kept waiting sent Azula into a fury. The pile in which Azula had planted herself was reduced to emptied barrels licked clean of their contents and deflated sack of sugar. Azula was reluctant to reactivate her bending to look for any scraps left and screamed bloody murder at her obese military to bring her whatever may be left. Fearfully a pair of chubby fire nation girls quickly brought the only barrel of cooking oil they could find to Azula. Azula grunted in frustration as she snatched the barrel from them bending calories into the muscles of her arms to lift the barrel over her head and chug it with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls took a few steps back before she threw the barrel back down. The girls weren't even soldiers, they were just the daughters of a fire kingdom nobleman who were traveling to the nearby fire nation base to meet their bother a lieutenant in the fire nation army when their caravan was raided by Azula for food. The young spoiled women foolishly tried to protest the treatment, only to find themselves arrested by the same crippling impact every other girl in Azula's army had felt. After they recovered from the simple attack all they could think about was food, gnawing unyielding hunger gripped them and dictated their actions. Since then they had spent the last two days chained to a post at Azula's side lorded over by the massive tyrant. Fed only scraps and forced to endure her endless flatulence and constant demands their weak pampered spirits were crushed. No longer were they naive upper class socialite, they were beginning to strip away all their refined manners and status. Their dreams had turned from marrying a rich man to take care of them into dreams of spending the rest of their days at Azula's side hopelessly trying to satiate both hers and their own endless hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you worms could find for me?!\" Azula shrieked with unbalance and tossed the barrel like a plaything having not fully deactivated her bending. The barrel soared across the village and landed with crash on an abandoned cabbage cart that had been picked clean. Azula began bending calories into her legs and leapt to her feet with shocking ease landing again with a deep thud sending heavy vibrations across the ground. She turned scanning the collections of empty boxes and depleted pots of liquid. She turned a sharp eye at June who was licking the last grains of sugar from her fingertips with a smirk. All her obese followers had only a bowed head to offer her as she looked for any remaining provisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then!\" Azula breathed heavily some mental sanity beginning to return to her with no more food to gorge, sweat beaded again on her face. \"This raid was assuredly more prosperous than recent excursions\" Azula continued her voice evening out as she pushed a stand of hair out of her face and tucked it back into her greasy bang. \"But you worthless cows still took far too long to clean out this village! I began my closing feast before half of you even returned with your offering to my stockpile of sustenance!\" Azula cast a maddening eye at her soldiers and slaves some of the insanity leaking back into her voice. \"Do not keep me waiting!\" She roared heat jetting from her mouth as a fire welled up within her. \"Now bring me my royal carriage you filthy swine!\" Azula cursed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula's demands were quickly obeyed as a large cart pulled by a dozen or more large bullboar was led into the town square. The buggy was a caravan wagon that had been stripped of parts of it's enclosure and a wide plush couch mounted on it. On either of it several chains were bolted to the ground just inches from the seat so Azula could bind recently turned girls in and treat them like her new pets as she broke them in to be her loyal slobs. The two nobleman's daughters still shook with fear their developing folds of fat quivering at the sight of them, while most of her entourage now regarded them with respect finding their time bound so closely to Azula's side a necessary part of their eye being opened to this new life. Behind the ponderous queen of gluttony's would be throne parts of the Caravan's original structure remained, several shelves and straps for securing food stores that Azula would need to placate her on the trip ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula's face twisted with rage when she saw the shelves had been restocked. \"What is the meaning of this treachery?!\" Azula snapped \"Once again you fat whores  did not inform me there was more to eat??\" Azula's rage was something the girls had to endure. They knew this would happen but they learned early on giving Azula all the food meant they would go hungry on the trip ahead. If Azula became hungry on the trek to the next village she would begin ordering her soldier off their own mounts so she could cook them for her own meal leaving the poor obese women to walk the rest of the way. As Azula calmed down once more she looked to several of the earth nation girls with dominance \"Well what did you find?\" Azula asked tired of the outbursts her incompetent slaves made her endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Several barns and stable were on the far side of the town Mistress!\" One of the larger girls squeaked her voice slightly trembling \"We secured them before the feeling townsfolk could gain access and escape on any useful stock. There were seven bullboar for you to use among the beast available\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven?\" Azula was impressed \"That's wonderful\" she smiled devilishly. With a nod to her servants leading her cart seven of the bullboar were uncoupled from the cart and led to Azula.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"These beasts have been pulling the cart the longest\" A round earth nation girl in tight stained robes bowed to her \"They won't last much longer carrying the weight of your magnificent corpulence my queen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then they have served their purpose, it's time they fulfilled their final act of service\" Azula bended some calories into her arm so she could lift it and pointed it at the large beasts of burden \"Become my meal!\" Azula laughed manically as she immersed the bovine hogs in flame \"Your existence shall continue as a part of my fat!\" Azula concluded as the flames died down leaving only a barbecued banquet. \"Cut it up and bolster our supplies!\" Azula ordered as some of the earth nation girls formed large sharp cleavers made of rock and cut the cooked bullboar into manageable chunks of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula climbed up onto her cart and plopped down into the sofa with a heavy thump as the new beasts were lashed to the front. Several other spoils from the stables were brought out as well so some of the newer girls who had been walking could ride as well, The two new nobleman's girls were able to share a hippocow as a mount for now. \"Lets move out ladies!\" Azula shouted to her congregation \"I will not tolerate calories lost while dawdling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where too mistress?\" One of the fire nation soldiers clad in tight armor spoke up \"There is a fire nation stronghold to the north we may raid\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula snarled showing her teeth \"A waste of my sublime talent! Ever since my sniviling coward of a brother took over he has recalled much of the military back to the homeland. There won't be much more than a skeleton crew left to maintain the fortress and any useful armaments or munitions are surely removed\" Azula spat in disgust as her bother's soft policies \"But the Worst of it is any food stores they may be left with are little more than military rations, all protein no fat! We will not waste precious calories on such refuse. We will continue north past it to the village of Makapu! March my corpulent valkyrie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they rode Azula continued to have one of her maiden pluck food from the stores behind her and feed her between outbursts at her forces for taking too long \"Pick up the pace you sow! Anyone who slows our progress is wasting calories! My calories! That's the same as cutting off my heavenly fat and that is tantamount to assassination!\" Azula would vociferate at the top of her lungs spewing food and saliva across her belly. Beside her a sack of bread lay in reach always restocked after each raid. Azula would grab hunks of the break and use them to dab and soak up butter and lard that has spilled down and pooled in the rolls of fat under her chin. Azula stuffed a few loafs into her cleavage to remove the extra cooking oil that overflowed her mouth. After the bread had taken in all the butter and oil it could hold Azula stuffed them into her mouth, no calorie could go unused. 'I can not be allowed to waste so much of my immaculate flesh! MOVE FASTER\" Azula roared and let a blast of fire erupt from her mouth, the flame rising up over the forest canopy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wheels of Azula's mobile platform slowly began to cut deeper and deeper ruts into the dirt road as her small band of warriors pressed north to their next meal. Azula's abusive commands thinned out becoming more spaced out as she was subdued by food. It was the most relaxed Azula became these days. The trip from one raid to the next with plenty of time to gorge and take a break was one of the few factors that kept Azula from drifting into absolute insanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her food and sweat stain robes slowly fill in once more as her well deserved reward of another successful raid was turned into fat to bolster her power and beauty Azula continued to placate the voracity of her hunger with the remaining spoils stocked around her. Another haunch of meat from her fried bullboars was brought to her by her servant and Azula tore into it with a bestial hunger ensuring her robes would fill in with more than just replaced weight sending her to new heights of obesity. However even through her pacified state of mind brought on by the indulgent repose Azula's hunger for more power and more food never dulled. After picked that last bits of meat from the toasted animal's bone and licking the seared fat away Azula let loose anew with her demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not let your greedy fat fingers slack from your reins!\" She erupted once more as liquid trickled out the corners of her mouth. Azula's salivation always going to into overdrive as she ate, which was at least nine tenths of her waking day. Azula had been taking note of how frequently her plump escort's hands were dipping into their satchels for snacks. Once more her paranoia was twisting her mind and she was certain their pace was slowing down as the frequency of their snacking increased. \"There is a new feast for me waiting ahead and you worthless hogs are keeping me from it! Your queen's magnificent girth shall not be wasted by your incompetent foolishness!\" Azula screamed and formed a whip of fire to crack at them taking several shots at the riders closest to her. She made a few close pops at a few of her guards make them yelp as they pushed their mounts to move their chubby bodies out of her reach, One poor girl got a light nick of heat on her tailbone as the whip cracked just inched from her. Azula let the flames whisk away and dropped her arm back onto her fat with a slap sending waves throughout her corpulence as she panted out of breath, sweat making her glisten in the fading illumination of the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer army obeyed without question save for a grumpy \"hrmph\" from June. Azula was demanding, cruel, and selfish. Her endless demands getting more and more fierce as she grew were the demands of a tyrant obsessed with their own greedy desires. Azula made no attempts to mask this fact, she happily embraced her food lust and power hungry goals centered around gluttony. Azula's madness that stemmed from her hunger was also growing more and more unbalanced almost as fast as she was growing in size. What was once a insatiable look in her eye as she ate had become a crazed void of obsession. Looking in her eyes as she ate was looking into bottomless pools of gluttony, and it was this bottomless feeling that drove Azula even more mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever her softening soldiers did not mind these facts at all. Quite the opposite it drove them even harder to please her and her gut. As twisted as it was through all the abuse and snarled teeth aimed at them her soldiers beamed with pride as she berated them with insults. They smiled  to themselves as she yelled for more to eat. No matter how much she screamed bloody murder and hatred at them, her servants loved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would blush when they watched her eat. They felt nervous anticipation as they set out mounds of food for her during raids, eager to see her appear and devour their tributes. Electric joy lit up their bodies when Azula's gorging had out paced her garments and she had to remove her armor or loosen a sash to make room for her growth. Even with all the abuse they had endured from her, the torture, the stuffing, being taken from their lives and forced into her service, inflicted by the same hunger that Azula felt, they all felt an obligation to Azula and a deep desire to follow and serve her. Somewhere between the fear they first felt when Azula appeared in their towns or outposts, and the point where they were just another of her fat soldiers marching behind her to instill fear into others they had all been broken by Azula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the parade of slobs continued on as dusk bathed their round bodies in an orange glow Azula couldn't help but notice just how far a few of her followers had come. Off to Azula's right a small group of earth nation girls rode on a pack of cow hippo. Wrapped in ragged garments they salvaged from the most recent raid after their clothes were once again over extended by their fattening bodies these girls were among the largest in Azula's charge. Their gains since they became Azula's entourage were topped only by Azula herself. While the girls never used the same extreme calorie burning bending Azula did their own earth bending did consume a few extra calories too and they never ate quite the massive meals Azula enjoined non-stop. But still these girls were only a short distance behind Azula in mass, each just above the three hundred pound threshold. Azula gazed at the copper colored light that shined of their sweaty rolls as she recalled where this all started.</span></div></div>",

Denzel and Marlene were both in school and as such didn't need Tifa as much as they used to. So when she saw the ad in a magazine for the cruise around the Planet, she decided that a vacation was in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not going to limit herself and experience everything the familiar and not-so-familiar stops on this cruise had to offer. She'd try anything and refuse nothing that was freely given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, packing her bags and arriving at the departure point in Kalm, Tifa was soon ushered onto the ship, one <i>Locke's Treasure</i> by name. Her cabin was spacious and certainly more than she would have taken if she wasn't in her vacation mindset. One of the attendants soon had her luggage set down where she wanted and asked if she wanted room service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, give me your order and I'll have it brought to you as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa, feeling incredibly giddy, responded. \"Give me one of everything on your menu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant nodded and soon left, leaving Tifa to sink back on her large bed and exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...vacation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, a cart was wheeled in, diverting Tifa's attention away from the television program she was currently watching, finding herself oddly drawn to it. Said program was a cartoon, something she normally wouldn't watch, but there was something about the animation, and the main character, a female pig, that drew her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the attendant left her alone, Tifa returned to the cartoon, watching the sow dive into a trough and eat messily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up a large bowl of ice cream from the cart, Tifa repeated the action, slurping, grunting, and outright making a pig of herself as she ate. Once she was done, she blinked a bit and noticed her messy clothes from the ice cream binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd just have to be more careful when eating ice cream in the future. The cartoon had ended while Tifa was thinking and she gave a pout at missing it. She'd catch it in full the next time it was on, she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now there was still a lot of food to eat and she was feeling quite hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoagies, spaghetti, hot dogs, liver and onions, this was just a tiny portion of the food Tifa managed to eat, the cart slowly emptying of food as time passed. By the time Tifa felt truly full, she had packed away about a tenth of the food on the cart. Rubbing her full stomach as gently as possible, Tifa couldn't help but giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really am quite the piggy. But it's a vacation so who cares if I gain a few pounds? I'll have them worked off a week or two after I get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident in this, Tifa decided a nap was in order and was soon asleep, snoring loudly, something she didn't do often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the slumbering martial artist, the entire cruise was an experiment being run by Neo Shinra to test out their latest subversive devices. The cartoon was meant to be used in covert ops for subliminally turning an enemy agent, the food was laced with appetite enhancers, designed to limit the effectiveness of opposing infantrymen and their support. There were more of course, but the company started with these two on every passenger to join.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe true effectiveness of this experiment would be shown at the end, and Tifa Lockhart was about to find out firsthand how effective these initial devices were.</span></div></div>",

However, she mainly woke up because she was ravenously hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that she didn't want to disturb anybody this early, she perused the remaining food on the trolley she'd ordered yesterday for something that would taste good cold. Finding some sliced ham, bread, butter, jam, croissants, boiled eggs and a stack of pancakes with a jug of syrup, Tifa moved her breakfast in front of the television and turned it on to find more of the cartoon that she had been watching the day before and began to shovel food into her mouth as fast as she could  swallow it. Caught up in the strangely enticing cartoon, she didn't realise how much or how quickly she was eating and a few mintues after finishing what was in front of her another wave of hunger enticed her to scavenge for increasingly unsuitable food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour after she started her breakfast a break in the cartoon gave left Tifa the presence of mind to decide that there wasn't anything left on the trolley that was particularly appetising having sat there un-refrigerated or un-heated for half a day and she decided it was time to move on from breakfast. Also that she was wearing clothes that had both been slept in and had an uncharacteristic amount of food spilled on them, though the effects of the cartoon lingered enough to prevent her incredibly bloated stomach from really registering consciously.  So she grabbed her suitcases from where she had dumped them upon arrival and easily carried the two heavy bags over to the giant wardrobe that took up one wall of her cabin, with the intention of unpacking them. She was thwarted in this attempt, however, by the discovery that none of the doors on it seemed to actually open, or at least not before the she stopped trying harder for fear of breaking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a small amount of investigation she came upon a small button marked \"Wardrobe\", which she pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your automated wardrobe system.\" said an electronic voice, \"This system will attempt to provide for all of your clothing needs during your voyage. Please place any suitcases you may have beneath the bed and stand on the illuminated floor tile so that we may scan for your style and size preferences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" thought Tifa, following the instructions, \"I can't begin to imagine how expensive this system must be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scanning.\" stated the voice, as blue light fields began to move through the area beneath the bed and the area in which Tifa stood, \"Should you want to use any clothing of your own be aware that there is a laundry available for personal items on deck 3. Wardrobe items can be returned for cleaning using the shoot illuminated now.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA flap in the wall flashes briefly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be aware that this system is currently in testing and there may be callibration issues. Should you wish to perform a re-scan to better personalise your wardrobe simply press the button and request a re-scan. Similarly feedback can be registered in the same way, as well as this introduction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue light fields finish moving through their respective areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scanning complete, please press the button when you are ready to select your outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" Tifa exclaimed, sitting on her bed, \"I'm beginning to wish I hadn't packed so many clothes. I doubt I'll need anything other than this wardrobe can provide. Hmm, I guess I should work out what I'm going to do with my morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes thought, during which she unconsciously rubbed her distended stomach, firm from all of the food packing into it, Tifa decided that she felt like getting some exercise in to start the day (never mind the fact that she had already started it with a binge, that didn't occur to her, breakfast doesn't count), so she stood up and pressed the button again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"State your required attire.\" said the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swimwear please.\" asked Tifa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait one moment.\" it responded and, after a brief whirring noise, one of the wardrobe doors opened and a hanger moved forward bearing a fairly sensible looking bikini, solid black bottoms with a white string top, on a rail next to it was a large plain white towel. \"Please state if these are unsuitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll do nicely.\" Tifa smiled, she had something very much like it in one of her suitcases, and pulled the bikini off the hanger and tossing it only the bed, swiftly followed by the towel. Both hanger and rail then retracted into the wardrobe, the door shutting behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her now somewhat dirty white t-shirt, black miniskirt and underwear, throwing them into a pile in the corner, Tifa donned the swimsuit, pulling the bikini bottom up over her sleek muscular thighs with ease and into place over her firm buttocks. Then putting the top in place beneath her breasts tied the strings first behind her back and then, pulling it up over her sizable, yet perky breasts, behind her neck. She also redid her hair, braiding it so that it wouldn't get in the way or tangle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmiring herself in the mirror, ignoring her bloated midsection once more, and admiring the wardrobe for its perfect choices of style and size, Tifa wrapped the towel round her wait and left her room to find the pool.</span></div></div>",

The former L'Cie were the toast of burgeoning civilization, a source of strength and inspiration for the struggling populace free from Cocoon. Several chefs were catering this latest feast and all were clamoring for the heroes to be the first to taste their cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that Lightning was ushered from station to station and handed plate after plate of rich, decadent food. There were pastas with exotic names, sugary puddings, and the oddest bread she had ever tasted. Still as the night wore on the solider found her belly reaching it's capacity. She had never really eaten so much food since she was a small child and the result was a horrific ache in her stomach, the lean muscles trying to hold back the onslaught of calories she had just ingested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over at her friends, Lightning saw that Sahz and Snow were in a similar boat as her. Hope, on the other hand, was still eating, a pleased look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Lightning's sister was rubbing her full stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tap on her shoulder made Lightning turn around. It was her superior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaluting as fast as she could, she winced a little at the pain in her stuffed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At ease Farron.\" The captain took a deep breath and gazed at the frivolity all around him. Turning back to his prized subordinate, the big man patted her on the shoulder. \"Ease up. You and your friends saved the world after all. You deserve a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A break,\" Lightning repeated, looking down at her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow many more breaks would she and her friends be subjected to as the months wore on?</span></div></div>",

Once inside and seated, Lightning saw just why Captain Adomar was the size he was: the Captain and his wife at stupendous amounts of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain's wife, Shuri Adomar, doted on Lightning as soon as all of the food was assembled on the table, prodding Lightning into filling her plate more than once. Lightning, not wanting to offend her, took as much as was offered. This, eventually, caused her to undo a bit of the zipper on her dress, allowing her stuffed stomach more room to expand as Shuri filled her plate once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain didn't escape either, Shuri ensuring that he had lots of food as well as eating a hearty amount herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A well-fed soldier will be the best solider,\" Shuri explained, Lightning nodding at the logic. An army did run on their stomachs after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had never eaten this much food in her life, and the Captain was also struggling to finish after another plate. Lightning matched him and was even able to down one more thanks to Shuri's insistence and her own desire not to offend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end result came in the loud belch that came after finishing her last plate, one that exceeded the one Captain Adomar had let loose only a few moments before hers. Blushing, Lighting started to apologize but Shuri merely giggled and patted Lightning's taut belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good soldier also isn't that worried about manners on the battlefield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is a dining room,\" Lightning said, sweat pouring down her face owing to her exhausted and full condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll soon find that there isn't much difference between the two,\" Shuri responded. \"Now after you two are done digesting, I'll get dessert!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning gave a quiet groan at that, looking at her captain, who looked a bit more pleased at the prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Lighting, you will definitely be joining us next week at the same time, right? My husband never brings guests with appetites like yours around and I would be delighted to cook for you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be here,\" Lightning said, forcing down another belch from escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuri smiled at that and once again patted Lighting's stomach.</span></div></div>",

Vanille was to her left, in the same situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a routine scouting mission, the pair confident that they could handle whatever creature was in their way. Then they had run across an enormous Flan. It was almost as big as a King Behemoth but the worst part about it was the intelligent gleam emanating from it's eyes. During their fight the monster had managed to disarm Fang and Vanille with a deceptive trick. Then it knocked them out with a swipe of one arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang had awakened in her current predicament.

A bowl was held out to Fang, filled with a greenish goop, much like the color of the Flan's own flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang spit at the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoaring at her, Fang was prepared for a strike but the Flan instead turned towards Vanille and punched her hard in the stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bowl was then placed before Fang again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanille moaned in pain and Fang quickly took a bite of the strange gelatin-like substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it Fang had finished off the entire bowl. She could hear Vanille eating as well, the two locking eyes for a brief moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would have to trust in their friends to come and save them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang glanced down and looked at her trim abs, a tiny bit of flab now appearing among the muscles and she shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please get here soon,\" she said quietly, before the fullness in her stomach caused her to close here eyes.</span></div></div>",

But even though he was gone, the women in his life still thought about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his room Ryoko, the ochre eyed, cyan haired, semi-retired, space pirate phased through the wall as quietly as possible taking a cursory glance and making sure no one else was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, anybody there, anybody gonna stop me from looking around my Tenchi's room, no, okay then.\" Ryoko stiffled the giggle that threatened to escape her lips, giddy at how <i>clever</i> she was being. Being a space pirate Ryoko was never one to play fair, so she decided to go the direct route and search Tenchi's room for anything that could help her get a leg up on the competition. So stiffling the desire to ransack the room with all the finese of a drunken elephant, Ryoko starts to methodically search his room in all the places, according to late night TV, that boys liked to hide their naughty belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching through Tenchi's drawers, and noting that he was a breifs man, the back of his closet and under the bed, Ryoko was now digging beneath the matress and pulled out a magazene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, I knew my Tenchi wasn't such a paragon of goodness as everyone thinks he his.\" With a gleeful and muffled squeal Ryoko started flipping through the magazene and was stunned at what she saw. Sure enough it was full of scantily clad women in a number of provokative poses but what was really stunning was the fact that none of these women could be under 300 pounds, there was even a photo of two obese women dressed like sumos and wrestling with each other. As hard as it was for her to beleive the proof was right there in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenchi has a thing for fat girls!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo stunned was the space pirate that she didn't hear someone else come up behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryoko, what are you doing in Tenchi's room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoko lets off a surprised squwak and whips around to see</span></div></div>",

The first three Demon Sorceror's he'd tried to release from Limbo had been banished again almost as soon as they'd been able to return to the mortal plane.  The accursed Chan must be removed from the picture.

Perhaps less so, given that they lack any drive or imagination of their own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must remove Chan, and the rest of his meddlesome band, from our path if we are to succeed in releasing the last four Demon Sorcerors, and not have them cast back into the Nether as Po Kong, Xiao Fung, and Tchang Zu were.\" Shendu growled as he stalked back and forth, smoke still billowing from his mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFin, Ratso, and Chow began to emerge from their hiding places, all of them badly singed.  Only Hak Fu had avoided all of the flames. \"But how are we supposed to do that, Shen-Dude?\" Fin said, patting his still smouldering sleeve.  \"Chan's too good of a fighter for us, heck, even the Shadow Khan!\" Fin flinched backward as Shendu's baleful gaze fell on him but he continued.  \"He's just way too fast...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShendu paused, thinking.  \"Fast...yes,\" he said starting to grin.  \"Yes, we shall just have to slow Chan and the others down...won't we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to laugh at the simplicity of his idea, Shendu prepares a spell that will cause...</span></div></div>",

He has proved nearly as adept at defeating each of you as Chan has.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...Shendu...wha--?\" Finn began to ask after 15 more minutes passed in this fashion, but the query died on his lips under a glare that promised more flames if he continued to interrupt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Finn said quietly, \"If ya won't be needing us...\" Chow added with a nervous laugh, \"We'll....just get outta your hair.\" Finished Ratso.  And the three of them turned tail and practically fled from the cannery.  Hak Fu remained, standing a silent sentinel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly half an hour later Shendu called to his Shadow Khan again, and bade them retrieve the necessary spell ingredients.  Mindless and without imagination though the Khan were, on errands such as this they were far more efficient than human enforcers, especially seeing to the rarity of a few of the ingredients (these the Khan stole from Uncle's own personal store of ingredients, and for once managed to remain completely undetected).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the benighted ninjas handed over the ingredients and Shendu began to concoct the spell, chanting softly as he did.  The flame in the basin changing color as he dropped in each herb and powder, and giving off ever thicker smoke.  As Shendu's incantation reached a crescendo an orb of flames, smoke, and what appeared to be pure light began to form above the basin.  As a final touch, Shendu breathed a gout of flame directly into the orb, which brightened to a dazziling glare and exploded outward in a gust of hot air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, we wait...\" Shendu said, looking pleased. </span></div></div>",
