She opened her eyes and picked the smartphone off of her sweat dampened pillow. \u201cFuck\u2026\u201d She grumbled as she swiped to see the text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up and stretching her arms above her head, it was revealed she\u2019s wearing a sweaty bra and panties and nothing else. What\u2019s a girl to do though, it was a hot night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanting her wide and unwashed feet onto the carpet of her bedroom, she stood up. \u201cDamn...I\u2019m gonna get an earful from that prick manager.\u201d She grumbled as she went to get dressed, not bothering with a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was late for work after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\nAn obnoxiously loud motorcycle pulled into the E-Z Mart parking lot. Trish was astride the vehicle, no helmet as usual. As she killed the engine and stomped down the kickstand, her manager came out angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish felt her temper flare as she saw the pudgy man coming at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n\u201cFashionably late as usual, huh?\u201d he asked--though it was more of an accusation than anything. \u201cI guess you think this place runs itself. Well, it doesn\u2019t, you good-for-nothing dropout!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish really didn\u2019t have time for his bullshit today. She walked into the gas station at a fast enough pace that her shithead manager had to waddle to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you act like this won\u2019t have consequences, you lousy bitch! The only reason you haven\u2019t been fired by now is because I don\u2019t have anyone to replace you with.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, like anyone would want some short-fused, stuck-up fuck like you to hire them,\u201d Trish muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust beating myself up over waking up late, Dixon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d better be!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trudged over to his office, went through the door, and slammed it shut. For a split second, he opened it, yelling: \u201cAnd have the goddamn decency to take a shower for once!\u201d before promptly shutting it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both of them back on the daily routine, Trish took a moment to steam to herself about the unrelenting shittiness of her job. How the hell did someone like that obese turd of a human being Dixon manage to become manager? Why is he so obsessed with her personal hygiene? Why does he keep chewing her out over the slightest fuck-up? She hasn\u2019t been late in like, two weeks! Fucking asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPounding a fist against the marble counter, she started dreaming up scenarios about her boss being powerless and humiliated. All of them had one thing in common: he was shrunk and in her control. She imagined him squirming on the ground, hiding from anything and everything like the wuss he was; she imagined him being crushed beneath her filthy boots, like a bug; her mind wandered to what he said to her just before, and she began to incorporate it into her torture fantasies. She\u2019d pick him up and drop him in the same boots she used to crush him, and he\u2019d have to deal with her feminine musk, whether he liked it or not (he didn\u2019t).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her daydreams continued, something indescribable was about to take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDixon was leaning back on his horribly overworked chair, his thoughts consumed with Trish and her unbearable laziness. You\u2019re not supposed to be late period, you ingrate! You should be gone by now! In the back of his mind, he did realize that it was nice to have her around; maybe not as an employee, per se, but as a chew toy. After all, someone had to suffer for all the injustices he\u2019s faced--like his car getting towed last week! How was he supposed to know that double parking in the handicapped spots was illegal?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDixon got up and started pacing around the room. \u201cOooh, you\u2019re gonna pay for pissing me off, Trish,\u201d he growled as he thought up ways to make the smelly, punk bitch miserable. Should he make her work late? Maybe put her on the graveyard shift? Nah, she\u2019d probably enjoy not having me around\u2026not to mention that she\u2019d drag down Dan and encourage him to slack off. \u201cWhy does he like hanging around her, anyway? Can\u2019t be her personality\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh right, how could he forget! The one thing every worker hates, no matter what their profession is: unpaid overtime! It\u2019s not like she\u2019s too popular with the higher-ups, and nobody really gives a shit about the equity and quality of life of gas station staff; not to mention that she doesn\u2019t have any other job to run back to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoy oh boy, I can\u2019t wait to make that bitch\u2019s life hell\u2026\u201d Dixon continued to cackle and rock in his chair at his mischievous plan, his genius known only to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, an eerie, unpleasant shiver washed over his body, and he suddenly started to sweat. Was his mind finally creating something resembling a conscience? Did he have the meat sweats again? No, this was something else. Something...unnatural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing that these might be the signs of some kind of heart attack or stroke, he began to dial 911 on his desk phone. Before he got the chance to answer, his body began to shrink, his body contracting down into his clothes. In the span of a few seconds, he was completely trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing into a primal, instinctual level of self-preservation, Dixon wrangled around in his XL polo shirt, thrashing around aimlessly. It took him a whole 15 minutes to do so, and by the end of it he was panting like he just ran a marathon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out from the sleeve of his shirt, he swung his head around frantically, trying to identify anything that could kill him at this size. He then realized that there was one very obvious thing could get him killed; it was tall, sleazy, and started with the letter T.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god, I can\u2019t let that giant harpy find me! As long as I can get to the front door, anywhere is safer than here! After making sure that some stray spider or cockroach or whatever wouldn\u2019t leap out and make a snack out of him, he carefully made his way towards the door.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a spin-off of sorts of my Carmen The Tomboy Giantess interactive. The Trish character first made her debut in that interactive as one of Carmen's friends/bad influences. Given my proclivity towards bad-girls, I thought we should dedicate an interactive entirely to the punk biker herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-Characters-</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish Beluga:<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nOccupation: Gas Station Cashier<br>\r\nDemeanor: Kind (or at least not hostile) to customers who are kind to her, but has a very quick temper when you piss her off. <br>\r\nCo-Workers: Dan Dulhoon, Dixon Knots (boss)<br>\r\nFriends: Dan, Shawna, Tambry, Audrey, Clair<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDixon Knots:<br>\r\nAge: Mid-30s<br>\r\nOccupation: Gas Station Manager<br>\r\nDemeanor: Cross, Short-Tempered<br>\r\nRelationship with Trish: They have an awful relationship. Dixon thinks she\u2019s a lazy, useless layabout, and Trish thinks he\u2019s an equally lazy, overbearing, hypocritical jackass; unfortunately for her, he has all the power in the workplace...for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan Dulhoon:<br>\r\nAge: 20<br>\r\nOccupation: Gas Station Janitor/Clerk<br>\r\nRelationship with Trish: He and Trish are pretty friendly with each other, and he doesn\u2019t like the way that Dixon immediately assumes the worst of her. He has a slight foot fetish, and looks the other way when Trish takes off her work boots, even when it means an extra mess to clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawna Powers: <br>\r\nAge: 20<br>\r\nBio: Black skinned beauty with braided hair and spectacularly enormous boobs and booty. Hangs out with Trish's gang and is the loudest of them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTambry Jacobs: <br>\r\nAge: 21<br>\r\nBio: The only one of Trish's friends to have done hard time behind bars. She may be the most violent and dangerous of Trish's crew...at least until Trish's new powers kick in. Short black hair and several tattoos, she is the group's designated booze buyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey Justeen: <br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nBio: The rich brat of the group, has paid their bail on occasion when things got really crazy. Not to mention her family owns most of the town and makes sure none of them face any real punishment for their misdeeds. Blonde (go figure) and slutty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair DeLune: <br>\r\nAge: 17<br>\r\nBio: The skater girl of the team. Skateboards everywhere and wears the traditional beanie and torn jeans typically worn by her type. Is the most smart mouthed of them.<br>\r\n</td>",
