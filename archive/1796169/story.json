Daven looked around and saw a table with a sign up sheet. Daven walked up to the table and noticed that there were three lines. One line was short, one was long and one was very long. Daven walked to the short one.<br>\r\n After a couple of minutes Daven was finally at the desk. He was face to face with a manager. The manager loked him up and down and said, \"Names please.\" Daven replied, \"Daven Kat and Kit Addison.\" The manager looked at the list and made a check mark. Afterwards he said, \"You are the tenth contestant please go to the waiting area and we will set you up with your first match..\" Daven did as he was told and waited.<br>\r\n After about a half hour later his munber was called and he was ready to fight. Daven being a ninja was a very experienced fighter that knew his skills well. Kit was a dancer that wasn't trained as a fighter, but her ability to throw fire and her agility from dancing makes up for her inexperience. Daven was ready as well as Kit.<br>\r\n Daven walked into the arena and waited to see his opponent enter the arena. He waited when suddenly an announcer shouted, \" Ladies and gentlemen we present to you a battle of strength and wits! Welcome to the Golden Knights arena. After the announcer got done talking a door opened and released a bear. <br>\r\n The bear wasn't a normal bear. It had claws and fur, but the tail was long and spikey. Daven hasn't seen this type of bear before but he knew that he had to fight it the first round. The bear roared and got on it's fours. Kit said, \"Are you ready? It's about to charge!\" <br>\r\nThe bear charged but Daven teleported behind it. Kit threw a fireball. The bear was dazed yet it didn't catch on fire. It missed Kit because of this and Daven followed up by throwing a ninja star. The bear turned around and saw the ninja star. The ninja star got stuck into it's skull but didn't affect the bear too much. The bear was furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?      </span></div></div>",

Knowing this meant that he could only take down the bear by out smarting it. The bear charged at him.<br>\r\nKit watched Daven teleport away like last time but she knew that something more had to be done in order to defeat the bear. The bear hit the wall and got stuck because of the ninja star stuck in its head. This was their chance to make a move.<br>\r\nDaven appeared next to Kit. <br>\r\nDaven: So what do we do, this thing is clearly stronger than us.<br>\r\nKit: Its head is stuck in the wall which gives us an advantage. <br>\r\nThe bear was still struggling to get out the wall. There was something odd glowing underneath it.<br>\r\nKit: (notices the glowing ball) Hmm, do you see that ball there?<br>\r\nDaven: How could I miss it? What do you have in mind.<br>\r\nKit: Let's see what happens if we can hit it.<br>\r\nDaven: Ah, it might be a weak spot. Gotcha.<br>\r\nKit: Let's go!<br>\r\nThe bear managed to pry itself out of the wall. It was furious but didn't see Daven nor Kit. Confused, it looked around frantically. Daven and Kit were both behind it. <br>\r\nDaven waited for the glowing ball to be shown again. It was and he threw another star at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He brought his new ninja suit and classic katana and a small shuriken. Today was a unusual day because he was ready to fight. <br>\r\nHe walked into the arena and sees nothing but open space and a large crowd. He was excited to face his next challenge for arena battles were not new to him.<br>\r\n He stands there feeling confident to bring his girl friend, Kit a new trophy. However he didn't know who or what he was going to face. What was mere minutes felt like hours to him as he anxiously listens to the announcer introduce his opponent. <br>\r\n The gates open and Daven sees a womanly figure walk into the scene. He gets ready for he doesn't know what is going to happen next. The figure was wearing a red robe with a hood and carrying a small dagger. He waited patiently for the figure to introduce herself. The opponent took off her hood and it revealed a face with blue eyes. It was Kit.<br>\r\n Daven's eyes widened in shock for he knew that he didn't want to harm one of his best friends. He wasn't afraid to fight a girl for he has done it before, but he was afraid of hurting his friend. Kit looked and saw the expression on his face. She didn't know that she was going to fight her boy friend Daven. They were both in a bad situation. <br>\r\nDaven: What, Kit what are you doing here.<br>\r\nKit: I should ask you the same.<br>\r\nDaven: They tricked us!<br>\r\nKit: Yeah but there is only one way out.
