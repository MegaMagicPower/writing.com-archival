            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zuko was sitting at a table with a red suit on beside his wife Mai.  She was in an elegant black dress with a ruby necklace and red thin silk scarf.  She had her two side tails as per usual, only she had two gold hair jewelry pieces.  They were 2 inch long gold hoops with rubies with hair pulled through them and tied into a braid under the hoops to keep them in place.  Mai smiled as she had a hand on his as he took a sip from a spoon that had soup from his bowl.  Mai just sat there with a smile as she looked across the table.  <br>\r\nSong sat eating her salad wearing a green dress that had a left quarter long sleeve.  She wore a white chocker made of silk.  Her elbow long white gloves were lovely.  Her hair was pulled into a tail pulled into a pony tail with the hair pulled from the middle of the scalp.  Giving a clear view to her bronze hair jewelry of a half inch long hoop with emerald in the shape of a disc on the hair jewelry hoop.  <br>\r\nKatara sat at the table popping a grape into her mouth.  She wore a shoulderless light blue dress with the dress hanging onto her cleavage giving plenty of view.  She wore her hair in her normal style only on her hair loopies were a pair of hair jewelry pieces that were a series of silver rings with sapphire stones on them held by a chain to slide on the hair loopies without damaging them.<br>\r\nAnd at the table were the last two women.  Meng was sitting with her green Chinese dress on with gold line art of flower petals blowing into the wind with crawling badger moles.  She had a diamond cut out on her cleavage.  On her right wrist was a gold border green cloth tied on.  <br>\r\nJin was wearing a puffy yellow tank top with bicep sleeves that were shoulderless.  She wore a green skirt and had her hair long with the hair brushed straight.  <br>\r\nAang was sitting at the table as well wearing a yellow suit with white under shirt.  He smiled as Zuko then stood up and tapped his glass.  The restaurant got quiet as the girls and boys at the table stopped eating.  <br>\r\nZuko then smiled as he reached for a small box by his soup.  He then picked up th ered velvet box.  He walked over to Jin who blushed and began to shake with raw nerves.  Smiling Song reached over to hold the girl's hand to help her to stop from shaking.  Zuko then opened the box to show a black metal hair jewelry hoop.  It was an inch and half long with three topazes going down in a line.  Song stood up as she went to Zuko's chair.  Zuko then took a seat as he asked her sitting across from Jing.<br>\r\nZuko then asked her the question, \u201cJin, could you honor me with marriage?\u201d<br>\r\nCrying into her hand she then said with a squeal, \u201cYe-yes!  YES!\u201d<br>\r\nShe then hugged him in a full tackle.  Two spikes of earth came out of the floor as Iroh sighed.  He then looked at Haru as the young man earth bent the floor back into place.  <br>\r\nThe other girls at the table were clapping as Aang then lifted a glass.  Everyone stopped as they waited for him to say something, \u201cTo the soon to be happy groom and bride, merry marriage asking day!\u201d<br>\r\nPeople clapped and people cheered as girls congratulated Jin on her proposal.<br>\r\nSokka was in a long blue trench coat.  He had on a black belt with his sword attached.  He put on a hat as he pulled on a pair gloves.  He wrapped a scarf around his neck as he grabbed a flower.  Sokka began to walk to the front door.  <br>\r\nHe was stopped by Suki's voice as she asked him, \u201cWhen Sokka?\u201d<br>\r\nSokka stopped as he then turned to her, \u201cYou know when.\u201d<br>\r\nSuki then nodded as she stood up.  She then went up to him as she pulled his scarf tighter and tucked it into his coat.  She then said to him, \u201c11, we have brunch with the girls.\u201d<br>\r\nSokka nodded as he kissed her on the lips.  He then walked out the door as he braved the cold morning.  The sun was just above the horizon with the sky beginning to light up as he made his way out.<br>\r\nInside the mansion he had exited a girl throwing up was heard as Suki went to find out who it was.  She came to a door as she opend it to see Azula in her red night gown throwing up into the toilet.  Suki then went over and stoked her back as she grabbed her hair holding it back.  Azula let out more as she then coughed and pulled back.  <br>\r\nSuki then smiled as Azula then said to her threatening, \u201cTell him before I do and I'll burn that smirk right off.\u201d<br>\r\nSuki shook her head as she said to Azula, \u201cOf course not.\u201d<br>\r\nSokka was at the front of a hospital as he walked inside.  He walked to an elevator after checking in.  He waited until the elevator took him to the third floor and he walked down the coma ward.  He came to a bed that had one of the most beautiful girls in it.  It was Yue with her long hair tied into her elegant hair loopies.  They were long now and a little unkept.  <br>\r\nSokka sat down by her bed as he took her hair and undid the fancy elegant braids to her hair loopies.  He began to brush her hair as he moved her and then he began to tie her hair into braids.  He then said to her as a couple of tears came to his eyes, \u201cI miss you Yue, I really do.\u201d<br>\r\nFIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE<br>\r\nZuko groaned as he felt something good on him.  He felt wet as he then woke up and saw a large round bump in the blanket. He then pulled up as he saw Jin as she licked him.  She then smiled at him and said with a lustful smile, \u201cOh, hi Zuko, I hope you don't mind if I continue the celebration from last night some more?\u201d<br>\r\nZuko grinned as he said to her, \u201cOf course not.\u201d<br>\r\nJin then smiled as she went back to licking and eating as Zuko reclined back.  He heard her slurp on her morning meal as he then heard a knock.  He groaned as he then said with a strained voice, \u201cCan it wait?\u201d<br>\r\nThe door opened with Mai walking in as she said to him, \u201cWe have a brunch to go to in an hour.  I suggest that you finish the morning snack before going to brunch with the rest of us.  Also, try to wear something casual, but not too casual.\u201d<br>\r\nMai then left the room as Zuko groaned and shook.  He was red in the face as he let out large pants of red flame from his mouth.  He gripped his hands into fists as he tried to control himself.  Suddenly, he let out a long and loud moan as his flame change from red to yellow with red surrounding it.  He then hit the bed as the flame became small bursts.  He then sighed as sweat was coming from him.<br>\r\nMai smiled softly as she said to Jin, \u201cI see you can't resist finding the P-Spot either.\u201d<br>\r\nJin then crawled out from under the blanket as she whiped her mouth with a gulp.  She then said with a smile, \u201cNope.\u201d<br>\r\nMai then pointed at the corner of her own lip as she said to Jin, \u201cYou left some.\u201d<br>\r\nJin then licked the outside of her lips as she got up the frosting from breakfast.  Jin then walked out with a shake as she said to him, \u201cI'm going to go get dressed Zuko.\u201d<br>\r\nMai then said looking back at him, \u201cShe's done it now.\u201d<br>\r\nZuko asked still reeling back from his morning work out, \u201cDone what?\u201d<br>\r\nMai said walking out with a grin and shake, \u201cGet revved up for tonight lover boy.\u201d<br>\r\nOn Ji was wearing her red hoodie and gold short shorts.  She took a gulp of her water as she then began to run again.  She then put the cap on the water bottle as she then ran down the steps.  She enjoyed the park outside her apartment.  <br>\r\nBut, what she enjoyed even more was seeing her boyfriend.  She smiled as she then ran up to Aang who sat on a bench.  He had her favorite morning snack, blueberry frosted donuts.  Oh, what did she do for the universe to deserve such a handsome and perfect man.  <br>\r\nAang stood up as he smiled at her as she came to a stop.  She then took one of the offered donuts.  She bit on it as she ate it slowly.  Aang hugged On Ji as the two smiled and enjoyed the hug.  Aang then asked her as he put the box away in his bag, \u201cYou ready for brunch?\u201d<br>\r\nOn Ji nervous then shook her head as she said to him, \u201cNo, but I am tired of waiting to meet your family.  So, let's go.\u201d<br>\r\nSmiling Aang then put his arm around her shoulder as the pair began to walk.<br>\r\nSokka took off his trench coat as he walked into a Jasmine Dragon.  He wore a black class b shirt with his blue uniform slacks.  He walked over to the table with Zuko, Mai, Ty Lee, Katara, Suki, Meng, Jin, Song, Toph, Azula and Kaya.  Sokka smiled as he pulled out a chair after bending over giving kisses to Kaya, Azula, Suki and Ty Lee.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On Ji, this is my family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone smiled as they greeted her and introduced themselves individually.  On Ji was slightly shocked when she heard that Katara, Toph and Meng were all Aang's girlfriend or wife.  Sokka then said to her as he took a piece of bacon, \u201cHe's an Air Nomad, that's how they are.  Multiple partners in life and all, and trust me he won't mind if you sleep with someone else either.  We're all pretty open here, heck me and Zuko had that homo phase six years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko looking mad said to, \u201cI thought we said we'd never bring it up again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai then said to him just so he would hear, \u201cNo fair, you said that I would get that kind of action for my birthday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko said to her, \u201cMe and Sokka will, but let's not talk about it in front of the tyro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in understanding Mai then kissed him as she out loud said to cover up the private conversation, \u201cI love you too, Zuko.\u201d<br>\r\nZuko stroked her cheek as she then nuzzled his neck.  On Ji was very surprised by all the emotions going on.  Ty Lee and Suki were holding hands as they smiled.  Jin was obviously doing something naughty to Song as she was holding back moans.  On Ji could not believe what was going on.  Then she saw Aang kiss Katara as he went over to Toph and kissed her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Ji finally sat down as everyone ate from the large plates of meat, eggs, pancakes, burgers and biscuits.  Waiters and waitresses came to fill tea as they all talked.  On Ji eventually got comfortable with the situation and even was talking with Katara.  The more experienced partner flirted with her saying that the short shorts were really cute on her.  On Ji blushed at the compliment as she had commented on Katara's medium heels and how they looked good on her.  The two had to go shopping some time so they could be girly Toph complained making everyone laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then decided it was time as she stood up.  Everyone quieted down as she then coughed.  Sokka looked at her expectantly as he waited for what she had to say.  He waited for her to be comfortable and then she began to talk, \u201cEveryone, I would like to say on everyone's behalf.  That we are happy to welcome On Ji as a new member to our little family.  And hope that she stays with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone smiled and said here here.  Azula continued as she then said to the group, \u201cOn a similar note, I would like to make a special announcement.  About a month ago it was Sokka and my anniversary, our third anniversary.  And I would like to say that thanks to Ty Lee's help, me and Sokka celebrated it like we should have.  We were going through a small rough patch with being pressured by my body.  We just have been working so hard for the last year and I would like to tell you all that our hard work has paid off.  As we all agreed when we started this community, that any and all children would be considered ours.  No one would be father or mother, we all would.  And so, Sokka my lovely husband, Zuko my brother and Aang my husband's best friend.  Mai my sister that I never was born with, Ty Lee my best friend, Suki my fellow wife, Jin my girlfriend, Katara my frenemy, Meng, Kaya, Song and Toph that are my friends.  I'd like to let you know that you will all be mommies and daddies 8 months from now.\u201d<br>\r\nEveryone cheered and toasted as Sokka then smiled.  He literally ran on top of the table as he leaped at her.  She screamed in a fun manner as Suki and Ty Lee caught him.  The four hugged and were joined by Kaya.  Everyone with the exception of On Ji gave hugs and congratulations all around.  Sokka then lifted up Azula as she squealed and was lifted into the air onto his shoulders.  She then laughed and told him to put her down as he said he would never do that.  The moment was memorialized by Iroh taking a picture of the event.  Today was the greatest day of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i></i></b>  Now, it is your chance to change the story around.  Please pick one of the choices below.

She had mellowed out considerably from her teenage years, and the love of Sokka and the others had done much to help her pull through her various issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he is!\" she chirped, giving Azula a tight hug and a perhaps-not-entirely-platonic kiss on the cheek. \"You're going to have a <i>baby!</i> That's like the best kind of news there is!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula laughed, and she reciprocated Ty Lee's hug and kiss (though the latter was on the lips, as opposed to the cheek).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I suppose it is, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is,\" said Kaya demurely, cheerfully, smiling at the antics of the two best friends and fellow wives. \"It means a new addition to our family, a little son or daughter for us all to spoil and dote on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she agreed, joining Ty Lee in giving Azula another congratulatory hug. \"We're happy for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka smiled at the sight of some of the women he loved the most in the world looking so happy, and he went over and wrapped them all up in a great big bear hug, giving them plenty of playful, affectionate kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is one of the happiest days of my life!\" he said proudly, with a loud, hearty guffaw, and the girls joined him in revelry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

It's going to be a long trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded as he said with a sigh, \"Yeah, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then hung up his phone as he said to the girls sadly, \"Sorry, girls, that was work.  They want me to come in to fix a corporal's mistake on some paper work about me.  A Lieutenant's job is never finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula pouted as she said with a slight whine, \"Are you sure?  I mean can't you just do it during drill this week end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head he said to her with a sad response, \"Sorry, babe, but be sure to keep the baby safe.  Speaking of drill as long as I'm there, I'll just check into the barracks to stay there til drill is over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked inside Sokka went to the closet as he opened it.

Behind her were Azula, Suki, and Kaya, and all of them had a very meaningful sort of expression on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For good luck,\" said Ty Lee with a giggle, giving him a deep kiss on the lips, which Sokka found himself hungrily reciprocating despite the technically urgent nature of his call. Almost against his will, his hands made their way down Ty Lee's back, and they came to rest on the generous curve of her shapely, toned posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe purred into his mouth at the feeling of his large, calloused hands gently, lovingly squeezing her behind, and she pressed herself tightly against him, feeling the hardness of his erection which pressed against her abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki, meanwhile, slipped around past Ty Lee, wrapping her arms around Sokka's bare, toned chest from the sides as she leaned in to plant a kiss on his cheek, even as he continued to kiss Ty Lee. Kaya did similar from the other side of Sokka, though she favored a handful of his firm buttocks -- and when had his underwear come off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula, for her part, pressed into her friend, Ty Lee, from behind, her bosom mashing interestingly into the bubbly girl's back. She playfully nibbled at one of Ty Lee's ears, reaching her hands around and up her friend's blouse to tease her very generous endowments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Sokka had to leave so shortly, they did not have the time to give their husband a proper farewell -- or at least, not the sort to which they had grown accustomed -- but they still gave him a lot to think fondly on when he left to take care of business, and a reason to get done quickly and return home soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was, Sokka probably should not have lingered so long with his farewell kisses, but the girls made it very hard to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had a talent for making certain things hard, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut ultimately, after a few minutes Sokka <i>did</i> have to finish getting dressed, then leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take too long,\" said Azula, giving him one last peck on the cheek as he went out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't,\" he assured her, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't get hurt, either,\" said Suki, giving him a sharp, knowing look. Then she added: \"I'd never hear the end of it from Yue or Katara, if I didn't tell you that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka gave her a halfwit grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of <i>course</i> I won't,\" he promised. \"You know how those two worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he gave each of the girls one last, lingering kiss on the lips apiece before setting off in the direction of the barracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully there wouldn't be any... <i>complications</i>... with the assignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

But, remember, Jeong Jeong is your priority.  Now, Admiral Zhao Kwok and Sanjit Manda are not here at Two Headed Fish Island.  But, from what we understand there are 3,000 troops here and 14 of their best ships.  Among them is the Former Southern Water Tribe Polar Bear Dog class ship, the FIRE QUENCHER.  This part of the mission is where Jet and Haru come in.  Seeing as the barrel we are going to send the four of you on shall be useless it is your job to come back to friendly waters on the FIRE QUENCHER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet looked to Haru as the pair nodded.  Chey then said to the pair, \"Alright, the ship is a real morale booster to the boys if we can get it.  The White Lotus has had a bad losing streak as of late as you know.  The war is looking bad for us, and we need a turn around.  So, are you capable of doing it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four then nodded as they then said with a salutes, \"Yes sir.\"</span></div></div>",

The tongues of red and orange and yellow were banished as quickly as they had appeared, quenched in a controlled spurt of water and hissing, billowing steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSangok bent the water that hadn't been evaporated by the flames back into his camel pack, and the steam he deftly re-condensed to join the rest of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditionally, as Sangok had been dousing the flames, Longshot had quickly, intuitively calculated the most likely location of their source from what he had seen of the fireball's trajectory. Even as the illuminating fire vanished in steam and darkness, he swiftly, silently drew his bow and knocked an arrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even as Sangok bent the water back into his pack and Sokka began hissing out commands, Longshot loosed the arrow. He did not watch or listen to see if the missile would find its mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe <i>knew</i> it would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this happened within the span of a few seconds, and even as the sharp, strangled cry of a sentry came down from atop the wall, Sokka was leading them into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've got firebenders on the wall,\" he snapped out at just scarcely above a whisper, as gold and crimson sparks began to appear in intervals atop the fortified defensive structure, lighting up the night air as posted sentries and spotters leaped to attention. \"We need to get under cover before they decide to start roasting the whole area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe indicated the barren, stony ground on which they stood, where in the dimly flickering light of the impromptu firebender spotlights they could see the signs of heavy scorching and charring.

The three of them stood and ran towards the wall, but 'they' were ready for the trio. Sangok Blocked two blasts of fire with the water he had with them. They were great blasts which meant that his own supply of water was diminished significantly. They continued to run almost there when another blast of fire shot out. Sangok once again moved to extinguish the blast with his own element. He did not see the arrow that had been fired moments later, taking cover behind the blast of fire. The arrow would have struck true were it not for Longshot's dexterity. The master marksman's keen eyes spotted the arrow and he loosed his own projectile, which struck the enemy arrow mid flight, deflecting it away from its prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the three were behind the wall before another moment passed. \"Okay, Sokka said his mind working overtime, to adjust his plan as they witnessed their new surroundings, \"We can beat a hasty retreat to the water from here. This hut should give us cover for most of the way there.\"  Longshot nodded, showing his acceptance of the plan. Sangok let out a small sigh \"I\u2019m glad you suggested that, my pack is already getting low. It seemed like they were all ready for this new plan. Sokka used his hands to count down so that they could move together. He indicated with three fingers, then two, then one. As soon as the last finger curled into his fist three ran as fast as they could towards the water line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards wouldn't make it that easy, as soon as they were spotted again, fire and arrows began to rain down from the walls, Sokka knew his only hope was to get to the water. They had almost made, when Sangok moved to use the last of his water to block a jet of flame that was heading straight for Longshot.  There wasn't enough though and the force of the blast caused Sangok to stumble back tripping onto his back. A sharp pain shot out from the water bender's ankle. Without a second thought Sokka turned Grabbing Sangok and dragging him the rest of the way into the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSangok, moving his arms forced the water to surround the three of them and create a temporary air pocket inside the water. \"Are you alright?\" Sokka asked his companion immediately moving quickly to examine the injured foot. \"I think so\" Sangok replied. Sokka looked at the injury confirming \"It looks like you may have sprained it.\" Sangok let out a heavy breath. \"Not a good start then?\" he commented. \"It's okay. Sokka responded, now that we've made it here we can move up and down the beach as we please. You can waterbend the water away as we walk the rest of the way.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLongshot helped to support the man as they went. The sprained foot made water bending difficult for Sangok. Sokka could see it was taking a lot out of the man as they went. Sokka had the three of them continue as far down the beach as he thought Sangok could take them before commanding them to go back up. It seemed to work well enough. The three managed to get to the wall without any further trouble; it appeared that there were groups searching for them near the beach where they had submerged themselves. The plan was working for now, but it had cost them dearly. Sangok now needed someone to help support his weight and the man was already greatly fatigued. Sokka took Sangok from Longshot. The quiet man attached a customized arrow to his bow and shot it over the wall. It acted as a grappling hook and landed with the precision that the sniper always had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka realized that it would be very difficult for Sangok to cross the wall now, and if he did it would sap any remaining strength that the man had left. Sokka looked back at the roaming scouts. They were slowly getting closer to their position. If he left Sangok they may discover him. As the leader Sokka knew he had to make a difficult call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could tell Sangok to remain behind and try to keep hidden<br>\r\n<br>\r\nor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake Sangok with them, but deplete the man's strength leaving him virtually defenseless.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If they fire bend the mirrors will catch the light and the mirrors will slip back thanks to the pushing of heat and photons.  The small shafts that they are leaning on will push the triggers and bolts will fire.  This will produce false locations while we sneak up to the wall.

As they made their way to the wall fire was bent out and bolts were fired at the wall.  Sokka began to climb up the wall with climbing palm claws.  He placed in spikes along the cord making a path for the guys.  As he got up the wall he put in the last spike and unclipped his belt.  He threw his boomerang at the first bender he saw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bender fell down the wall with a scream as there was a thud.  Sokka grabbed his space sword as he went into battle.  A bender ran at him as he threw his fist at him.  Sokka ducked and slid as he swung up his sword at the man's arm.  Just as the flames began to come out of the fist the arm was cut off cleanly right through the elbow.  The girl screamed as he then punched her face and stabbed her in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then moved in attacking two more benders as they fought with fire daggers.  Sokka moved and leaped to the side off the small border wall.  He spun as he landed and cleaned their necks of their heads.  Long Shot got to the top as he knocked arrows and let them fly at the last three benders.  Sangok got to the top as they heard bells being tolled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoldiers were coming out as they searched for the intruders.

It wasn't full, or the noise wouldn't have been so evident, but there was still a decent amount inside it.

Like a thing of terror, he descended upon them, and ere any could even react, there were eight new corpses littering the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree of the newly deceased had a single, black-feathered bolt each sticking from their throat. Three more had their throats cleanly slit, sliced by an edge finer and keener than any of steel or iron. One had a part of his skull caved in by a heavy blow to the back of the head, and the last had two or so feet of black, extraterrestrial steel protruding from her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe defending forces did not have time to assess these injuries personally, however, as they were understandably preoccupied with the presence of the individuals responsible for the deaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne soldier drew a pair of broad, curved dao from his back, while another lowered a long, keen spear at the intruders. Two more, coming in for support, punched their fists forward, one shooting forth flame and the other a burst of compressed, swirling air -- one of the rebel airbenders for which the Hurricane Horde had originally gotten its name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSangok, reacting quickly, moved his arms, and wall of water -- smaller than he would have liked, but nonetheless sufficient for his purposes -- intercepted the elemental attacks. Most of it burst into steam, but he used his waterbending to quickly cool and condense it back into liquid, which he swirled around his body in a hoop of flowing water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLongshot fired off two arrows, getting the firebender in the eye, bringing him down. The airbender, however, managed to half-deflect, half-dodge the missile, before making to retaliate with a spinning parkour chop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWisely, the three jumped out of the way, narrowly avoiding getting cut in half by the resultant blade of wind -- the airbender's comrades were not so agile, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka grimaced, understanding all too well why the Air Nomads traditionally <i>forbade</i> the use of air for attack against living things, and emphasized so strongly on defense -- a competent airbender could easily cut through solid stone with their element, if they focused, and you couldn't really <i>block</i> a blade made of <i>air</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he did not let this daunt him, and springing forth with a loud cry, he closed the distance between him and the airbender. In a fraction of a second, he was upon his foe, and he raised his weapon high. Gray eyes widened momentarily in surprise, before rolling into the back of the head as the hard, azure ball of a Water Tribe war club was brought down on the unarmored skull with a sickly <i>CRUNCH</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe airbender dropped to the ground, dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka, Longshot, and Sangok did not waste any time waiting for reinforcements to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came across a few more enemies as they made their way to the prison near the heart of the compound, but between Sokka's weapons, Longshot's aim, and Sangok's waterbending, none of them stood a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they were inside the prison building, cutting down the few remaining guards who had not been permitted to leave their posts to respond to the alarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they began their search.

Being able to spend up to days at a time in a meditative trance could probably be very useful in Jeong-Jeong's predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout need for prompting, Sangok used his waterbending to freeze the lock on the cell door, and then shatter it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise was just loud enough to draw the grizzled White Lotus general's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sokka Mawii'aa, I presume?\" said Jeong-Jeong gruffly, tersely, cracking open a single eye to survey the specialist. \"I was expecting you sooner than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ran into some trouble,\" was all Sokka said, before walking into the cell using his sword to deftly cut the chains from the firebender's manacles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeong-Jeong, free to move once more, stood up with little difficulty. He did not seem to have nearly as much trouble moving as Sokka might have expected from an ordinary person, but then leadership of the White Lotus armies were just about anything <i>but</i> ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you have arranged a way to get us <i>off</i> of this island?\" the general inquired dryly, massaging his sore wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jet and Haru should be taking care of it as we speak,\" interjected Sangok, and Jeong-Jeong nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then,\" he said. \"Let us depart, before anyone catches wise to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then a voice spoke from behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I already <i>have</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

He was handsome, or at least he <i>would </i>have been, if not for the gruesome, jagged scar which ran diagonally across his face, from his temple to the side of his chin, running between his eyes and through his nose (from which a good chunk was missing). He was sneering at Sokka, and <i>solely</i> at Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn either side, he was flanked by three soldiers -- four were equipped with waterbending camel packs, similar to Sangok's, and the other two each bore a long, thin, wooden staffs in a fashion like yet unlike that of the Air Nomads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're certainly looking as charming as ever,\" said Sokka snidely, darkly, in attempt to temper the ice cold <b>hate</b> flowing through his veins with wit and sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn snarled, raising a hand to the scar on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I have forgotten, <i>Mawii'aa,</i>\" the young commander hissed, spitting out Sokka's family name like it was a piece of rancid meat. \"Don't think that I will <i>ever</i> forget what you took from me,\" he murmured coldly. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHis eyes were on Sokka, and Sokka alone. And Sokka's eyes were likewise focused exclusively on Hahn.

As far as he was concerned, he and Hahn were the only ones present in the building. \"And <i>you</i> attacked <i>me</i>.

Both were men of the Water Tribe, proud and strong, and resourceful and cunning. They were, in many ways, cut from the same mold, mirror opposites of one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another time, perhaps, they could have been friends, at least or rivals, but not here, not now. No, there was too much blood between them, and they were on opposite sides of a war, besides. They were bitter foes. They hated each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hahn's hate was hot and fiery, wild and undirected. When Yue left him for Sokka, he lost something, the part of himself that had made him a decent human being. He had attempted to take her back by force, to kill Yue's lover and bind her to himself forevermore, to chain her to him so she could never again leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn had let his anger consume him, and Sokka had easily stopped him, had easily cut his face with that damned black sword. He had betrayed his people, embittered and filled with a formless, writhing hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka, in that way, was NOT like Hahn. He hated the man, yes, but his was a cold hate, as cold as the eternal glaciers of his ancestral homeland. It was as sharp as his sword, carefully honed, at directed solely at Hahn. His hate was the hate of good man who witnesses another commit unimaginable evil, and realizes that this person must be stopped. It was impersonal, rational, calculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger did not consume Sokka. Not in battle. It may have fueled his strength, may have lent power to his limbs, but it did not rule him. No, Sokka was a clever man, more intelligent by far than most would give him credit. He saw his anger as a tool, a resource to be used, a means to an end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used his anger. It did not use him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hahn swung wildly, bringing his sword to bear with all of his not inconsiderable strength, a hot, burning wrath writ upon his face, Sokka coolly sidestepped, and thrust his blade forth with precisely the amount of force needed to penetrate -- no more, and no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpace Sword slipped between Hahn's ribs, its slender, lethally pointed blade piercing through skin and muscle and cloth and steel like they weren't even there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stabbed through his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn was already dead, even if he hadn't accepted it yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widening, the commander, feeling the steel in his chest, and perhaps knowing the certainty of his fate, nonetheless made one final, desperate, hateful attack. Even as his life force swiftly ebbed and his limbs became as lead, Hahn took one last swing with his sword before Death could take him fully into its icy embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened in a flash of gleaming obsidian, and a spray of liquid ruby. Sokka's eyes widened, feeling a warmth on his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the light left Hahn's eyes for the final time, Sokka raised a hand to his chest, feeling something hot, wet, and sticky. Bringing the hand away, he saw a brown, calloused palm stained with red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision blurred, and the room seemed to spin around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen does Sokka come to?</span></div></div>",

Kaya had declared that he needed a <i>sponge bath</i>, and Ty Lee, Azula, and Suki had all quite eagerly concurred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue had been a little hesitant, a tad uncertain, at first, as to how to take the obvious intimacy between her husband and the other girls.

And, certainly, <i>he</i> was pleased with <i>her</i> reaction, her fingers gently wrapping around his gradually swelling girth, lightly squeezing his hardening manhood as she skillfully, attentively worked her hands up and down his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was glad to finally be home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

He did not seem to notice that his clothes were getting wet as he embraced his pal, nor did he appear to pay any mind to the hard thing which was currently jabbing his thigh. \"When did you wake up?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka chuckled weakly, looking only vaguely uncomfortable with the position Zuko was putting him in. Suki had reluctantly broken their kiss when Zuko had grabbed the still-recovering specialist, and Kaya had moved aside before she could be bowled over by the teary-eyed firebender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The latter had given Zuko a glare for this, at first, but her expression had shortly changed into one of amusement and interest when she saw him press his body against her naked husband probably just a little bit more than could be considered strictly platonic)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today, and today,\" said the Water Tribesman with a wry grin. \"Just woke up a couple hours ago, and they couldn't kick me out fast enough,\" he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so <i>happy</i> to see you're okay,\" Zuko forced out in between weak sort of half-sobs. His frame was trembling, and he sniffed a little bit as he squeezed his best friend a little bit tighter. \"I was there when they brought you in... Jet called me on the way to the hospital... You looked <i>awful</i>...\" he moaned miserably. \"There was blood <i>everywhere</i>... we were all so <i>worried</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed Sokka, short and chaste, and one could argue all day whether it was just a friendly greeting or something more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're okay...\" Zuko continued, pulling back and giving Sokka a weak grin. \"I love you, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this a platonic declaration, or something more... <i>initmate?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yue was slightly confused as she saw this.  When she was dating Sokka he had secret thoughts and then her accident happened.  What she didn't know was that Zuko had stayed by his best friends side.  The two fell for each other to a degree, they by no means homosexual.  They didn't go around looking at other guys, just each other.  It was a sexually evolved platonic love, they were sokka sexual and zuko sexual.  Mai knowing that they still liked girls introduced Sokka to Ty Lee's friend, Suki.  And that's where those two hit it off.  Zuko and Sokka didn't really lose the love of their relationship, it just took a different turn in the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue then asked curiously, \"Sokka, are you and Zuko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at each other as the moment was ruined.  Then Zuko pulled back as he then went red in the cheeks and said adverting his eyes.  He had finally noticed his naked sister as well as the other women there.  Sure, seeing naked women was no biggie, but it was considered impolite in the house to look at anyone naked without their permission.  Suki laughed as she saw Zuko's reaction as Sokka put his hands up in front of him as he waved them.  He then said to Yue, \"No, no, no it's nothing like that.  Well, it is, but not like that.  You see we love each other in a evolved platonic way.  I mean whatever, I'll explain it later.  Could we get dressed first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded as they all began to get dressed. Zuko stayed cause he needed a shower anyways.  Katara had really beaten the team into work outs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka and the girls went to the dinner table as they ate.  Yue was explained a lot from how the car accident nearly ruined Sokka's life as much as hers. How he dated Suki and after learning of Yue's condition promised to share him.  Then there was the meeting of Azula and how she had nearly demanded that Lu Ten the Fire Lord arrange a marriage between them.  So, Sokka joined royalty by marrying Azula.  Yue commented on how that Azula was then the second wife sense she and Sokka eloped two weeks before the accident that was three years ago.  Suki then proposed to Sokka on the jumbo screen as her and Sokka were at a Blade Quest event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue asked what Blade Quest was as Suki explained it, \"Blade Quest a unique new sport that came about maybe just around the time of your accident.  It's no older than a couple of years tops.  I think it was an independent sport before now, as it is a national past timer especially for non-benders.  The idea is that five warriors will stand in front of a maze of sorts.  Inside shall be many traps, you pick three weapons or items.  This includes utility belts, packs, swords, boomerangs whatever is on the wall of equipment.  The five then navigate the maze to retrieve an item.  Everyone is on their own, they score indepentantly.  There is a 2 hour game, by the time is up who ever has navigate enough retrievals wins that day.  Each player has two subs, two team mates that can substitute for them if he or she gets tired, injured or if they want to send in their best to pull in the victory.  And that is Blade Quest, Sokka's favorite team was the Southern Water Tribe's very own Polar Bear Dogs.  They did great, until last year when they decided to join the war.  Not that I'm complaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue then smiled as she then asked more questions.  Through out the meal of meats and vegetables the first wife learned nearly all there was.  She even learned that Kaya's wedding was going to be happening two months from now.  (AU: I know that I said Kaya and Sokka were already married but I decided there needed to be a wedding chapter on this route.  So, Kaya's wedding shall happen soon, yay for the bride!)  Yue asked thinking that Kaya was already a wife.  Sokka cleared it up saying that they weren't married just yet.  But, they might as well be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the talking the group decided to go to bed. The herbal medical tea that Sokka was told to drink before bed was finally getting to him.  The girls and him retired to the shared room as they piled on into bed.  Azula was on his right with Yue to his left.  On the lower half of the bed sleeping at his waist were Suki and Ty Lee.  Kaya was sleeping with her head in Yue's bosom as Yue was sleeping with her back to Sokka liking the feeling of his arm wrapping protective around her waist.</span></div></div>",

The other girls were busy at work, but as Yue had been out of action for three years, she kind of didn't have a job anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she was spending some time with her husband at his side-job/hobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara rolled her eyes, sharply jabbing and sending some water from a small basin to slam into the practice target, dead center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why you're so worked up,\" she said. \"We haven't lost an important match in ages, and these guys are just rookies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did a quick roundabout punch with her other hand, and a jet of water, formed from the lingering moisture on and the target, slammed into it from the side, knocking it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka sighed. His sister was a smart person, most of the time, but when it came to probending she could get remarkably stubborn and bullheaded. She had a very high opinion of her own abilities -- not without merit, mind, but she still wasn't invincible, and Sokka felt like he was constantly having to remind her of this fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably the fact that he was brother that made Katara so reluctant to listen to him, honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko, on the other end of the training room, grunted as he knocked off a few small but quick fireballs at his own target, instinctively bobbing and weaving as he went through the motions with his usual intensity. Of the three members of Team Avatar, Zuko was probably the most diligent, in terms of practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf, he was also usually the one to come out of matches looking like he had lost a fight with a meat tenderizer. He focused a little too much on offense, and while it was undeniably effective, it also usually left him open to some pretty nasty counters on the occasions where failed to knock an opponent out of the ring quick enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep on the heat, that was Zuko's motto, and it served him well enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang, who was training in the center of the room, between Zuko and Katara, was probably the most reasonable, and the most defensive fighter of them, as well. It had been a very long time since someone had knocked him out of the ring, and it was not for no reason that he held the title of Avatar, having won it from the previous, aging champ Roku in the legendary firebender's last match before retirement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Aang was still no more invincible than Zuko and Katara, and while he was a rare sort of natural talent, he also had a bad habit of taking matches a little too lightly. The airbender got into far more close calls than somebody of his ability should have, and Sokka still tried in vain to get the younger man to really buckle down and push himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatural talent could only carry a person so far, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka sighed again, and he shook his head. Did he try to convince them to take this upcoming title match more seriously, or did he leave them to their own devices for a bit?</span></div></div>",

The Jasmine Dragon didn't have a lot of people in it, this time of day,  and they were in a somewhat remote corner of the shop, but that was hardly to say that they were alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite to the contrary, there were rather far too many strangers present for Sokka's liking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that this stopped his manhood from betraying his brain when Yue casually undid his zipper, inconspicuously reaching into her husband's trousers and grabbing a handful of his slowly stiffening length. Nor did it stop him from whimpering with pleasure when Kaya casually let a spoon drop to the floor beneath their table, bending down out of sight under the pretenses of retrieving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, though, she could not care less about the spoon. There was only one implement down there that had her interest, and that one was a good deal larger -- and far more useful, in her lustful opinion -- than any kind of silverware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hello</i> there, handsome~\" whispered Kaya playfully to Sokka's cock as it twitched and throbbed in spite of its owner, just loud enough for Yue and Sokka to hear. \"You certainly look happy to see me,\" she purred, giving the side of its head a soft kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka only barely bit back the groan that threatened to loose itself from his throat at this action, and it took nearly all his willpower just to maintain the appearance that he was NOT currently being serviced by two<i> incredibly beautiful </i>women whom he loved <i>very much</i>.

It was the hottest one yet, and she shamelessly teased the slit, poking the tip of her tongue into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was unable to hold it in anymore. He came in public. The only thing hiding this from the other patrons of the Jasmine Dragon was the table they were sitting at, and the hope that nobody had looked in their direction from a low angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis turned him on far more than it probably should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid his semen get all over Kaya's face, or did it go into her mouth?</span></div></div>",

It arched just slightly above the table.  Unless if you staring at them, which you had no business doing the sperm was barely seen.  The sperm landed on the back of Kaya's white tank top with green short shorts. Smiling she came up with her spoon in her mouth as she made a delicious hum.  She then pulled the spoon out on it was a small bit of sperm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka stared in horror as Kaya then gave it to Yue.  Yue put the sperm in between her lips as she made a noise often associated with tasting a tasty appetizer.  The two then took napkins to their lips and tapped their lips in a very lady like fashion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was about to try and zip up his zipper when Yue's hand went down.  She then saw a waitress come up.  She then ordered for the group as a whole, \"Yes, the man here will have the four tentra tentacle fish and chips, with  side of sea weed wrapped grilled craw shrimp and to drink he'll have he'll have some Hulong tea.

She then said loud enough for people to hear her so she was not suspected in the future, \"Now to get my ranch dressing from my husband's pocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue went down as she water bent some water from her personal pouch she carried like a purse.  She moved it around Sokka's cock as he gritted his teeth.  The water healed his weariness and exhaustion as he grew hard again.  Yue smiled as Kaya then heard Yue say to Kaya quietly, but not too quietly, \"Can you help find my ranch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling the soon to be bride nodded as she went under the table's surface.  Kaya and Yue were stroking his long shlong as he choked a moan and groan.  He was shuddering as a little boy walked by and asked his mother why was the man cold.  She then commented that she didnt know why he was cold.  Yue giggled at this as she then said to Kaya, \"You hear that Kaya, Sokka's cold.  Oh, what ever shall we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya then rubbed her hands together as she then reached into her purse.  She then said to Yue, \"Alright, all we have to is dress him in his coat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfusion hit Yue's face like a train coming to a wreck.  <i>What was this fruit bat tapir talking about?</i> Yue thought.  Then out from the purse came a small tube of cloth.  The tube of cloth was blue with a small hood that had white linen sewn in to give a southern water tribe hooded parka look, but the fabric was thin silk.  It even had a string to act as a sash.  Smiling she then pulled the basically designer condom over the cock and pulled back the water tribe inspired hood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue blinked a few times as Kaya then pulled on the sides of the designer condom.  She listened to the fruit bat tapir ask the cock if it was warm and snuggly now.  She then tied the string loosely as to not let the cum be restrained.  She then kissed it on the head as she said with a blush as she looked away, \"Oh, I'm just trying to be a good wife is all.  Oh, stop it, I'm not that pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue then had decided, this girl was definitely on her way to the loony bin.  But, then again, if she carried this in her purse then Sokka had to have liked it.  Sokka was one to turn down anything he didn't like after trying it at least once.  And he was a very tolerable man, so there must have been something that he saw in this girl to have proposed.  So, she decided to go along with it and asked her, \"So, where did you get this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya then blushed as she then said to her, \"Well, you're not going to believe this but.  I made it myself, and I made a couple more.  One of his White Lotus uniform, a Kyoshi armor one and his proud Southern Water Tribe wolf armor.  Me and Sokka met at a sex addict with weird fetishes meeting.  And we just went for each other.  I call this and my talking, dick role play.  It's not weird is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue then said as she thought about her answer carefully.  </span></div></div>",

She joined Yue, kissing Sokka's penis from the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, you're such a lucky young man,\" Kaya purred huskily. \"To be sandwiched in between two such beautiful, horny women as us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka shuddered, bone-deep, and he bit choked back a groan as he felt Kaya flit her tongue across the tip of his member. It was then joined seconds later by Yue's tongue, and it was all Sokka could do not to lose it when he felt the two warm, moist, soft appendages begin wrestling one another with his foreskin as the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came soon, from that, but Yue and Kaya were prepared, and they caught the jet of sperm with their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" said Kaya, loud enough to be heard, but not so loud as to draw any undue attention. \"It looks like the bottle broke.

Here, let me give you hand with that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a small dish from atop the table, the sort typically used for holding dipping sauces, and she and Kaya scraped the semen off of their hands and into the dish, giggling a little to themselves. They finally sat back up, and Yue set the dish of 'ranch dressing' on the table. She and Kaya were both smiling like the cat-owl that got into the cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked a little out of it, for a second or two, but he recovered quickly enough. Shaking his head, he zipped back up -- his erection flaccid once more -- not bothering to remove the parka from his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew from experience that Kaya would probably want to do it herself, once they got back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, though, he noticed a pretty young woman coming over.

Around her waist was worn a belt that looked like snake that was of blue scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she then said to the three, \"Excuse me, Sokka, fellow sisters.  May I have some of this dressing?  The Jasmine Dragon doesn't have that flavor of ranch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Yue nodded as she poured some of it into a small saucer.  Sokka then asked his royal wife, \"By the way Azula what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to him, \"Why treating my latest artist, she is quite talented.

She smiled at him as she began to teasingly caress him there, stroking up and down his leg, so close to his member. Kaya, in turn, was cuddling up to him in a very family unfriendly manner, shamelessly pressing her breasts into his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was getting <i>painfully</i> erect from this, and from the show they had made of so casually eating his semen in public, and he was certain that if he were to stand up, the tent in his pants would be plainly obvious for anyone to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo of course, <i>that</i> was when Sokka felt Kaya grab his arm and heard her huskily whisper, \"C'mon, big boy,\" into his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she stood up, bringing him up with her, and Sokka heard Yue following suit on his other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka <i>really</i> hoped nobody happened to be looking at his groin, at that moment, as Kaya all but dragged him to the women's restroom.

He felt extremely self conscious, supposing that <i>everyone</i> must have known what was going on. He felt like they could have plucked the knowledge right out of his head just by looking at his face. Surely, the nature of this little restroom trip had to have been written all over his face, as Kaya and Yue herded him into the end stall, the one farthest from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the second the thin metal door was closed behind them (Sokka could not help noticing how it <i>only</i> barely latched shut, the lock improperly on the stall door), Yue and Kaya were tearing at Sokka's clothes, yanking down his zipper and slipping up their skirts.

It must have set him back a couple of thousand, but it was well worth it.  People could drink their tea in the bathroom or not.  Plus with the fountain sink and full body mirrors the bathrooms were the best part by most customers reviews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stalls were wide enough for four whole people to fit in them.  If you really desire it, you could do it.  But, more often than not you just went by yourself.  Yue then was about to take off the cock parka when Kaya then stopped her.  She then said to Yue, \"I only used the finest cloths for that and the best beads, just try it trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding she then began to place Sokka's 8 inches inside her pussy.  She felt the hood of the designer cock enter as she felt a tickle along her g-spot.  It was an odd sensation, but certainly delightful.  Then she began to fell silk covering something, something that fell like bumps.  They made her feel a high she never felt before.  As she then began to move back and forth she let out a long deep stuttered moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the brushing of bumps up and down her pussy as she shook and shivered in excitment.  She climaxing so fast repeatedly she orgasmed as she then after 5 times collasped onto her husband.  She had to stop, the world was shaking as she panted out arms wrapped around his shoulders.  She was nearly fearful from so much pleasure, \"Wha-what is causing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya giggled as she said expectedly, \"Gets the girls every first time.  You see Yue, I make my dick cloths out of a bead sock with two layers of silk in between them.  And the beads are made of the finest smooth stones that can only be produced by earth benders.  With the the inside layer of silk the cock is protected by the small imperfections of the stones and with the outside layer the girls vagina is also protected.  And the beads roll back and forth providing a vibration.  And the silk just feels extra nice thanks to the solid bead structure.  First time users of my dick cloths experience immediate orgasms, guaranteed or your money back.  I sell a few of these online thanks to Sokka's idea of selling them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue could not believe the feeling she was receiving as Sokka then said to her with a haunting whisper, \"Time to show you what you have been missing these past three years, my moon goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka grabbed her knees as he slammed her back into the wall. The walls were lined with velvet so he wasn't like he hurt her.  Just surprised her as she screamed from the dick clothes that were sent on a frenzy.  She then felt him shove in and out as he bit through her blouses buttonns.  She then felt her bosom being licked all over as he bit into her neck. She screamed and in the recesses of her mind she knew she just gave away their cover to the whole restaurant.  But she did not care as she felt her husband cum inside her as she came for a 12th time in just this experience.  She was thanking every spirit for multiple orgasms and Sokka's very fast recovering cock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was let down the door to the ladies room was heard to have opened.  There was a stomping coming as Sokka pulled up his pants and so did Kaya.  The door then came with a knock was someone's voice was heard.  Who was it?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The door swung closed behind her, and Yue was almost a little frightened at the intensity of the lust she saw glimmering in Azula's golden eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya wisely moved aside to allow Azula access to her husband. While the woman had mellowed out considerably from her teenage years, she could still be very... <i>fierce</i> when she really got in the mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no conversation as Azula strode forth and mounted Sokka. She did not so much as say hello to her husband before taking him inside of her, before hungrily impaling her womanhood upon him. She was randy, it was apparent, and <i>exceptionally</i> so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only concession Azula made to any sort of foreplay was the greedy kiss she brought down upon her husband's lips, devouring the taste of his mouth as she began to rock her hips against his. She did not do it as vigorously as she would have liked -- Sokka had before expressed his concerns about harming the baby with any undue exertion -- but still she did it, and she loved it very much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka groaned, thrusting in and out of Azula as she kissed him deeply, passionately. It was all he could do not to come right away as she assaulted him, hungry and horny and wanting so badly to feel him inside her. He was conscious of the life growing inside the gentle curve of her belly, but he was also conscious of how tight she felt around him, and how beautiful she looked at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pumped in and out of her, loving the feel of her body, and it was clear that she loved the feel of his as well. They came with a cry, both at the same time (Azula was much less vulnerable to the effects of Kaya's little custom penis coats than Yue was, having considerably more experience with them).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula smiled, panting and sweating as she gave her husband one final kiss, before disengaging and pulling up her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better,\" Azula said with a wink. \"But now I really should be getting back to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she leave, or did Sokka and the other two stop her?</span></div></div>",

She then said protectively, \"Hey, don't take away the bone, it's the best part about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said agreeing with her, \"I'd have to agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya then kissed Sokka as she then said to him with a hot whisper, \"See you at home hot stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then unzipped him in public and pulled off his cock parka.  She took it and placed it in her purse as she then said to him ,\"Ill be taking this, you seem warm enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding Sokka then said to her as he kissed her lips, \"See you are home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling she then began to walk to work.  Sokka then hugged Ty Lee as he patted her ass and said to her with a whisper as she pulled out the fake breasts, \"And I have something just for you when we get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering in anxiety she then nodded as she then kissed his neck where his bite mark was.  She then said to Sokka, \"Oh, looks like the fire princess got some pain in.  Promised to make you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee's bosom began to ring as she then gasped and looked into her bra.  She pulled out her pink flip phone (In this universe cell phones are new, flip phones are really expensive.  No smart phones yet.) as she saw that her phone had a alarm.  She then said as she reached into her bosom again.  She pulled out a bottle of pills as she popped two inside her mouth as she grabbed Sokka's head.  She then kissed him as she moved his mouth open as she pushed her tongue into his mouth.  Sokka swallowed the pills as she then stopped frenching him.  Sokka then said to her with disgust, \"I really hate taking pills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee then pouted as she batted her eyes lashes looking cute, \"Even when I assist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Sokka then kissed her forehead as he said to her, \"Of course not, you are a great nurse.  I'm lucky to have you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling she then kissed him as she then said to him, \"Have a good day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then walked away with Yue as Ty Lee left with a cart wheel.  Sokka and Yue then walked as they eventually came upon the East side of town.  She looked up to see a white statue made of stone that was of Jeong Jeong.  It showed him in the White Lotus Uniform.  There was a fire fountain that was letting out controlled fire with water benders near by just in case.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka and Yue then sat at Jeong Jeong park as they sat on a bench.  Sokka wrapped an arm around her shoulder.  He then kissed her temple of her head.  They watched the fire go up as they sat there watching the show.  Sokka then said to her as he whispered, \"You remember this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping she then heard him say to her, \"That right, this is where we first came to on our first date.  And the best part is to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her as he got closer to her, \"I got a letter this morning.  Dad is coming here by boat, he should be here in White Lotus city in a month.  He sent an email that he wanted to see you for the first time in three years.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue smiled as they kissed as she said to him, \"It'll be great to see him.  Well we better get back home now.\" And so they left for home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sokka and Yue were walking as they were making they're way to the more crowded part of town. As Sokka was walking with Yue he felt off without his armaments. Then again he was told that his core strength could not support the full throw of a boomerang or the swings of a sword. And not being used to using all you've got could hurt the body more than using all you've got while wounded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked with Yue he saw two people that owned a small shop. The shop was a small pastries shop that was a outside shop. The building was their house from what the could see and the outside with shelves. The had display pastries with boxed pastries on the shelves with the pair giving pastries to people. They were a pair of married people with one being a fire nation man with a long beard of grey with white streaks along the sides of his head. His eyes were dark gold and his flesh elderly with age suggesting he was in his late fifties or early sixties. He wore a white long sleeve shirt with a pair of red pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wife was a young wife that was in her mid thirties or late thirties. She was pregnant and showed signs of soon to be labor. Probably a month or two and she was of water tribe descent. Her hair was long and brown with seven hair loopies on each side of her face go to the back to a folded tail.  She had accent beads along the hair loopies. She wore a blue shirt that was loose fitting and was a maternity silk shirt with a long white ground sweeping skirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a pair of little boys running around the alleyway yard. They were practicing bending with a tutor. One of the boys was a water bender as he made ice. The other one was a fire bender, though he was rather weak at it seeing as he only made small quick bursts of flame. Sokka looked at the little boys with fondness as he thought about his own soon to be children. He and Azula would have a handsome son or beautiful daughter. Sokka then saw something that made his blood boil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour green suit wearing 'guards' with a sigil on the right breast pocket of a moose lion in yellow. They wore shades and they were with a young man who was just maybe older than 13 or 14.  He wore a green cap with open vest with his chest exposed showing his six pack. He was rather buff yet skinny as his body hadn't fully developed. He wore a pair of black pants with his feet bare of any foot wear. He wore a pair of stone bracers as he walked with his sway silver necklace. His eyes were green and his hair brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were the Hou mafia an Earth bending group of criminals that were all related. If you weren't an earth bender then you were a non bender guard. of the clan. Their superior line of earth bending has produced major threats and prodigies, but there is also an increase of non benders in their family.  Sort of a trade of power in Sokka's opinion. The four guards were more than likely carrying concealed weapons.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka began to walk over as Yue then grabbed his arm.  She then said to him, \"Sokka you are not armed and you are still recovering.  This is only your third day out of the hospital.  Let's call the police, Kaya or Suki. You are not supposed to fight, besides they might just leave after they commit their crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy said the man as he pulled out some Yuans, \"You owe me twice as much, I need a new car.  So, what's it going to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then said to the Hou boy, \"We don't have the money, Lee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee Hou was offended as he shouted at him, \"Lee? Do you really think you can just call me by my first name like you know me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wife was going to the alleyway yard as she went went for her kids. The tutor was a old wizened lady as she walked with the young boys. Lee looked at the woman and then snapped pointing at her. Two of the guards went at the wife as they produced weapons. One pulled out a dagger while the other pulled out a sling with metal missile (Pin balls) dispenser on his wrist. He loaded one up as he pelted it at the wife. The other missile he threw after that flew away after the water bender boy yelled for his mother. He attacked the missile with a water shot. She fell down as she groaned in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka had enough of standing around as he began to walk over. No one attacks a parent just trying to protect their children. Yue was royally pissed as she saw the metal missile hit the woman's unborn child. Water came out of the water sac she carried on her as two tentacles were behind her. Sokka then said to the guy with the dagger, \"Hey, can I borrow that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka ducked as the water hit him and turned to ice as Sokka grabbed the dagger and said, \"Thanks.\". The man with the sling threw two shots one after another at Sokka.  Sokka ducked and ran dodging the two shots as he punched the man in the face. He then shook his hand as he then turned to the Hou mafia.  He bent over and picked up the sling with metal missile dispenser.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee then snapped as the other two reached into their jackets.  They each pulled out a pair of short staves.  The clicked buttons on them as they telescopically extended.  Turning the tops spear tips came out of the tops.  Sokka then reached into his back pocket as he pulled out a military ID.  He then said to Lee, \"Lee Hou, I am a soldier of the United Republic known as the White Lotus.  Now, unless if you have permits for carrying those spears.  Then I suggest you put them away.  Carrying a small blade or small missile based weapon without a permit is perfectly okay.  Carrying a two handed weapon or sword is required to be in the hands of a permit owner or in the house.  Now, being a fine man of the Hou family you have to have spear permits.  I mean you are the Hous, you guys are upstanding and law abidding citizens.  Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the two Lee then said to the two, \"We were just handing their weapons to these pastry merchants weren't we fellas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding they made the weapons into shafts again as they gave them to the pastry merchant.  Lee then said to Yue, \"Skank, mind releasing my boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue looked at Sokka as he then gave a nod.  She then threw her hands and the ice shattered with a blunt force impact to his ribs. Coughing he moved to go with the group.  Lee then pointed at the man who had assulted the pregnant woman.  One of the spear weilders walked over as Sokka then said to him as he got in front of him, \"Na uh, he assaulted someone and he needs to stay here like a good little boy to wait for the cops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Lee he heard him say, \"He's just fetching the dagger and sling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then tossed the dagger as he caught it and handed the hilt end to the guard.  Sokka then said to him, \"Sorry, but the sling stays, it's evidence.  Now, I suggest you get moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling the man then began to walk away with Lee.  Lee earth bent the shelf to fall down with the pastries before leaving.  Sokka then reached into his pocket.  He pulled out 612 Yuans as he looked at the destroyed pastries.  He then gave the people the right amount to pay for them all plus a hundred.  Sokka then said to the man as he thanked him, \"Hey, mind wrapping up a brownie cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then nodded as he said to Sokka, \"That'll be 5.58 Yuans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then pulled it out as he gave the wrapped desert to Yue.  Yue then placed it into her purse.  Sokka pulled out his cell phone as he flipped it open.  He dailed Toph's number as he said to the phone, \"Yeah, Toph? Yeah it's Snozzles, could you come clean up this mess here on Kuzon Avenue?  Yeah, we ran into a little trouble. Made a citizens arrest of a battery and assault on a pregnant woman.  Really?  Thanks, we'll be expecting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue walked over to the man as she kicked him in the nads as he was trying to get up.  She then said to him as she water bent him to the ground forming the water into ice, \"You let that be a reminder of what you did.  You endangered a life today and that was very bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka went to check on the wife as he looked at her belly.  She was breathing in and out as he then began to apply pressure.  The missile was powerful enough to get past her skin.  Sokka then said to Yue, \"Yue, we need some water bending healing now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue then ran over as she began to heal the woman.  Sokka removed the missile as he then tossed it onto the ground.  The woman began to breath normally again.  She then said as she held Sokka's hand, \"Thank you, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water bender boy then said to Sokka, \"Who are you mister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka grinned as he said to him, \"Name is Lieutenant Sokka Mawii'aa is my name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy then said to him with a smile, \"When I grow up, I want to be like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue smiled at this as she then said to him, \"What you did today was very brave, no doubt you will make a better soldier than my husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka gave her a sour look as she giggled.  Sokka then rubbed the kids head as he said to him, \"Catch me in 10 years kid and General Sokka will get you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then stood up as a police unit got to the shop.  Toph and another cop got out as Toph then said to Sokka as the cop went to arrest him, \"Good job Snoozles, were there any injuries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her, \"Just the wife of the pastry merchant, she suffered a missile wound from a sling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka handed it over as he then said to her, \"Make sure he goes away for a long time for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph nodded as he said to him proudly, \"That's the job Snoozles. See you at dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded as he and Yue then went to the bus stop.  As they got on the bus they rode on it until they got home.  They got off the bus as they walked down the street.  There was a 300 foot long black fence with yard behind it.  He opened up the gate as he and Yue walked to the 5 floor mansion.  They walked inside as Sokka went to the dinner table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was being served by Suki and Kaya.  Kaya then went up to her soon to be husband and gave him a kiss.Suki wrapped her arms in a hug around him.  Azula was at the table as Sokka went over and kissed her.  He then said to the women at the Sokka table, \"I love all of you and am lucky to have you as my own.\"</span></div></div>",

Beside her was Kaya who was sitting across from her.  Yue was sitting beside Kaya with Ty Lee being on the other side of Sokka.  Ty Lee was holding hands with him under the table.  She loved Tuesdays, it was her day to hold hands with him.  She really hated the second and fourth Wednesday of the month.  Cause Toph got to hold hands with him as the group sat with mansion dining room with Zuko and Aang plus their loved ones.  Sure she liked all of her family, but if you're just a fuck buddy you shouldn't have the right to affectionately hold someone's hand.  At least that was her opinion, but then again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph and Sokka do care about each other a lot, they were best friends of the sort that you didn't need to remind one another.  So, she guessed it was okay for them to once in a while do their own thing.  Sokka then mentioned how he and Azula would be busy on Saturday.  Sokka took a rib off Tiger Seal as he ate on it.  At the table was five flavor soup, soft shell turtle bass, tiger seal ribs, roasted Mocking Duck, cow pig patties, bread, fruit of all kinds and three big bowls of salad to get salad from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki then said to the table, \"Well, I got some news.  Next Monday, my dad should be joining us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka lost all heart now as he then said to her, \"Ling is coming over?  Great, another dinner of 'hey you should marry the avatar.'.  Next friday's title match couldn't come sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki then said to him as she kissed his cheek, \"Hey, I married you, not Aang.  Not Zuko, no one deserves my heart but you.  So, just deal with it.   Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded as everyone continued to eat their dinners as the news and other things were said.  Soon they were cleaning up from dinner and the girls went to bed with their husband.  There was a large bed with cushions and pillows every where. The bed itself could fit 14 people on it.</span></div></div>",

He was wearing nothing but boxers, and Ty Lee herself was naked, preferring to sleep <i>au natural</i>. Suki, for her part, wore a lovely, sheer, low-cut nightgown. Sokka got into the bed, following Ty Lee and Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him came the other girls -- Yue, Azula, and Kaya -- and they had variously playful and affectionate smiles on their fair, lovely faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue wore a billowing white silk nightgown, beautiful and elegant, and sensual also in how modest it was, clinging perhaps some to the curves of her womanly form, but leaving much also to the imagination.  Kaya, in contrast, simply wore a large old T-shirt that only just went down past her posterior. And Azula, for her part, wore a deep red maternity gown which showed the slowly growing curve of a belly two months pregnant, and the swell of a young mother's bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were all in bed, they extinguished the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the <i>fun</i> began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee amorously, playfully snuck a hand down Sokka's boxers, causing her lover to groan as she squeezed and stroked his flaccid member into a full erection. She happily pitched a tent in his underwear, and of course this quickly drew the attention of the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smiled, seeing the expression on her husband's face as Ty Lee teased and pleased him. She scooted up to Ty Lee, pressing into the girl from behind so that she was effectively spooning the former Olympic gold medalist, and then she reached around and began playing with the generously endowed girl's breasts. She kneaded the sizable mounds of Ty Lee's large, all natural tits, pinching and twisting the girl's puffy pink nipples to elicit squeals and moans from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka watched this with rapt attention, and Suki could see the bulge in his boxers swell a little more as he watched her molest Ty Lee while the porn star herself skillfully stroked him off. She smiled, pleased to have his attention, and amused by the simple look in his eyes. He was so much fun to tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to be outdone, however, Azula came in from the other side and began planting sharp bites and kisses up and down their husband's arm and shoulder, giving him more than a few hickeys along the length of his strong, shapely biceps. Kaya, meanwhile, crawled over and pulled Sokka's boxers down, joining Ty Lee in stroking him off. She whispered sweet nothings to his cock as she squeezed and rubbed it, and Sokka groaned delightedly, a bit of clear precum leaking from the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue herself, lastly, seeing the other girls having their fun with Sokka, went straight ahead and straddled her husband's abdomen. Smiling beatifically at him, she kissed him passionately, lovingly, and Sokka moaned into her lips as their tongues began to play, coming all over Kaya and Ty Lee's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

He gave Ty Lee a playful kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he said, teasingly, \"Last night wasn't enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee fondled his ass a little more, and she began to nibble and lick on Sokka's neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can <i>never</i> have enough of you,\" she said huskily, delighting in the sounds of Sokka's groans. The grapefruits lay all but forgotten on the counter as she took in the wonderful feeling of her lover's hard, toned body pressing into hers, of his strong, muscular frame shivering and shuddering beneath her as she teased at his neck, planting a trail of kisses down to his collar bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka moaned appreciatively, melting into Ty Lee's ministrations, uncaring of anything else that was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Suki, who chose that moment to peek into the kitchen to see how breakfast was coming, shook her head and sighed -- though she was smiling -- when she saw that Sokka and Ty Lee were a little busy at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she try to get their attention, or did she take over making breakfast and let them have their fun?</span></div></div>",

He then pushed her back by her shoulders and the final clue was her lost smile.  She looked like the puppy kitten that did something bad and deserved a lashing.  Sokka then stoked her cheek as he asked her, \"What is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki snuck by as she began to cock breakfast.  She knew that voice, that voice was only reserved for investigating problems.  Using his logic to solve problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee looked down into his hand, \"My agent said that I'm getting older and that my breasts are being to slack with the audience.  She suggested that I get a breast implant.  And then I thought if the audience is starting to get turned off by my bust. Then (Quietly) <i>maybe you were too</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki nearly threw the spachela at this utter nonsense.  She was stopped by Sokka as he picked Ty Lee by her chin.  He then said to her, \"Ty Lee, you have 15 seconds to rethink my love for you.  And how it is not bound by your figure.  Other wise you don't know me well at all and this civil union is over.  I will not waste time with people who don't know me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee was about to cry as she then saw that spark in his eyes.  That spark that was reserved only for those he loved.  It spoke to her as she then cried into his chest as she apologized.  She said with a cry, \"I'm so sorry Sokka, I didn't mean to listen to her.  I should have realized that you are the greatest person on this planet.  Oh, Sokka!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka hugged her as he kissed her forehead.  He then said to her hugging her, \"It's okay, now let me demonstrate me devotion to you like you just demonstrated your devotion to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka went to the bathroom after picking her up bridal style.  He striped her of her cloths as he began to massage her shoulders.  She moaned and squirmed with a whimper at his rough hands.  They were getting out all the stress of the last few days.  She then moaned out as she lost her tears and felt his hands cup her breasts.  She then felt him move to the front as he said to her bosom, \"Hey, girls, I heard from Ty Lee that you girls are feeling sad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee giggled as she then said in disbelief, \"The Kaya treatment?  I really screwed up if I'm getting this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then nuzzled her left breast as he said to it, \"Of course not, <i>honey</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then kissed the nipple to her right breast as he said to it, \"<i>Bun</i>, have I told you how hot you've been looking lately?  You've driven me wild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee giggled as she then said to him, \"I can't believe that you named my breasts even.  You really do love them don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then nuzzled into her breasts as she giggled and said hugging his head into her bosom, \"Ah, you're just like a little baby suckling on my breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka began to suck on bun as he licked and bit it lightly.  He listened to Ty Lee moan as she then cried out a little.  She then closed her eyes as she whimpered.  She then felt herself grow wet.  Sokka then began to finger her as he felt her shiver.  She then came as she cried out after feeling his other hand tweak honey.  His pussy fingering hand drew out her nectar as she sighed out and rested her face into his neck.  </span></div></div>",

What happened to Cutie?  Am I no longer cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping Ty Lee caught onto his playing as she said to him, \"Of course not Cutie!  You are so c~uuute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair walked into the bedroom as there was breakfast for Sokka and the girls.  They all ate their breakfast as Sokka licked up the blue berry pancakes that Suki made with the sausage and eggs.  He loved her original blue berry pancakes.  She made them from scratch and they were freaking delicious.  Yue then asked the question that she was some what fearing, \"Can I get more information on the Album?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee then said as she giggled, \"It's a photo album that each of gets to make ever since I joined the party. It's been a tradition to make one once every two years.  Since we've only been at this for three that means me and the others besides Kaya shall do this next year. As for Kaya she doesn't have one either.  But, she is a bride to be, not a civil union participate or wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue then asked her, \"What do you mean by civil union participate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee then said to her, \"Well, me and Cutie here entered a civil union partnership.  I don't believe in marriage, I believe love is love and that marriage is a binding contract.  It is too constrictive, and not free.  But with what we have we can truly test each other's love.  With no restrictions we can really cut the rugs and smash the walls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue then nodded as she then said to her, \"So, you are committed to Sokka, just not married to him.  Fair enough, so anyways let's get this started shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee giggled as she stood up and grabbed the camera.  She then said to Sokka, \"Now, Cutie, you might want to strip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded as he stripped out of his clothes.  Yue smiled as she saw his long cock and began to kiss it.  She then got a flash of light as she kissed it.  She then petted it like a dog as sshe then made an aw sound which got another flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue then made a victoyr 'v' sign by it as she had it resting on her cheek.  She then got flashed by Ty Lee's camera.  Yue then rested him down as she pulled Sokka into her bosom which got a pic as Yue then put him into her pussy.  She turned around as she threw up two vs as Sokka grabbed her thighs and pulled up her legs and back.  Showing her pussy stuffed with his meat as she stuck out her tongue as pictures happened.  </span></div></div>",

Yue went to go the joint living room to enjoy her day with Mai and Zuko.  Suki was kissing Sokka as they pair had some alone time. PUlling at her shirt she presendted her bosom in green silky lingerie as she then pulled his head into her bosom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nestled his face into her bosom as she hummed a small song as he then began to lick and nip at her bosom.  She giggled as she then then pulled his pants apart.  She then pulled out his cock as she went at it with her wet pussy.  She slid up and down his cock as she felt his long girth inside her.

Ty Lee went out of the mansion as she walked to the bus stop.  She got on the bus as she rode down town.  She rode past the Piandoa statue as she got near the red light district where her work was. She loved how each of the statues were in rememberance to the great generals of the city and the United Republic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus eventually stopped as she got off the bus and walked to a studio.  In an alley way were four people with white skin and steel gray eyes.  They wore civilian cloths and carried no armaments.  They walked out of the alley way as the air moved the dust for them.  There was a fifth person behind them.  It was a man wearing a blue hoodie as he pulled down the hoodie to show himself as Hahn.   He was all healed up as he then said to the four, \"Alright let's meet our spy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Ty Lee's work there was a man with a Earth Kindom descent.  He had black hair with green eyes as he saw one of Hahn's soldiers walk inside.  The earth kingdom descent man walked over to the soldier as he went behind a scene back ground piece.  He then said to Hahn, \"What is it my lord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn then said to him, \"I want you to initiate the plan today.  After the movie have her drink this bottle of energy drink.  Tell her it shall boost her right up.  Then do the plan as instructed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then nodded as Hahn and his men went out the door unnoticed as they went to the local university.  <br>\r\n<i><b><span class=\"cbrown\"><br>\r\nBack with Ty Lee </span><br>\r\n</b></i><br>\r\nTy Lee was using her breasts on a young man that was wearing a blue spirit mask.  She was starring in the blue spirit porno series.  She stroked the six inch penis with her bosom as she giggled at him.  She then said to him, \"Oh, spirit me away my big cock wielding master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCum came out as she squealed and then the director the man who was ordered by Hahn said, \"And cut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy lee then stood up as she wiped her face with a towel.  She then said to the porn actor, \"Good job, Gukki, can't wait for Friday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGukki waved off as Ty Lee then said as she sat in her chair, \"Man am I exhausted.  A girl's ass really gets spread out when she does a shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe director came over as he gave her the energy drink, \"Here you go Ty Lee, that was a great shoot.  I'll see you Friday, tell your husband that I said hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling then said to him, \"Sure thing, Mr. Ling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then opened the drink as she tossed her head back.  She guzzled the brown drink as she was in need of energy to go home.  Letting out a sigh she then got up and got dressed.  She moaned as she was in her changing room. Ty Lee could not see straight as she then blacked out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b><span class=\"chunter\">Later after the attack</span><br>\r\n</b></i><br>\r\nTy Lee woke up with a blanket around her body in an ally way.  She had her clothes on the ground beside her with her purse.  She looked out the allyway to see she was on the west side of town.  It was a big corporation side of town in the beginning of the after noon.  So, no one would be out of the buildings to see her shame.  She saw the Iroh statue as she then wondered how she'd gotten there.  Then she felt it, the very thing that made her truly know fear.  The only thing to take away her smile, she felt semen leak from her pussy.  She then did what?</span></div></div>",

Every indivual second seemed to stretch out into an eternity all its own, and the three girls were each all too conscious of the awkward silence which pervaded the air between them.

She was shivering dreadfully, her skin ashen. \"I blacked out after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki clenched her fists on the steering wheel, gnashing her teeth as she put two and two together. Toph, likewise, had a darkly livid expression, and the chassis of the car groaned a little as she unconsciously metalbent in her anger, though it did little more than cause the convertible to shudder briefly as they drove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That scum,\" Suki hissed, and it was clear that, mentally, she was swearing a blue streak a mile long. \"That piece of human waste. How <i>dare he</i>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snarled, and Ty Lee looked dismayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she said weakly. \"I know what you're thinking, but <i>don't</i>. It's not worth it. I... I'm not worth getting in trouble over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki slammed her foot down on the brakes, and the car came to a screeching halt in the middle of an otherwise abandoned road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>No</b>,\" she said. \"Don't you <i>dare</i> talk like that. I don't care what you think, Ty. What that bastard did to you was <i>unforgivable</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\" she murmured. \"But. I don't know, maybe...

Maybe if I had just done the vaginal, like he had said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph's teeth snapped together with a sharp noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He <i>didn't</i>,\" she snarled, knowing full well how important Ty Lee held her bond with Sokka. \"<i>That fucking piece of rat shit sucking, cock mongering, motherfucking <b>bastard whoreson</b></i>,\" she said lowly, dangerously, cloudy eyes flashing with rare emotion as she gnashed her teeth and swore. \"I will <i>kill him</i>. I will kill him and I will murder him and I will shit on his grave and laugh at his funeral. That <b>fucker</b>. That unforgivable, inexcusable, absolutely utterly <i>abhorrent</i> pile of human<i> filth</i>. He had NO RIGHT,\" she hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki nodded, darkly agreeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"He... Not only did he violate the terms of your contract, but he actually <i>drugged</i> you and... <b>Kyoshi's sweaty taint</b>, he actually fucking <i>raped</i> you.\" She narrowed her eyes, gritting her teeth and hissing through them as she spoke. \"No,\" she said. \"I refuse to let him get away with this. Not only was what he did <i>wrong</i>, absolutely unforgivable, completely irredeemable, but you are like a <i>sister</i> to me, Ty Lee. You're like a sister to <i>all of us</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll show that fucker,\" Toph growled. \"I don't know where he might think he's from, but up here in Republic City we <i>take care</i> of our own. You're <i>one of us</i>, Ty Lee. I ain't gonna let that cocksucker get away with what he did.\" She shook her head, her jaw grimly set. \"<i>None of us are.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee simply sniffed, and tears ran down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

He looked put out as he then said with obviousness, \"Azula just had to burn dresses while I was about to eat my sandwhich.  Didn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko was sitting across from him hanging out with his buddy looking at his what used to be piping hot pizza.  He said in ruffled emotion, \"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<i><b><br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Back with Azula</span></b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula was huffing and puffing as she went to the water sprinkler system in her room.  She opened the box attached to the wall as she pushed a red button.  The sprinkler system stopped as she then went to another closet.  This closet had the maternity dresses that she bought recently, hoping that she wouldn't have to wear them for a couple more months.  She pulled out a nice black dress with a gold cord belt with clips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled on the dress and left the back that had a pair of strings to lace up the back.  She slipped her left arm into the bicep sleeve and shouted, \"SOKKA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Sokka came into the room as he said to her, \"Yes, my hot flame?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to him with a softened glare, \"Thank you.\"  She then said to him as she seemed far less angry now that he called her by her cute pet name, \"Could you be a sexy savage and lace up my back?  I'll let you know if it's too tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka went behind her as he began lacing up her back as she made the dress snug.  He finally tied the double knot at the top and tucked in the loops into the dress and put the loose laces into the criss cross of the laces.  Azula then took the cord belt and wrapped around her back and under her bosom.  She clipped the two ends together and rotated it to where the clips were in the back.  She looked at herself in the mirror as she then said to him, \"Does this dress make me look fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then wrapped his arms around her as he kissed her neck saying into her ear with a husky whisper, \"No, my hot flame.  It makes you look scorching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling she said lustfully, \"I'm almost tempted to just skip the party and have sex with that kind of talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her as he lightly licked her ear, \"Can't have that, so I'll go get ready while you finish up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula nodded as she felt him pull away.  She then went over to her beauty mirror and began to paint her face.  The most expensive make ups in all of the world were here at her beauty mirror.  She pulled out a necklace as she put it on finishing her beauty after applying red eye shadow with lip stick and a light shade of blush. </span></div></div>",

Her favorite, but currently killing her nostrils thanks to her pregnancy.  She loved that particular brand of tangerine juice added black wine, an alcoholic red wine that is so dark of red that it could be either rosewood or black hence the name of the black wine.  Sokka could not turn down a good year of anything be it Seaway from the Southern Waters, Beer from Gaoling, Black Wine from the Black Cliffs, Cactus Juice from the Si Wong Desert, Ba Mist from Ba Sing Sae, Fire Water from the Fire Nation capital or Tiger Bear's Breath from the Northern Waters.  Those were his seven favorite drinks and boy did he love them, it was a miracle that he was not a drunk.  But, then again like his father he never drank less he had something to eat with it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl stood up as she wore a blue silk dress with gold back as the dress was a shoulderless dress.  The top of the two piece dress had no sequence, while the knee long skirt was cover in blue and gold sequence making an interesting mix.  She had long black hair in a pony tail. She wore blue eye shadow to go with her blue lip stick that she wore upon her thick lips. She had three large braids in the middle of the pony tail and three hair loopies on her left side going to the back to join the pony tail at the middle braid. She had gold accent beads on the three left hair loopies. Her eyes were a pair of red brown like cooling lava from a volcano. Her right eye was covered by a wide bang of hair as her d-cup bosom bounced with her leaning from foot to foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOyaji stood up as he raised his glass of a light green liquid known as Seaway, \"To Ms. Mo Lee for entering a contract with us that shall last for the next 4 years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then smiled as Oyaji then turned his glass in her direction, \"And let us not forget the agent of our company who recruited her and came up with the marketing strategy to sell over 400,000 copies of the Dragon, the best seller fictional book about General Iroh in another life that tried to invade Ba Sing Sae under a tyrannical rule of the Fire Nation and he who was it's liberator eventually.  Ms. Azula Mawii'aa, thanks to your efforts and decisive thinking you have made this company over 6 million Yuans in just one year alone and gotten a movie deal for us and Ms. Mo Lee.  Congratulations to both of you fine ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone took a drink of their glasses as claps were heard all around after as Sokk and Azula sat back down.  Azula had been on her feet the entire opening.  She was just ready for her food as caters brought to them.  All of the food was made by Iroh's own store the Jasmine Dragon and served with the finest teas and drinks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula smiled at the special treatment she was getting from her husband.  Holding hands and eating, while just sitting with him was the best in the last couple of months.  She then looked down at her baby bump as she sighed and rubbed her baby bump.  Sokka then grinned as he said to her, \"Just think about it.  Another 6 months and we'll be parents, I really hope that this life lasts.  And that I or you don't disappear from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in agreement with her husband she went in and kissed his cheek.  She then moved to his lips as she kissed them wrapping her arms around his neck.  She then licked his lips as she pushed her tongue in.  They loved each other as Sokka wrapped his arms around her and rubbed her lower back.  His left hand moved to her right cheek as she moaned out in pleasure.  Then there was a cough heard.

We are very eager for the new addition to our family,\" she said with genuine warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMo Lee beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, it really is grand,\" she chirped. \"I've never had one myself -- I've not found the right man yet, you understand, with all the good ones getting snatched up by lucky ladies like you and Ty,\" she said in chary, joking manner. \"But a few of my older sisters are mothers, and they never fail to coo about their little dearies any chance they get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm certain you will find a good man,\" said Azula reassuringly. \"You are a beautiful, charming, intelligent young woman -- <i>and successful as well, now!</i> -- and any man would be lucky to have you. You just have to wait for the right one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMo Lee smiled wanly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" she said, \"But I'm doubtful how long I can bear to wait...\" She gave Azula a weak grin. \"Most of my other sisters are married, or engaged, or otherwise <i>seeing</i> someone, and I imagine it won't be too long now before Ty joins them in starting her own family, too...

So, how about this, I please you and then I rub one out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to him with a bit of a glare, \"Sokka, if I don't get some white wine then you won't be getting anything for a week from anyone.  And I'll make sure of it, so if you masturbate then I won't be getting white wine.  Thus, I'll give you a counter offer.  We won't do missionary like you desire for the baby's safety and you can please me all you want.  But, you will give me a shot of white wine or else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling nervously Sokka then said with a snort, \"Eh, yeah sure.  White wine it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Azula then sat up as she then said to him, \"Alright, so, pleasure me first as you desired, then I'll take me drink before bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded as he sat up and got on his knees wrapping his arms around her.  He began to lick her neck as he undid the laces to her dress.  Her dress became loose as he slid her arm out of it's bicep sleeve.  He pulled the dress down and off of her as she kissed him.  Sokka went for his own jacket.  He threw it off as he kissed her and attacked her lips roughly as he went for his buttons.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's shirt was taken off as he threw it back and pulled at his blue wife beater.  Azula's hands went to his zipper as she then unzipped his pants and let him get out of his pants. Sokka moved his legs out of his pants as he left his boxers on.  Sokka then kicked his pants off the bed for two.  As he moved his hands to her back and caressed slowly her lower back.  He kissed her lips as he slowly began to plant kisses down her neck while grabbing her ass cheeks massaging them.  Sokka bent his back as he grabbed her cheeks hard as he went further and further down kissing her bosom on the way down.  He stopped at the nipples to kiss them both before going down moved and licking her belly button.  She moaned as she then panted in excitement as she saw his head go to her woman hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula gasped as she felt her ass be embraced as her clit was kissed.  Then a series of pecks were given to her lower lips as her upper lips made an 'o'.  She said as she grabbed her own swelling breasts, \"Oh, Sexy Savage,  yes kiss my lips.  Oh, yes kiss the bean you oh so love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then licked her as she said with a coo, \"Oooh, giving a frenchy are we?  Well that deserves a reward.  She moved her hands to his ass as she bent over and began to kiss his lower  back.  It was a bit of a stretch for her neck cause the baby bump got in the way.   She would probably not be able to do this in a couple weeks.  So, this was her neck favorite part, initially Sokka would have nothing to do with it.  But for her, he learned to love it.  She took her most well trimmed nail and circled his ass hole.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then began to lick at her neatly trimmed jet black hair of her pussy.  He licked inside as he stuck his tongue in as deep as it would get.  His tongue was like that of a dragon toad, long and bumpy as she felt him reach her g-spot.  She moved erratically as she pushed her finger inside his prostate and got at his p-spot. Her baby bump was being pushed to the limit as she felt him squirm under her touch.  She loved this power she had over him.  Sokka them finished her as she screamed and hit the bed rolling to her side.  Sokka knew he was going to pay for this in the morning.  So, he thought he would get what he could out of tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then went for her cunt again as he licked at it like a cat owl that wanted the milk. She began to pants and moan as she reached down and put her hands into his hair.  She moaned as she shoved his head into her pussy.  He licked and kissed at it eating her like he would a capybara cow pot pie.  She groaned as she came again as she mewled.  She couldn't believe how relentless he was.  He was ravanging her sex like a coyote wolf does to it's first meal in a week in the South.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula loved him  and his sexual attention that he gave her.  Usually she was a taker, but this bay was taking that from her.  At first she did not like that, but she supposed she could learn to love it.  After all what woman could say that her man was willing to please her in so many ways.  She loved his feeling she was getting that she could get her man to give her and give her more.  She came for a fifth time alone in this train of thought.  Azula couldn't take any more pleasure as she felt his tongue go deep and deeper as she squirmed, but felt her legs clamped down by his hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka moved in on her pussy more as he dug in and pushed his hand down on her thighs keeping her where he wanted.  She was moaning as she then saw a puff of fire escape her lips as she then said to him, \"Sokka!  I'm bre (scream)  Ei! athing fiiiiiiire!\"  Sokka then slowed down letting her calm down in her pleasure as she felt her heaving breast come to a slow bounce.  She then lost her fire as Sokka then continued slowly.  She hated this, she couldn't get the fast and repeated relief without giving the baby stress and she couldn't stand the slow pace orgasms.  She loved how slow and time taking he could be, but that delayed her relief.  Her eyes grew heavy as she then came again letting her eyes widen and then lower.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said with her throat parched, \"Sokka, I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka knew he exhausted her so he got up on his knees and moved to her. He then placed his cock into her mouth as he began to rub himself.  He pumped his hand up and down his shaft as he groaned.  He dropped his head back as he moaned out cumming down her throat.  She then swallowed as much as she could before spitting a bit out to prevent choking.  Sokka got his camelback that he used on hikes and runs.  He gave her the tube as she bit down and took in the much needed water.  Not for the salty taste of his cum, but just cause she sweated so much during the sex.  She then stopped as she fell into the abyss of sleep. Sokka then got up as he wrapped his arms around her and cuddled with her.  She went into a deep sleep as his own eye lids grew heavy. He then went into a deep slumber and a snore.</span></div></div>",

A black sleeve with a white lotus patch right under the head. There was the rank of Lieutenant under the white lotus patch.  She put a cloth kama half way onto the cock with the uniform as she finished the uniform with his tradional wolf helmet mini.  The wolf helmet mini was tied on just tight enough to not fall off and the flap was pulled back to let the slit to his penis for exposure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Kaya then said to him, \"So, how are you doing this morning <i>Handsome</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her, \"He's doing just fine, you know the other girls call him Sokka Junior or Big Sokka.

Kaya moaned delightedly as Sokka's member, lubricated with her own saliva, slipped into her anus.

It would not be long, now, until their wedding, but still she intended to wait until they were finally, officially married before she would give him her virginity, her cherry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little strange to think of herself as a virgin even as her husband-to-be thrust his cock in and out of her ass, but she was indeed one, in a way. No man had ever been inside her maidenhood, to none had she given her gender. For that, if alone of all other things, she had reserved all her life for one, single person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only man to have her womanhood would be Sokka. And even then, only when he was, at last, her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe respected that, and understood it.

That's too much\" Suki protested \"You have the wedding and the honeymoon and-\" Sokka cut her off, his voice gentle. \"It will be okay; as you said, it's just us tonight.\" Sokka could see that it looked as if Suki was deciding whether to be flattered by his offer or upset by his spending of money. It was going to be an expensive few months, but with the money he was making from his secret missions, he would surely be able to afford it. There was no way he could explain that to any of the girls though.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSieh returned, a serving tray in hand with two glasses of a dark red liquid. Gently she placed the glasses on the table in font of each of them. \"Are you ready to order?\" Sokka nodded, \"I'll have a moose bison steak\" he looked over to Suki smiling \"Correct me if I'm wrong my dear, but I believe my companion here will have the  tiger shrimp pasta. Suki nodded her head indicating to Sokka that he got it right. \"I'll have it right away\" Sieh promised, going back to the kitchen once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you remembered\" Suki told him in surprise. \"Well, I have been known to use this thing once in a while Sokka told her  tapping at the side of his head. \"it has saved us on more than one occasion, Suki agreed smiling. Sokka could tell that Suki was having a great evening. He had not seen her smile like this in some time. She as always happy, She probably showed it the most of his women, but Sokka guessed that it helped to give some time alone with each of them. He would have to take the other girls out for a one on one session like this eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dinner arrived Suki and Sokka began to eat talking lightly with each other, and having a rejuvenating conversation. Once they both finished eating Suki leaned over the table . \"This has been a great night Sokka. I can't remember the last time I've had this much fun. Before we do finish the night I have a surprise for you.\" Sokka gave a look to Suki indicating he had not expected anything. \"A surprise? You didn't have to.\" Suki's smile grew. \"For such a wonderful husband. I couldn't resist.\" Sokka laughed. \"What's this surprise you have for me?\"</span></div></div>",

A couple of weeks after she found out Azula was pregnant, she decided to get herself checked out.  After a list rigorous tests, it was finally decided that she'd never be fertile enough to get pregnant.  She still felt the guild deep inside her, feeling her womb filled with his seed.  As if all he had on his mind was to spawn a child with her, cause that's all she was good for as a wife.  She knew deep down that he'd never think that way.  But, still she had to hear it from his very own lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki broke down into a cry as Sokka then surprised ask in low confidence, \"Was I really that bad?  I thought that we had a great time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki shook her head as she said to him, \"No, it's not that.  It's just, I wanted to know.  What would you think of me Sokka if I told you that I could never have a baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then looked at her seriously as he said to her, \"That you would be a waste of my time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki was shocked as she heard this, but she listened still as Sokka continued.  Sokka continued saying to her, \"You would have a baby, our baby.  If this is about Azula getting pregnant first, then that's dumb.  Cause that baby will be all of ours and if you never get pregnant, then that's doesn't mean you won't ever have a baby.  The baby right now that our multiple marriage is having is a baby from all of us.  I didn't marry you to get you knocked up, I married you cause I love you.  Now, tell me what this nonsense is about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki nodded as she said to him, \"I went to the doctors to get myself tested after I heard Azula was pregnant.  While you were on your long training exercise where you got wounded.  I found out that I was so infertile that my chances of ever getting pregnant were very unlikely.  The best odds that I would have were one out of a trillion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka took a hand to her cheek as he pulled it down and looked into her eyes lovingly.  She then felt his lips upon her as he pulled back and told her, \"If we truly want to have a baby, then we'll beat the odds.  I mean they say you have a better chance stepping a land mine than winning the lottery.  And that's how we got so rich and financially stable enough to support our best friends in a house with all our marriages legal.  I mean, we are known to beat the odds.  Even among benders we are both successful career nonbenders and known through out the city. I'm the first non-bender coach of a winning probender team.  And you were known as the greatest martial arts and fashion &amp; performance arts from Kyoshi Island university.  I mean you were the first nonbender stunt double in mover history and owning a fashion website that is in the top five of the biggest in the world.  I mean, for a couple of non benders in a world filled with non bender prejudice.  I think we beat the odds everyday just walking out that door and being as awesome as we naturally are.  So, we will beat this if you want this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki then kissed him as she then bit his neck and as he was about to speak he was hushed.  Suki said to him, \"Just lay there and be quiet.  A good husband like you deserves to be ravished while your ever lovely wife tries to get pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki took his cock that had now grown hard again and lubed it up with her pussy juices.  She then took his cock and inserted it.  She kissed him as she pumped up and down with her butt muscles.  She slammed him up and down as she took his cock in and out of her.  Suki moaned as she bit his neck and scratched at his body trying remain a hold of him.  She felt his arms wrapped around her as he then licked and sucked her lips.  She moaned in the throes of passion and heat as they finally came together.  This process went on into the night as they finally came several times. The room cleaner was going to have a mess to clean up after they left in the morning.  Eventually they plopped down on the bed, exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki then head Sokka as he stroked her bosom as his arm was wrapped around her, \"I love you, no matter what happens in our life time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smiled as she turned to his lips and planted them with a kiss.</span></div></div>",

The water inside them coming from the puddles and grass manipulated the wooden bodies to attack with swords and water bending imitations from pipes. Hasook was a master of the Mechanist designed puppet water bending technique inspired by plant bending.  Sokka leaped and swerved around the puppets as he hacked at them with his black blade or space sword as he called it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then heard his cell phone go off as he pulled it out and switched to one handed fighting.

Azula had an IV in her left arm as she squeezed Sokka's hand.  If he felt pain then he was putting up the most impressive show of not feeling it from Suki's point of view.  Azula was letting out a few screams here and there as she pushed, then breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe panted out small yellow flames from her mouth.  The mid wife said to her, \"Now, Azula dear don't fire bend.

She then said to the two wives and husband as the others had to wait out in the hall, \"It's a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Sokka said to Azula, \"She's going to look just like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby was lifted with blood still on it as Sokka's eyes became those of an possum elk in the head lights.

The baby is coming out backwards, I'm going to have to assist it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula looked panicked as she said to the people gathered, \"Is it going to be okay?  Please tell me my baby is going to be okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe midwife water bent up inside Azula as she used water bending to get the child back in order.  She then let the water drop as she said to Azula, \"Everything's alright, now please push again Azula.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula began to push again as the baby came out.

Then he saw it, the dangling chain from the ceiling with a hook.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe left air bender swung his staff at Sokka as the water tribesman leaped above the air sweep.  He landed nimbly on Hahn's blade as he leaped from it and grabbed onto the chain with a hook.  It had dry blood on it from it's last victim as he swung on it he used his sword to cut the chain.  The large 400 pound chain landed across Hahn as he hit the floor.  Growling six fire benders came out with fire daggers as they went to protect their commander.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka growled as he then put away his sword and grab his jaw blade.  He went to a window as he smashed it and began to fend off the attackers.  He then moved his arm in a drawing motion saying to his soldiers, \"Get out, get out.  We'll settle this another day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong Shot got out first as he fired off arrows outside the building.  Jeong Jeong got out next as Sangok covered Sokka.  Sangok got out as he went with the others.  The four went across the compound as they got to the harbor. There was a fight going on.  Jet was fending off several fire benders and water benders.  There was four air benders that were also in the fray.  30 non benders joined the benders as they attacked with Water Tribesmen weapons.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He had just won with his probending time last year the finals and Team Avatar was a legend for it.  Everything was going awesome for him, as a matter of fact he was riding with Mai to the movie theater.  It was always to catch up on the news and there was a new movie coming out.  The movie was a romanance called 'The Moon that did not Rise.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a movie about how a young southern water tribe bender had become the moon and missed her lover a fire nation boy.  He though that it was a nice movie to take Mai to on their special night.  The anniversary of the day they first said the three words that forever changed their life for the better.  \"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe limo stopped as people's cameras flashed their bulbs and the door opened.  Zuko exited with Mai as the pair walked down the red carpet.  They walked into the theater in the balcony.  They then sat down for the trailers for the movies coming out. There was an advertisement for the circus where the world's first bear was the main attraction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news reel started as there was film of soldiers in white uniforms on ships.  The news caster said to the audience, \"News from the front.  The Hurricane Horde has put a great fight against the White Lotus military.  Many young men and women have died for their country.  At chameleon bay the Hurricane Horde is suffering against the Earth Kingdom navy, which is a positive.  But, at Snake Gorilla Island of the Southern Water Tribe the Hurricane Horde has claimed another piece of territory where the new island empire is spreading fast.  The Hurricane Horde that is in the Mon Ce Sea where the occupation of  Kirachu Island is going badly.  The island was taken five weeks ago and is the first non Southern Water Tribe taken territory of the Hurricane Horde.  With such a strategic and highly praised military victory on the Hurricane Horde's part the enlistment for them has increased.  Elusive general Hahn Ginebig has been rumoured to have recruited 4,000 more troops for the Hurricane Horde's cause.  Admiral Zhao of the Hurricane Horde asks at a neutral territory of Southern Air Temple for peace between his new nation and the world.  And war criminal Sinjit Manda formerly of the Northern Air Temple has joined the Hurricane Horde in exchange of sanctuary.  This war criminal was in charge of placing blasting jelly at the bottom of the temple at several stress points last fall and blowing them up.  There were more than 16,000 deaths of Air Nomads that day.  With Sinjit Manda and Hahn Ginebig as the two major military generals deciding this war on the Hurricane Horde's part the war looks like it'll last even longer.  So, General Piandoa has asked more people to sign up for the military.  He has asked for every available bender and non bender to lend what they can to the war effort.  And that's the news from the front.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko was disgusted with how the Hurricane Horde was winning and there was nothing he could do about it.  Or could he?</span></div></div>",

He walked the hall way as he went into a door way.  Cheers were heard as Aang went to a large diamond shaped platform.  It was made of metal as Aang stepped on it.

Sokka was more than likely at drill while Toph was working with the police.  She had just graduated two days ago from the police academy.  Song dispised the sport seeing it as barbaric and that animals had more sense.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang then saw the referee in the middle.  He called them out as the pair went up taking off their robes to show thier bare chests and same colored shorts.

As the earth bridge was pulled back by earth benders the gong was sounded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up Aang threw his hand out at Hide's chest.

So, here it is, the story is about Zuko, Sokka and Aang buying a house 4 years ago.  They moved in with their first girl friends and wives.  Now, four years later their lives continue.  The first chapter shall be the main story line and then you get to pick which guy's adventure you will follow.  So, there will only a few rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No killing main characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No male character (Zuko, Aang or Sokka) shall only have one girl.  The idea is that this is a mixed marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Orgies are the idea, try to keep it that way.  If some yaoi is seen, then it's seen.  I have no qualm on yaoi or yuri.  It's not for everyone just like straight is not for everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Try to have more than just sex or lemons in the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Once you pick a route stick with it.  You can't go on the Zuko route and then just switch it up to Sokka.  You pick one guy on the route and that's it.  Less you pick the expand canon route.  Then that's a different story.</td>",
