For the most part, your home was dark, but you liked that. As you stumbled around, you managed to grab a bowl of cereal from the kitchen, spilling milk almost everywhere but your bowl, amble your way to your favorite chair and plop down into it, turning on the television. It was the news channel giving the regular feed of your boring old town. Coal exports, the weather, and some anti-anthro rally later this afternoon lead by the Mayor himself. Man, you hated that guy. But you could do nothing about it, so you simply rammed more sugary flakes into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got dressed in a simple tee, jeans, sneakers, and walked outside, enjoying the bright sunlight. Maybe today would be good. You looked out across the landscape, gargantuan houses bigger than you could comprehend around you, some houses as small as yours, but not that many. You lived in a neighborhood of giant, anthropomorphic animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...you had forgotten how big they were. You always lost track of that.</span></div></div>",

Technically, next door was an inaccurate depiction, your house was practically in her yard given your size different. You heard Meena was panicking and worried about something. Meena was very shy and nervous for an anthro, even to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk towards her door you let out a sigh. You see the doorbell that Meena installed at the bottom of the door just for you. As you press the button, you hear crashing. \"Coming!\" yelled Meena. You let out another sigh. Meena probably forgot to put her glasses on again. Bat anthros had really poor eyesight. But then Meena walks up to the door and opens it. You look up to see Meena's silver fur covered body. She was very petite, especially compared to the pudgy cow girl Betty and that buxom vixen Vixie, but Meena was still beautiful. You knew she was a bat girl, but you didn't know what kind. You didn't know if she was a fruit bat or vampire bat. Today she was wearing a pair of blue jeans and ironically, a shirt with a yellow bat girl symbol. Meena was a big nerd when it came to pop culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello?\" asks Meena. \"Alan? Is that you?\" You didn't see Meena's face, it was too high, so you didn't know if she was wearing her glasses or not. \"Down here!\" you yell. \"I'm down here Meena.\" \"Oh! Hi, Alan, Oh thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank goodness you're here.\" \"No sweat Meena, what's the word?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeena actually looked nervous and bit on her fingers. \"Alan, I need you to...\"</span></div></div>",

And don't want to take apart my home just to find them... ya know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, you patted her foot. \"Sure! Where do you think they might've fallen?\" you asked as your neighbor gently picked you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they might have fallen under the couch... or the coffee table. I was taking a nap on the couch after a long day of gaming and well... now i can seem to find them anymore.\" she said, sighing nervously. Her heart was beating pretty fast as she careful walked into the living room. Unlike his other neighbor's house, Lalonde's 'pink palace', this living room looked quite normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell normal except for the fact that it was all GIGANTIC. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a blue couch with holes in it, a brown recliner chair, Meena's beanbag chair, their widescreen tv, and so on. You used to come over and play video games with Meena when the two of you were younger. Great times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lovely bat set you next to the couch. Already from your vantage point you could tell that her glasses weren't under the coffee table. \"Just leaves the couch then.\" you say, waving up to her before going under the monolithic piece of furniture. It was dusty, dark, hot and smelled of wet matted hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay done there?\" asked the cute bat from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I'm doing fine.\" you replied as you stumbled about in the dark. After what felt like fifteen minutes, you finally emerge from underneath the couch. Covered in dust and sweat... but no glasses. They weren't down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't find them Meena.\" you grumbled, brushing off lint and other things off your clothes before turning back towards your host.

She thinks that I need to settle down soon. She wants me to get a boyfriend as soon as she can.\" Meena then pounds her head on the wall, forcing you to hide in her enormous bat ear. Whenever she comes, she usually brings in some meathead guy to try and hook me up with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch. Talk about pushy.\" Meena then shakes you out of her ear and then takes you to the front of her mouth to speak to you again. \"Please Alan! You have got to do this for me!\" \"Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Then you hear a knock. \"Oh,\" says Meena. \"That's here. Just act natural.\" You shake your head. Meena walks up to the door and you look out the keyhole to see that Meena's mom looked a lot like her daughter except with a bigger bust and reddish hair. How old was she?

Judging by how fast Meena's mother was walking, it was clear that she was extremely excited about spending time with her daughter. As they walked past the plethora of shops aligning the streets, Alan casually sat upon Meena's palm as her and her mother began talking with one another. While it did seem odd that he was acting the part as the giant bat girls lover, he just hoped that he managed to play the part convincingly enough for the older bat to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me Alan, how did you know about my dear little Meena?\" Her mother asks as her eyes beamed down at the human's tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"h-huh?\" Alan stammers unsure of how to exactly answer the question without making it sound absurd. \"w-well, Meena just happened to be my neighbor.\" He states while trying to come up with some lie in order to make the claim sound even more believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" her mother asks while giving a large smile. \"So I take it you two started out with some sort of puppy love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Meena quickly answers before Alan even had the chance to tell his own made up tale. \"We knew each other for quite some time, and soon enough we ended up becoming lovers\" Meena smiles warmly down at her human companion. \"Isn't that Right Alan Sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right!\" Alan quickly nods his head while looking up at Meena. \"How could I forget about all those times we secretly hinted about dating?\" he quickly adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! well you must tell me about your experiences when we head back home!\" Her mother requests as she lets out a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Meena and Alan return a chuckle, but not in the same pleased state as the bat woman. The two awkwardly gazed upon each other as their eyes displayed complete uncertainty over the matter. Just what type of stories could they possibly make up to appear like sweethearts? The doubtful thoughts soon vanished as the group stopped in front of a large building at the corner of a street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are!\" Meena's mother beamed proudly as she stood before what looked like an extremely fancy building. The ornate decorations and overall regal appearance of the structure could have easily been mistaken as some sort of home for an aristocrat, if it wasn't for the restaurant's name located right over the front doors.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? you want to eat here!?\" Meena stammers surprised by her mothers choice of cuisine. \"I mean..you do know how pricey this place is right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now Meena!\" her mother laughs at her daughters utter surprise. \"it's been ages since I've seen you, so we minus will celebrate in a memorable fashion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to ruin the moment, and unsure if her mother would even take her urges into consideration, Meena slowly nods her head. \"a-alright then.\" Within moments the three enter the regal establishment where they are quickly greeted by a ram garbed in the typical showy attire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening.\" he spoke in a rather esteemed manner as he gazed upon the two bats while standing stoically upon a wooden platform. \"A table for two?\" he asks while looking upon the small party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually three.\" Meena corrects as she lifts Alan up to view in front of the ram. The calm expression on his face soon dissipated as he looked down in surprise at the miniscule human being. \"e-errr...of course.\" he nods while clearing his throat. Judging by his sudden state of shock, this fancy restaurant must've been exclusive to anthros...that or this was the first time a human entered such a building. \"Right this way please.\" he politely orders as he led the three to a small table located at the side of the restaurant. As soon as the three were seated, a Lynx waitress soon walked up to the three focusing her gaze down at Alan. \"errr...do forgive me.\" she speaks in a soft yet uncertain voice. \"but, this is the first time we really had...well, a human within this restaurant.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a negative thing?\" Meena's mother asks with a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! not at all!\" quickly replies the Lynx. \"well...it's just...\" she stammers trying to find the correct words to speak. \"we don't seem to have the right accommodations for...his size.\" she answers. \"our utensils and glasses are all meant for anthros, so we don't really have anything that would be appropriate for somebody this small...err no offense.\" she quickly turns to Alan abashed. \"none taken he replies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...are you suggesting that we leave?\" The Bat woman asks as she was now having second thoughts about her meal choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Of course not!\" The Lynx answers. \"it's just that...well...this is quite an unexpected predicament for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeena looks down at Alan as a smile soon formed on her face. \"so you're saying that you have nothing his size?\" to which the Lynx slowly nods her head. \"well...will it be alright if he shared with me then?\" Meena asks while turning her gaze up at her. \"that can be arranged.\" the Lynx nods once more. \"Great! then me and him will be sharing a meal.\" Alan was surprised that Meena would be so willing as to share her own food with him. \"you have no complaints about that? right Alan?\" Meena looks down while gently rubbing his head. \"None what so ever.\" Alan replies while smiling. \"alright then, may I ask what you two would like to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving the drink order to the waitress, she soon took her leave. \"I'm so sorry about this Alan.\" Meena's mother apologizes as an ashamed expression soon grew on her face. \"if I would have known, I would have chose some place else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry.\" Alan smiles while looking upon her. \"it's perfectly fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments the Lynx soon returns holding two glasses of water for the group. \"Here you are.\" she smiles while handing the two beverages to the bats. \"Now what can I get you all to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the roast meat with saut\u00e9ed vegetables, drizzled with a hint of herbs please?\" Meena's mother answers. Judging by how she ordered her meal, this wasn't the first time she ate at some elegant establishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! and as for you two?\" The waitress turns and looks at Meena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"we'll have the Fettuccine Alfredo please.\" Meena answers. While it did sound like such a common choice to make within such a fancy restaurant, it did seem like the easiest thing for Alan and her to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, it will be out shortly.\" The Lynx nods and leaves the two to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the waitress did say that the food would come out shortly, she actually did mean it. In just minutes, the food was prepared and set right before the three. \"here you are! enjoy your meals.\" she says with a big grin on her face as she soon walked off to tend to another table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, the three then began to proceed eating there meals. As Alan knelt on the side of the plate to look down at the massive pond of pasta, he turned his head to glance at the older bat. It surely did seem like Meena's mother was quite adept when it came to high class. His attention was quickly disturbed as a sudden movement caused him to fall straight within the patch of noodles and cream sauce. As he tried to stand up on the slippery surface, he soon felt another odd movement surrounding him. In moments he was soon raised upwards, along with a batch of noodles. As he turned his head to the side, the view of Meena's approaching open maw took over his sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Meena rolls her eyes. \"Are you sure about this Mom?\" Her mother puts her arm around her shoulder. \"Of course dear! We should unwind after the day we've had! I just found out that my little girl has a cute boyfriend, and he just met his future mother in law! I'd say quite a bit has happened.\" You and Meena glance at each other when she says \"mother in law\", Meena turning red as she does so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" she says.

With her so close you can smell the wine on her breath. Hell, she's so big its like the wind itself smells like wine! You don't get a chance to answer as you feel yourself being snatched up. \"No way, he's mine!\" Meena says with a pout. She follows up with a barrage of kisses.

Meekly you waved her worries off as you smiled up at her. Maybe it was the amount of near-death experiences you had had within the last hour, or maybe it was finally being able to get intimate with a girl you had grown to love, but you were ecstatic to see her, and your body seemed to agree with this assessment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeena blushed as she noticed this. \"Would've thought you had had enough intimacy with mega giantesses with my mom.\" she chuckled, smirking approvingly as she brought you close to her face. Her lips covering you in wet kisses. You then inform her that you most of that was forced with Martha, and you were hoping to have your first time be with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause you loved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeena blushed again, tears of joy welled up in her eyes, noticeable even in the shower. \"Oh Allan... I love you too!\" she squeaked happily, before smothering you in more kisses, her plush lips like gentle cushions rubbing all over your tiny body. This just made your arousal even more painfully obvious. Giggling, Meena's tongue teased your tip, sending pleasurable vibrations through your body. She continued to tease and play with your rock-hard member, well until you finally achieved your own climax right onto her tongue, taking your mega girlfriend by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tested this new taste in her mouth, rolling it over her tongue, before swallowing. \"Not bad... got more?\" she asked, as she...</span></div></div>",

Meena climbs the stairs with you in hand as her mother follows. You see that she's headed for her bedroom and look up at her. She smiles awkwardly before her mother cuts in. \"Well I think we've had a good day! I got to meet my little girl's cute little boyfriend,\" she says as she ruffles your hair. \"And we all had a little fun!\" Meena and you both turn red. Meena can't believe she actually kissed you like that. You can't believe you got to know her mother so up close and personal. The two of you say goodnight to her mother as Meena enters her bedroom. \"Maybe you two can get started on some grandchildren!\" her mom calls out as Meena shuts the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your mom's kind of lively huh?\" you ask now that the two of you are alone. Meena looks down on you. \"Yeah, she likes to take an active role in my life. That's why she was always so persistent in getting me a boyfriend.\" You smile and look away a little. \"That explains that comment about grandchildren huh?\" Meena immediately gets flustered. \"Oh! Don't mind her! She was just being silly! As if we'd have kids! That doesn't mean I wouldn't want to have kids with you! I mean, I just....\" She keeps stammering and stumbling over her own words. You find yourself getting flustered as well. \"No, I get it. Don't worry about it. I mean, can an Anthro and a human even have kids? Sex alone would really be something!\" The two of you fall silent with your heads down. Both of your faces are completely red. You don't know why you're feeling this way. You've never thought of Meena in a romantic way before, but spending so much time with her has changed your perception. Just now the thought of sex with her made your heart race like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeena breaks the silence. \"Well I guess we should get to sleep.\" She says as she carries you over to the bed. \"We're sleeping together?\" you ask. \"Well yeah, we're supposed to be in a relationship. Also my mom might come in and it would look weird if we slept separately.\" she explains, sounding kind of hopeful. You smile at her. \"I guess you're right. Besides, I already got to sleep pretty close to both you and your mom.\" you say with a laugh. \"Did my mom's chest feel good?\" Meena suddenly asks. \"What?\" you respond. \"My mother's chest, did it feel better than mine?\" It looks likes she pouting. \"I know my boobs aren't very big, so....\" You can see that she's a little worried about this. \"Meena It doesn't matter, you're a beautiful girl and I like everything about you.\" Both Meena and yourself are shocked by this. You said it without thinking, but you meant every word. Meena smiles at you and gives you a kiss, and you return it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't say for sure, but you think this fake relationship might actually go somewhere. Meena brings you up to her face. \"You still haven't answered my question. Did my mom's boobs feel good?\" You get nervous for a second before Meena laughs. \"I'm just kidding, lets get to bed.\" You sigh in relief as she sets you down and walks to her closet. She changes into her pajamas right in front of you, causing you to blush. When she turns around and sees your red face she looks pretty satisfied. She lies down in bed and places you on her chest, her hand holding you in place. She's very gentle, so it makes you feel secure. The both of you then drift off to sleep. How does the night go?   </span></div></div>",

You smiled up at her \"Hi there meena!\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed a smile and stopped nervously shaking as held you in her hands, wriggling her fingers, feeling you in her palm. Still blushing, Meena tried to make small talk, about upcoming games and movies, but it came out forced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kinda games do you like Meena?\" you asked, trying to get her to calm down, placing a hand on her thumb. This cheered her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh... Duh... Dating sims.\" she meekly replied. You grinned \"oh? What kinda dating sims??\" you asked. Meena wanted to answer, wanted to let him know it was the kind of sim that had the beautiful Anthro girl finding love and acceptance with a charming Human boy... but didn't know what you'd make of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation was cut short by the oncoming chest of Lalonde as she triumphantly held up the jug of milk. Her pillowy breasts jiggled into Meena's hands, smishing onto you as a result. \"Here is zee milk!!\" she said, a big proud smile on her face. Then she noticed Meena's shocked expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mon Dieu... what is wrong Meena??\" asked the sheep woman, then she noticed where Meena's hands were... and remembered they were previously holding her human neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!!! Merci!!\" she exclaimed, shoving her free hand into her cleavage, withdrawing you from it's massive embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardone!!\" she giggled as she backed up, freeing Meena's hands of the bountiful chest. Chuckling, blushing and twitching a bit Meena took the milk and was making her way to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait!!\" implored the busty bovid \"Would you like zome cake??\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised Meena (almost as much as suddenly copping a feel on another woman), and she seemed to mull it over before replying...</span></div></div>",

You sat in front of the lovely sheep girl, who cooed and giggled as she petted you while you ate.

Calling out to Vixie to stop, you tried to slip out from beneath her finger, but as stated... the silky exterior of the lovely lamb's nightgown made it difficult.

Needless to say as soon as you made contact, your sexy french-accented neighbor practically melted with pleasure, knocking Vixie's hand away and grasping you there, pushing you into her quivering lips.

You feel the walls of fur get tighter as she grips them with a moan. Things take another turn however just as you manage to poke your tiny head out to see whats going on. Her boobs take another shift as Lalonde's hand reaches out and grabs one of them. \"Oooh!\" Vixie moans as the sheep squeezes. In response to the groping Vixie reaches for Lalonde and grips one of her ass cheeks. \"Ready to play huh?\" Vixie asks with a smirk before pulling the sheep closer. You end up getting squished between their boobs as their bodies press against each other. In another swift motion Vixie's hand moves toward Lalonde's head and pulls her in for a kiss. Lalonde looks surprised at first but soon begins making out in earnest. Their hands are feeling up each others bodies as they kiss other, all the while you're watching from the fox's boobs as the two gigantic faces above you go at it. Its insanely hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point during their makeout Vixie breaks the kiss and glances down, spotting you still between her boobs. \"Well I think we've ignored Alan here a little too long, wouldn't you say?\" she asks. You are then lifted up between two of Lalonde's fingers and suspended in between their faces. \"Oh I am sorry Alan, but eet feels so good!\" she tells you with a smile. \"Why don't we get him in on the action?\" Vixie asks before opening her mouth. You look down to see her waiting maw. Her tongue rolls out like a red carpet, or a monster waiting to drag you into its cave. Lalonde drops you onto the squishy wet appendage and it immediately curls back into its home. You can see Lalonde's mouth getting closer through Vixie's open mouth. Her tongue snakes out just as they connect, sealing you into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air inside your new prison is hot and humid. Its a good thing the girls don't have bad breath. There's a strong smell of mint throughout the moist cavern. Just as Lalonde's tongue enters Vixie's moves to meet it, taking you along for the ride. They press together, squishing you and covering you with saliva. As they intertwine you get trapped in their embrace, sliding every which way as they lick each other like crazy. Your ears are filled with the sounds of their moans. It comes from everywhere, like the voices of two goddesses. In the chaos you slip away from the tongue battle and tumble against a wall. Looking up you see that its actually a tooth, Vixie's, judging from its sharpness. You only get a moment of rest before the girls realize they've lost you. Lalonde's tongues begins darting around her partner's mouth, probing every corner. Her search eventually ends with you being scooped up and returned to the fray. Getting tossed about while listening to them moan and giggle has gotten you very hard, and as the make out session continues you reach your limit. With a gasp you blow your load onto their tongues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside the girls stop kissing and look at each other knowingly. They can both taste your \"contribution\" and break contact. Lalonde reaches into her mouth and pulls your out. \"Hee hee! Zat was quite good no?\" she giggles at your exhausted form. \"I'll say,\" Vixie adds. \"But what do you say we have a little more fun? I could certainly go another round.\" You look from one giantess to the other. Vixie has a smirk and Lalonde is lost in thought. What does the sheep decide?</span></div></div>",

She actually looks really cute. \"Well...I think zat I am not done yet.\" she says, then shoots you an adorable smile. Her earlier reluctance is gone and now she's acting as playful as Vixie. Suddenly you feel a claw run gently up your back. \"You took the words right out of my mouth.\" the fox says. She moves next to Lalonde and puts her hand around her waist. From your position in Lalonde's grasp you can see them both staring at you. One look at Lalonde's kind smile and Vixie's seductive one makes you retract your earlier thought. Lalonde might be playful but Vixie is downright kinky. \"I'll let you lead the way.\" she says, and the sheep begins walking. She places you in her palm and looks straight ahead as she goes. Looking up you can just see her enormous breasts bobbing up and down with each step. Soon the three of you reach your destination-Lalonde's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you enter the room Lalonde hands you off to Vixie as she begins undressing. In one quick motion she removes her nightgown and the two mountains that were your prison finally burst out without restrictions. She then climbs onto the bed and lies on her back, watching you sensually. You enjoy the view for a second before Vixie holds you over her body and drops you. Its like you fell out of a plane. The ground that is Lalonde's body gets closer and closer until you finally make impact. Lalonde giggles as the surface you landed on wobbles. You get up and find yourself on a vast pink surface next to a huge tower like structure. One look at her face in the distance tells you that you're on her breast, so the tower must be her nipple. It amazes you just how huge she is, even though you see her all the time. \"Eez eet to your liking?\" the sheep asks lovingly. \"Hey little guy, heads up!\" Vixie says before you can answer. You look up to find that she has already shed her clothing and is lowering herself onto Lalonde. Her shadow covers you as her own massive boobs prepare to drop down on Lalonde's. In an instant she lands and their boobs press together. You can only lay there and become aroused as the two furry orbs squash you between themselves. They rub against you as the two women start kissing each other once again. They go on for a few minutes before Vixie lifts herself slightly and grabs you. \"Okay Alan, you have a job to do.\" she says and drops you on the nape of her neck. \"Get down there and finish the job.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her neck you look down the landscape that is her back, taking in her curvaceous form. \"Vixie, you're over a mile tall! It would take forever to get down there!\" you complain. \"Hmm...you have a point.\" she says. To help you along she leans up and arches her back, sending you tumbling down the slope of her body. When you reach her butt she lets herself fall back onto Lalonde and resumes kissing. You stand atop her butt cheek and peer over the edge. The curved mountain you're stranded on is breathtaking, especially with Lalonde's equally fantastic ass right under it. Throwing all caution to the wind you leap over the edge and grab onto her fur. You then let go and fall for a couple of seconds before grabbing hold again. Its funny to think that while these two beauties are going at it you're just a speck clinging to one of their asses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue using your method of climbing down until you reach the point where their bodies meet. The smell of sex is overwhelming and gets you more than excited. The scent is flowing from Vixie's pussy, which you're currently hanging right next to. Her fur in this place is slick with her juices. She's very moist right now, as is Lalonde, who's own sex is directly below. After steeling yourself you make your way inside, sending a jolt through the giant fox. \"Finally!\" she moans loudly, and starts kissing Lalonde more aggressively. Inside her, you walk along the moist ground, running your hand along the wall. The whole place shakes as Vixie shudders from your stimulation. You start getting more aggressive, groping and massaging the walls. The air becomes thicker and the place gets wetter and wetter. When it reaches the boiling point you hear Vixie let out a howl on the outside, and a wave of juices flows toward you, washing you out. Vixie's cum oozes out with you stuck inside, dribbling down to Lalonde's body. When you reach her labia you grab and hold on to avoid going any further. She bucks when she feels you gripping he and gropes Vixie's ass tighter. \"Oh Alan!!\" she yells. You climb along her folds and enter her cave, which is just as wet as Vixie's. You give a repeat performance and clean out her vagina as well. This time however, you end up on the bed in a puddle of her cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giantesses lie there panting while you try to trudge through the goop you're trapped in. When you finally get free you look around at their legs surrounding you. The bed shifts as Vixie gets off of Lalonde and lies next to her. She reaches down and plucks you off of the bed. \"That was fantastic.\" she says before giving you kiss. \"Oh, let me as well!\" Lalonde says and grabs you. Her lips mash into you and she smooches you aggressively. \"Okay, lets get up, its still the middle of the day.\" Vixie says.</span></div></div>",

Winking at you, she starts to turn back to her counter, to resume work (and alleviate the squirrel's suffering) when you suddenly approached her lovely hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty!!\" you called up to her. Surprised she turned back around, leaning down slightly. \"Yeah hun??\" she asked, curious as to what you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath as you looked into her eyes you forced the words out...</span></div></div>",

The catgirl was casually sifting through a book about vampire lore. Lily must've sensed you, as she gave a half-hearted \"excuse me.\" without looking up from her book. Closing it, and returning the book to it's shelf, she looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... hi... Alan.\" she said, cracking a slight smile as her studded tail flicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... hi Lily. Haven't seen you around much. How're things?\" you asked, nervous. You always had a thing for goth girls, and now the sexy queen of them was standing over you. You hoped she couldn't notice you blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehhh... you know... doing well. You??\" she asked. This was the most either of you had ever said to each other. You tell her you're doing well also, and if she had any good book suggestions? This sudden interest in her seemed to amuse Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... there's the Dark Hunter chronicles... the Esoteric Gospel Rites... stuff like that.\" none of those were really hitting ya. Without a word the giant shecat leaned down and picked you up gently, bringing you closer to her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a David Morsoe book?? The kind of mystery story that old housewives read??\" she asked, grinning. Nervously you explain why you were there, getting things for your folks. Her grin turned into a smile. \"That's really sweet of you Alan.\" she said as she placed you on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you get through the line.\" she offered. You were, quite frankly, speechless. You and Lily never so much as did anything more than share a brief moments of eye contact. Nervously, you thanked her and held onto the black hoodie she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, and the two of you were outside the bookstore. \"So... Lily... got anything planned for today?\" you hazarded to ask. Now it was her turn to look shocked. \"Uhh... not much.... really. Was just going to go.....\"</span></div></div>",

Lily, the most beautiful goth girl you had ever seen, was inviting you to have lunch with her. This was like a dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Lily, I'd love to join you.\" You said nervously, trying to hide your face so she didn't see you blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright then, pipsqueak! Climb aboard!\" Lily said, reaching down her index finger for you to climb on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith butterflies in your stomach you climbed back onto Lily's finger and let her lift you into the air. This time, however, she didn't put you onto her shoulder. Instead she dropped you on top of her head, and you were lost in a jungle of her ebony fur. Looking around, you noticed that you were right next to one of her massive ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I'm gonna be giving you a ride, you're gonna have to do something for me in return. How about you give me a scratch behind the ear and we'll call it even.\" Lily said teasingly while gently ruffling your hair with her fingertip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Lily. So, where are we going to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this amazing place that serves the best fish you'll ever taste. They even carry human and anthro sized servings. Trust me, you'll love it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily then began walking, and as the ground below you shook with her footsteps, you took it as your cue to start scratching her ear. As you did it, you heard Lily start purring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that's the spot. Keep it up, little guy. I might just want to keep you as my own little pet. Then I could have you do things like this for me every day.\" Lily said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both laughed, though secretly you wouldn't mind being kept as a pet by Lily. She was always nice to you, albeit a bit on the playful side. She was also beautiful beyond words, and being surrounded by her fur like this gave you a warm relaxing feeling. It was almost as though this was where you belonged. Being able to spend every day with Lily, getting to interact with her beautiful body on a daily basis, it would be perfect. Eventually you got so absorbed in those thoughts that you didn't even notice when you arrived at the restaurant. It wasn't until Lily poked you in the back with her claw that you stopped scratching her ear and snapped back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey shrimp, you can stop now. We're here.\" Lily said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, you climbed aboard Lily's massive finger and let her carry you in her palm. She walked up to the woman at the counter, a petite mouse girl with glasses, and began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Suzy, long time no see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily, it's been ages! How have you been?\" The mouse girl asked, sounding excited to see Lily again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I've been fine. A little rough patch here and there, but nothing really worth complaining about. And you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been doing great! I can't thank you enough for helping me get this job! You're the best friend a mouse could ask for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's some fearsome irony, isn't it?\" Lily said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, what brings you here today?\" Suzy asked, adjusting her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just here to get a bite to eat. Can you show me to a table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. One anthro table, coming right up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one anthro and one human, thank you. I'm here with a little friend of mine.\" Lily said, holding out her palm to let her friend see you. You smiled and waved at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry sir! I didn't even see you there! Okay then, two tables coming up.\" Suzy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy then lead the way to an open table and gestured for Lily to sit down. Lily took her seat and placed you on top of the table. You then watched as Suzy reached into her pocket and pulled out a much smaller table and chair, one that was made to fit someone of your scale. She carefully put the smaller table on top of the main one, right in front of Lily, and waited for you to take your seat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, what will you be having today?\" Suzy asked, looking at Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in the mood for tuna today.\" Lily replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you, sir?\" Suzy asked, looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have what she's having.\" You said, smiling up at Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. Two tunas, coming right up!\" Suzy said as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the mouse girl returned with two trays carrying tuna. One was massive to feed an anthro like Lily, and the other was tiny enough for a human like you to eat. Suzy walked away, and the two of you began to eat. Lily wasn't kidding, the fish at this place was amazing. Throughout the course of the lunch, you and Lily did a lot of talking. It was a truly amazing experience for you. You wished that this could last forever, but soon enough you both finished your fish and the lunch was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you left, however...</span></div></div>",

Kevin lets out a laugh. \"Isn't she a riot?\" \"That's one word for her.\" \"Well Al, I introduced you to my anthro girl.\" \"Don't you have some friends in my height class?\" asks Milan as she wiggles her tongue. \"Kev wanted to see how the anthro side of town's been treating you.\" You let out a laugh. \"Well, I guess we could introduce your girlfriend to the neighbors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Milan's body begun to glow in all sorts of colors. She turns red and then yellow and then pink and blue and violet and even checkered. Kevin lets out a whistle. \"That's why I love this chick. She's made of surprises.\" You let out a sigh. This girlfriend was not getting on your good side. But you had to introduce her to someone. Which neighbor do you visit first?</span></div></div>",

Cleo, I want you to meet my friend Alan.\" It was there you look up and look in shock at a large black furred jackal woman looking at you. Cleo looked taller than an average anthro and that was quite a feet in itself. She also had hieroglyphs tattooed all over her body and two earrings shaped like anhks. She was dressed just like a sorceress and had bright green eyes and long blue hair that reached past her butt and nearly hit the ground. She sorta looked like Anubis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were speechless but Cleo didn't speak either. Instead, she smiles and waves down at you, showing you her massive teeth.

Carnivores are the best kind.\" It was here Cleo picked both of you up and placed you on her shoulder. Still smiling and still not talking. That sort of made you nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't say much does she Kevin?\" \"Yeah,\" said Kevin. \"Tell me about it. Ouch!\" Cleo pokes Kevin on the back with one of her claws and gives her boyfriend a slight glare. \"Hey, I'm not criticizing beautiful.\" You let out a laugh. \"Careful Kevin, it's easier to get in the dog house when you're dating a dog the size of a highway. Ouch!\" Cleo poked you too and actually begun to growl slightly. Kevin took this opportunity to whisper something important to you. \"Cleo doesn't like being called a dog. She's a jackal.\" \"Oops, I'm terribly sorry Cleo. Won't happen again.\" Cleo just smiles to signify she forgives you. \"So Kevin, why come to town with a huge do... jackal in tow?\" Kevin clears his throat before giving you the answer.</span></div></div>",

With that, Cleo puts you down and walks off with her tiny boyfriend who she proceeds to place in her cleavage. Well, at least now you've got a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night you went to the restaurant, it looked a lot like a pyramid. It was obviously built for anthros given the size.

Patty looks down and gives you a smile, showing her intimidating looking hippo fangs. \"Ooh,\" she says in a girlishly high pitched voice you'd never expect from a hippo. \"So this is Kevin's friend. I gotta say Cleo, he looks much cuter than your \"big strong\" man.\" Cleo shakes her head as Patty lets out a girlish laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Patty looks down on you, you begin to sweat. The last creature you expected to be your date was an obese semiaquatic mammal with huge fangs. You couldn't help but stare at her and she lowers herself to the point where you're standing dangerously close to her house sized lips. \"Well look at that, you like me already. I can tell, after all, I am the most beautiful anthro this side of Coalton Shores. Ah, why wait until the end of the night.\" Before you could do anything, Patty pushes you into her lips as she gives you a giant kiss. You let out a muffled scream as she even puts you in her mouth and licks you with her enormous tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Patty spits you out, you're covered in lipstick and saliva. \"Ugh.\" You groan. Kevin lets out a laugh as Cleo picks him up and places him on her shoulder. \"Good luck with Patty Alan.\" Kevin lets out another laugh and holds out his hand as Cleo gives him a humongous high five. As Cleo and Kevin enter Nile Moors, Patty picks you up again and you let out a slight scream. \"See that jackal carrying her man? When the night's over, that's going to be you and me.\" \"Huh, what do you...Ah!\" Before you can finish your sentence, Patty crams you deep into her cleavage. You can barely move and it's nothing but darkness. What's more is that its sticky and reeks of sweat. You're thinking \"I am so going to kill Kevin when this night is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes in Patty's monster sized breasts, you both arrive with Kevin and Cleo at a table. Cleo gestures to Patty to ask where you are. \"Oh don't worry, it's not like I put him someplace where he'd fall and get crushed. Cleo reaches into her cleavage and places you on the table as you inhale deeply and Kevin walks up to you. \"I think she likes you. You're gonna be boyfriend and girlfriend at the end of the night.\" \"As if,\" you whisper. \"Next time you hook me up with one of your girlfriend's friends, tell me the species first.\" \"Oh, hold that thought.\" Kevin shuts you up just in time for a falcon waiter to come by. \"Welcome to Nile Moors, where the sands of time flow between both worlds. Can I start you off with some drinks?\"</span></div></div>",

Human sized and anthro sized.\" The waiter places a smaller table in front of you and Kevin, human sized of course. You realize at this point that Cleo might actually be mute. Kevin was dating an anthro that couldn't even speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you wonder. How did the waiter understand her. Then you realize something, all three anthros you've seen tonight at the restaurant were anthros of animals you'd normally find in Egypt. Maybe there's an anthro version of Egypt on Zoonova and they know each other. Then the waiter turns to you and Patty. \"And the beta couple?\" \"Beta couple?\" You ask. \"Wait right...Guh.\" Your hippopotamus date lets out a giggle before pushing you against one of her mountain sized breasts. She seemed really intent on making you her boyfriend. You know a few female neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just take a couple of waters.\" The waiter nods his head and then flies off to the kitchen. Once the waiter's gone, Patty and Kevin let out a laugh because they noticed one of the waiter's feathers was sticking up on his head. Cleo even gives a smile. \"Do you know him?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty lets out a laugh. \"Oh course sweetie. We're from the same neighborhood. Nile Moors is a closer to home version of Kththuus.\" \"Kththuus?\" you ask. \"What the heck is that?\" \"It's the Zoonovan equivalent of Egypt,\" says Kevin. \"To be perfectly honest, the technology is modern, but the fashion sense is ancient.\" Cleo glares at Kevin. \"Not that it doesn't look good on you Cleo.\" Cleo then gives a smile. Patty wiggles her large body and then looks down on you. \"Personally cutie, I don't go for the whole Cleopatra look, but then again, why stick with one style when you look good in them all.\" Patty laughs and her body jiggles. \"Ugh.\" Patty hears a crack and then lets out a grunt as she is forced to take another chair at the table and sit on two chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one thing I hate about this place,\" she complained. \"Whoever built such shoddy furniture obviously wasn't feeling too consider to hippo anthros.\" You let out a laugh but then close your mouth because you didn't want to insult Patty's weight, but Patty just smiles down on you. \"Don't be shy, you can admit it. The more woman the more beautiful and more for you to run around on little man.\" Patty giggles again and Kevin laughs. You turn your head and glare at Kevin. \"I'm going to get you for hooking me up with this anthro Hiddenberg Kevin,\" you say to your friend under your breath. \"Next thing you know I'll be having a shotgun pointing down on me.\" \"You can only hope.\" Replies Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh. You really wish you knew what you were getting into when you agreed to this date, but it might be so bad. Sure Patty was oversized even for an anthro and a little vain but she seemed friendly.</span></div></div>",

I'd say its so big, that Earth can be its moon. But even that's giving your little blue marble too much credit.\" You let out a laugh. That was actually pretty funny. But then you see Patty's large breasts and you shudder. Not that you didn't enjoy it, but you didn't want to be stuffed in hippo cleavage again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly decide to ask more. \"So, about Zoonova.\" Patty turns to Cleo and the jackal girl nods her head, gesturing that it's safe to tell you about Zoonova. \"Well,\" says Patty. \"Let's just say Zoonova has more in common with Earth than you think.\" \"Excuse me?\" Patty lowers her head to the point where you're dangerously close to one of her moon sized seductive eyes. \"For every place on this pebble you and Kevin call home...\" \"Hey!\" yells Kevin. \"Watch it Patty.\" Patty simply pushes Kevin away with her fingers and lodges him between Cleo's breasts. \"As I was saying,\" says Patty back to you. For every country on Earth, there is a similar, if not exactly the same place on Zoonova. Kththuus is the Zoonovan Egypt, Zeizenheim is the Zoonovan Germany, Kaishidu is the Zoonovan Japan, ya, ya, ya, ya...\" Patty raises her head and lets out a yawn, showing her large teeth. Even for an herbivore, those big teeth made you shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it. That would explain Lalonde's accent.\" \"Lalonde?\" asks Kevin. \"One of my neighbors. This big sheep with a city crushing H-cup. She must be from Zoonovan France.\" Patty's eyes then suddenly pop. \"H-cup?\" Patty then looks at her own breasts and squeezes them as she gets in a huff. \"Are you saying you'd rather be out with some ovine tramp? Is that it Alan?\" \"No! No! Patty! I mean, you're beautiful, for a hippo. I'm not picky about anthro chicks, I mean.\" If Cleo could talk, she'd be snickering and Kevin laughs himself as his girlfriend squeezes him out of her breasts. \"Leave him be Patty. He hasn't had a date since.... well since ever.\" \"Kevin!\" you yell. Patty lets out a laugh and then puts one of her breasts on top of you, pinning you to the table. \"You're lucky you're so cute,\" the hippo giantess says. \"But this is what a real woman's jigglers look like... got it.\" \"Got it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty then lifts you up and kisses you again before putting you on the table. She had an attitude to her, but she really did like you. Maybe this double date would go smoother than you thought. Never thought you'd get this far on a double date involving a jackal and a hippo.</span></div></div>",

Patty leans in close and whispers in his ear, confusing the rest of you. The waiter nods and heads off. \"What was that about?\" you ask. Patty giggles and once again pushes her boob against you. \"I just ordered for all of us. Don't worry, I think you'll all like what I picked.\" You're about to say something but Kevin and Cleo seem okay with it so you just go along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter later returns with the food. As he places the plates you marvel at the size of them. You feel a movement nearby and look to see Patty lifting her fork to begin eating her salad. She moves the fork to her mouth and begins chewing the lettuce. Its a little amazing and frightening at the same time. She's so huge ts like she's chomping down a giant tree. The crunch of the lettuce is loud to your tiny ears. You see that Cleo is enjoying a rare steak, which is even more unsettling. She tears at it with her razor teeth while a bit of blood trickles down her chin. \"Hey babe, you've got a little something on your face.\" Kevin calls up to her. She smiles and wipes herself off while he goes back to his burger. Its then that you realize you don't have anything. \"Um, Patty?\" you ask. \"I thought you ordered for me.\" The hippo smirks and reaches down to pluck you off the table. \"Well I thought it would be more romantic for us to share a plate.\" she says and gives you a kiss. As you wipe yourself of you see that she's placing you on the edge of the plate. In front of you is serving of roast beef and some mashed potatoes. \"I had them put a tiny morsel of meat and potatoes on my plate.\" Patty tells you with a giggle. It may be tiny to her but its a full sized meal for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dig in to the meal before you and find that its quite delicious. \"Man, anthros can really cook!\" you say as you eat. \"You know it!\" Kevin calls over. \"Well if you like anthro cooking, then I'll make you a good meal one day.\" Patty says from behind you. You turn and are a caught off guard by how close to you her face is. You stumble back and fall into a lettuce leaf. \"Well it looks like you're about done with your portion.\" she says. The roast and potatoes are practically gone, so she's right. \"Now I think you need to have some vegetables.\" she adds. You see a gleam in her eye and a second later she gently pushes you onto the lettuce leaf. She then begins mixing the salad, getting you caught in the middle of all the vegetables. \"I'll let you have some of mine.\" she says with a smile. You watch as her fork scoops up the veggies around you until suddenly the lettuce leaf you're on is lifted into the air. You her mouth getting closer and shut your eyes when your about to enter. She doesn't eat you, but bites down just inches from your body. Her lips are right in front of you and she gives you a little kiss before pulling you away and chewing. \"Go on, have some.\" she tells you. She breaks off a few pieces and sets them on the plate, placing you down as well. You shrug and eat it while she watches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finish the lettuce Patty taps you lightly. \"Thirsty?\" she asks. You nod and she immediately whisks you into the air. You see you're headed for her glass of water and roll your eyes. She must not have ordered you a drink so you could share. She dunks you in so you can reach and you sip up as much as you can. \"Okay, thats good!\" you call up. However instead of pulling you out she drops you in. \"Oh I'm sorry!\" she says, but you can tell she's not. \"Here, let me help you clean that off.\" she tells you, even though its only water. She then picks you out of the drink and brings you to her mouth. The giant maw opens and her tongue begins assaulting you, licking you all over. Just when you think she's done the tongue pulls you inside and tosses you around a bit. When she spits you into her hand you're a little dizzy, but a little aroused as well. She looks at you with a sly smile, and you see that Kevin and Cleo are watching as well. When they see you look at them they both smile and Kevin gives you a thumbs up. You turn away from them and blush a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everyone is finished eating you get ready to leave. Cleo picks up Kevin while Patty stuffs you into her cleavage. Its still kind of sweaty but you're able to make yourself comfortable. She smiles down at you as she walks out of the restaurant. What's next?</span></div></div>",

You look away for a second. \"Well..no, but it would be nice if you asked me.\" you say. Patty chuckles and lifts you up for a kiss. \"You just sit there and look cute.\" she tells you. \"Us girls will take care of the rest.\" You are then put back in her boobs as they continue walking. You really can't complain. At this point its pretty comfortable and Patty has grown on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a booming walk Cleo and Patty enter a building. It appears they're standing at a counter so you try and get a better look. Its a booth, and the one operating it is an anthro mouse. \"Here you are, two anthros and two humans.\" he says as he hands Cleo and Patty two tickets each. Guess they decided on the movies. You can't complain since you didn't have any better ideas. Besides, this date has turned out better than you expected so you should just go with the flow. Soon you're in a line for snacks. Patty buys a tub of popcorn and a soda. You marvel at the size of it. Its like a stadium to you. It gets darker as they enter the theater and find seats. Patty grunts a little when she sits. Seems she has to use two seats. \"Ugh, this again.\" she mutters. \"Us plus sized anthros just can't get good seats.\" You chuckle a little, causing her to look down at you. \"Whats so funny little man? You find my rump funny?\" she asks. \"No, of course not! I think its great! I kinda like bigger women...\" you say and then trail off embarrassed. Patty giggles and gives you a pat on the head. \"Just kidding cutie, but its good to know you like my butt. You'll see a lot more of it eventually.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie starts you see that its a comedy. Its actually not that different from human movies, there are just anthros in it. Patty lifts you out of her cleavage and sets you on top of her breast. Its just like a huge bed, and its really comfortable. You lay back and watch the movie like this. Its pretty funny, and you find yourself getting into it. Patty watches as well, grabbing handfuls of popcorn. Sometimes a small piece will fall to you and you eat it. A while into the movie you look over and see Cleo kissing and licking Kevin in her hand. This doesn't really surprise you. Then you look up just in time to see Patty's massive fingers descending. They grab you and deposit you in her own hand. Then her gigantic lips come down and press you into her palm. She kisses you over and over, with you not resisting. The two anthro girls continue to make out with their dates through the movie, and when it ends the lights come back on. \"Well I had fun, did you?\" Patty says with a wink. You blush and look down as you answer. \"Yeah, I liked it.\" Patty grins and Kevin laughs. \"Well then how about you return the favor.\" she says and puckers her lips. You decide to just go with it and give her huge lips a smooch. She giggles like crazy and kisses you back. \"All right Alan!\" Kevin calls over. Cleo smiles and gives Patty thumbs up. \"Well I guess we should get going.\" Kevin says. \"Alan, I'm sure Patty will be more than happy to give you a lift.\" Patty puts you in her boobs again. \"Of course I would.' she says.

You hear the door open and close before you are taken out. \"Well, here we are!\" she says. You look around and see that its very nice. She then sets you on a table and walks away, the ground rumbling as she does. Looking more you see that most of the furniture is big even by anthro standards. She is a rather large girl after all. The table you're on is like a whole country in itself. It stretches on forever, making you realize once again how small you are compared to the anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty returns and plants herself on the couch by the table. It groans under her weight and she smiles down at you. \"Care to join me?\" she asks and reaches for you. She drops you next to herself and you roll down the incline into her rump. Its very soft and as you try to gain some balance you end up grabbing it. \"Oh!\" she says happily. \"A little eager are we?\" It seems as though she's more bold (if thats possible) now that the two of you are alone. Her massive finger comes down and presses you into cheek, then rubs you around. \"Let me help.\" she says. After she's finished she brings you to her face. It fills your vision, and you find yourself admiring her looks more. Are you falling for her? \"Don't think I can't see your tiny cheeks turning red!\" she says with a squeal. You look away but she brings her lips closer for a kiss. the saliva covers you and her tongue begins licking you. Its surprising how gentle a tongue the size of a building can be. You find yourself growing erect, and so does Patty. \"Oh! I think its time to take this elsewhere!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are then carried to another room and from her huge palm see a bed. You think you know where this is going. \"Uh, Patty.\" you say.  'Maybe you're moving a little fast.' She just giggles. \"Oh come on don't be shy!\" she says and dumps you onto the bed. Its much bigger than the table, and seems to go on forever. Meanwhile Patty has started to strip, revealing her gigantic chubby body slowly. She releases her breasts first, letting them spring forth. Then she moves to the lower half, showing you her naked hips and thighs. Every part of her is so big, she's like a country waiting to be explore. She then plops down on the bed with you. \"Okay little man, time to explore.\" she says as she lays on her...</span></div></div>",

She churred, purred and rumbled as you reached the 'mouth' of this love canal. Inquistive, and a bit mischievous, you take a mighty handhold of her large clitoris 'nub', which stuck out above you like some cute fleshy signpost. A massive moan shook the soft, and puffy, ground that you stood upon as you licked her throbbing clitoris. Patty gasped at this, bucking her wide hips reflexively, sending you careening into her open snatch. It felt like a musky 'slip-n-slide' at your size as you slid down inside her intimate nethers. Needless to say, her body was REALLY bucking by this point. Her vaginal walls began to tighten as she neared climax. The noises you heard coming from her, at your current location, sounded like someone doing vocal impressions of whales... or maybe a steam train? Whatever the appropriate simile, you were soon joined, in earnest... by your new lover's vast fingers. Clearly this lovely lady was in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest... so were you. Sporting a massively hard erection that could, theoretically... bludgeon a deer to death. Wanting to please Patty, you begin to rub your naked body up against the velvety walls of this immense vagina. Already quite worked up by this point, both you and the lovely Hippo achieve climax at about the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the mile-high anthro, it was sheer ecstasy... for you it was both euphoric and mind-numbingly terrifying (like a wet roller-coaster/cannon) as you shot out of the 'Mystery Cave' atop a strong current of sweet-smelling fem-spunk that deposited you back atop the bed sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, gasping, and smiling... Patty reached down to lick you off. \"That was... that was amazing Alan.\" she said enthusiastically as she cleaned you with her tongue. This rewarded her with a dollop of your ejaculate in response to such stimulation. Chuckling as she swallowed, the Hippo showed you with kisses for a job well-done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" she whispered, since you were basically right next to her mouth and she didn't wish to blow out your ear drums. You returned the thanks and your new girlfriend deposited you atop her vast cleavage as she laid back to bask in the after-sex 'glow'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you were about to drift off to sleep when...</span></div></div>",

And by the time she was done, the lady was known for having left more than beer cans and broken hearts behind.... to put it lightly. The incident created quite the controversy when it happened.

Needless to say, this didn't make you feel good in the slightest. The last thing you want is to get caught in a fight between two anthro hippos.

Another look around reveals her nipple, which to you is still quite a ways away. You start to walk towards it and decide to just get there fast.

Looks like you finally made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've come this far so now you have to seal the deal. With determination you grab onto the nub as best as you can and start massing it. Patty's breathing picks up a little, but she sounds like she wants more. You then start squeezing harder and trying to make a real impression. You then get another idea and begin climbing it. Grabbing handfuls of her flesh you ascend the nipple as if climbing a wall. The funny thing is you don't seem to be making any progress. Then you realize that her nipples are getting harder with her arousal, making them grow. After some time you reach the top and look out at the expanse of hippo. Off in the distance you see her other breast, with its rock hard nipple. You then feel a lurch as Patty begins squirming. Falling to your face you grab on to keep from slipping off. This hits her harder and she fidgets even more. Taking care to avoid her nipple hole you bite down and try to stimulate her even more. After what feels like hours she finally climaxes and settles down. You're pretty much spent as well. Her huge fingers come down and gently move you back to the base of the nipple. \"That was amazing.\" she says while panting. You give her a smile and lay back on the soft flesh. \"Well after that I need some rest.\" she tells you. \"Good night Alan.\" The two of you then fall asleep for the night.</span></div></div>",

You look at a giant elephant anthro woman, African considering her tusks and she was bright pinkish brown with long silvery hair that was in a combination of a mohawk and ponytail and bright blue eyes.

Kevin then walks up to one of Ivory's open nostrils. You hesitate but Kevin then grabs you by the hand. \"Hey, we're getting a lift to a better view. Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Kevin into his girlfriend's trunk, it's dark and slightly wet but you have no time to complain because Ivy is lifting you boys up.

You hold your breath as Irma takes you under water and then Irma inhales you into her trunk and takes you above the water. You look out the nostrils in awe. You felt like you were staring out a skyscraper in the middle of the ocean. You then turn to see Kevin is performing the same stunt with Ivy's trunk, except you can see Ivy's tusks, something that an Asian elephant like Irma lacks. Irma and Ivy then dive down and you and Kevin are closer to the water and can actually touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" You say. \"Having an elephant for a girlfriend can have advantages dude.\" Says Kevin. \"Whoa. You're saying Irma is my.. my..\" You were thinking about that. Maybe Irma could be your girlfriend. She was a beautiful girl if a little, okay, a lot heavy set. Irma and Ivy then raise out of the water and then they put you and Kevin down on their respective shoulders. Ivy then sucks up some water with her trunk. \"Oh you better not.\" Says Irma. Ivy then spews water from her trunk and nearly knocks you off Irma's shoulder. Irma however uses her hand to catch you before you hit the water. \"Okay Ivy you asked for it.\" \"Bring it on tuskless.\" Says Ivy. Irma inhales water and sprays Ivy in the face with the stream and as Ivy lets out a grunt, Irma blows Kevin off Ivy's shoulder. \"Kevin!\" yells Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin falls into the water and Ivy picks him and puts him on her shoulder as Irma laughs. \"That was a good one Irma.\" Irma then snatches you with her trunk and brings you to her mouth for a kiss. You sputter as you were just kissed by lips much bigger than your house. Then you see a crystal glow in Irma's eyes as she smiles and flips her hair. You were in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Irma,\" says Ivy. \"I got a score to settle with you shooting my boyfriend off my shoulder.\" Kevin lets out a laugh. \"Come on girls. Don't do something crazy on my account. You're best friends.\" \"Yeah,\" says Irma. \"Unfortunately. So Ivy. What's the game..\" Ivy lets out a laugh. \"How about we have a little race. First one to reach, let's see who can reach, what's it called Kev...\" \"England?\" \"Yeah. Lets see if you can beat me to England.\" \"Huh.\" Says Irma. \"You're on ivory face. Let's rumble.\" With that both elephant girls swim off at rapid speed. \"Hang on tight Alan.\" Says Irma. \"It's a bumpy ride.\" You hang on and both Irma and Ivy take off at high speed as Kev lets out a laugh. You hang onto Irma as Kevin hangs on to Ivy. You both give each other a determined look as your elephant girlfriends have their friendly race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one of the elephant women reaches England first? Irma the Asian elephant or Ivy the African elephant?</span></div></div>",

You and Kevin hang on tight as your pachyderm girlfriends go underwater and startle a fishing boat. You then look forward and see a Union Jack in the distance. You couldn't believe it. Even if they were both three mile high elephant girls, Ivy and Irma actually swam all the way to England.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a tight race, but Irma manages to swim ahead of Ivy and splash both the African elephant and her boyfriend as she passes and her trunk hits the shores. You're almost tossed off her head but then tumble towards Irma's ear and grab hold of her earring before Irma places her trunk below you to stand on. As Irma gets up out of the water, Ivy is finally able to get up and follow her. Irma lets out a laugh. \"What's the score now Ivy?\" \"Heh,\" says Ivy. \"Don't get cocky. You won one hundred fifty races and I've won one hundred fifty. Still was pretty fun.\" Kevin lets out a whistle. \"I can't believe it,\" he says. \"I didn't think you girls would actually swim to England.\" \"Hey Kev,\" says Ivy. \"Don't forget, I'm much, much bigger than any human on the planet. Come on Kevin.\" \"Oh right. See you later Alan. Ivy has some friends in England she'd like to visit.\" \"Nice meeting you Al.\" Says Ivy. With that Ivy walks off carrying Kevin on her head in her Mohawk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrma then lets out a yawn. \"Wow,\" she says as she holds you up in her trunk. \"We went a little far haven't we Alan? I don't know if I feel comfortable this far from Coalton Shores.\" You let out a laugh. \"This is a first for me too beautiful. That, and having a girlfriend I could live on. And such a beautiful gray skinned Asian goddess at that.\" Irma giggles and leans against the London Bridge. \"Oh go on. We've only just met. Well, I think you should decide what we should do. You think us two crazy kids can handle being out of Coalton so far. It's your call Alan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it. You didn't exactly plan on going to England. Maybe you should head back. You're not exactly prepared for vacation. But then again, how often do you go to England. But then again. You didn't come her entirely by choice.

Some of the water even goes down Irma's trunk and hits you. \"Irma,\" you say. \"Can you try not to cannonball every time you go into the water?\" \"Any particular reason why not?\" asks Irma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get nervous and then fiddle around with your fingers. \"Well, to be perfectly honest... well... you're not...\" You really didn't want to tell Irma that she was too big and heavy because you were afraid of how she'd react but then she lets out a laugh. \"Oh I get it. Sweetie, I'm an elephant. Calling me heavy is a compliment.\" You let out a sigh. \"Oh really,\" you say. \"Well in that case, you're the heaviest anthro I've ever met. I'll bet you're even heavier than an anthro whale.\" Irma lets out a laugh as she continues swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh. \"You know, I've never dated an anthro anymore and Kevin is the first person I know to have.\" \"Well, it's mostly humans with anthro girls,\" said Irma as she performs a backstroke and places you in her canyon sized navel. Dating is okay, but we're still waiting for them to legalize interspecies marriage. But don't worry that won't be far.\" You blush and take a seat on Irma's belly button. You still couldn't believe you had an anthro girlfriend so soon. Then again, she was very nice and it looked like this would work. Of course, Lalonde and Betty might not like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, oh,\" says Irma. \"Brace yourself.\" Irma goes underwater and you hold onto her navel as Irma swims underneath a cruise ship. She must not have wanted to get in the way considering that the ship was smaller than one of her toes alone. As Irma comes out of the water you are shot into the air as well and have to grab onto Irma's tail before she swims on her stomach again. \"You okay back there sug?\" asks Irma. \"Uh yeah.\" You see that you're between Irma's titanic cheeks as you hold onto her tail and immediately climb up and take a nice spot to lay down on Irma's left butt cheek. Of course then you get an idea in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Irma...\" \"Yes Alan?\" \"I was wondering something.\" \"Shoot.\"</span></div></div>",

You shake your head and then Ivy blows you out of her trunk as Kevin catches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a look of disgust as Kevin laughs. \"That is so gross! How can you stand being in there?!\" \"Easy, that's how I met her. Mistook it for a cave when I was camping on Zoonova. Now look at this.\" You look out and you're in pure awe. You can see all of Coalton Shores from up on Ivy's head. She really was big, not just in body shape, but in height. You thought she was three times bigger than a normal anthro upon seeing her, but at this height she had to be at least five or seven miles. \"Amazing. This is absolutely amazing. She's titanic even for an anthro.\" Kevin lets out a whistle. \"Hail to the big girls baby.\" Ivy hears Kevin and lets out a laugh, causing her massive body to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while Ivy is laughing, you loose your balance and walk forward. \"Yo Al! Be careful. You don't know where you're going through Ivy's mohawk. It's beautiful, but it's as thick as a jungle.\" Unfortunately you just keep moving through the hair as Ivy tilts her head back. Kevin lets out a grunt and grabs hold of his girlfriend's hair but you slip and tumble screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan!\" yells Kevin. Before you know it you're in the open air and you're hurdling down fast. You look to see you were quickly descending to the Earth. You should've know it would be dangerous to be at the top of such a huge anthro, especially one much bigger than a normal anthro. Fortunately you find something long and hairy to grab hold of so you don't hit the ground. What did you grab?</span></div></div>",

You never knew what else they saw in you, but they soon adopted you as their son none the less. The two macro women you thought were sexy goddesses were now the women you called 'Mom'. Your burgeoning hormones have made this all the more awkward as the years have gone on. They love you dearly, and are incredibly gentle despite their massive sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSound like fun?</span></div></div>",

You had been adopted by an anthro couple when you were a baby, a same-sex anthro couple at that. Two mile high anthros were your mothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, both of your mothers were HUGE even by anthro standards. Both of them were anthros of animals that would've been large at normal scales and they were also on the heavyset side, even for their respective species, especially in the butts, hips and bellies. First was the more maternal of your parents, Miranda. Miranda was an enormous two humped gray-furred camel woman with long blonde hair and two massive humps on her back that you tended to climb as if they were mountains. Miranda worked as a plus-sized fashion model and while vain and ditzy at times, she was the more motherly of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour second parent was a masculine lesbian mother who was more paternal and sometimes hard to approach but still caring. Her name was Dominique and she worked as a police detective. Dominique was an absolutely brown-skinned and brunette haired hippopotamus anthro. She was usually the more ferociously protective of you and could be intimidating at times, but she had a golden heart and was extremely loving to both you and Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've gotten used to extremely large anthros given that both Miranda and Dominique were utterly enormous, though even after all those years, you still wonder how you and your mothers made it work.</span></div></div>",

Then after she puckered up her lips and gingerly delivered a kiss to you head, you felt tired to the point where you stifled a yawn and fell asleep in her palms.

While initially underprepared to take care of baby you, they were resourceful in giving you a good ceiling over your head. They fed you, they clothed you, they kept you warm and close.

You two had been married for over a year now and she you were lucky to have her. Vixie introduced you to her and soon enough you were steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you were waiting for your wife to arrive on top of the table, you managed to get up thanks in part due to a walkway she put in for you (with Meena from next door's help of course). Latoya comes into the kitchen and lets out a loud yawn as she shows her large and sharp teeth. \"Morning Alan.\" Your wife says. Latoya bends over and licks you as you laugh slightly. That's how she gives you kisses. \"Good morning Dear,\" you say. \"For once I actually woke up before you did.\" Latoya lets out a yawn and walks up to the stove shaking her massive butt that was one of your favorite parts of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatoya seems to notice her tiny husband staring at her and wags her tail a few times. \"Oh you little tease. I know where someone's sleeping tonight.\" You remember when you married Latoya. It was just legalized for anthros and humans to mate. Kevin was your best man and Vixie was the maid of honor. Meena had to keep Lalonde from getting hysterical like she always does at weddings and Betty made the cake. Since you found out Lily worked at a photoshop back on Earth, you decided to hire her to take pictures of the wedding. Even Ryan who normally doesn't like you congratulated you at the wedding. Of course, the wedding was on Zoonova since Mayor Bloomberg would never allow such a thing in Coalton Shores. Latoya was wearing a white gown with pink alien flowers embedded into it and she picked you up from the ground to put on her shoulder as soon as her father walked her up to the alter. Aside from Reggie getting drunk and ripping off her own dress at the reception, everything was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the present day, Latoya walks forward with a plate of eggs and sits down on the table as she breaks off some of her meal for you. \"Thanks Baby,\" you say as you eat the small chunk your coyote wife gives to you. \"I'm really lucky to have married you.\" Latoya giggles. \"I'm lucky Vixie had such a cute human friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Latoya?\" you ask. \"Anything I should know about today?\" Latoya holds out a finger as she swallows the mouthful of eggs before she tells you what's going to happen.</span></div></div>",

Meena was always anxious about the size of her chest, compared to some of the other ladies in town. But while it was modest compared to say... Lalonde or Betty... to you it was a lovely plush mountain. Speaking of her breasts, she playfully smooshed you between them, showing some more love and affection to her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile such a pairing as this wasn't unheard of (ironically happening more between human males and anthro females than the opposite way around), it certainly had a strange journey getting to this point. Meena was one of your next door neighbors, and despite her massive almost mile-high size... was quite shy and sheepish around humans. Always had been since you first met her as children. You became friends, bonding over a love of pop culture and video games. And while you did find her attractive, you were (ironically) too nervous to take it beyond simple 'friends'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most you two ever toyed with the idea was when you took Meena to the size-inclusive high school prom. She looked STUNNING in her dress, and after an amazing night together you knew right then how much you loved her. But it had taken a while to get through her 'shell'. You two then dated for about three years, off and on, your desire to be with her for the rest of your life growing with each time spent. And each time spent increasing her confidence in herself. It wasn't until you graduated from college the following year that you asked her to marry you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she said yes. And-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's on your mind sweetie?\" she asked, licking you softly. Chuckling you playfully batted at her tongue. You tell her what was one your mind. Her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooing and churrling, she gives you the biggest wettest kiss she can give you. \"Oh?

Unable to hold back you hug tightly onto her left boob, gently biting it... and sending quivering tremors through your wife's sexy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh you naughty boy!\" she smirked, gently plucking you off her chest. \"Seems I might have to punish you!\" Meena added, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that your wife put you</span></div></div>",

Slight vertigo passes as you find yourself in front of the most beautiful face ever. \"No kiss for yer wife?\" smiled Betty as she puckered up her large cow lips. You were enveloped in soft plushy lips as she kissed you. You were now covered in lipstick. Which is funny, because she doesn't usually wear lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Whateva have I dun?\" she asked in mock deadpan voice, grinning as she placed you atop her breasts and headed back towards your house. \"Gonna have ta clean you up sweetie!\" You couldn't help but chuckle and laugh as you relaxed atop her copious cleavage, held in place by her plaid workshirt. Something told you she had this planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't unheard of for Humans and the gargantuan Anthros to marry. Though usually it was male humans to female anthros for some reason. So nobody batted an eye when you finally popped the question to Betty, the large cowgirl who owned the local supermarket. You two had had this unofficial relationship for the longest time, constant flirtation, unacknowledged 'dinner dates', and so on. Then one night you two took it further, making out and making love. It was then that you knew it. It had just taken so long for you to stop lying to yourself. You wanted to spend the rest of your life with Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the happiest day of your life when she accepted your proposal. Otherwise you would've wasted your life savings on not only a giant engagement ring but renting a crane to lift it up to her (even then she ended up having to stoop down to meet it halfway). Thankfully her family members pitched in for the actual wedding ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a year ago. Betty brings home most of the income, (owning a grocery store will do that) but she doesn't mind one bit. She loved you, and you loved her... and that's all that matters to the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile mentally reminiscing you and your wife entered the household. You could tell from how her breasts swayed that the heavenly cow wasn't wearing a bra. Smirking you couldn't wait to see what she hand in store. As soon as the door was closed, Betty began to unclasp her overalls, sending pleasurable vibrations through her chest. Giggling to herself, the beautiful bovine began to undo her shirt buttons, playfully (but carefully) teasing you as she purposefully ignored the button closest to you, instead going around as she began to undress. You grinned up at her as she soon finished... leaving only the sole button... the one you were no clinging to, to hold back the avalanche of breasts hidden beneath this thing shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful sweetie pie!\" Betty winked as she took a deep breath, seemingly inflating her chest as her massive lungs took in air. This threatened to pop the button, as her heaving breasts seemed to be trying to break free. Betty giggled as she flexed her arms, sucking in another lungful of air... and off went the button! Luckily you had jumped into her lovely 'udders' before becoming a projectile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hee hee!! Heh heh!!! Get outta there!\" she chuckled and laughed as you squirmed around inside her cleavage. Sighing she plucked you out of the softest and sexiest prison you ever knew. \"Silly boy.\" she giggled, before licking you as she resumed walking into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what day it is?\" she asked, gently sitting down as she discarded her shirt, now completely topless before you. Coyly, you grinned like a chesire cat. <br>\r\n\"I dunno... what day is it? Hmmm... not Valentine's Day. Not 4th of July. Not Mother's Day...\" your bride rolled her eyes to your antics.<br>\r\n\"Cut the act sweetie.\" she said as she nuzzled you lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay.\" you relent. \"Today is...\"</span></div></div>",

The sidewalks were split in two since the anthros showed up and specially marked. the small human half was marked with shoe prints while the anthro path was marked with paw prints. It was a good way of making sure anthros didn't accidentally crush their human neighbors beneath their enormous feet. As you walk down the street, you see several anthros.

She and a few friends of hers had formed a band called \"STAMPEDE\" and Reggie did tell you that you were invited to listen anytime you wanted, but you never actually visited before. You figured that you might as well get a front row seat. Fortunately Reggie didn't live too far away and you knew a shortcut to get to her garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get closer to Reggie's house, you hear music already playing loudly but from the sound of it, it was just a warm up. You decide to run close to the side of the wall and then you inch up inside the garage and see Reggie's band playing loudly. They were all female anthros and they were all African animals. The bassist who played alongside Reggie on guitar was a golden furred lioness, an odd thing considering real hyenas and lions were enemies. There was a zebra anthro girl on the keyboard and a giraffe girl on drums. Reggie herself was playing the guitar and held out her tongue as she gave her trademark grin. All this time you never knew that she had a tongue piercing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music was a little loud, given the size of the players and you decided the best thing to do would be to cover your ears to avoid going deaf, but you could still hear the sound waves. It was a good tune. You thing you could hear Reggie and her lioness friend singing but it was hard to hear anything over the loud music that was playing faster than any song Dragonforce could make. You actually nod your head a few times as you listen. Reggie's music was heavy metal in nature and you heard some words about the \"last door to the apocalypse\". That must've been the name of the song but it wasn't exactly clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the music stopped and you decide to clap. It was the wildest sound you had ever experienced. However, it would appear none of them have noticed their little fan had been watching and then Reggie lets out a sigh and the lioness shakes her head. \"What was that Reggie?\" asks the lioness. \"That was weak. I could barely hear myself sing, let alone hear you.\" Reggie lets out a grunt. \"Sorry Maggie, I'm doing the best I can...\" The giraffe girl merely shakes her head. \"Well, it's your own fault. We're playing so fast, you two barely have time to sing. Can you be anymore hyperactive hyena girl?\" The zebra girl nods her head. \"And we don't even have an audience.\" \"Calm down girls,\" says Reggie. \"I'm working on getting a gig. And I wouldn't raise my voice to a carnivore if I were you.\" \"What's the point of playing if nobody sees us?\" asks the giraffe girl. \"Uh-oh,\" said Maggie. \"Watch out Reggie. It looks like they're revolting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps you came at a bad time. You know all bands argue and it looked like even anthro bands did as well. Should you talk to them and critique their sound, or should you leave them to deal with their own issues?</span></div></div>",

Ryan didn't have anything against humans, but he hated you. You had a habit of returning movies late and he didn't appreciate it.

I look up and see that the wall is Meena's foot. As i look, i can see that Meena is wearing Ant-man t-shirt, we were watching that movie last week, and wearing and blue shorts. I even see her wearing the large glasses she always wear. I knew her for a long time and knows that she loves games and any other pop-culture , but she also very shy and nervous when it comes to everyone. As much as she doesn't like being so shy, I always think that's what makes her so cute and that she is beautiful the way she is right now. I realize I'm distracting myself and shouted to Meena to look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alan?\" Meena looks down and see a tiny speck next to her foot. \"H-hey, Meena.\" Every time I see Meena, I could not help but feel a little nervous, which is ironic since it's Meena of all people I'm nervous of. \"Y-you know to knock first, I almost step on you.\" She knees down to pick me up. \"Sorry, but I came to help you like I said I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right.

Seeing her looks so distraught was enough to make even the coldest of villains look down in shame, well to your mind at least. Seeing as how it wouldn't hurt to check out the suit, you give a shaky sigh and nod. \"Alright then. I guess it wouldn't hurt to check out the suit real quick.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeena's eyes brighten ever so slightly by your words as she quickly shakes her head feverishly. \"r-right.\" she replies as her huge palm soon descends right before you. \"Climb on, i'll take you to my room.\" While the whole idea of entering a girl's room might seem awkward, let alone somewhat pervy in the eyes of others. You've known Meena for long enough that you visited her so called 'lab' for years now. Upon clambering onto the side of her finger and making your way to the middle of her palm, you motion a thumbs up towards her face. \"All prepped.\" you call out, like an astronaut about to get blasted off to the stars. Stifling a small giggle, the giant bat girl slowly rises up as she begins to turn face back into her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking, Meena soon enters into her room as she places you ever so caringly upon her desktop. Like usual, the surrounding wooden top is covered in books and other sets of metallic devices that you could only guess were her other experiments at hand. \"Looks like you've been pretty busy.\" You admit as you make your way towards on large book spine that seemed to read 'chemical mixing 101'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I guess i'm just the type of anthro who loves research.\" Meena replies in a kind yet flustered tone as you see her rummaging about below in a wooden box. Curious, you make your way towards the edge of the table side to peek down at her. \u201cHere it is!\u201d she beams as her head rises up like lava erupting from a volcano, causing you to stumble back in shock. As you try and regain your footing from the sudden shock, your eyes ascend towards the upper half of her body, as her right index finger and thumb were pinching something in between. Noticing your curious expression, Meena lowers her hands before you as she gently pulls back her fingers to reveal her so called \u2018Suit\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026the suit?\u201d you ask perplexed as Meena nods her head. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She returns as your eyes begin to draw upon the odd design of the protective attire. Strangely enough, it looked almost like a mix between an astronaut\u2019s suit and a diving suit manufactured in the 20th century. In fact the helmet seemed to be nothing more than a metallic dome with a circular hole cut right in the middle. As you were busy her creation, Meena begins to catch on to your perplexed reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d She asks as she tilts her bat head at her own question. \u201cWell\u2026It does look like something that can withstand some pressure.\u201d You admit as you walk on up and gently give the odd helmet surface a knock. \u201cOf course.\u201d Meena nods. \u201cI managed to fashion the suit using a highly tolerable plastic.\u201d \u201cPlastic?\u201d you ask, questioning whether or not such material could withstand something like acid. \u201cYes, but not just normal Plastic.\u201d Meena reiterates. \u201cit contains a sturdiness and well defense that\u2019s enough to withstand many harmful materials.\u201d She states. \u201cIncluding digestive juices.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised by her sudden explanation you can\u2019t help but eye her and the odd suit multiple times. \u201cWell\u2026say I do go inside your body.\u201d You begin. \u201cHow can I communicate with you? Let alone breath in you?\u201d Meena\u2019s face brightens up even more by your questions, as if she\u2019s slowly raising her hopes on you considering the task. \u201cWell, I managed to install a small radio device in the suit.\u201d She begins with the first response. \u201cWith that, you should be able to talk to me with ease. And as for air, well I was thinking maybe giving you some oxygen through a pump outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026you\u2019re planning on just keeping a pump stuck to the suit the whole time?\u201d you asked completely confused. \u201cWell\u2026it would not only give you oxygen, but it would also help me pull you out in case there was any accidents.\u201d The sudden mention of accidents brings a small shiver coursing down your body as Meena continued to stare down at you. With all this work she did, it definitely would seem like a jerk move to turn her down now. However, the unpredictability of the whole event could lead to serious trouble. After seconds of inner arguing, you give a long exhale before gazing back up to her eyes. \u201cMeena-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean what happens if it becomes another failure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you don't have to worry A-Alan, I tested the invention already. Here j-just watch w-what I mean.\" As Meena gently puts you on a table, she reaches behind her to reveal a strange looking gun that looks like it came from a sci-fi film. She then places an apple on a counter, far enough for you to see the demonstration, and points the gun at it. When Meena gently pulls the trigger, the barrel began to glow green. Then a small bright green light shots out from the barrel and engulf the apple. The light surrounds the apple and the apple shrink right before your eyes. When the light fades away, Meena gently picks you and takes you where the apple was. You look around for bit before you finally spy the very apple that could easily crush all of New York at once without any effort is now the size of a regular apple, regular to you that is. Before you say anything else, Meena picks you up again and place you back on the table. You see her then points the gun at the apple again and shoots it again, but this time it grew back to its previous size. Meena turns toward you and waits for what you have to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it actually works.\" You saw the demonstration and still could not believe what you just saw. There was one thing that you had to ask. \"I just have one question, why you want me to tested on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want a human I-I know could t-trust completely, and the person I-I trust is you A-Alan.\" You see Meena blushing deep red as she tells this to you. You couldn't help but blush at the fact that Meena has place so much trust in you. \"So, please, will you help me on project?

But thanks to a combination of human and anthro technologies and science, there isn't an Anthro alive who's eyesight isn't keen enough to see a human, even with their 10,000 mile height difference. Unfortunately as good as Anthros are at spotting humans, it should go without saying that humans tend to go unnoticed, as anyone might expect. If an Anthro isn't close to you and you're not in a crowd, you might as well not exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why it's pretty unfortunate you that you're now so terribly, terribly small in comparison to the rest of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god.\" is all you can say, gazing out across the tabletop towards the massive ray gun that did this to you. Remember the apple? It shrank from the size of atleast a hundred miles tall down to what you would consider to be a regular apple. And that size ratio was never reset, so now you're... well, it's difficult to tell how small exactly. But you're pretty sure you're somewhere underneath an inch tall. A regular human would look gigantic to you, and the rest of her home was unfathomably huge now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be okay, though. Meena would come back and fix you if you just stood right where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ground began to shake, or more accurately violently quake as loud, booming steps could be heard throughout the house. Meena was coming! From your position on the edge of her table, you saw her the moment she turned around the corner, and your face paled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was...words couldn't describe her size. Your mind already had made room for 10,000 mile high beings, but this was just too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan?\" the bat girl asked quizzically, scanning up and down the table for your miniscule form. You screamed and yelled, waving your arms as you jumped up and down to get her attention. She slowly approached the table, her petite form suddenly taking up your entire field of vision as her stomach touched the edge of the table, the fibers of her ant-man t-shirt coming dangerously close to hitting you, and big enough for you to grab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alan, where'd you go? Are you hiding?\" she asked, your frantic waving and yelling falling on deaf ears. Suddenly, and without warning, she dropped down to her knees in order to search for you underneath the table. A hurricane of wind assaulted you in the process, and you found yourself flying hundreds of feet across the table, as if you were launched out of a cannon. You stumbled and tumbled through the air until you suddenly slam into something huge and metal. Disoriented, you tried to find purchase on the smooth surface, clinging to a large groove for dear life as you looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd Alan run off to...?\" Meena muttered to herself, her whispering voice magnified by your unusually small size. \"I-if he left in such a hurry, something important must have come up...he's never bailed on me before.\" she declares, standing up straight with a sigh. \"I hope he didn't touch the gun...if he shrank down, there's no way I'd find him!\" she says, although she says it like the idea isn't even a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looks straight at you, and reaches out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a moment to even decipher the movements of the monolith, but suddenly you realize that she's not reaching for you, she's reaching for the gun...which you just happen to be holding onto the barrel of. As her hand wraps around the base of the gun, you're forced to hold on tight as the continent-sized raygun is violently turned upside down as she examines it closely, looking for any signs of tampering. After recovering from the violent movements, you turn your head to the right to find the bat-girls awe inspiring iris looking at the gun...and straight at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meena!\" you yell, letting go of the gap in the metal in order to wave your arms. \"I'm right here! Meena!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeena's giant eyeball blinks, and narrows for a moment...</span></div></div>",

Humans were hardly built for dealing with Anthros as it is, and this was just too much. With a sharp movement of the gun, you were sent soaring god-knows where as you tumbled helplessly through the sky, unaware of what was going on around you...except for the sound of the gun firing. A rush of green light filled your vision before it suddenly began to turn a dark grey. And then you hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on your feet once more, you pushed yourself off the ground, noting how warm and soft it was. Not to mention the color being the same as...Meena's fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you found yourself dazed by your fall, you were smart enough to figure out that you must've been on Meena somewhere, if the gigantic, multi-mile high strands of fur surrounding you were any indication. Many miles above you, completely engulfing the horizon was Meenas tight shorts, which led you to believe that you were somewhere on her thigh? Meena had to be sitting down, otherwise there's no way you'd still be able to stand upright on her leg, but you really didn't want to have to deal with Meena standing up and sending you far into the carpet below. With a newfound resolve, you began to walk towards Meenas short-shorts, wondering how you were even going to begin to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar above, like a distant planet, Meena's titanic face stared at the Mannequin with a look of glee. The mannequin was of some anime character, some magical dog girl in a cute outfit (and Meena maintained that the show got good after the first season, though Alan never had time to watch). But that didn't matter, she realized, she was fretting over details. It worked! Her once full-sized recreation of a beautiful anime girl was now practically a speck of dust on the floor...no, smaller! And it <i>excited </i>her, filling her body up with energy like a thousand cans of gamer fuel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had lowered herself into a criss-cross position after she fired the gun in order to get a better view of it on the way down, but halfway through sitting down it was already gone! She shifted her legs in order to stand back up, but suddenly realized that any sudden movements would surely send the mannequin flying, and then she'd never find it. Reorienting herself, unaware of the tiny passenger who's life she saved in the process, she began to drag herself across the floor in order to get closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit of effort, she was right in front of where the mannequin had once stood, and gazed down into her carpet fibers in the hopes of finding it, with no luck. This excited Meena even more, and she could feel her breathing get a little heavier. The gorgeous figure of a beautiful woman, downsized to nothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she came back to reality upon realizing that it was a collectors item, and cost her hundreds of dollars! She couldn't just lose it, it was an investment! It would make her rich in 20 years, she'd told Alan, who'd rolled his eyes (although she didn't notice). She had to get it back somehow. But she couldn't just blast the carpet...she'd just end up making the carpet huge, or the house! Or the <i>world</i>, though the current theory was that it wouldn't work due to the sheer amount of power it would require. But she technically didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she'd need to wait on Alan to come back later. She'd just have to avoid that spot until then. She had other tests to do, after all, there was no reason she had to find it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I can find it myself, though, can't I?</i>\" she thought, twirling the gun in her fingers. <i>No, no! It's never been tested on living subjects!</i> But...she <i>was </i>about to test it on Alan, and at the time she'd honestly believed he'd come out fine. If she couldn't use it on herself, then that meant she never really believed that in the first place, and Alan might aswell have been a guinea pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was able to take comfort in the fact that the gun did, however, have a system in place for self-modification. She'd designed it so that if used on the user, the gun would shrink or grow with you, so it should be impossible to find herself stuck at a tiny size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...in theory. It was untested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she couldn't shrink herself for a dumb, sexy mannequin, that alright she may have liked to look at on lonely nights, but...she'd be really small, <i>puny</i>! She'd see the world through Alan's eyes...no, smaller. Down in the fibers of her carpet, lost, with a gun that might not shrink with her, but damnit, the thought of getting down with the mannequin was...intriguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if she knew it worked for sure, then maybe she and her cute neighbor Alan could finally be the same size, and they could finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, <i>no!</i> Bad thoughts! Meena shook her head, as if that would clear her mind, and took a deep breath. This whole shrinking thing was enticing, but she had to act rational. What was the <i>right </i>thing to do here?</span></div></div>",

You were scare to get near the gigantic love lips, not because you were intimidated by its sheer size, but because you were afraid of what Meena will think if by some miracle, or bad luck, she discover you touching it. You like Meena, oh who are you kidding, you have a crush with the bat-girl since you both were kids. You always help Meena since then because not only she is a dear friend to you but you also wanted to build up the courage to tell her your thoughts. You wanted to get to know Meena in a more deeper relationship than just being friends, but this is not what you had in mind. You feel like that if you climb this massive lips, you might just ruin the friendship you and Meena has. You wanted to respect Meena's privacy, but you also know that if you don't get her attention in some way, then you're doom to be this small for the rest of your life. The world is shaking, which means Meena is moving and you're running out of time. No other way, you began your climb on the fleshy wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeena finds one last piece of junk she wanted to get rid of and shrink it to a dust mite. She looks around and is amaze of the gun's shrinking potential, as well as how much space she truly has in her room without the junks laying around. She looks one more time, before remembering about Alan.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I wish Alan would stay around, i still want to see if i can at least grow him.\" Meena feels sad that Alan left without telling her anything, which is the weird thing for her. For as long she remembers, Alan would always stay around for her to show up and tell her that something important happen and he needs to go. This is the first time Alan just disappear without saying anything. \"Maybe he is getting tired of helping me and getting in trouble.\" Meena feels sad with the thought, at the same time won't blame Alan if that's the case. Meena is not going to lie, some of her projects had at one point injure Alan or almost kill him. He never blames Meena for those events, but she always feel responsible whenever it happens. \"Hmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like forever, you finally made to the top of the lips. You really don't want to climb on it again, especially when you look down and not see the base for miles. You turn around and felt pale as you see just how vast Meena's womanhood is. For starter, just the lips' edge can easily hold mountains within their width, the clitoris looks like a small continent, and then there's the opening. The opening looks like wide, never ending void that could swallow planets, and the tunnel inside looks like the abyss that goes on forever. Needless to say you don't want to go in there at this size. Looking around, you see that the only thing sensitive enough is the clitoris. You start you journey there and hope that Meena's movement doesn't knock you into the abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeena wanted to get the thought that Alan is tire of being endanger out of her thoughts, but every time she has bad thoughts about something, it stays in her mind for a while. As she walks to the living room, she saw something that finally got her mind off about earlier. She saw something strange, she sees what looks like a human-size zap marks. The marks looks similar to the ones that comes from the junk Meena shrunk earlier. Something shrunk on the table while she was away. \"That's strange, I don't remember shrinking...\" Then it hit her as she made some connections in her head. Tears began to form from her eyes as she realize what just happen. \"Oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan finally reaches the clitoris, which took longer than he thought. He looks at this behemoth organ one last time before making up his mind to climb it. As he reaches the top, he tries whatever he can to either get Meena's attention or at least give her a reason to look inside. After a few minutes of nothing, you were about to give up when suddenly everything shook like the world was about to shake apart.<br>\r\n\"D-did I got her attention?\" You don't believe that you attempts was able to get this unfathomable size girl's attention. However before you could do anything, the sky above, that is Meena's panties, came crashing down on top of you and slams you against the organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeena's mind was rushing nonstop while looking for Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be ok, please don't tell me that you actually shrunk.\" Meena was scared, she searches everywhere on the table with a magnifying glass looking for a micro Alan. At the same time many bad thoughts was going through her mind.<i> Did I shrunk him to nothingness? What if I already step on him? He could be scare, lost in the carpet fibers. He might have been trying to get my attention all day and I fail to look.</i> Meena crouches to the ground and see if she can find Alan, but her panicking and the tears running down her face is not helping her. \"P-please be alive, Alan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Meena panicking above and this is not good for you. She won't be paying attention to any attempts you would try to make, so being here is too dangerous as Meena crouching is making her panties pressing against her which means that you're getting squish against the organ. You want to calm Meena, but you have no choice but to hear her have an absolute nervous breakdown. You have no choice but to squirm your way somehow into Meena's womanhood until she finally stops. That part is easier said than down as the panicking bat-girl is constantly moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeena wants to cry herself to sleep from the realization that she shrunk her best friend to who knows what size.

Before you can do anything, she turns the bottle upside down, sending you plummeting toward her outstretched hand.

That is, until Winnie spins around. The motion pulls the bubbles right over the lips and stops. At this point, you\u2019re pounding on the walls to try to break it, but again, it\u2019s hopeless. You look on in horror as Felicity\u2019s body comes careening toward you and slams against your prison, popping the bubble and sending you flying deep into the equine planet. </span></div></div>",

Her name was Hunter, an unusual name for a girl, but she was a 10,000 mile tall German shepherd girl with a hard body. She could put the most fit human body builder to shame. You heard she used to be in the army and from the looks of it, it wasn't hard to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what will it be, Paris, the skyscraper sized skunk, or Hunter, the canine colossus?

You get up to see Hunter standing tall on top of one of the turnbuckles as Tinka gets up and rubs her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's next?\" asks the German Shepherd girl as she flexes her large muscles. You can't help but drool as you see that muscular bod. Then you hear stomping and then turn your head to see two anthro giantesses stepping over you without even noticing you. They were both dogs as well. One was a titanic akita inu girl with red kanjis on her cheeks while the other was a muscular pit bull girl with long blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to move closer underneath one of Hunter's lawn chairs to get a good look at the wrestling match about to occur. The akita inu girl lets out a scoff. \"Come on Hunter,\" she says as Tinka walks to get an ice pack out of a cooler. \"Give it a rest. That's your eighth match today?\" Eight matches? This was no ordinary anthro. Hunter then proceeds to grab a beer can, drink the entire contents and then crush the can into a ball between her abs before tossing it to the pit bull girl who gives a vicious look. \"There's no stopping you today is there coach.\" Hunter lets out a laugh. \"But you can sure try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was exciting. Anthro wrestling made human wrestling obsolete to watch and you were about to witness a planetary cat... er dogfight and the wrestlers didn't even know you were there. Perhaps you could introduce yourself to Hunter after the match. But which of the girls will fight the german shepherd titaness.</span></div></div>",

There were about three other employees that worked alongside you, all meateaters, all making you nervous. One was a crocodile girl known as Sheela, and she terrified the wits out of you. She knew of your fear, and always took the opportunity to snap her massive jaws at you. One day, you truly think she's going to eat you. Another isn't so bad, Mike the lion, he was your manager. Very uptight and snippety about the tiniest of details, which he always got you on. The last one you hardly knew anything about, Milo the shark.

You couldn\u2019t help but stare a little at her rump those short shorts do look good on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head trying to get rid of any perverted thoughts. \u201cOk where would you like me to start\u201d Alan said walking, over to her paws \u201coh start at the pad then work down to my toes please.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood to see she\u2019s in a better mood now. Alan did as he was asked starting at her pad then working his way down, wow her paws sure are tense Alan said in his mind as he rubbed at the skin of her pad and worked his way down making sure to get between her toes and get rid of any toes jam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParis seemed to be loving it you could see her toes curling a little you where a little worried at first but slyly just ignored it and continued with you job.

You'd refill the soap containers or sweep up a bit, but all in all, it was just for fairness. Humans were utterly obsolete in an anthro-sized environment, and vice versa, so you were a tad daunted by the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\"Maggie purred with a chuckle, each purr coming from her voice high above creating roaring thunderbolts that forced you to cover your ears, lest you be deafened by the sound.\"But uh...\"You continued, her massive eye looking down at you still.\"Could you lend me a hand getting up there?\"You pointed a finger at her gargantuan bare feetpaws, rising like monolithic monuments in the distance, larger than anything you had seen before.

You were a bit frightened as the unbelievably big digits wrapped around, but immediately comforted once you figured how slow and gentle the lioness was proceeding. She raised you up ever so slightly above her feet, the warmth from her golden fur calming you. It was pretty nice, until she let go. You plummeted with a very unmanly scream, and looking down, you see your destination.</span></div></div>",

Your mind had to be on her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do what the lioness suggests and start rubbing the pad of her biggest toe, or what you thought was.

Maybe this job wasn't going to be so hard. Then again, your first job in the pedicure section was with Reggie's friend. You move onto the front of the toe as you rub and  then you pause slightly as you see Maggie's claw. It had to be more than ten times as big as your house. You ignore the claw and continue to rub.

You step on the next pad as if it were a platform and then you start to rub that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're rubbing Maggie's toes, you notice a spot of toe jam and then you decide to rub the toe while it's in sight, rub off the jam and pat the skin as Maggie lets out a mew. This lioness was a total house cat when it came to a good massage, but then again, she was still the queen of beasts as far as species were concerned. The next toe you visit has a slight hangnail that you're able to fix by taking out a file to cut off the hangnail before you smooth out the edge. Though you prick your finger while doing it and you put your finger in your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to move onto Maggie's next toe but you nearly fall off because there isn't a next toe and you grab the nail by the edge. You forgot that while all anthros had five fingers on each hand like humans do, most of them who had toes had only four toes. This depended on species though, because they had the same number of toes as real animals do on their back legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done on this end Maggie.\" Maggie lets out a purr. \"Good,\" she says. \"Now you can move onto massaging...\"</span></div></div>",

She seemed to be in a hurry to get home and even put her hood on over her head, but you keep following her and she doesn't even see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily takes her time getting home. She must live on a far part of town. Along the way, you see her acting strange a few times. She ran right past a woman with a baby carriage and looked the other way when a pair of humans were carrying a mirror right past her. If another anthro like Betty or Lalonde came in, they would've helped without being asked but the way Lily was acting, it was like she wanted to be ignored. Maybe anthros with human phobia really did exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you keep tailing Lily, you see her walk into the video store and grab the heel of one of her boots to get a closer look. Then you remember why you didn't like going to the video store. One of the clerks, Ryan, a giant husky anthro had a grudge against you for always having the videos in late. He was such a Nazi when it came to that and you remember the last time he warned you that one more late video and he'd revoke your membership. That guy has serious OCD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to watch Lily, she has picked up a few movies she wanted to rent and walks up to Ryan. \"Hi Lily,\" says Ryan in a surprisingly friendly tone. You'd think that Ryan wouldn't get along with Lily since he was a dog and she was a cat. \"Haven't seen you in the store for a while. Lily didn't answer and instead handed Ryan the movies she planned to buy. \"Night of the Killer Canary, The Venomous Duck, The Mouse Returns. Yep sounds like Lily's normal horror movie night. I'll bet nothing scares you except for....\" Suddenly Ryan stops and sniffs the air. \"That's odd,\" he says as he turns his head. \"I just picked up a familiar scent, the type I don't like.\" Ryan grits his teeth and begins to growl as Lily looks in confusion. Uh-oh, has that husky noticed you yet?</span></div></div>",

As she does so, she lets out a scream, jumps on the table and hisses loudly as you scream yourself. \"Alan!\" yells Ryan. \"When are you going to return Road Rovers video from three weeks ago?\" \"Come on Ryan, cut me some slack. It didn't last as long as it should've.\" \"Don't give me that crap weird boy! You come tomorrow with video and membership card!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily just hisses again and even sticks her tail in the air. \"Get him away from me Ryan! Get that human away from me!\" Ryan lets out a growl and walks from behind the counter to walk up to you. \"Now look what you've done! Why do you think Lily never talks to anyone. She is humanophobic.\" You were shocked. So it was true, Lily was afraid of humans. But that didn't make sense seeing as she was 10,000 miles high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what, why? Ah!\" Before you can say anything, Ryan picks you up, walks out of the store and tosses you into an anthro sized trash can before walking back into the store. You let out a grunt as you climb out of the trash and back down to the ground, shaking bubble gum off of yourself. \"Geez, what a jerk. Huh?\" You turn your head to see Lily running out of the door with her movies. Now you know why she never speaks to anyone. But why would a giant anthro be afraid of humans? If it was the other way around, it would make a lot more sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided to head to town and visit the local supermarket, Jiffy Mart. You pulled your wallet out of your back pocket and thumbed through it, making sure you had at least enough cash to buy some groceries. Eh, a hundred bucks after paying down the rent to your small home, and you had to keep it all together until next payday, so you decided to keep splurging to a minimum. You got in your little beat-up car, revved the engine, and you were out of the driveway, waving up at your titanic neighbors as you drove down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Al!\"You heard Reggie's thunderous, upbeat voice call down to you with your least favorite shortening of your name. You looked up, and couldn't even see past her ankles today. There were too many clouds in the sky today.\"Uhh...hey Reg!\"You shouted up in reply. She followed back with her signature howling laughter. You took it that she was in at least a good mood today, but you didn't know, she was always laughing, a hyena thing. You drove by Lalonde's home next, but it appeared she wasn't anywhere in sight. You wondered where she could be? The sheep girl was such a socialite, she was always out around the neighborhood, chatting it up to whomever would stand her bleating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you left the neighborhood behind, you simply went into a casual driving stance, one had on the wheel, the hanging out the window. You began to survey the area around you. For the most part, it was empty flatlands. When the anthros arrived years ago, a good majority of the planet had been terraformed to massive fields of grass to keep the godlike creatures from crushing anything underneath. It was for the better, a single anthro alone could level entire mountain ranges with their toes alone. With their highly advanced technology, though a culture quite similar to humankind, each race quickly adapted to one another. Space-defying buildings were set up that were bigger on the inside than the outside, or vice versa. Roadways for humans were made, and walking paths for furries were set up as well. Overall, it was quite peaceful. Though, there were troublemakers on both sides. On the humans, you had the anti-anthros running about, claiming that they were just monsters that were waiting for the perfect time to kill and enslave us all. On the anthro side, you had the terrorists who believed humans were nothing but vermin to be crushed and or enslaved. You shuddered a bit as you drove, remembering a news story about one particular anthro terrorist that demanded ransom for some captured humans, was denied it, and she decided squish all of New York City under her foot. That was in the earlier years, back when relations were rough. The criminal had been caught, the city already rebuilt bigger and better, but the shock of all those lives just simply vanishing never went away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head from memories and returned to your driving, the small town of Coalton Shores just up ahead. It was always boring, even with the giant animal beings around. There was nothing to do but either work in the coal mines, move away, or stay and stagnate your life. You've been hoping to move away, but you've never had the chance to stash enough money. Something always came up, and you've been stuck in your little run-down home. At least your neighbors were interesting enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled up your car into the parking lot, choosing a nice spot right at the front beside an anthro's titanic jeep, their tire tread large enough to move landmasses if it wanted to. You got out, clicked to lock the car, and started walking. There was a nice little door there for you, and you entered the Jiffy Mart. Humans and anthros alike browsed the aisles, the humans up in the racks of products to keep from getting stepped on, and the furries around shelves holding their own equally large produce. A small turtle anthro child, barely a thousand miles tall, pointed at you just as you grabbed some chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look mommy, another one of those little toys! I want one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now son, those aren't toys. They're living beings.\"The gargantuan mother replied to her shelled son. He simply pouted as he walked away, eying you a little. You shrugged. He was just a kid who didn't know any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had gathered a handful of meager groceries, you went up to the checkout counter to see a familiar face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello-o-o Betty!\"You called up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive wall of furred black and white turned around to greet you.\"Alan! It's been a while!\"A southern female voice replied, though much more deeper and thunderous.\"Ah thought you had gone up and went to that fancier supermarket on the other side of town!\"Betty brought her face down to look at you, very female in appearance, yet retaining features of a human and that of a cow. She was a bit chubby, but it added to her cute factor. She even had a nose ring like a bull's going through both nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, that place is way overpriced.\"You replied.\"Plus, my favorite cow always gives me a discount, right?\"You flashed her a big grin, to which she only rolled her eyes and slightly smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty reared up to her full height as she took your groceries and prepared to check them, giving you a nice view of her massive breasts, or for the correct term, udders. They were snugly clad in a red plaid shirt sporting a nice bit of cleavage for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, there ya go, Al.\"She handed you your bags with amazing dexterity of her fingers, taking your money just as easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No prob.\"You wave up at her as you leave, but suddenly...</span></div></div>",

You turned around to look at her, and she nervously drew her finger back, a grin of uncertainty and forced nonchalant on her face.\"What's up, Betty?\"You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah was uh..wonderin' if'n ya'll had any plans tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged.\"Not really.

You had considered her nice and cute, but had never had 'datable' come across your mind. A human-anthro relationship wasn't uncommon,and it certainly wasn't looked down upon, but the odd thought never came to you until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh...\"You open your mouth to speak, Betty's eyes pleadingly looking down at you. You wondered what she saw? Obviously, it wasn't in the looks department, seeing as you were too small for her to properly make out, a mere mite of dust that could be swept away with the slightest of movements from her. But maybe it was the friendship with her that started it, our your words? You had no idea.</span></div></div>",

Most of the parking lot was empty, save for a few stragglers getting their last-minute groceries, both human and anthro alike. You were alerted by seismic stomps that nearly rocked you off your feet as two massive hooves landed right in front of you with a heavy thud, each one an insurmountable wall. You looked up, your eyes trailing along Betty's well-toned legs clad in tight jeans that went higher than the sky could compete with. You couldn't even see past her thighs, she was so gargantuan, but she could somehow see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan!\"She boomed happily from above in her cute accent.\"Glad ta see you!

From your vantage point of her raised now, you could make out the curvature of the planet, even spot out a few landmasses in the distance that could be islands or other countries.

Its mind boggling how huge they are. Being a cow, she naturally has big ones. They look about as big as Lalonde's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want a closer view sugar?\" Betty asks with a giggle. She then lowers you to her chest and sits you down. Behind you is her massive face, smiling lovingly, and in front is the impressive valley of her cleavage. \"Well? Get goin'!\" she says and nudges you with a finger. You look back at her face with a smile of your own. \"If you insist.\" you say and enter the valley. As you step inside you can feel Betty's breathing. Her chest rises slightly with a low rumble. To your sides are her breasts, the impressive mountains that they are. You run your hand over one and Betty giggles. \"Mmmm... that's right honey.\" she says sensually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to take in the view of her boobs, spending quite a bit of time in there. Walking forward, you make your way further down her body. Being inside her shirt should make you feel trapped, but instead you're just excited. You've already passed her boobs and are making your way down her pudgy stomach. It looks like you're nearing the edge of her shirt when suddenly the fabric comes crashing down with something on top of it. \"Where do ya think you're goin' little guy?\" Betty asks. You realize that its her hand that's in the way. \"Uh...just trying to explore.\" you suggest. The gigantic cow laughs as she lifts up her shirt to grab you. \"Tell ya what, lets get back to my place.\" she says, and gets up off the ground. What does she have planned?</span></div></div>",

You're riding on her colossal finger with a bird's eye view of the neighborhood. Although you find your eyes drawn to the giant breasts bouncing behind you. \"Heh, I always knew you had a thing fer my girls.\" she says with a smirk. You snap to attention but she giggles and pats your head with her other finger. \"Ya think I didn't notice? Every time you come in the store your eyes are glued to em'. Ya might be a speck, but I have pretty good eyes.\" she says. \"Well you're a quite a looker.\" you say, trying to play it cool. She can probably sense your tenseness as she just laughs at your comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you arrive at her house and look up at it. Its made of wood, looking kind of barn like. Guess it makes sense since she's a cow. She enters the front door and carries you through the living room to the sofa. With a plop she sits down and places you on top of her enormous boob. You wobble a bit on the squishy surface but manage to stand. \"So are we gonna have dinner?\" you ask. Betty just shushes you with an finger to the lips. Its like having a mountain pressed against your face. \"I've got something special in mind.\" she says. The ground beneath you starts shaking and you fall on your face into her soft breast. When you get up you see that she's taken her other boob out of her bra. \"Would you like some milk?\" she asks. Your face goes beet red. \"You mean...?\" you stammer nervously. \"Yup.\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself being lifted between two building sized fingers as Betty frees her other boob from the confines of her shirt and bra. The articles of clothing are discarded to the floor below with a thud. Whats left are two beautiful orbs that seem as big as countries. Betty takes one in hand and moves you close to the great nub that is her nipple. when you stare up it from her finger you can't help but reach out and touch it. Betty shudders for a second. \"Go on, don't be shy.\" she says. You reach out with both hands and begin massaging it, causing the cow to moan and squeeze the mammary. Soon the nipple begins to leak a little and a drop of milk comes out. To you however its the size of a huge lake. Its lands on you with a splash and you get a taste as it flows into your mouth. Its sweet and better than any drink you've ever had. In a daze you lunge forward and grab her flesh, licking it to make more of the drink come out. It works, and you see another drop coming. You are once again almost washed away in a torrent of milk, lapping up as much as you can. You feel like you're in heaven until the scenery changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty lifts you away from her breast just as a stream of milk begins trickling out. While it may seem like just a little dribble of milk to her, she knows its like a tidal wave to you. \"Easy there! Don't want you drown.\" she says quickly. \"Sorry, I couldn't help myself.\" you tell her. \"Well Ahm glad ya liked it, now there's somethin you should know.\" she says. \"We cows sell our milk, but it gets processed. Only someone special to us gets to drink it straight from the source.\" She seems to be getting nervous, so she just lays it all out. Ah've decided that Ah really like ya. Will ya be mine forever?\" she asks. You stare up at the bovine beauty in disbelief before answering. \"Yeah! Of course!\" you blurt out, to which she gives you a sudden kiss. The two of you hold the kiss until there's a knock on the door. Who could it be?</span></div></div>",

Her figure is chubby like Betty's, but more voluptuous and she's wearing a tight red sweater with some very tight jeans. Her boobs are even bigger, jiggling with every step she takes. Betty rushes in soon after. \"Mom, wait!\" she says. Mom!? \"I'm kind of in the middle of somethin.\" she says and glances at you. the brown cow raises an eyebrow. \"An what is so important? It seems ta me like you're here all alone.\" she says with a southern accent like Betty's. She sees Betty glance at you and then checks the table. She spots you instantly and in a flash she's upon you. \"Well what do we have here?\" she asks, prodding you with a finger. She's surprisingly gentle, but hey, so is her daughter. She's even bigger than Betty, so having her face this close is a little daunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this little cutie?\" she asks. \"He's uh, my date. His name is Alan.\" Betty tells her.

She stands up straight and looks down on you with her hands on her hips. You cane your neck and gaze up past her thunder thighs to her planetary breasts. Its almost impossible to see her face. With one swift movement Ana snatches you up between two of her fingers and brings you to her face. \"So tell me, who made the first move?\" she asks. \"Well actually, Betty asked me out.\" you say, to which she slaps her knee and laughs. \"Thatta girl!\" she tells Betty, who has a distinct red tinge to her white fur. \"Yeah, and we were about ta have dinner.\" she says. \"Great, I'll join ya!\" Ana announces. Betty sighs and face palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later the three of you are sitting at the kitchen table. Betty is setting the plates down while Ana and you wait. \"Wait till ya try my little girl's cookin!\" Ana says. You can tell Betty is embarrassed. Every time her mother speaks she tenses up. You think its cute though. \"I will say though I didn't think she'd ever get herself a man. She was always all business what with that store of hers.\" Ana tells you. \"Mom!\" Betty whines as she sits down. She moves you over to her plate and you see the food spread out before you. Its a vegetable dish, which makes sense considering cows are herbivores. You walk over to a huge brussel sprout and tear off a piece of the leaf. Its delicious! It tastes like she cooked it in some kind of sauce. You continue to sample vegetables, finding each one fantastic. \"This is great!\" you call up to Betty, who smiles fiercely. \"Well she did learn from the best!\" Ana says, pointing at herself. You and the two cow ladies finish eating and...</span></div></div>",

Betty rolls her eyes and sighs. \"Always ready for a drink, huh momma?\" she asks. She sounds a little annoyed but you can see a smile on her face. Guess this is a little joke between mother and daughter. Betty disappears into the next room, leaving you and her mother alone. You look around awkwardly, waiting for Betty to return. The silence is killing you so you decide to try and start a conversation. Turning to face Ana you are greeted with her gigantic face hovering at point blank range in front of you. With a yelp you fall back onto your butt, causing the great cow woman to chuckle. \"You really are a cutie.\" she says, picking you up and setting you back on your feet. \"Thanks...\" you manage to say. Spending time with anthros has made you less nervous around them, but having Ana so close, studying you in detail is a bit unnerving. \"You seem like such a nice boy, I'm glad Betty managed to wrangle a guy like you.\" she says. Unlike Betty's southern accent, which is very cute, Ana's thicker accent somehow makes her seem sexier. You blush at her compliment and she rubs your little head. Her building sized finger feels so gentle, just like her daughter's. You would try and talk some more but for some reason you're mesmerized by the petting and her giant face. She just sits there and enjoys your company until Betty returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you hear the rumbling that signals Betty's return you look toward the door. She enters the room with a bottle of wine and a couple of glasses. \"Did you two have a nice chat?\" she asks as she sets the glasses down. Each one towers over you, many times taller than anything humans could build. \"Sort of. We just kind of enjoyed each other's company.\" Ana said, giving you an additional stroke on the back. You gaze up as Betty pours some wine into each glass. Its like a waterfall rushing into an enormous bowl. The glasses are then suddenly lifted away as the cows take their first sips. \"Oh, come on Alan!\" Betty says and lifts you up. The table gets farther and farther away as she lifts you up to her glass. When the ride stops you're being held above her wine. \"Come on, have some!\" she insists. You try to take a sip but end up up taking a big gulp instead. Betty places you on her shoulder when she sees you've had some and begins chatting with her mother. \"So how far have you two gone?\" Ana asks. \"Mom!\" Betty says with a roll of her eyes. \"I'm just curious! Has he had your milk?\" the older  woman presses further. You don't answer but the blush on both of your faces tells her everything. With a smirk Ana takes another drink of wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later the bottle of wine is almost gone. These girls really like their alcohol. You stare up at the giant bottle and Ana's face suddenly appears next to you. \"Betty can sure drink huh?\" she asks, the wine on her breath smothering you. \"Although wine is more my thing. She prefers stuff like beer and whiskey.\" You back up from the tipsy cow only to back into a second massive face. Betty, who is now also up close, glares at her mom. \"Whats that supposed to mean? You make it seem like I'm some drunk!\" she says. The two of them are feeling pretty loose right now, and their accents have turned into a strong southern drawl. Suddenly Betty pushes you onto the table with her lips, giving you a sloppy kiss. \"Aaww!\" Ana says before taking another drink from the bottle. Betty snatches it from her and takes her own swig. You just stare up while laying on your back, their huge bosoms taking up your view. A drop of wine splashes into your face, giving you another big gulp. Although you haven't had nearly as much as them, you've had quite a bit. It doesn't take too much longer for you to black out.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen you wake up you find yourself on some very soft ground. When you roll over you see a huge nipple towering over you and deduce that you've been sleeping on Betty's breast. The rumbling snores tell you that she's asleep right now. Feeling hungover you crawl to the nipple and through sheer willpower climb to the top. You're very thirsty and remember how great Betty's milk was. With all the focus you can muster you try and stimulate her nipple until just as planned a drop of milk comes out. You plunge your face into it and drink up, relishing the taste. Its then that the woman you're on wakes up, and you realize its...</span></div></div>",

Curiously, you looked in your rearview mirror, and what you saw nearly gave you a heart attack. Betty's colossal, curvaceous form was stomping towards you with great, mighty strides. The very worst part though, she had an expression of pure rage on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan! Ah know ya lied ta me!\" She thundered, giving you all the incentive you needed to step on the gas and go as fast as your little car could take you. Unfortunately, it was pretty much pointless.

You cough a few times before Betty bounces up and down on you.

You think you hear her snort a challenge, but her movement tosses you about on the bed and the pain from being sat on for so long leaves your head spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You recover in time to see the raptor woman put her claws up and hiss, showing a mouth full of formidable fangs. \u201cDon\u2019t try anything stupid, missy. We\u2019re here for your money, not your life. Don\u2019t try and be a hero, or you\u2019ll get <b>cut</b>, got it?\u201d She flicked her claws, and they glinted in the moonlight coming through the window. \u201cAnd so will that poor sap you\u2019ve been flattening under your fat ass all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty snorts steam. \u201cMiss; yer one stupid Dino.

The dinosaur woman blocks, but Betty dodges her own vicious slash; knocking over the bookcase the raptor bumped into earlier. Both giantesses threw punches, kicks, and even a few hip-checks, trying to use their plump figures to advantage, but they seemed evenly matched as they knocked against walls, cursing and snarling all the while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like watching two powerful goddesses slugging it out, and you had a front row seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scuffle was getting heated\u2014Betty barely dodge another claw-swipe that left deep gouges in the wall.

Despite the raptor woman\u2019s efforts, she and Betty were evenly matched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Betty! You can do it! Kick her scaly ass!\u201d You cheer, and see Betty smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, see that? Even after I squished him with my big rump he still likes me,\u201d Betty quips to the raptor woman. \u201cNow, ta deal with you, ya sidewinder!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty twists out of the grapple and delivers a knee to her foe\u2019s stomach. The dinosaur woman\u2019s eyes bug out and se lurches forward, clutching her belly with a groan. Betty looks back at you, and you just barely see her wink at you. Then she knocks the stunned raptor woman into the wall with a hip-check, putting her huge butt to use once more\u2014this time on a fellow anthro. The dinosaur woman slams into the wall with a thud, not far from the safe. Before she can recover, Betty grabs the safe\u2019s door\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd slams it into her saurian foe\u2019s face. <br>\r\nYou wince in sympathy. Robber or not, that HAD to be painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer snout bloodied and flattened, the raptor woman collapses to the floor in an unconscious heap. Betty smirks down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what ya get fer messin\u2019 with a heifer.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets another two whips from her closet and quickly ties the raptor\u2019s feet and hands.

Was wonderin\u2019 where you two went,\u201d Betty says casually, grabbing them in her hand. She licks her lips. \u201cWell, down ya go.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring their screaming, Betty opens her mouth wide, holding the two men over it. She lets them scream and beg for a few more seconds\u2026and drops them. The giantess cow\u2019s maw snaps shut, muffling the robbers\u2019 screams. She swishes them around for a moment, letting out a quiet moo as she enjoys the taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as casually as if she was eating candy, Betty tilts her head back and swallows them whole. <br>\r\nBetty sighs and pats her plump belly. \u201cMmm..tasty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives her stomach another pat as she walks over to the bed, gently picking you up. \u201cAre ya alright, Alan?\u201d she asks, concerned. \u201cDid any of those varmints get to ya?\u201d She nuzzles her cheek against you, cooing to calm you down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026no, Betty. I\u2019m, uh; fine.\u201d You manage to say. Still stunned by what just happened. \u201cI\u2026wow, you were amazing! Where\u2019d you learn to fight like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTook some self-defense classes back on Zoonova, when I was a calf. When I saw them breakin\u2019 in, it just all came back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at Betty\u2019s stomach. \u201cOkay\u2026and those guys you ate\u2014are they\u2026y\u2019know\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty laughs. \u201cOh don\u2019t you worry none. They ain\u2019t dead. Got four stomachs, remember? They\u2019ll be fine: no acid in the first one. As long as they don\u2019t get themselves in the second stomach, they\u2019ll be fine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in relief. They may have been robbers, but nobody deserved to be digested alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty kisses you\u2014which given her size, left you soaked in cow slobber. Not that you mind, you were safe now; both from the robbers and from Betty\u2019s anger. \u201cI think you\u2019ve had enough punishment, Alan. Let\u2019s go call the cops and get these varmints outta here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places you on her shoulder and picks a phone off her desk..then makes a face before she can dial. Reaching jnto her mouth, she pulls out a shoe\u2014from one of the human robbers. You and Betty both laugh as she tosses it aside and dials the cops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From your perch on Betty's shoulder, you can't help but nod in approval: for such a sleepy town, Coalton Shores' police were always quick and alert. \"Heads up, the fuzz is here,\" you say, leaning against Betty's cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckles and nuzzles you, \"Time to talk to the folks in blue, I guess.\" She smirks, \"Hope they have a jail cell big enough for Miss Jurassic Park.\" After calling the cops, Betty had been sat on the still-unconscious raptor woman's chest, just in case she woke up. Despite the occasional twitch, though; the robber hadn't stirred. Her snout was bent at an odd angle and slightly bleeding. Betty really had done a number on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they'll manage. You already have her cronies 'in custody'.\" You point at the cow giantess's plump belly. Muffled shouts can still be heard from within as the human robbers she ate keep yelling to be let out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Serves 'em right. All that strugglin' feels good.\" Betty gives you time to grab onto her hair as she slowly stands up and goes into the living room just as the sirens and footsteps get louder. There's a hard knock at the door--probably the anthro cop, from the volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Coalton Shores Police!\"</i> A male voice barks. <i>\"Responding to a break-in report!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All clear, boys!\" Betty announces. \"Door's unlocked, come in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens to reveal a burly deer anthro about as tall as Betty in a cop's blue uniform, his antlers being trimmed to not bump into doorframes. Two human cops are with him, one perched on each shoulder and wielding shotguns. The deer flashes a badge as he enters, \"Officer Matthew Blake, ma'am. Where is--\" he stops when he gets a good look at Betty's skintight dominatrix outfit, quirking an eyebrow for a second. The human cops try to hide smirks, but keep quiet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince at their reactions. Betty had wanted to change out of her costume, but there hadn't been time. Thankfully, the cops are he's shrugging slightly before Matthew drops back into cop lingo. \"Ahem. Where are the perps, ma'am? I understand there were three--one anthro and two humans--and you detained them?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty nods. \"Yessir! I beat up the raptor lady and tied her up as best I could back in my room. Slammed a safe door on her face, too; ya might wanna have a doc waitin' for her back at the station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cops chuckle at Betty's story. \"Day-um!\" the one on Blake's left shoulder quips. \"That had to hurt!\" He gets out his walkie-talkie and starts radioing more officers to come in and pick up the perps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew smirks in approval. \"Serves her right if you ask me. Where are the human perps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Betty both crack nervous grins. \"Well...she sort of ate them,\" you manage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cops all blink. \"<i>Ate</i> them?\" Matthew echoes. \"I know they were robbing your place, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty puts her hands up. \"Woah, easy! I'm a cow--four stomachs, remember? There's no acid in the first one--those two sidewinders'll be fine. I can feel them throwin' a fit in there right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew looks septical, but shrugs. \"I suppose that works. Just know we'll have to take you down to the station to cough them up later, okay? If they fall into the next stomachs and get digested, you could get smacked with an Excessive Force charge, or worse. That clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYikes. This cop was a hard-ass. When you saw Betty eat the two robbers, you'd almost felt like cheering. Hearing the potential consequences made you feel a bit guilty over shrugging off the two guys getting eaten. Betty's wince told you she felt the same way. \"Yes sir,\" Betty says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n===A Bit Later====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cops filed away, Matthew handed Betty a yellow slip of paper. \"And be sure to show up at the station at 9 A.M. <i>on the dot</i>, to spit up the two perps you ate. The Chief doesn't care how good they tasted, got it?\" the deer cop says sternly. The raptor woman had already been taken away, Betty getting more odd looks when the cops saw the whips she'd tied her up with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Officer.\" Betty answers, patting her belly. \"They won't be in there for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew nods. \"Good. Have a safe night, ma'am. Oh, and about you snatching that young man's car off the road and taking him to your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Betty cringe. \"Y-yes?\" She croaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew's stern face cracks a grin. \"We're letting you off with a warning this time. Try not to do that again.\" <br>\r\nHe turns and thunders off down the road, following the squad cars of the human cops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty sighs in relief. \"Good Lord, I was worried!  I was so mad when I figured out ya fibbed, I didn't think straight! Can ya forgive me, Alan?\" she says pleadingly, cradling you in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug it off. \"Relax, Betty. You protected me from those thugs, even if you were mad at me.\" You smile. \"And the whip was a but much, but...well, you sitting on me wasn't too bad. I got a great view, after all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty blushes and kisses you again, soaking you in cow slobber. \"Oh, hush! C'mon, let's get back inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before Betty's lying on her couch, with you nestled in her ample cleavage. She'd changed out of her red bodysuit into a pink nightgown. Every few moments, she'd pat her belly and smirk. \"Heh, I know it was overboard, but damn if gulpin' those crooks down didn't feel good,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they kinda deserved it,\" you say. Silence settles, neither you nor Betty saying anything for a few minutes. After all the adrenaline of Betty flipping out AND the robbery, it feels awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo break the ice, you ask Betty....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You never thought Betty had a sadistic streak, but a woman scorned, especially women who were 10,000 mile high cattle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well,\" said Betty. \"If y'all ain't answering, I guess ya don't like my boobs, but don't worry, I've got something for y'all if you're being picky!!\" Betty then shakes her breasts until you fall screaming down the gap in between her cleavage, right down her breast armor. Betty feels you falling down and uses one of her fingers to trace your path before you fall and land on her moon sized udder, making her giggle. She even starts to spray milk in your face. Since it isn't pasteurized, it tastes horrible and you nearly drown. But no, Betty's too nice to kill you. She was still your friend, even if she was mad at you, and would just settle for torturing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Betty picks up her udder and shakes it, causing you to fall in between her thighs where she proceeds to grab you and squeeze you tight as you scream like a banshee. Betty squeezes tighter and giggles as she lays back and lounges. \"Oh,\" she says. \"Oh, oh oh, y'all feel good in there Al. I can keep this up all night.\" \"Please Betty,\" you groan. \"Don't do this!\" \"Well, it is kinda mean considering ah'm much, much bigger than a dinky little guy like you.

I have a friend who's into this sorta thing and I think she'll be tickled pink to join in the domination.\" You gulp to yourself. Betty had a friend who was into female anthros dominating male humans. You lied to the wrong cow. But will Betty call her friend? If she's that brutal, maybe Betty will forget it. After all, she's still your friend, even if she was mad at you.</span></div></div>",

You see Claudia and you're stunned. Claudia was a giant brown furred and pear shaped coyote Yajuu with long reddish brown hair. She was wearing gold earrings along with a yellow t-shirt and purple pants that looked like they were coming apart. You couldn't stop drooling at her, but then you shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I thinking?\" you ask yourself. \"She's the other torturer.\" Then Claudia lowers her head and sniffs at you as she gives a slasher smile and even licks you as you scream. Claudia lets out a laugh. \"I just love to watch them cheaters squirm. You hurt my gal pal's feelings little man, and now we're gonna hurt you.\" Claudia was drooling at the thought of how she would torture you and then she realizes how Betty is dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw dang,\" says the coyote with a tone of disappointment. \"Ya didn't tell me it was Amazon night.\" \"Oh don't worry Claudia,\" says Betty. \"I got another outfit just your size.

But death would be a blessing at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudia lets out a giggle. \"What did I tell ya Betty?\" she asks. \"They feel so good under there.\" Betty lets out a laugh. \"It tickles, it just tickles so much. I might just have to do this more often.\" You don't like the sound of this. You might've unintentionally made Betty more hostile towards humans. To make matters worse, both anthros were jumping up and down on you. You couldn't tell which one was heavier, the pear bottomed coyote girl or the southern cow girl. You were in anthro bottom hell. All because you turned down one date. \"There is such a thing as disproportionate retribution.\" You mutter. However, neither girl can hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're trapped between their butt cheeks for twenty minutes before they get up. You're still alive but you were squashed for so long you got stuck to one of the girls. But which one?</span></div></div>",

You're drenched in cow saliva and cough as you actually swallow some. Both then you look up in surprise as Betty smirks down on you. \"I thought you were going to eat me!\" you yell. Betty just gives you a sneer. \"I'm an herbivore Alan, I dun't eat people. Anthros ain't even allowed to eat humans. I told ya I weren't gonna make a meal outta ya.

Of course, you got tossed around like chewing gum for pissing off an <i>herbivore</i>. Maybe visiting a <i>carnivore</i> like Reggie wasn't a good idea.

You gulp and hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you're driving down the street to get to Reggie's house. Given that Reggie and her neighbors are all 10,000 foot tall anthros, you needed your car to visit Reggie. You park in the human parking lot between her house and her neighbor's house. You didn't know what kind of anthro Reggie's neighbor was, but you did hear her saying unflattering things about Reggie. You let out a laugh. Living next door to someone in a rock band would get old real soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was what was bugging you. You didn't hear music at all. Usually Reggie's joint was always jumping. \"I hope she's feeling alright.\" You say. Now you were beginning to worry. You run up to the front door and climb Reggie's steps. You look around Reggie's lawn to see it had better days. There were spots of dead grass in sight and some parts of the fence were broken. You even saw one of Reggie's bras hanging on the side of one fence post. What exactly did she do since you last saw her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you decide to go for it and then knock on the bottom of the front door. \"Reggie?!\" you yell. \"Are you in here Reggie? It's me. Alan. Are you feeling alright?\" You wait for ten minutes and then you feel tremors and hear the thunderous sounds of the hyena girl's footsteps. Reggie opens the door and you see her two city crushing feet covered in golden brown fur with black spots. You look past her ankles and then cover your eyes because apparently she wasn't wearing a skirt or pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without saying a word, Reggie crouches down to get a good look at you and you see her large pierced face.</span></div></div>",

You human men are such pigs. Now for your detention.\" She walks into her kitchen and digs through her cabinet before producing a jar with air holes drilled into the lid. She obviously had it in case she had to deal with unruly human students. Why they let an anthro teach at a human school you didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the corgi drops you in the jar and screws it shut before walking back to her desk to grade papers as her rump shakes from side to side. You let out a groan. You were gonna be here a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen does the corgi giantess let you out...?</span></div></div>",

Craning your neck you gaze upward and see the naked body of the corgi. Her arm moves and she lowers her hand, extending a finger. That one finger casts a great shadow as it draws closer. It creates tidal waves of love juice when it touches down, making contact with you at the same time. When it retracts back into the sky you go with it, stuck by the cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo you it was a monolithic event, but to the giant corgi it was a simple movement. She simply stuck her finger into a small puddle and you stuck to it. She brings you to her face and glares at you. \"Where do you think you're going young man?\" she asks. \"I was just-\" you start before she cuts you off. \"I'll tell you where. You thought you were going to get out of your detention. Well, not on my watch!\" She paces around as she lectures you, with you feeling every step. As she stomps around her naked boobs jiggle, drawing your attention. \"Excuse me but my eyes are up here! If even now you can't stay focused on your punishment then I know what to do!\" she says. Next she walks over to a shelf and drops you into a jar. \"I have to finish with my work, but we'll get back to this later.\" She walks away with a sway in her hips, which you think is intentional. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on its become evening. She's kept you here the whole day! You eventually fall asleep, but her approaching stomps wake you up. You rub your eyes in time to see her reaching for the jar. She carries it to the bedroom and smiles at you. \"Time to complete your punishment.\" she says, and dumps you onto the bed. You land with a couple of bounces and the bed starts to move. The corgi gets on as well, her legs on either side of you. Ahead of you is her pussy, which you're all too familiar with. \"Okay, now you'll be doing it yourself.\" she commands from above. You stare up at her and she glares at you. \"Get to it young man.\" she bellows and scoots you forward with her paw. You start walking on your own and reach her pussy. \"Get on with it!\" she says. You reach up and begin feeling her moist lips. She lets out a moan of pleasure as you do so. Moving on you start climbing and slip inside. She bucks when you enter and plays with her nipples. Inside you start moving around, grabbing and hitting whatever you can. Outside she's going crazy twisting around on the bed. After a while she climaxes, squirting you out in another gush of cum. She grabs you once again and drops you on her areola. \"Now do here...\" she says lustily. Her nipple looms over you, and you see her finger circling around, tracing the areola. With no other choice you throw yourself forward and tease the nipple. While you do what you can here she masturbates, eventually reaching another orgasm. When she's done she looks at you with a smile. \"That should do it. Lets do it again sometime...\" she says before trailing off and falling asleep. Now's your chance to run, but you don't know if you can make it through her home. Plus, that was actually pretty great and a sexy teacher is always nice. Should you try to leave or stick around and get to know her?</span></div></div>",

Despite your size, your like a speck to her and that you wonder how they could see you there with their big moon size eyes. You should probably ask her when she wakes up.

You barely got even an hour sleep despite your hard work of climbing from her breast, down to the bed, to the floor and climbing up back to her nightstand all night.

You wasn't sure what else is to say until Rachel starts to but in the conversation again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Laura, it is good that you came to the restaurant with us and as you can see, Allan is a little bit shy right now. So I don't want you to intimate him too much though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Rachel, I wasn't intimating him that much girl and I was only asking his name though, but I guess I shouldn't butt in for you on the date. I think I should leave and I don't want to ruin your guys day.\" Laura said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to wonder if you made a bad scene or that your shyness have gotten in your way to cause trouble.

That didn't give you much courage, most of your anthro friends say that dragons( and dinosaurs to an extent )are a real mean bunch. They apparently have a mean disposition and treat humans and other anthros badly. Not to mention Sapphira... that girl was a real monster, she and her gang routinely razed entire human cities, avoiding the law numerous times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. After all you can't expect anthros to be tolerant if humans aren't. Plus all that nasty stuff people say about them must be only an unfair stereotype, right? You finally get to her house, it's colossal to you but normal sized compared to the other houses next to it. You ring the bell, put on a smile and wait for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic door creeks opened, and forward came a truly titanic dragoness. She had shiny crimson scales on her back, with smooth black plates on her stomach region. She had a massive rack and wore a fancy red dress with two holes in the back out of which her giant wings were poking out. She was barefoot, showing off her giant 5 toed reptilian talons.

Now my feet are sore from the walking. This is where you come in, you will massage and pamper my feet, OR ELSE!\" She hisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp down and nod silently. This lady was completely insane! Should have listened to your friends, and you thought they were joking when they said dragons are born with a superiority complex. But you weren't in a position to oppose her, you were on her turf after all and if you want to leave this house in one piece you better not anger her further...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she confirmed that you understood your task, she dangled you above her gigantic foot and suddenly released you. You let out a scream as you plummeted hundreds of feet. You land squarely on her sole, which luckily was much softer than her scaly body. You slowly get up, your feet slightly sinking into her smooth flesh. She was laying down on her belly with her soles facing upwards. You were standing on the giant, black island of flesh that was her pad, with five smaller islands representing her toes in front of you. You look behind you and you see her colossal rump standing as tall as a mountain. She raises her head, and with an anoyed glare she said \"Stop staring and get to work! Or else you'll become a permanent decoration on the botton of my sole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much delay you got on your knees and started rubbing and massaging her sole. It was hard work, you had a lot of ground to cover and the stech was unbearable, it didn't help that her talons were radiating heat, making you sweat like a pig. Midway through she curls her toes in delight, almost making you plummet to the ground. After what seems like hours of hard work she suddenly picks you up and gets up. She dangles you like before only this time staring at you for a few seconds. You stay still, silently praying and awaiting judgement.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then walked deeper into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outside of the house was unremarkable, but the inside was a whole different deal. There were fancy paintings of dragons and dinosaurs strung up across the hallway walls. You passed by a room that looked like a kitchen.

Lucy was a rich gal, living the highlife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally stops in one of the rooms. It was a large room that appeared to be the living room.

Allow me to educate you in Zoonovan history.\" You sit down on the glass table, preparing to get bored to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clears her throat and starts the lesson \"For millions of years the Draconic race had control over some of the largest mineral deposits on Zoonova. And as such all dragons are rich and influential. I myself have a net worth of several billions and own 7 major brands, 109 factories and 542 ore mines back at Zoonova. The anthros back at Zoonova show us the respect we deserve, but here on earth they seem to have forgotten the proper manners. The best part is that I don't have to do anything, everything is automated by my orderlies and I get almost all of the cash\" She declares proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo all dragons are rich apparently. That would kinda explain her discriminative nature considering everyone in the neighbourhood has average income at best. Wait... does that mean that Sapphira the rampaging, dragoness terrorist is actually a multi-billionaire? Your curiosity gets the best of you and you ask \"So Sapphira is also filthy rich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy's smug and proud expression quickly went sour as soon as you mentioned the infamous anthro terrorist. \"Sapphira... don't even mention that name in my presence! She squandered her entire family fortune so she could for a gang of similarly shallow minded individuals and for what? To destroy your race. She is a disgrace to dragons everywhere!\" She states. But then her furious grin disappeared into a saddened one? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We used to be... friends. No, we were more than just friends. She was the only other dragon in my home town, we played together, went to school together, we were inseparable. We never liked humans, but we didn't downright hate them. But one day she went too far. She left her old life with me behind her. I've been trying to do the same, which is why I came here, to start a new life. She even went as far as to changing her name. Sapphira is not her real name, It's Alice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat there, procesing all of this new information, when you noticed something. Tears were rolling down Lucy's crimson cheeks. You felt kinda bad for her, sure she was an elitist dragon with anger managment issues and she kidnapped you, but she's going through the loss of a loved one and you just reminded her about that loved one.

The gigantic dragoness calms down and wipes the tears off her face. She picks you up and she holds you on top of her palm and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... i'm sorry human. I shouldn't have lashed out on you and I shouldn't have taken out my frustration on you. I will no longer hold you here against your will\". Would you look at that, it actually worked! Being nice was your ticket out of here. But then you look out of the nearby window and you notice it's already night. It would be a real bad idea to go home at this time, lest you want a nocturnal anthro thug to make a smack out of you.

She gently places you on the bed, the moment you make contact with the cotton sheet you sink down a few meters due to the extreme level of fluffiness. She turned around, opened her dresser and started undressing herself, you being the gentleman you are, looked away. After hearing her close the dresser you turn around only to see her in only a bra and panties. You recoil back in shock, afraid she'll punish you for peeking at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully she wasn't angry.

She was a European dragoness judging by her large leathery wings. This dragoness woman was noticeably overweight, you're guessing at least four hundred pounds had she been a normal sized human. She also had bright red hair that looked like a combination of a mullet and an anthro and had huge horns on her forehead, similar in shape to a crown. All she was wearing was a red A-shirt and miniskirt with a belt and she looked plenty angry. She was looking around and before you could say another word, she covers your mouth, shoves you in her cleavage and flies off with you before anyone can see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" you ask your captor. She just breathes out a slight ember to tell you to keep quiet. Soon, this dragon woman, this giant obese blue dragon woman takes you to the outside of the city. \"Good,\" she says. \"We're all alone. This dragon woman looks down and sees you outside of her cleavage. You had managed to slip down to her stomach area and tried to hide behind her belt. You tried to inch your way to the tail and climb down, but the tail wraps around you like a python and you let out a groan before you're lifted up in front of her face. This dragoness bears her enormous teeth and sniffs you before giving a look of disgust. \"Wretched humans,\" she said. \"I don't know why I'm even trusting you.\" \"Wh-What do you mean? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness breathes fire above your head and you're forced to duck. \"Remember my name human,\" she said as she tightened her tail grip on you. \"I am Sapphira.\" You then let out a gasp. You heard of Sapphira, she was a nasty anthro terrorist who despised humans with a passion. She was the leader of a gang that hated Mayor Bloomberg even more than you do. But why oh why did a dangerous criminal want you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, let me go Sapphira,\" you say. \"I actually like anthros. Please don't kill me.\" \"Oh I'm not going to kill you, as long as you do as I say.\" You gulp loudly before Sapphira explains and turns her head to a dartboard covered in photographs of the mayor. She breathes out several flames to melt the dartboard to the ground. \"There is going to be an anti-anthro rally in town today. Unknown location. Only a human can find it. That, my little friend is where you come in.\" Oh no. You were going to be an unwilling accomplice. You shudder at the thought of Sapphira's plan as she strokes your head with her finger and presses you against her enormous belly.</span></div></div>",

But before he can warn anyone, Sapphira spots him and grits her teeth and grabs him with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs that jogger screams loudly, Sapphira tosses him up into the air and snaps him into her mouth before swallowing him whole.

You try to run but this mastodonic unicorn picks you up by the leg screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen things get much much worse. You hear more stomping and turn to see Sapphira and let out a scream. She was pissed. So much that she was already fuming smoke from the nose. She lets out a loud roar and you think you might've even wet yourself. \"You little worm!! Not only did you fail to destroy the rally, injured an anthro and lost my bomb, but you had to blab about it!!\" \"H-How did?\" \"Simple, I had Ruby here put a listening device outside of your house when you were supposed to be delivering the bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to sweat as Sapphira breathes more fire into your face.

You see these skulls!\" Sapphira holds up her necklace again. \"How many of them do you think used to be stoolies like you.\" You shudder as Ruby squeezes your leg and makes you scream.

Meena is shaking in her seat, knowing she ratted out the most dangerous anthro on both planets.

But soon enough Sapphira and Ruby have escaped. You breathe out a sigh of relief and then Meena walks out. \"Are you okay Alan?\" she asks. You nod your head up and down. \"Thanks Meena.

Was it something I said?\" You don't answer and just keep running but Meena flaps her wings and creates a gust of wind to blow you down.

What do you care, you're nothing more than animals that can talk! You mutant freaks are destroying our planet and driving us to extinction! I hate all of you!

She was accompanied by two other anthros, the main members of her terrorist gang. The first was Ruby, a titanic red furred unicorn with a horn that looked like it was painted in blood. She was Sapphira's second in command and was infamous for going against her species' herbivorous diet when it came to humans. The second was a yellow feathered griffin with a black colored head. Her name was Topaz and she was a complete psychopath who enjoys torturing humans in the most gruesome ways possible and rarely spoke in anything other than an insane laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphira lets out a grunt and blows smoke out of her nostrils. \"I should've known better than to trust a human with that bomb,\" she groans. \"They're completely useless.\" Ruby just gives an evil laugh. \"Don't say that Sapphira,\" she says as she licks her lips. \"They have one use. Oh, when we get to that rally, I'm going to swallow so many bugs whole.\" Topaz just lets out an evil laugh as she polishes what looks like an oversized potato peeler. \"Kill humans,\" she says. \"Kill the humans.\" \"Yes Topaz,\" says Sapphira as she breathes out fire. \"All humans in Coalton Shores, starting with that loudmouth anthro hating mayor of theirs will perish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as soon as those monsters get forward, there's a large explosion that makes Topaz yell as she collapses on the ground in a cloud of feathers. \"Topaz!\" yells Sapphira. \"What's going...\" \"Looks like your bomb blew up in your face dragon breath.\" You crawl deeper into Reynard's cleavage as Sapphira's eyes let out a look of surprise that quickly turn into rage. \"Reynard!\" she yells. \"Hounding me as usual I see.\" The secret agent you once knew as Vixie simply opens up her tail to reveal she really a kitsune. \"What's going on out there?\" you ask. \"Be quiet,\" says Reynard. \"And hold on. This won't be pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby lets out a snort and drags her hoof through the ground several times before she runs at Reynard with her horn out. \"Ruby!\" yells Sapphira. \"Look out!\" Ruby tries to impale Agent Reynard but Reynard jumps into the air and swings all nine of her tails in Ruby's face to make her groan before Ruby crashed horn first into an empty skyscraper. Ruby tries to pull out her horn but Reynard forms her tails into a fist and whacks the evil unicorn in the back, causing her horn to break off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ruby recovers, she feels her head and you peak out of Vixie's cleavage to see what happened. Once Ruby realizes the damage, she makes a face of despair and takes out a compact mirror before letting out a scream. \"It seems you've been reduced to a mere horse.\" Says Reynard. Ruby lets out a snort as she lets loose tears of pure rage. \"You broke my horn!\" Ruby tries to punch Reynard but Reynard trips her and Ruby hits the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Topaz gets up and coughs up blood before she shrieks and holds up her potato peeler. She tries to cut Reynard with it but Reynard grabs it with her teeth before tossing back Topaz. Topaz then flaps her wings and flies up before swopping down and holding out her talons. But Vixie outwits Topaz by picking up a car and tossing it at the scar in Topaz's face. The car is lodged in and Topaz shrieks before she crashes into the ground and smashes the street to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixie or rather Reynard, smiles but then a stream of fire goes over her head and she turns to face Sapphira now madder than ever. \"How did you find out about us in the first place Reynard?\" asks Sapphira. \"Let's just say,\" says Agent Reynard. \"Don't use a courier that lives across the street from me.\" Sapphira breathes fire and three of Reynard's tail catch on fire before the fox girl waves them and then looks as Sapphira. \"Cheater.\" Sapphira rushes at Reynard and swings her tail but Reynard ducks and then kicks Sapphira in her large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sapphira bits Reynard in the shoulder with her sharp teeth to make her scream before tossing her through a skyscraper and making it shatter As Reynard gets up, she has to dislodge a truck from her side as Sapphira continues to breathe out flames. But then Reynard tosses the truck at Sapphira and it lodges itself in Sapphira's throat. As the dragoness is gagging, Vixie runs at Sapphira, all while you're bouncing around in her cleavage. \"And here I thought I knew my neighbors.\" You say as you grab onto a thick strand of fox girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Reynard then kicks Sapphira in the face and causes her to crash into the street. Sapphira flaps her wings to blow back Reynard before spitting up the truck and breathing more fire. Reynard has to move through the fire and use a big chunk of road as a shield. You're so hot in her cleavage combined with the heat of the flames and the heat of the fox fur, you stripe down to your underwear hoping Agent Reynard wouldn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReynard and Sapphira grab each other by the shoulders and grapple with each other as they both hit the ground. You hold on tight because the fight gets really hairy. \"Come on Vixie,\" you say. \"You can beat the dragon. I sure hope Sapphira doesn't know I'm in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a grizzly fight between two city sized anthros. But who will win?</span></div></div>",

Sapphira was about to see you, if not for the fist flyng into her snout, breaking her nose and teeth in the process, and sends her flying onto her back. Quickly jumping onto her, Reynard doesn't gives a moment of rest and starts beating her down the dragon. From the frantic movement, you're thrown out and land near the unconscious body of Topaz and her gear. As Sapphira could see that she's going to be beaten, her hands swing around her opponent's neck and starts to choke her, distancing her from the dragoness. Due to Reynard's size, her arms can't reach the anthro terrorist and soon tries to pry the evil dragon's strong claws off her neck. <br>\r\nShaking off the shock of being thrown, you see that Reynard is being choked and she's already blue, you panic, until you see a needle beside you, the size of a spear. Picking it up, you rush over to where the two titans are fighting and once there, you start to climb the dragon, who was more focused on Reynard than on you.<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, little fox? Can't breath?\" Sapphira taunts the kitsune, Reynard still looking at her with a determined look.<br>\r\n\"That face pisses me off; in fact that your kind of people pisses me off! Believing that everyone is equal, when it's obvious that there isn't. Humans are inferior to us, yet you people believe that we should treat them the same as us. Suppose that even if you emerged victoriously, do you really think that the anti-anthro rallies would stop? In fact, this incident would inspire more to hate us and even more so. So, just die will ya! Let me snap your neck like the pathetic shit you are!\" Sapphira monologues, as she finally goes for the kill.<br>\r\n\"No, they'll hate you!\" You shout as you plunge the needle into her eye and the dragons roars, letting Reynard's neck loose.<br>\r\n\"You little piss ant! I knew you were trouble when I sent you to bomb that rally! I'll get you for this!\" She roars in pain, as her claws cover her injured eye and starts to move her arm towards you.<br>\r\nReynard, who was recovering from being nearly choked to death, pulls out a knife and gets up, as moves towards her downed opponent, kicking her arm away from you. The dragon howls in pain, as her holds her broken arm, before being kicked down to the ground. For the first time in her wicked life, she felt fear and soon spots the knife in Reynard's hand.<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do with that?\"<br>\r\n\"For breaking multiple laws, such as murder, arson, terrorism, conspiracy, and violations of both human and anthro rights, of the first degree, you are sentenced with the death penalty, Sapphira Jewels!\" Reynard declares, as she plants herself on top of the evil dragon, preventing her from moving.<br>\r\n\"You can do this! Where's my trial? Can't I declare insanity?\" Sapphira begs, for the first time in her life.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but you should taken your trial back a few years ago when you had the chance. Had you been on Zoonova, perhaps you may of had a small chance of evading the death penalty, but you're on Earth, aren't ya?\" Reynard says, before plunging the knife into the monster's neck and slicing it open.<br>\r\nSapphira's single eye stares at her with shock and despair before the light of life vanishes, along with the monster known as Sapphira. Reynard falls to ground as adrenaline stops going through her as both you and her Reynard stare at each other, filled with exhaustion.<br>\r\n\"Is she...\"<br>\r\n\"She's dead, Alan. She's dead, though her legacy will live as a legend of terror and hatred towards dragon anthros,\" The fox states, as her tails merge into one.<br>\r\n\"Let's go home, Alan. You had a busy day today, you deserved it,\" Reynard says as you nod your head, before passing out from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next following days were eventful: your friends and family come by to check on you, eyes filled with tears as they feared for safety. Especially Meena and your mother, as they were balling their eyes for you. Even Ryan gave you a break, as he told you to hold onto the video for a bit longer. Your neighbors came by to check on you and gave you a 'get well' gifts. Meanwhile, true to Sapphira's words, Mayor Bloomberg used the incident as an excuse to fire up the anti-anthro activists, though the pro-activists protested things were repeating themselves, they themselves being fired up. After the fall of Sapphira and her top two trusted aides, her organization fell pretty quickly and made it easier to capture them. As for Reynard, not much was said of her, as she didn't come by nor her actual job being mentioned at all. For you, the days went by as a blur and the press were relentless on you, asking questions about your involvement. It was a dark evening as you were resting, when you heard a knock on your door and you go to open it, hoping it wasn't anymore journalists. Standing there, was your foxy neighbor, covered in bandages. You both awkwardly greet each other before falling into a long period of silence.<br>\r\n\"You alright, Ms...\" You ask her, being the first to break the ice between you two.<br>\r\n\"You can call me Vixie as you always have, Alan. As for your question, other than having multiple injuries and tons of paperwork for me, I'm fine. How about you, Alan?\" Reynard, no, Vixie asks, returning back to the personality she had before showing that she was a secret agent.<br>\r\n\"So-so, but man, the media doesn't give you a break!\" you complain, making the giant giggle.<br>\r\n\"I know, but there's another reason for me coming here,\" Vixie states, as she reverts to her Reynard persona.<br>\r\n\"Uh, what is it?\" You ask, curious of her request.<br>\r\nWhat was it that Reynard wanted to ask you?</span></div></div>",

You knew the police in this town well what with how small Coalton Shores was. The first of them was Kyle, an ankylosaurus anthro. He didn't speak much and was said to not be very smart, but he was still a cop. The second one was a female cop. Elise, a blue whale anthro. She was more human looking than most anthros, except for her huge tail and white underbelly and chin and the whole blowhole thing.

But then you take a closer look at Ruby and then let out a laugh. You get a feeling this might not be as bad as you thought. It's a foolish thought, but you couldn't help but laugh at Ruby. \"What's so funny?\" asked Sapphira with a slight growl. \"This is your second in command?\" you ask Sapphira. \"She's a unicorn.\" Ruby lets out a look of confusion that soon turns into a look of anger. \"What's that supposed to mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphira realized what you were thinking and gave an evil smile. \"Oh,\" she said. \"I get it. You're not the first to underestimate my Ruby. Ruby, would you be a dear and show our guest your horn?\" Ruby lets out a laugh and walks up to her boss and bends down. You take a good look at her horn and realize that not only was it glowing but it was also bright red. You shutter because something tells you that it wasn't always that color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphira patted Ruby on the head and made her smile. \"My Ruby is just as deadly as she is beautiful.\" Ruby then let out a giggle. \"So Ruby, my lovely blood red unicorn, what form of torment would you recommend to pump the little worm.\" Ruby actually had to think about that and you didn't like the look on her face. Then she begun to giggle. \"I know the perfect thing Sapphira. We'll give him the Six Tick Kiss.\" Sapphira was actually impressed. \"Ooh,\" she said. \"We haven't tried that for a long time. Good idea.\" Sapphira liked that idea and logically, that meant you were going to hate it, whatever it was. \"What is the Six Tick Kiss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphira and Ruby both laughed evilly and you begun to shake. \"You see,\" said Ruby with a giggle. \"We both kiss each other, except you're in our mouthes at the time.\" You give a look of disgust. \"That's the torture.\" Ruby just gave an evil smile and showed you her teeth. Being a unicorn they weren't sharp as Sapphira's but at that size even herbivorous teeth can be frightening. \"Wait, it gets better.\" Sapphira decided to continue where her lover left off. \"We also play tug of war with our tongues. Whoever has you in their mouth at the end of the tug of war, gets to eat you.\" You let out a scream and then turn to Ruby. \"But unicorns are vegetarians!\" Sapphira just gives you a smug smile. \"You don't know Ruby at all.\" \"Oh relax,\" said Ruby as she looms her face over you. \"You'll be thrown back up in an hour, that'll give you enough time to think about whether you want to fink or not. You're too important to us to melt.\" Ruby and Sapphira let out another laugh and then decided to get it over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphira placed you in her cavernous mouth again as Ruby kissed her. At the intersection of the maws their tongues wrap around you and each other. You grunt and groan as both behemoth terrorists toss you around with their tongues. You're living a nightmare, they're like pythons trying to squeeze the life out of you. You couldn't think of a worse torture but then you remember that whoever pulls you into their mouth first will eat you for an hour and then regurgitate you. At this point being digested would be a blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho wins the tug of war. </span></div></div>",

You couldn't believe two things. The lengths they'd go to interrogate you, namely the fact they'd eat you alive. The other thing you couldn't believe was that you were going to be swallowed by a unicorn, a creature that wasn't even supposed to eat meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to break free but Ruby's tongue is too big and pulls you into the throat as you let out a scream and Ruby gulps you down. Outside Ruby feels her neck to feel your descent as Sapphira wraps her tail around the unicorn's leg and gives a lustful smile. \"A growing girl needs to eat.\" Ruby gives Sapphira a smile before letting out a slight belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside Ruby's stomach, you're completely horrified. You're standing on an island of human bones in a sea of acid. Sapphira wasn't kidding. Even though Ruby was an animal that was supposed to be herbivorous, she was an outright predator. You could even swear some of these skulls were children's and shiver. You have one hour of this to look forward to and the island of bones was slowly dissolving. You gag on the stench of stomach acids and decomposing bones. It was even worse than Sapphira's fire breath. Then things get much worse because Ruby shakes her hips and rocks the stomach. You scream and nearly get hit by a wave of acid. Sapphira has her head to Ruby's stomach and both of those titans laugh at your misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt goes on like this until the hour is over and Ruby gags a few times to send you back into her mouth panting heavily. Ruby opens up to show your tortured form to Sapphira and Sapphira gives a wicked smirk your way. \"Now are you ready to talk, or would you rather be unicorn cud? I'm sure Ruby can think of another way to squeeze the life out of you.\" Ruby licks the top of your head as you bite your nails. Morality or not, your puny body couldn't take any more torment from these two terrorists.</span></div></div>",

Topaz is the most destructive creature we have in the alliance. When she gets though with you, you'll spill every secret you've kept since you were a larvae.\" Oh, you really don't like the sound of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as much as you were going to hate the sound, the reality would be much worse. Topaz came in and you got a good look at the new torturer. She was an anthro griffin with clawed talons for hands and large wings on her back. She had black feathers from the neck up and on her back and her lower lion body was covered in yellow fur. She had yellow green hair and her face was covered in scars. She was laughing insanely as she held up a duffle bag, presumably full of weapons to torture you in ways far too grizzly to describe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Break,\" muttered Topaz. \"Break human. Break.\" Oh man, this was worse than you thought. This griffin girl wasn't just insane, she was downright feral. Sapphira must have a real crew of monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Topaz went through her bag to find something to torment you with, Sapphira smugly looks down on you and licks you to add insult to injury. But then she decides to be generous and offer you a deal. \"There's still time to surrender right now human, tell us where the anti-anthro meeting is right this minute and you can skip Topaz altogether.\" What will you do now?</span></div></div>",

The rally is taking place at the wharf, in the back of a fish cannery! The mayor called a secret meeting in an informal location to avoid terrorists! I'm not lying! Cross my heart!\" As you cringe, Sapphira looks down at you and gives an evil smile before stroking your head with one of her giant claws. \"Now that wasn't so hard was it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTopaz however isn't as happy as Sapphira and lets out a groan. She wanted to torture you. \"Calm down Topaz,\" says Sapphira. \"You'll get to rampage to your heart's content when we get to the meeting.\" Topaz gives an evil grin, if she had teeth she'd show then right now. Sapphira then places you on the ground and kicks you slightly with her giant leg to push you across the floor. \"Get lost human,\" she says to you. \"We don't need you anymore. And don't you dare tell anyone you saw us or...\" Sapphira then gestures her finger under her neck to give you the picture. You gulp and run away. \"Call Ruby and the girls Topaz,\" you hear Sapphira say. \"Tonight we paint Coalton Shores red with human blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is trouble, big, big trouble. You ratted out the meeting to the most dangerous anthro on two planets. In a way this is your fault. What will you do.

This is 9-1-1, what is your emergency?\"A female voice answered on the other end of the line. You couldn't tell if it was an anthro or human answering the phone, the officials had both working on it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...\"You gulp.\"I would like to report...something really big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you repeat that sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Coalton Shores, a really small mining town.

Thank you for your call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked her back and flipped the phone shut, looking off into the distance.

Earthquakes rattled the planet from twenty anthros stomping across the landscape, their massive feet bulldozing the ground beneath into paste. Smoke rose up from the human side of town, and you could make out Sapphira and several of her cronies around her gleefully torturing the small humans below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, more stomping and groundshaking. You looked off to the horizon, only to see hope. Several anthros clad in riot armor or police uniforms were heading for the terrorists, backed up by tiny human tanks by their feet and fighter jets buzzing around them to aid in any way possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was about to be a big showdown in Coalton Shores.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the fight broke out, the authorities had the upper hand, they had several strong anthros on their side and Sapphira's flunkies were taken out one by one. A cerberus anthro on Sapphira's side was the first to fall and at the hands of a tiger anthro while a mountain lion cop held down a phoenix anthro long enough for a tank to strike him with knockout gas. One dingo anthro cop had trouble with a pegasus anthro but a lioness anthro came to his side and knocked the pegasus out. You watched from a safe place as even the destructive Topaz was knocked back by a large tortoise anthro. As her opponent turned his back on her, Topaz took out a giant knife and tried to stab him but was shot at by an attack jet in the face. The griffin anthro shrieked loudly as the tortoise man turns back and pins her to the ground, breaking her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, only Sapphira is left and she is not giving up without a fight. That horrible dragon easily makes short work of the human tanks with her intense flame breath and as a couple of jets fire at her, she crushes them in her hand as she gives an angry snort. But then the leader of the riot squad appears, a tall black panther anthro in green armor with a mullet and a red eyepatch walks forwards to confront Sapphira. \"Shadow.\" Mutters Sapphira. \"Your rampages ends now dragon,\" says Shadow. \"You're under arrest.\" Sapphira just breathes a huge torrent of flames at Shadow as you let out a scream. Shadow however holds up a shield to block Sapphira's flame breath. \"I'd like to see you try!\" yells the dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's time for the deciding battle. Shadow rushes at Sapphira as she continues to breathe fire but then he jumps into the air and fires at the dragoness, forcing her to use her large wings as a shield. Shadow kicks at Sapphira and manages to land a blow to her face before she responds by biting him in the arm. Shadow scratches Sapphira in the face and then slashes her across her large chest. Sapphira breathes fire again and this time Shadow is in the direct range of the fire. But he endures and delivers punch after punch on Sapphira's face and manages to knock out a few of her fangs. Sapphira scratches Shadow but he holds up a paw to protect his good eye. You bite your nails as you watch the assault. The remaining tanks try to help Shadow but Sapphira knocks them away with her tail before flying up into the air to get an advantage as she continues to spew flames. But Shadow just jumps into the air and grabs hold of Sapphira as they wrestle in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphira attempts to breath fire but then Shadow grabs her by the mouth and stops her. All Sapphira succeeds in doing is burning her own mouth before Shadow grabs her by the wing. Sapphira shrieks as Shadow pulls her to the ground. Shadow turns Sapphira around so she's in direction of the crash. The two anthros fall to Earth with a massive quake strong enough to blow you several miles across the ground screaming. Looks like you didn't choose a safe enough spot. But as you get up, you see that Shadow has triumphed as the rest of the anthro cops come to his side. \"She's unconscious. Hold her down until the armored car comes. She's still dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, an anthro sized armored convey appears and you look up at the sky and let out a yell of victory as you pull back your fist. Good has triumphed over evil. Sapphira has been defeated and you had a hand in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you're listening to the radio as you wash dishes and you hear a report about last night. \"Last night was a dark night for Coalton Shores. The infamous Sapphira and her gang arrived at an anti-anthro rally and attempted to destroy our town. At least one hundred humans were severely injured, including our own Mayor Bloomberg.\" \"Only injured? They could've at least killed that jerk.\" \"But fortunately, the same human tortured into giving the location of the meeting to Sapphira notified the police who made short work of the evil anthros. Coalton Shores was saved from a terrible fate.\" You turn off the radio and smile to yourself. Sapphira was finally behind bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think everything's over, but then you heard a tapping on your roof, you had company and it sounded like anthro company. You decide to go to the door to see who's there.</span></div></div>",

You didn't think there were giant anthros all around the world, but there were anthros working the airport already in Brazil. As you are looking around, you hear a hissing noise. You look up and see a giant tan skinned hourglass shaped anaconda anthro. She was wearing a large purple cloth around her waist like a skirt along with a black bra and purple sunglasses on the top of her head with long slick backed yellow-green hair. You step back out of fear but the anaconda woman lowers her head and you're in front of her lips far bigger than any human building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hola,\" she says. \"Are you Alan?\" \"Uh yeah.\" The anaconda woman hisses at you and feels you around with her tongue. \"So this is the hero who got Sapphira put behind bars. My name is Bella. Bella Constrictor. I am your new host. You will be living with me until Ruby is captured. But since you are such a fine specimen of human, I hope that never happens.\" \"Whao!\" you yell as Bella lifts you up by the shirt with her giant tail and then places you on her shoulder as she slithers off. You already had a friend in Rio, albeit a giant scaly snake woman friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Bella take you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ah, Texas. The state of big hats, livestock and freedom. Anyways here's a little backstory to set the stage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first anthro settlers that arrived in Texas accidentally brought some fauna from Zoonova. The average Zoonovan tick was completely harmless to the colossal anthros, but the smaller ones were the size of a car. In an environment where they have no natural predators they thrived, attacking livestock, devouring crops and assaulting people, causing billions in damages. The invasive species was eventually restricted to the area of Texas thanks to human and anthro efforts. To this day swarms of Zoonovan ticks cause problems for farmers. The good thing is that an Anthro who's ready to get his or her feet dirty could make a fortune as an exterminator. Bad thing is that a lot of people still hold a grudge against the anthroes for introducing this invasive species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new neighborhood means new neighbors, new neighbors calls for a new introduction page:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nThe Cast<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Humans</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan: The main character, you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanton: An old fashioned farmer in his sixties. Holds a grudge against most anthros and you to an extent, because you live among them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily: One of the few humans in town and Stanton's daughter. She is tolerant towards anthros unlike her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Anthros</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDella:A giant cowgirl. She's Betty's older cousin and your new caretaker. Small world eh? Appearance wise she resembles her cousin a lot: pudgy, hard working and cheery. She's heard a lot of good things about you and plans to get to know you better. She works for Stanton and helps around the farm, her boss respects her enough as to not call her names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish: A well toned, giant anthro rattle snake. When she was a little kid and her family was out for a walk and she spotted some Zoonovan tick over the sidewalk on a warm summer day, she always went there and stomped the absolute slime out of the tiny insect. Then she looked up at her parents as if she expected a compliment. Now she does much of the same, except she gets paid to do it. She seems nice but you're not sure how to feel about her. She mostly wears short jeans and a short shirt that reveals her well toned abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma: A skinny Coyote anthro. She is an apathetic grocery store cashier, who consistently sounds as disinterested as she can possibly be. She has a liking for you, stating that you're the only person in town who doesn't bore or annoy her to death on a daily basis. Usually wears really skimpy clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie: An chubby anthro Buffalo. She runs the local bar where they serve both humans and anthros. You don't drink much, but Della often insist that you come along to the bar. Jessie has nothing against you, as long as you don't cause trouble or loiter in her bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal: An giant, anthro gargoyle. She can usually be found wearing long jeans and a white shirt. Her cheery and nice persona hides a dark secret. Recently she has been acting very suspiciously around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo are you just landing or have you spend some time with the cast already<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a large urban city, but you could also spot farmlands some distance away. A little nervous, you weren\u2019t even so much as told where you were going, but the agents did mention you should receive a phone call from the government issued phone they handed you. After the plane lands, and you head into the lobby to pick up your luggage, the phone begins to ring, and familiar voice begins to talk to you as you answer \u201cHave you arrived safely Mr. Alan?\u201d he asks \u201cAh yes, I\u2019m here.\u201d you reply. You pick up your luggage, and shortly after ask \u201cWhere am I? What should I do?\u201d as you nervously look around for any kind of sign. \u201cWell Mr. Alan, welcome to Texas. Or should I call you by your new name Mr. David D. Johnson.\u201d he chuckles \u201cWait, what\u2019s the 'D\u2019 stand for?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt stands for Doe, but you should see your new guardian soon.

What about my social life?\u201d you interrupt. \u201cAhem, you see Mr. Johnson, you are an adult, and we can only recommend you the safest option. You are more than free to see the world as you like, however please listen to any instructions given to you by your guardian. Should you see fit, that she is too smothering, or cruel, you may request a new guardian at any time using this number. One more thing Mr. Johnson, good luck.\u201d he say\u2019s as the call disconnects. \u201cWait... good luck?\u201d confused, you start looking around for anyone similar. Around you were various Anthros, and humans; many of the Anthros were reptiles or non-hooved mammals, being in Texas you expected to see more cows, and horses \u201cSpeaking of Anthros, he didn\u2019t even tell me what race my guardian is.\u201d you mumble to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, you start hearing the clacking of hooves, as you crane your head to the source you see something odd \u201cIs that Betty? No wait... is that what he meant by someone similar?\u201d she begins to look around as if searching for someone, eventually her eyes land on you, and a grin spreads on her face. She walks up to you, and begins talking to you as she leans down \u201cWell hello there sug\u2019 you\u2019re lookin' mighty lost. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re looking for little ol\u2019 me?\u201d \u201cUmm\u201d is all you manage to respond with. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d she giggles as she offers a hand for you to get on. You have second thoughts about climbing on, but she seems to be a relative of Betty, so you go ahead, and climb on. She brings you up to eye level, and begins to introduce herself \u201cMy name is Della, and I suppose you must be David D. Johnson?\u201d you nod at her question \u201cWonderful, welcome to Texas Alan... I mean David.\u201d she winks. </span></div></div>",

You had no way of turning the annoying beeping off, since the alarm clock was bigger than your old house. You had to wait for Della to wake up, she's a hard working girl and her boss required her to be at the farm early and she set up the alarm clock accordingly. In the relative darkness you hear a loud smacking noise, after which the beeping stopped. With a loud yawn the gigantic cow says \" Good morning Alan... did you have a good night well? \". Half asleep you manage to mutter a simple \"yeah\" after which Della lowers her hand next to your bed. You rub your eyes and you climb on top, almost falling off in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDella then transported you to the kitchen. She places you on your own small table, that was on top of her anthro sized table. Three months ago, when you moved in agent Zillian had the house fitted with furniture appropriate for your size. After you both eat your breakfast Della goes off to work, leaving you to do whatever you want for the day. The first few days she refused to let you go anywhere without her, but you managed to convince her that it would be really suspicious if you were always together outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got dressed in a simple tee, jeans, sneakers, and walked outside, you're instantly greeted by the scorching Texas sun. Even after all this time you still haven't gotten used to the heat, but still you believe today would be good. You looked out across the landscape, gargantuan houses as big as Della's lined around you, with some small houses meant for humans, although not too many. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do today?</span></div></div>",

But then again, she was an anaconda. \"What's wrong Alan?\" asks Bella. \"Uh, nothing is wrong. I just never met a snake anthro before.\" Bella lets out a hissing laugh before she takes you to her house. \"Here we are.\" Her house sure was big, even for an anthro's home and Bella then wraps herself around a giant tree before she points to two other houses. \"First I will introduce you to my neighbors since well mi casa es su casa, as of today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Bella points to her right and you see a jaguar anthro girl walking into her house. She was slightly fat but with a large hourglass figure and generously sized assets and long flowing reddish gold hair. She was wearing a ruby necklace and a black shirt with a bright orange skirt. \"That is Niceta, she is my best friend.\" \"She's beautiful.\" You say. \"Si,\" says Bella. \"But she also has quite the appetite.

All day long she is working on paitings and the flute, though she never shows any sign of improvement\" Letty was a literal giant anteater anthro who was wearing a brownish shirt and purple long pants.

At first you scream but then you land softly and slip deep into one of their cleavages. You try to get up but your wiggling makes you sink down even farther.

She was wearing nothing more than a green and black striped T and a pair of leather shorts. Considering she was a walrus, cold weather was the norm for her. She had dark brown reddish hair with a white streak in it, her lips were colored purple and had two large tusks coming down from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis massive walrus also had large breasts even for an anthro and as this goth walrus bends down to get a closer look at you, all you can see are mountains of walrus blubber. She lets out a sigh. \"Hey bug,\" she says to you. \"Are you going to speak to me or what?\" You jump back. \"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm... I'm Alan.\" \"Oh, I know who you are,\" says the walrus girl. \"You got some serious cajones for putting away Sapphira. You must've had some kind of death wish. By the way, I'm Darcy. You better memorize it because we're roommates until that unicorn is caught.\" You let out a laugh. \"You're not very jolly for a walrus Darcy.\" Darcy then proceeded to let out a sarcastic laugh herself. \"Get used to it. I better put you some place where you're not likely to be seen. Don't worry, I know just the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy then lifts you up and it looks like she's going to place you between her breasts. You inhale deeply, but then you soon learn Darcy had another place in mind for you. Instead you places you between the rolls of walrus blubber on her belly. \"Better get comfy in there.\" Darcy lets out a giggle to herself as she walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around to see nothing but walrus flesh, but for some reason you could walk around. It probably helped that Darcy was much, much, much, much bigger than you. You walk and feel her soft blubber beneath you. It was a little warm, so you had to take off your coat. You exhale and then begin to cough. It was still sweaty in here. You're actually worried. Darcy may not be like Sapphira or Ruby but it doesn't appear that she likes you that much. You only hope for the best and wind up falling to the soft fleshy ground as Darcy's movements shake her blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt goes on for twenty more minutes until you feel something holding your leg. Darcy had reached in and had your leg between her fingers. \"Heads up,\" says Darcy as she yanks you out. \"We're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where is here? Where did Darcy take you?</span></div></div>",

It looked like something out of a Tim Burton movie and you blink before Darcy walks up towards the door and opens it. The room is dark and Darcy turns on the lights, revealing the bulbs had been painted green. \"You like?\" asks the walrus giantess as she smiles. \"Well,\" you say. \"You might be good friends with Lily.\" \"Who?\" asks Darcy. You just shrug your shoulders before Darcy places you on the table. \"Sorry about putting you between my rolls,\" says your walrus hostess as she shakes her large body. \"But I didn't want you to be seen. Not all anthros like humans as much as I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to cough slightly. \"It's okay. I'll be fine.\" \"Well sorry,\" says Darcy. \"I'm a walrus. Have you ever heard of a skinny pinniped.\" You look around to see Darcy has a collection of murder mystery books and a jack-o-lantern shaped chandelier along with a shelf with creepy stuffed animals that looked like they were stitched together by Frankenstein. This girl looked like she'd really get along with Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear some noises and realize Darcy's in the kitchen. \"Just sit still little man,\" she says. \"Dinner will be ready soon.\" You had this walrus woman all wrong. You thought she didn't like you, but she was friendly towards humans after all. You decided since you were going to be roommates with this monstrously big walrus goth, so you decide to ask her a question. \"Say Darcy? What made you leave Zoonova and come to Earth in the first place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Darcy. \"I wanted to see the universe past Zoonova. I've done a lot of traveling back on Zoonova and it got boring after I've seen it all. It's funny though. I never knew humans were so tiny. It's actually quite a pain to always watch where I step. A friend of mine accidentally sat on a bank when she came to visit.\" Darcy lets out a laugh at that thought and you walk to the edge of the table to see her large walrus behind shaking. You think that her shorts are slipping and you rub your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shorts are falling, she appears to be shaking them off, revealing a pair of triple extra large (to an anthro) skull covered panties. You look away and then you pant heavily. You couldn't believe it. it was as if she was flirting with you. You had a thing for goth girls but you had never been into big beautiful women before and this was the biggest of them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's ready!\" yells Darcy as the walrus girl steps forward into the room. What are you and your new roommate having for dinner?</span></div></div>",

You'll arrive in the morning.\" You let out a sigh and immediately pack everything. Around midnight, when the rest of the town is asleep, Khan and Zillic pick you up to take you to the airport where a rocket is leaving for Zoonova. \"We've already notified the anthro in charge of you,\" said Agent Zillic. \"They'll keep you safe.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You're gonna need a body guard. You'll be rooming with an anthro until Ruby has been captured. Good luck Alan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you were on the way to Zoonova. Since this was a planet no humans went too, you had to ride wedged between a hippo and warthog anthro. You could barely breath and it was so tight you couldn't move. It wasn't a pleasant ride. When you finally got to Zoonova, you had to move fast to avoid being crushed underneath by anthro feet. And those two agents thought you'd be safer here?

I must admit, you're shorter than I expected.\" \"I'll bet.\" This cat girl presses you against her cheek as she continues to smile. \"Thank you so much. I've been having nightmares about Sapphira ever since her cronies destroyed that city on Earth. I think you humans called it Cincinati.\" You let out a gulp. You had no idea Sapphira did that much damage. That really gives you an idea of what kind of anthro you locked up in prison. The sabertooth woman then places you in her ear. \"Stay in there little guy. We can't let anyone knowing a human is on Zoonova. Last I checked, Ruby was on Earth, but why take chances?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new sabertooth friend had the right idea. At least she can hear you clearly when you're right in her ear.

You're not a big fan of canine anthro guys since Baxter and Ryan back on Earth were never that friendly towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that Fang.\" Fang lets out a growl. \"Geoff,\" she says. \"The most obnoxious skirt chasing beach bum you'll ever meet.

Have you ever met an anthro with gills before?\" You look forward and see Fang's friend Marina outside her shop. putting up surfboards. She was a large bright blue hammerhead shark girl with long green hair. A little overweight but beautiful. Of course, you shook at the idea that Fang was friends with a shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you see something that peaks your curiosity. You see a hyena anthro who looked similar in appearance to your friend Reggie and around the same age, except instead of having a mohawk in her hair, she had her hair styled in a pompadour like smile. She was also dressed different as she was wearing a pink bikini and there was not a piercing in sight. Maybe she was a relative of your hyena friend.

You're shaking in the shark woman's grip before she places you on the counter of her store. \"Please don't eat me!\" you yell. Marina just lets out a laugh. \"Eat you?\" she asks. Marina laughs and slams her hands on her large thighs that look like they could crush an entire moon. \"Trust me,\" she says. \"A little human like you wouldn't put an inch on my waistline and I like to be large. these thighs are what make the big surfer guys come to this shack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina laughs again as you let out a sigh.

He ratted out Sapphira.\" Marina then trips on her own tail and falls on the ground before her hammerhead eyes pop out of her head. \"Sapphira?!\" she yells. \"Fang, do you know what happened to the last human to rat out Sapphira?\" You let out a gulp. \"What did happen to him?\" Marina snapped her jaws in front of you to freak you out. \"Sapphira ate him alive,\" she said. \"And spat out his skull.

And how is the antique business treating you.\" Sherry lets out a laugh. \"It's very good.\" Then Raquel tries to run off but Sherry grabs her by the shoulder. \"Hey, we haven't seen each other for two months.\" Raquel lets out a nervous laugh. \"Well,\" she says. \"I have to get home. I have company. Human company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry gives a look of confusion and walks up to Raquel until her navel is right up to Raquel's and it looks like you could walk in. \"What human? Where is he?\" Raquel gestures to her navel. \"You're keeping him in your belly button?\" asks Sherry. \"That is so disgusting Raquel. Well, I better get going.\" \"Ja. I'll see you later Sherry.\" Says Raquel. As the two move away from each other you start to loose your balance. \"Uh-oh.\" You say. \"Whoa. Better not fall out.\"</span></div></div>",

You dropped me!\" But at this point Sherry has moved far away Raquel couldn't hear you and Raquel continues to walk away believing you were still safe in her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to do something to get Sherry to notice you and take you back to Raquel so you jump up and down and in your panicked state, you even rub on her belly button and kiss it. This was an interesting situation. You had fallen into the navel of a giant tigress and wanted to be in the navel of a giant rhinoceros girl. What was it about anthro girls carrying you in their belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you keep making a commotion in her navel, your chubby tigress ride starts rubbing her stomach and gives a confused face. \"That's funny,\" she says. \"I feel like somebody is crawling all around my body. Ouch. Man, my navel sure is itchy.\" Sherry then fingers around in her navel and you have to dodge her massive finger to avoid being squishy. \"Ah!\" you yell as the tip of the claw almost touches you. \"Huh?\" asks Sherry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill Sherry realize you're in there?</span></div></div>",

Your new anthro roommate was a purple skinned tyrannosaurus girl with black stripes on her body and bright green eyes. Unlike other female anthros (even the reptilian ones) she was bald. She was muscular and was wearing cargo shorts with a tanktop that showed her large abs and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to walk away by the T-Rex girl lifts you up and then she exhales and shows her monstrous teeth. \"You're Alan right?\" You just flinch and then look up at the T-Rex girl. \"Please don't kill me,\" you say. \"I didn't want to run into Sapphira.\" The tyrannosaurus then realizes what you're worried about. \"I get it, you're lumping dinosaurs in with dragons. We're different species. And I'm not going to hurt you for the Sapphira incident.\" You stop flinching and look up to see the T-Rex was smiling and had sincere eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Tiana,\" she says. \"And I'm actually glad you got rid of Sapphira.\" \"Y-You are...\" Tiana nods her head. \"My father worked for Omnipol,\" she says with a sad look on her face. \"He was selected to infiltrate Sapphira's gang. Sapphira's goons consist mainly of mythical or dinosaur anthros so he was the perfect choice for a spy. He spent two years undercover sending Omnipol as much information on Sapphira as he could. But Sapphira got wise to my father's true allegiance after a while and she was furious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiana actually shows tears in her eyes as she wipes her face. \"The next day we received his ashes.\" You give a look of sympathy. \"I'm terribly sorry for your loss Tiana.\" Tiana gives a sigh. \"I'm just glad somebody finally put Sapphira behind bars. She'll get life for her crimes and dragons can live for a very, very long time. Come on, I'll show you around Zoonova.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiana places you in the center of her snout before walking forward. You were relieved that she wouldn't hurt you. You guess dinosaurs and dragons aren't as close as you think and Tiana was more than happy that you got rid of the criminal who killed her dad. And to think, you put away a monster that could turn the king of the dinosaurs into cinders. It's almost a scary thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Tiana take you?</span></div></div>",

That griffin anthro Topaz is viciously attacking a tiger anthro while a monitor lizard anthro cop is holding up a shield to block the flame attacks of a phoenix anthro. One tank fires at Sapphira's second in command, a giant red furred unicorn anthro only for her to catch the missile on her horn and swing it back, blowing up the tank and several others. A jet comes down at the unicorn and shoots at her but it only takes a clap of her hands to crush the jet like a mosquito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the police are not without victory as you seen a giant lioness cop quickly overpower a pegasus anthro and render him unconscious before jumping on Topaz and slamming her head into the ground. This lioness then growls and slashes a female cerberus anthro in the middle face to make her growl loudly. Then the lioness grabs her by the necks on the sides and tosses her into the unicorn to knock them both down. \"No mercy!\" yells the lioness. \"Hit them with everything!\" In no time at all, gunfire is on the evil gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure you had better get to a safe place. Unfortunately for you, you hear stomping and realize that that isn't exactly an option. You look up to see Sapphira herself walking forward with eyes of pure rage. You were the only one who knew about the attack so she immediately realized who called the police. A tank tried to hold her back but she knocked it away with her tail. The humans inside tried to run away but Sapphira's flame breath made quick work of them and then she flew forward and as you tried to run, that massive dragons lands with a boom in front of you and looks down at you as she surrounds you in a circle of fire. \"You little rat!\" she yells down, nearly deafening you. \"How dare you call the police! Nobody double crosses Sapphira!\" You let out a scream as Sapphira breathes down more fire at you and you're forced to run between her thunderous legs to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphira angrily flaps her wings and flies after you as you run like you've never ran before. Sapphira was out for blood and you knew it as she kept spewing fire. Of all the anthros she could've been, why did she have to be a freakin' dragon?! Even with her immense weight she could fly faster than a jet and if she caught you, you'd be begging to be killed.</span></div></div>",

Sapphira watches in anticipation and even takes out an apple to roast with her flame breath as a snack as she watches the torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Topaz viciously jams the screwdriver at the table and misses you, but not by much. You're horrified but you don't scream until Topaz nearly screwdriver's you in the junk. She lets out another evil laugh before slowly lowering the screwdriver over you. You scream as she presses it into your chest and you even cough. Sapphira simply watches as she eats her apple. \"Just wait an hour and he'll be ready to talk.\" \"Boo!\" yells Topaz with a grunt. Sapphira lets out a groan. \"Fine. Three hours.\" Topaz lets out a laugh and you begin to sweat as she then presses the screwdriver against your chin and makes you cough. She presses it down and you nearly choke. This was horrible. Topaz got to torture you for three whole hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you're going to suffocate when Topaz lifts up the screwdriver, all while laughing like a lunatic. Why was she pulling her weapon back now? That didn't sound like something a torturer would do. Then it hit you, Topaz was only getting started.

When you looked up at his face though you didn't see any ill intent in his golden eyes as he then began to walk down the sidewalk. While he did this you then saw a large bag that was slung over his shoulder which made you wonder exactly what this giant feline had planned for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you cleared your throat and attempted to make conversation with the anthro as you said, \"Okay, I don't mean to pry or anything. But where exactly are you taking me? Of course if you don't want to tell me that, then could at least tell me your name?\" You then placed your right hand onto your chest when you added, \"Here I'll start. My name is Alan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I could explain a few things. Firstly my name is Hank, and it's nice to meet you Alan.\" The panther told you, before you were brought closer to his face. You then heard him purr a little while he continued with, \"Secondly you should know Alan that I'm a gay male stripper who is heading to a party to put on a private show. And I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing what the muscled giant did for a living made you blush as you let out, \"You're a stripper? But....what could I do to help you during your performance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's simple. I need you to become a part of my act.\" He told you, which only made your blush even darker. He then kept on going with, \"Because you see a friend of mine who is also a human was suppose to help me out with this as a favor. But he sadly got really sick and couldn't come today.\" You then saw him wink at you before hefinished his explanation with, \"But when I saw you I knew that you would be prefect to take his place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, um what exactly would I have to do?\" You asked, as you tried to regain your emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but that's the best part because you won't have to do anything. All you have to do is let me rub you up against my muscled body from top to bottom.\" Hank stated, which made your eyes widen once more. However, the panther saw this and quickled you reassured you, \"But don't worry you're in good hands since I've done whit routine with other humans tons of times.\" You were then brought right up to his lips before he added in a whisper, \"And once my job is done then I promise to thank you for helping me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....okay, I'll help.\" You let out, before you were suddenly pressed up against the giant black lisp of the panther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused your eyes to widen in shock as you weren't expecting the heavily muscled cat to do something like this. However, the kiss didn't last long and after he had pulled you away from his lips he told you, \"Thanks, Alan. I promise you won't regret it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure. N-No problem.\" You stuttered, as you tried to recover from being kissed by a giant male anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once Hank had reached the place where his private gig was taking place you couldn't help, but wonder how this would turn out in the end.</span></div></div>",

Alssaya gasped happily and brought you into a big hug, gently squishing you between her considerable breasts.<br>\r\n\"Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you sssssoooo much!\" as the cute snek nerd gave you a kiss, stopping in mid-smooch as she realized what she was doing. Beet red, she pulled back, little line of saliva still attached to your cheek from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... sssssorry about that.\" she said, whimpering a bit. You wiped the surprisingly pleasant smelling slobber off.<br>\r\n\"Perfectly fine.\" you reassured her, kissing her thumb in response, sending pleasant happy shivers through her body. \"What time?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time what?\" asked a perplexed Alssaya, almost delirious from excitment, before remembering the conversation. \"Oh... 7-7-7-7-7pm?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"7pm works.\" you reply. Your would-be macro girlfriend gives you another quick peck before gently setting you back onto the ground. She sheepishly waggled her fingers at you before turning around and slithering off, a noticeable 'bounce' to her movements as she went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered if Meena had something to do with this. She had mentioned Alssaya's feelings for you in passing, so it's entirely possible she finally managed to convinced the naga-esque snake anthro to give it a shot. You also wondered where the two of you were going tonight.... you decided it was best to go prepare yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your mind briefly flashed back to the news, more specifically, the anti-anthro rally going on in the human side of town. You grimaced slightly in disgust at the thought. The mayor was always trying to get the anthros out of the town, by any means necessary. You have no idea why some people still vote for him to lead the town. You've even had a conversation with the man before. One of the most bigoted, angry, and dim-witted man you've ever met. Overall, it was a very unpleasant chat. It was right before you had moved into the anthro side of Coalton Shores, and he was trying to win votes. You argued that the anthros were no harm, and they were very peaceful for a majority of them. He simply glared at you, called you a dope-smoking, hippie-creating, giant-loving idiot and took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was almost four years ago, and now he was at it again to get the giant beings out of the small community. With a sigh, you got in your car drove off to the other side of town to see just what was going on with this rally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrived, you were greeted with various hate signs that said 'NO ALIENS WELCOME' or 'GIANTS GO HOME', or your favorite 'ANTHROS WILL BRING ABOUT THE END TIMES'. You stepped out of your car to a crowd, mostly older folks, surrounding a stage, Mayor Bloomberg in the center of it, screaming angrily. When wasn't this guy red in the face?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Anthros are stealing all of our supplies! Soon, nothing will be left for us humans!\"You heard him say as you reclined in the very back of the crowd. You rolled your eyes. The anthros were too big to even use any of earth's resources, that's why they bring their own from their home planet. Hell, they've even helped restore some of environment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eventually, all the air in our atmosphere will be gone because they've sucked it all up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the anthros technology helped with that. While on our planet, they barely need to breathe at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about all the help they've given us!\"You shout out above the crowd. Bloomberg furiously looked around for whoever called out such blasphemy.\"There hasn't been any military conflict on earth for over a hundred years! Our oceans are clean, our air is fresher! Plus, they're really nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's saying that?!\"He screamed. The crowd parted to reveal you in the back. You had hoped to remain hidden, but at least the spotlight was shared. Bloomberg's eyes narrowed at you.\"Alan...the giant lover who lives on <i>their</i> side of town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Sup?\"You casually wave at him with a big ol' shit-eating grin.</span></div></div>",

In fact, multiple shadows, bathing the entire human area of Coalton Shores in the darkness of the giant anthros towering over it. You, along with the rest of the tiny humans down below, looked up to see a group of maybe around five to six anthros looking down at you all, their collection of toes and paws and claws towering over the puny buildings as gigantic walls that went beyond the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne anthro knelt down as slow as she possibly could, knowing that any sudden movement from her could destroy this portion of the town. She was an eagle anthro, and she seemed nice enough despite her piercing eyes and shark beak. She kept lowering herself until her massive, miles-spanning face was directly above, her expression gentle yet firm.\"Humans,\"She greeted the majority of the group.\"Mayor Bloomberg,\"She turned to him next, his cowering form shivering as her eyes fell upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know there are many reasons you have gathered here today. But I assure, we are no threat to you humans. I am Hilda, one of the locals that live in the neighborhood across town. Notice the word 'local'-I've lived here and grown up in Coalton Shores along with the rest of you. Heck, I even went to school with some of your kids.\"She giggled slightly, still not alleviating the fears of the bigoted below. You did recall that her face was familiar, as were the other anthros around. There was a multi-special school just out of the way of town, and you had attended it growing up in your earlier years before your parents moved you into a human school once you got into high school. Hilda was one of your classmates way back when.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can do to make you feel better about us?\"Hilda pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off our fuckin' planet!\"One brave anon from within the crowd yelled up at her, only for the rest to follow with raised fists and a \"Yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda only rolled her eyes, followed by a small sigh that threatened to blow everyone away.\"We come in peace, humans, to protest your...protest against us.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Mayor Bloomberg could say anything to you, there was a sudden quake. \"What's going on.\" \"Anthros.\" Muttered the mayor with venom in his words. Of course, it didn't sound like one anthro, it sounded like three and that was the least of your problems. Suddenly flames erupted from the walls. \"Fire!\" one of the guards yelled. Everyone begins to panic and in the process of the frantic running, Mayor Bloomberg is knocked down, more angered than before and you can tell he's blaming this on the anthros. You could only stand in fear because you realized that it might just have been anthros that set this fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly remember something. A town not too far from Coalton Shores was destroyed by fire. It was believed the fire was caused by terrorists, namely a particularly nasty one by the name of Sapphira. Sapphira was the most dangerous anthro on Earth and Zoonova. She was a huge blue dragon anthro who despised humans utterly and didn't appreciate anti-anthro humans like Mayor Bloomberg. But as bigoted as the mayor was, Sapphira was even worse when it came to humans. Unlike most anthros she'd snuff out any humans she say on the spot. You even heard a rumor that she ate humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone is panicking through the fire and tried to run out the door. However, they stop in their tracks as the ceiling is torn off and they see the silhouettes of two giant anthros. The first is a large figured unicorn anthro while the second appears to be a griffin anthro. They were both female in appearance. Everybody steps back as the griffin laughs evil. \"Run humans,\" she mutters in a feral tone. \"Humans hate. Kill humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two characters were minions of Sapphira. The griffin was called Topaz and she was the main muscle of Sapphira's gang. She knew how to torture and pulverize humans in ways too grizzly to describe and enjoyed her heinous work a lot more than she should've. The unicorn was called Ruby and she was Sapphira's second in command. She didn't get that position by being Sapphira's girlfriend alone and she was a lot more dangerous than you'd expect of a unicorn. Her horn was bright red, possibly painted with human blood. Both of those titans look down with evil intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTopaz laughs wickedly as Ruby stomps forward. One of the guards takes out a gun and foolishly tries to shoot at Ruby, but at Ruby's size, the shot was barely as bad as a mosquito bite. Ruby turns to the guard who shot her and the guard twitches before trying to run. Ruby simply reaches down and grabs hold of him as he screams. \"Oh yeah,\" says Ruby. \"Shooting at a 10,000 mile high unicorn. That's real smart.\" You watch in pure fear as Ruby tosses the guard screaming into her mouth and you hear the sounds of crunching. These anthros weren't like the neighborhood anthros who were all so friendly. These two were real monsters. The scariest part was that you hadn't even seen Sapphira yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, even in the face of certain doom, Mayor Bloomberg just has to be an asshole to anthros and as he gets up, he shakes his fist at Ruby and Topaz. \"You miscreants! You anthros have proven my point! You're big destructive monsters that have no business being on Earth! Go back where you came from!\" Topaz lets out a grunt and lowers her hand. She flicks her fingers and sends the mayor across the room. \"Loud bug,\" she mutters. \"Flick! Flick!\" \"Anyone else want to say anything?\" asks Ruby as she lowers her head down. Ruby even licks another guard to make him freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, as those two monsters were corralling the humans who came to the rally. You were able to hide behind a curtain. As Topaz and Ruby are busy, you decide to sneak out of the town hall and run like heck. As you're running, the only thought on your mind is to get the police to settle this. Unfortunately, you hear stomping and one of the terrorists appears in front of you. You're almost terrified to look up and see who it is.</span></div></div>",

Those blue scales, that large yellow underbelly, that long red hair, there was no doubt that this was none other than the infamous dragoness terrorist Sapphira. She hadn't see you yet, but you could see her eyes glow bright red as she continues to breathe out red fire as she turned to the other humans who were looking in pure fear. \"Wretched creatures,\" she said. \"You have a lot of gall, all of you. You badmouth creatures that are practically gods to insects like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphira steps forward and you jump aside as the dragoness nearly squishing you before you duck underneath her large tail. \"Topaz,\" says Sapphira. \"Ruby. Is this the one?\" Sapphira asks this as she points to Mayor Bloomberg and Topaz nods her head as the mayor is getting up and lets out a cough. \"Anthros are nothing but titanic monsters, and you, you're the worst of them all. There's a reason that we don't have dragons on Earth anymore. Creatures like you belong in fairy tales and nothing more.\" Sapphira just lowers her head and opens her mouth to breath out smoke in the mayor's face as well as the face of everyone else to make them all cough loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphira then grabs Bloomberg with you watching. She pins him to the ground with one of her claws as he screams in pain. Sapphira gives a malicious grin. \"You should watch that mouth of yours. Whether you be a mayor or a king, any human is a mere ant to Sapphira.\" Sapphira then decides to torture Bloomberg by pressing him against the sole of her titanic foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get somewhere and call the cops while the terrorist were busy. But can you make it before Sapphira notices you trying to run from the rest of the human captives.</span></div></div>",

You'd think a dragon, a unicorn and a griffin would stick out like three sore thumbs even on Zoonova. But that was the main motif of Sapphira's gang, they were either mystical animals like phoenixes and pegasi or extinct animal anthros such as dinosaurs and as far as you knew, none of the dinos showed up. Only Sapphira and her two top officers were here in one place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make sure none of the other humans got any ideas, Sapphira breathes out a ring of fire around them and lets out a growl. \"None of you insects better call the police,\" the dragoness snaps. \"Or you'll only make the end all the more bitter.\" As much as you hated Mayor Bloomberg and the people at the rally, you had to find help and make it to the police station. They recently started recruiting anthros in case any of the giants went rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fast as your legs can take you, you run further into town to warn everyone of Sapphira's rampage. This dragon was the most dangerous beast on both world and even other anthros feared her. But this was no time for fear. Lives were at stake.

You try to run but trying to get away from a 10,000 foot tall anthro was completely pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby grabs you by the leg and you gulp as she takes you in front of her face in front of her huge snout. You see her smiling wickedly as she shows her huge teeth big enough to chew apart entire human cities. \"Look Topaz,\" she says. \"It seems we have ourselves a runaway.\" Topaz lets out a laugh as she opens her wings. She flies around the other humans at the rally to make sure none of them try to escape and moves as high up into the air as her griffin wings can take her as everyone looks in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Topaz was the least of your worries now because Ruby had you in her grip and she enjoyed it. \"Now don't do anything rash Ms. Ruby,\" you say nervously. \"I actually like anthros.\" Ruby lets out an evil laugh. \"Oh yeah? What were you doing at an anti-anthro rally then?\" She had you there. Even though you only came to the rally to mock it, an evil anthro like Ruby would never believe it. Even if she did, she'd still pulverize you for being a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ruby lets out a sigh as Topaz continues to terrorize the humans who came to the rally. \"Too bad Sapphira isn't here yet. I just hate it when that girl keeps me waiting. If only I had something like I dunno, gum to occupy myself.\" You don't like where she's going with this and then she points her horn dangerously close to you, cutting your cheek and making you bleed. \"Too bad I don't have any gum,\" says Ruby with an evil look. \"Put I still have something small to play with in my mouth. Maybe if you're good, I won't swallow you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're sweating heavily. It was considered the worst crime for anthros to eat humans but Ruby saw no problem with that taboo and she was supposed to be a vegetarian given her species.

You didn't know if she was planning on eating you, but you do not want to stay around to find out. You try to grab onto her airport sized taste buds to try and hold on, but the tongue is too slippery with Unicorn saliva and you tumble down as Ruby snaps her teeth shut, nearly taking your legs off in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're standing on a tooth bigger than a skyscraper. It's a flat herbivorous tooth, but it's still scary. You had never been in an anthro's mouth before. An anthro could swallow you whole and not even notice at your size difference. But Ruby could still detect you. But the trouble was only going to get much, much worse because Ruby presses her tongue on top of you and pins you to her teeth. You grunt in pain as her tongue viciously licks your back. From her grunts, you could tell she was enjoying your taste. She then takes off your shirt and pants with her tongue as you scream. \"Hey!\" you yell. \"Stop...AAA!!\" Ruby licks your chest next and you cough as you actually swallow some drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that still isn't it and then Ruby tilts her head back and forth, causing you to be pushed through her mouth like a piece of candy. Ruby laughs as she does this. \"Humans are so adorable when they scream,\" she says to herself. \"I might just keep you in there forever.\" This was a nightmare. \"I give!\" you yell. \"I give! Just spit me out! Please! Have mercy!\" But would one of Sapphira's top enforcers show you even a shred of mercy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby is thinking it over as the giant unicorn continues to play with you in her mouth.</span></div></div>",

So a nice temperature should be on the schedule today.\" she replied, sounding like she was right THERE in the room. Chuckling you headed over the food replicator, to have some breakfast. As you walked over, Shiari sent you images and numbers and statistics about your health, as well as suggestions for what to eat to stay healthy.

You simply tried to think about stuff like Baseball, and not the planet's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan... you aren't the first person to oggle me. Trust me... it's not like the things going on... you know... down South.\" came Shiari's voice. That made your brain stop as you contemplated what she meant. \"Yes... exactly. VERY awkward.\" added the celestial simian. She could sense your heart racing, your blood pumping, and a certain area of your anatomy 'growing'. A light rumble jostled your world. Shiari was giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't know you were such a fan.\" she mused. Somehow you knew she was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry... just... umm...\" you stammered out, trying to change the subject. Some more slight quaking came. \"You need me to leave you alone for a few minutes? Take some time out in the Holo-Shed?\" she joked, trying to calm you down. She could sense this wasn't working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could sense her sighing. \"Alright... don't tell anyone about this. ok?\" ordered the voice in your head as you suddenly felt an overwhelming sensation come over you. Before you knew it... you were unconscious. Thankfully you were able to sit in a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself in a black misty expanse. The floor felt soft... like a big cushion. Like... a hand. Bug-eyed you turned around, and there was Shiari, holding you in her hand. She was still gigantic, but at a more viewable height. If you had to guess you'd say she was probably about 200, maybe 300 feet tall. She was naked, as usual, but now he had the perfect view of it all... no weird dust mite-perspective \"You're in my mind Alan. This is an astral projection of myself. Hope you don't mind the continued difference in size. Kinda busy with everything else, so this is as small as I could get.\" You replied that you didn't mind one bit, but asked her why you were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple... you had a Shiari-sized itch to scratch... and I figured... why not help?\" replied the simian goddess as she gently leaned down and kissed you with her immense lips. She was big, and powerful... and beautiful. She could sense your attraction, your excitement, and smiled down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what now?\" she asked, smirking.</span></div></div>",

And, unfortunately, it is not just possible, but also very real.\"<br>\r\n\"Give it to me straight. How bad is it?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, that's the thing.\" She started. \"I can't tell how bad it is, because my calculator is broken, and the numbers involved are just too massive otherwise. But, I was able to figure out what it was that Sapphira used to make her formula.\"<br>\r\nSomething told you that it wasn't something good. \"What did she use?\"<br>\r\n\"From what I was able to tell, the formula she has is very diluted. We're talking one part per billion here, so very small, and she has used a very rare and powerful reagent. So powerful, in fact, it was all gathered up, and launched into the far reaches of space. Or so we though.\"<br>\r\n\"How powerful is the thing?\"<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that it is capable of making her grow. In fact, if my assumptions are correct, she has given many of her associates similar vials. If she did, we are going to have a massive problem. Before you say anything, I mean that they can grow to the size of the largest building with only a few drinks. Every drop adds a percentage mass to the body, and the bigger someone grows the more effective it is. Not to mention the mental effects of it.\"<br>\r\n\"How do you know all this?\" You ask.<br>\r\n\"Let's me say this, our race was a few feet taller than yours when we discovered it. Some wise guy decided to put some of it in all of our water supplies, and that's how we became so big. However, Sapphira was one of the first affected, so she must have kept a sample with her. Otherwise, she would have to have found the capsule containing the reagent. If she did, there's no telling how big they will get. There is only one way to stop this from happening, and that's with a neutralizing compound found only on my home planet.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, you don't mean that\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. What started on Zoonova will end on Zoonova. We must not delay.\" Meena looked over at the timer, seeing it was halfway down. \"I need to call up everyone. We're going to need them.\" She ran off, leaving you with your thoughts. What if Sapphire truly did figure out a growth method? Then both worlds are at stake. We're going to need to act quickly.</span></div></div>",

Sapphira's clothing in particular seemed the tightest, and it was proven true when her shirt ripped in the middle, and showed ample cleavage. Then, they surged out again, putting a lot of strain on their clothing. They began slowly creeping up, and their midriffs exposed themselves. The specially made shoes Sapphira was wearing popped open, then Ruby's did, and Topaz's. Their growth slowed, and stopped, with their clothing still creaking and groaning. Then, without warning, their bodies surged again. Sapphira's shirt ripped more, the very tip of her black bra, before her pants ripped down the front revealing her black panties. Ruby's clothing followed suit, as he butt began to shred her pants, then Topaz's shirt exploded off of her, revealing her far too small, brown bra. Then, their bodies calmed down, and the three just continued to fondle themselves from the lust produced by the growth. The three shuddered again, right before they began growing again. Ruby's shirt began ripping as her boobs expanded out of it, then her pants fell down revealing her blood red panties that were handing on by threads. Topaz was vigorously rubbing both her oversized boobs and her nether regions, as her bra continued to get smaller and smaller on her frame. Her pants ripped off of her with a loud noise, but she didn't care. She just went right on pleasuring herself. But, the biggest growth came from the dragoness. She was holding herself in check, not wasting energy on increasing her horniness, and it was working. Her bra was woefully undersized, as boob flesh was spilling over the top, the sides, and the bottom. Her panties weren't faring much better, as her continuous growth made it tighter and tighter. Then, both articles exploded off of her, as Topaz's bra and Ruby's panties did the same. All three females looked at the camera, as they finished growing. \"Now, about those demands.\" Said Sapphira. She droned on.<br>\r\n\"Alan, we've got a major problem.\"<br>\r\n\"No duh!\" You replied. \"They've got to be about twice as tall as before!\"<br>\r\n\"That's not our only problem.

The more pleasure and horny someone feels, the more they'll grow. Sapphira isn't just playing it clean, she's playing it smart!\"<br>\r\n\"What about the plan?\"<br>\r\n\"We have one of two choices: we could submit to what she's saying, or we could go to Zoonova to stop them for good.\"</span></div></div>",

Another ripping sound could be heard, as the front of her pants ripped, revealing her jet black panties. She moaned more, as she began shuddering. She seemed to be going up, as if she was lifted, but no, she was growing! Her shirt lifted up, exposing her midriff. She was rubbing her breasts now, moaning, as her clothing ripped more and more. Her pants continued to rip, revealing more and more of her body. Then, it slowed down, and stopped. \"A-as you can see, my body has grown much larger than it should be, and I'll tell you now, it was exhilarating. One could get addicted easily.\" She laughed. \"So, ready to succumb to my demands that you puny, insignificant, worthless humans worship us as gods and goddesses, and tend to our every whim, or should I grow some more?

Her fellow Revolutionaries had sent her a sample of the desired growth compound they had planned. First Earth and it's pathetic bugs, and while Zoonova came to their aid, Sapphira's co-conspirators would enact their own side of the plan back on the home world... taking their own samples of the chemical... and overthrowing the ruling council.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of growing beyond mere 50 feet in height made the dragoness antsy, lustful even. She hated humanity, despised how she was supposed to treat such insignificant fodder as an equal when they barely reach the top of her feet. Soon they would be in their proper place... and the 'race traitors' as well would learn how GODS are supposed to be treated as they too will be put down. Oh gods the thought of it was making her so damn horny she could hardly stand it... when her teammate Zipps came bound in carrying a package. \"Sapphira!! It's HERE! It's HERE!!\" stuttered the hyperactive rabbit as he almost slid into his superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fiery glare the dragoness gave him almost stopped his heart as he meekly handed the larger anthro the box. Impatient beyond compare, the leader of this underground movement tore into the package greedily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wrapped in pink paper, very funny guys...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly ripped the paper off. Everyone in the room was silent in anticipation as she looked at the item in the box. Then came the frown... the confused look on their leader's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sa... Sapphira?\" asked Zipps<br>\r\n\"Everything alright?\" asked Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness pulled out a small plastic container, labelled 'Mother Mabel's Food Coloring'. \"WHAT THE FU-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Meanwhile... elsewhere...</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLalonde was so happy today, she was going to have guests for dinner! The cute little Allan from next door, the adorable bat Meena, and Kurt from across the street. She had the roast and potatoes cooking in the crock pot, but was more focused on her centerpiece... the piece de resistance... one of her famous (well... neighborhood famous) pink frosting sponge cakes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the ingredients are very hard to come by... especially in Zoonovian portions. Hard for humanity to keep their giant guests properly stocked on items at times. So she's had to specially order the 'secret' ingredients for the frosting straight from her home planet. Took some effort, but she had gotten it timed perfectly with today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, to be honest, the lovely pink-colored ewe didn't remember said pastry batter looking so... different. It had come inside a glass tube as well, which she had felt was odd. It tasted funnier than she had remembered it too. But alot of food dyes and other chemicals to create that special pink color she loved so much tended to come in different colors than the intended result... so she paid it no heed as she mixed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stirred and whipped the ingredients together, the would-be hostess started to feel odd sensations. Her top began to feel tighter.<br>\r\n\"Mon Dieu!\" She exclaimed in surprise as she looked down, her breasts were already quite large... had she forgotten to drip-dry her laundry again? Then suddenly her chest began to... right before her eyes... expand like balloons. \"Sacre Bleu!!!\" she cried out in shock as her suddenly even more prominent assets inflated and threatened to smack into the bowl she was baking her cake in. Thinking quickly, Lalonde backed up, but soon found out her sexy rear was also expanding... giving the cute sheep a very curvy hour-glass like figure that made her previously sexy body look like bush-league 'olympic swim team' proportions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wat ees go-eeng on?\" she asked, panicking. Then suddenly... the poor Ewe felt a bit of vertigo as the rest of her started growing right in her kitchen. She bumped her head into the ceiling, dropping the growing anthro onto her knees atop the tiled floor, the impact cracking the ceramic. Her apron ripped off her body, exposing her magnificently magnifying mammaries to the fresh air.. leaving the sheep groaning in embarrassment. She had loved that apron too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when it felt as though she was about to fill up her kitchen... the growth stopped, leaving one very frightened... though now slightly aroused Lalonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah dun theenk that was ze food coloring, no?\" sobbed the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could collect herself... maybe call someone for help...</span></div></div>",

To this Meena crawled and squeezed along Lalonde's curvy body to reach the cake in question, wanting to run tests on the icing. This played hell with Lalonde's already extremely aroused/horny state as she felt the bat's hands and feet delicately tickling along her currently sensitive skin and fur. Her face turned a deeper red as she panted and quietly moaned to herself. Vixie noticed this, going a bit bug-eyed as she recognized her friend's... mannerisms... and slowly backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeena sniffed the cake batter and icing, detecting some definite... foreign smells to what she usually expects from a cake. \"Lalonde I might have to,\" spoked up the bat as she turned around... noticing at the last second that...</span></div></div>",

No one else to disturb your worship or deny Her existence. No one to try convince you to worship <i>their</i> pantheon and lead you away from Her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shrine was a small one, but you like to think it makes up for that by using its space well. The entire thing was inside a small cave opening, which you had hidden with a mass of different types of foliage to prevent those who would stop your worship from finding your shrine. A small pool sunken into the floor takes up a fair amount of space - in fact, you are kneeling in the pool at this very moment. A small piece of log, about as long as your forearm and slightly thicker than your leg, is placed at the end of the pool opposite the entrance. Upon the log are mounted several of your most prized possessions - all depictions of Her. Of Her beyond-beautiful cetacean features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small statuette crudely carved out of wood; a lovingly detailed drawing that you had spent many hours on; a small dolphin plush toy, painstakingly  dyed and re-dyed many times over so as to perfectly emulate her colours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a state of religious awe, you clutch the plush dolphin with shaking hands, engulfing it in a crushing hug. You had known about Her for almost as long as you could remember - since early childhood, no doubt. Recurring visions of Her, of your goddess, had been brushed off by your peers as either superstitious nonsense or possible heresy, depending on who you talked to. But you knew that She was real. You had seen Her in perfect detail many times over, Her wondrous form suspended in a sea of tiny globes of blazing light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut She had never noticed you. No matter how hard you prayed, no matter what you tried to earn Her attention for even the briefest of moments, She remained blind to your worship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeizing the carving in one hand while keeping the plushy held in the other, you rest your forehead against it as you attempt to regain control of your breathing, which is coming in short, ragged bursts. And yet, something feels different, somehow. As if something was gently touching the edges of your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Hello, little one.\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare ahead, mouth wide open. She- She had noticed you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"I must apologize for not noticing you until now, little one. It is so hard to hear prayers at my size. even those as fervent as yours. Please, little one, exit your shrine. I will pick you up once you are outside.\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile of pure, dumb bliss on your face, you stumble out of the shrine, heart pumping wildly. Everything seems to go quiet for a second - before a noise like the universe itself roaring fills your ears, and a translucent blue hand plunges downwards from the clouds in the distance, as your vision begins to blacken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Here we go, little one! Make sure to hold on tight - if you can!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">--</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, you clutch your pounding head as you awaken. Your entire being feels scrambled, your thoughts fuzzy and not-quite-there. The sharp, stabbing pains of a migraine assault your head relentlessly. The migraine and strange sensations seem to fade all of a sudden, however, and you realize that you are laying on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground in question is warm. Delightfully so, in fact. And it feels... Rubbery?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes at last, you roll onto your back and sit up. The stormy-grey ground seems to stretch endlessly before you, an infinite plane of rubbery grey skin making up the ground. Above you is what initially seems to be the night sky - but on closer inspection, the pinpricks of stars turn out to be infinitesimally small globes of light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elated smile appears on your face. You're here, with Her; your goddess; your deity. Looking behind you, you gawp as you behold a gigantic iris, many trillions of miles in diameter - if not even larger. You can only see it in its entirety due to its sheer, mind-boggling distance from you. You've been held on one of Her fingertips this entire time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dolphin goddess lets loose a giggle that could destroy the Milky Way through sheer force. <br>\r\n<i><b>\"Well then, my little worshipper, it's a pleasure to meet you face to face.

And She had hinted that goddesses of other pantheons were interested in you, as well. It was almost too much for you to take in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat definitely was too much for you to take in, however, was Her sheer, incalculable size. She was so vast that the tips of Her feathers alone could have swept through the Milky Way and scattered it into dust. So vast that Her omnipresent, gentle crooning alone, was almost causing your mind to buckle from sensory overload.  So vast that the universe itself could - and had - easily fit into any of Her orifices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNix, the Mother of the Night, Matriarch of Ravenkind, Mistress of the Lunar Cycle, and Queen of Darkness, stretches into infinity beyond, behind, above, and below you. Her form exuded a comforting warmth, and Her power kept you insulated from the harmful Void in between universes. Limited human mind too weak to comprehend Her majesty and power, whatever Her true form may have been was being interpreted as an indescribably gargantuan anthropomorphic raven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen She speaks, Her voice rumbles and trembles with raw, undiluted power, and Her claws are so long and so wide that She could hold the entire universe between two of them - possibly without even feeling it. You prostrate yourself, shouting words of praise for the All-Mother until your voice is little more than a hoarse croak. A gentle and appreciative, yet still impossibly loud croon comes from way, way above, and a clawtip capable of giving the multiverse competition in terms of size strokes your form as much as it can with the disparity in size.

A wardrobe and a set of draws contained all the clothes you would need, and a small, strange cube, about three by three by three feet, and with a square hatch on one side, would allow you to clean any clothes you inserted into it. A large cube, about twice your height, contained a matter creation system - as well as a mirror, sink, and shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last, but not least, a sleeping bag.

Gone. I wasn't able to see how or why the Earth is gone, but I was able to save you, at least. And the others were able to save a few dozens humans each - I was one of the last to notice that Earth was gone.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I...\" you stutter. \"How many humans are left?\" Lexi's projection hugs you all the tighter. Her embrace should have, by all rights, reduced to you a fine paste with her strength, but somehow no matter how tight the hug gets, you never feel even the slightest bit of discomfort. Just a loving warmth. \"<b>A few... Hundred...</b>\" Lexi says, sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind seems to go blank. A few hundred humans were all that was left. Head drooping downwards, you screw your eyes shut and push yourself into the construct's soft fur, tears beginning to flow once again. \"<b>Oh, Alan...</b>\" Lexi croons, both from her construct and from her actual body, utterance shaking you slightly. Lexi's construct softly kisses the top of your head as she holds your tiny body against her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping your arms as far around her as you can, you hug the construct, comparatively feeble, stick-like arms encircling her torso as far as you can manage. It takes a while, but eventually the tears stop, and Lexi releases her grip on you, placing another soft kiss on the top of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh,\" you begin, wishing to take your mind off of Earth and humanity's current circumstances. \"Just how big are you, Lexi? And how did you get so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Well, little bro, you see...</b>\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You cannot remember much, but as far back as your memory goes, the giant anthros have always been around. They arrived on earth long before your own time from a planet entirely inhabited  by the titanic beings, their homeworld known as Zoonova, and they've used their highly-advanced technology to exist somewhat peacefully beside the human race. People like you have come to accept them, seeing that you live in a neighborhood where a majority of the residents are these furries and some are your friends, but others revile them for simply existing, even though these gigantic creatures could conquer earth in less than an hour's time. Fortunately, most of them are quite peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Alan, a pretty simple guy, living a simple life in the small town of Coalton Shores, a mining community. Let's see what happens with these massive beings around you, shall we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nThe Cast<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Humans</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan: The main character, you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin: One of your few friends that share a species with you. You don't see him much now that you've moved to the anthro neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally: Another friend, but you do see her occasionally. The only other human who lives with the giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayor Bloomberg: Incredibly crotchety and ill-tempered, the mayor does everything in his power to discriminate and subject the extraterrestrial visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Your Neighborhood</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeena: Your next door neighbor, a petite(not relative to you), cute batgirl. Has dark grey fur, usually wears wide rimmed glasses for her bad eyes. She's incredibly shy, even towards you. Usually wears lots of fan t-shirts for videogames for television shows, seeing as how she has geeky interests in those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixie: Lives in the house across from you. A curvaceous fox woman. You don't really talk to her much, but she's friendly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReggie: Short for Regina. An incredibly hyper hyena woman that lives a few houses down. Always has rainbow streaks running through her mohawked hair, a couple piercings dotting her face, and a wild grin wherever she roams. She actually thinks you're a pretty cool guy, and she's invited you a couple times to watch her band play. You've never actually gone, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLalonde: You think she's french, if giant anthros from outer space could be french. A sheep girl with tinted pink wool(possibly dyed), and incredibly curvaceous and busty at that. If she were to be measured in human standards, you believe she'd be an H-cup. You think she's nice, and she finds all humans absolutely adorable to their small size. This leads to her treating you as a toy instead of a person sometimes. Usually wears really skimpy stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaxter: Arctic Wolf. You're not on good terms with him. The guy holds a grudge against humans for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Around Town</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty: A pudgy, if not cute cowgirl with a large chest that nearly matches Lalonde's. Runs the local supermarket. Cheery, hard-working, and southern to the bone. Usually seen in work jeans and something plaid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan: Husky. Works at the video store that you visit frequently. He doesn't particularly like you considering that you return all of the movies late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily: An odd, gothic catgirl with soot-colored fur. You see her wandering around town all the time, but you never speak to her, and she never speaks to anyone. Always has her massive black leather boots on, some tight jeans, and a black hoodie that blends into her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>From Out of Town</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphira: A massive dragoness, bright blue in scale color, possibly a European dragon, also known as both planet's most wanted anthro terrorist. Known to crush entire human cities in an afternoon, it's a mysterious how she's avoided being caught for years. Leads a group of Anti-Human Anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nThe Rules<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n1. Have fun.<br>\r\n2. The basic rules for my other stories. You read them? You should know. If not, check 'em out, or even message me.<br>\r\n3. Giants are allowed, I suppose...<br>\r\n4. These creatures are to be HUGE. A mile tall is the bare bones minimum for their height.<br>\r\n5. This story is to be told in 2nd person perspective, as in 'you'.<br>\r\n6. No ending the story, 'kay?<br>\r\n7. Feel free to add characters!</td>",
