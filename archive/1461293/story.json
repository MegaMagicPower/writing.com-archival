After several failed inventions he need this one to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack watched the clock then saw the bus pull up and all the kids getting off. Alex was 16 and hated riding the bus, he was always bugging Jack to let him use his car. Something Jack was not ready to let his son do. Mainly because it made him feel old. His little boy is growing up and getting so big. He actually was about 3 inches taller than him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Alex tossed his backpack to the floor then kicked off his ratty old slip on vans. <br>\r\nHi son, how was school? He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarley making eye contact Alex just shrugged and replied \u201cLame, as usual\u201d and turned to walk to his bedroom. <br>\r\n\u201cHey hold up there, I want you to help me with something\u201d Jack announced. <br>\r\nAlex stopped and sighed. \u201cCome on dad I just wanna go play my video games\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cJust give me 10 minutes, Please???\u201d Jack implored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSigh, fine\u2026.\u201d And Alex turned around. <br>\r\nHis dad handed him what looked like a smart phone. \u201cThis is my new invention and if it works I want you to be the first to see it work\u201d<br>\r\nAlex laughed, \u201ca think this one is actually gonna work?\u201d He liked taking down to his father. Teenage attitude is what Jack chalked it up to. <br>\r\n\u201cHere I already entered in the commands, I just need to you push the Activation button, the green one\u201d <br>\r\nAlex looked down at the device and on the screen saw the words \u201c3 inches+pliable\u201d He looked at his dad \u201cWhatever\u201d he reached out his hand and pushed the green button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his sons eyes, he saw his dad start to shrink. Smaller, and smaller and smaller until he stood no taller than 3 inches tall on the floor. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?.......No way !!!........\u201d He took a step forward. <br>\r\nJack looked around then at himself. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it worked !!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked up at his son smiling down. \u201cSo what do you think? Cool huh?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cTotally\u201d he said. Then crouched down for a closer look. \u201cthis could be your bet invention yet\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack proceeded to tell Alex how it work. Then started to immediately regret his decision to do so seeing the look on his son face. He could see the wheels turning in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm ok, Alex, so lets get be back to normal, I just needed to know it worked\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm no so fast pops, Maybe you might have to stay small for a while, this could be fun\u201d <br>\r\nJack demanded he return him to normal but that did not go over well\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He licked Bobby since he was a kid but pretty responsible for his age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back home he told Bobby he had a surprise for him <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby dawned a smile and asked \" Is it a puppy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack broke the news that no it was not a puppy. Bobby frowned but was still mildly excited knowing there was some sort of surprise waiting for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the house he dropped hi backpack to the floor by his feet. Jack looked down. \"Bobby your STILL wearing those old slip on vans?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are my favorite Pop\" he replied. \"Now where is my surprise?\" He asked looking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Jacks pocket, he pulled the remote and handed it to Bobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to help me test my newest invention. Its kind of like a shrink ray we saw in that sci-fi movie the other night\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby raised an eyebrow \"HAHA Yea right\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack to the remote and showed him, \"Here look, if we put in the commands here, (he typed in 3 inches Pliable)  then handed the remote back to Bobby. <br>\r\nTaking a few steps back he said \"Now press the Green Button\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby smiled, shrugged, then pressed the button, sure nothing was going to happen. A beam of light shot out from the remote hitting Jack and enveloping him in a flash of light. When the flash disappeared, so did Jack.....we kinda. He was there, just down on the floor, considerably smaller than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were Both in disbelief. \"NO WAY !\" Bobby said taking a few steps forward planting his foot right in front of Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked up to see Bobby's hand reaching down.
