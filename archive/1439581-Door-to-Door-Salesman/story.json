In all his enthusiasm to sell newspapers, he hadn't given any thought to the neighborhood where he had been assigned.  Now, standing in front of his mother's house, he realized exactly where he was.  This wasn't his childhood home; it was the place his mother had moved when he had gone away to college and she and Erik's father had split up.  He had only been there a couple of times for holidays when he was in school, but still couldn't believe that he didn't recognize it right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last time he had seen or spoken to his mother was ten years ago.  She partly blamed Erik for her divorce, and Erik had never really forgiven her for putting him in the middle of their marriage troubles.  Visits became fewer and fewer, followed by the conversations, and soon years and years had passed without them speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Erik was standing in front of her house.  The lights were on and the familiar Chevy Impala was parked in the driveway.  She was home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do?

You say, \u201cHi, I\u2019m in your neighborhood knocking on a few doors, Mr. Gus, and because you answered your door I have a great gift for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeff isn\u2019t it? I thought you looked familiar. So, you are out here working, are you? I was just about to start me an egg or two for breakfast. You, hungry? I have plenty; I could use the company right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate, and then you remember you didn\u2019t take the time to grab a bite to eat before you headed out the door. You didn\u2019t feel hungry at the time. This is your first day and your stomach was a bit agitated. But now you are ravenous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Mr. Gus, I believe I will join you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eat your eggs and toast, without bacon, and have juice and coffee to drink. Mr. Gus waits to talk with you until you are finished chewing your meal. Mr. Gus knows it\u2019s not nice to interrupt others while they are enjoying a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Jeff, my wife just died last month and I\u2019m having a terrible time adjusting. I get so lonely to talk to someone. I find myself sleeping late and the house is going to ruin. I have no motivation. I enjoy just being with another human being like this. I hope you understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes, sir, I do understand. I don\u2019t know how I would react to the death of someone I loved, but I can imagine it would be pretty lonely and sad. You did the right thing by asking me in. I was wondering though if you have ever thought of going to the local community center. I know they have luncheons week days for a small fee and they help you have others to talk with. My grandma went with grandpa before he died. They seemed happy with it. Now my grandma goes every time she feels well enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I have thought about it but that is as far as it has ever gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom takes my grandma and gets her again when she is ready to come home. You are right on the way and within walking distance if you need encouragement to take that first step. If you are not ready to come home when Grandma is you can always stay and walk home later. How does that sound, Mr. Gus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that sounds like something I might try. It would be better if I could go with someone the first couple of times. Sort of break the ice, you might say. I\u2019m really glad you came in and had breakfast with me, young man. This has been very enlightening. Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to not mention the product because you don\u2019t want to burden the teacher after learning about his misfortune of losing his wife. You grab your demo kit and head for the door. \u201cThanks so much for the nice breakfast,\u201d you pat your tummy and say, \u201cfilling. Thanks again It has been nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou get a late start after that interruption, but you feel much better for having helped another individual in their struggle in life. You put on a nice grin and go next door and give a rap on their door hoping they also ask you in; this time you want a demo from them not a meal and a visit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snotty nosed kid answers the door; a sloppily dressed women looking like the mom type, trailed right behind him. She toted a toddler on one hip and sprouted a cigarette from her puffy lips; the cigarette wasn\u2019t lit. Her hair was up in a wrap but it had escaped its confinement enough so that you can see it\u2019s a dull yellow red color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t mean to stare but can\u2019t help it. You swallow hard and start to turn away saying you have a wrong address\u2026</span></div></div>",

A dog barked ferociously and I heard  a thud as someone rolled off a sofa. A large woman appeared at the door. Out of her mouth hung an old cigarette. She was carrying an ugly-looking baby on her hip and she didn't speak, but barked.<br>\r\n\"Whatever you're sellin', I ain't buyin'.

You recall one of the major rules at the school sales meeting being 'Never EVER enter a stranger's home. Sell at the door and ONLY at the door!' But the grip of the woman's hand was very strong and you dare not try to do anything that'll piss her off. Plus... the way her baby's big red eyes were staring into your soul scared the beejebus outta you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat!\" she practically orders you the moment she lets go of your hand. You complied and sat down on the big soft sofa, gripping your box of chocolates tight. \"Wait right there. I'm gonna put little Joey to bed.\" She left toward the other room with her ugly baby still staring back at you along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so there you were. All alone in the living room of that big scary trailer... you could still hear that stupid dog barking outside. To pass the time, you looked over all the pictures hung along the walls. Mostly pictures of motorcycles. Harley-Davidsons if you had to assume. A couple of pictures of big sweaty hairy guys riding on motorcycles and pickup-trucks as well.... Yep... definitely trailer-trash material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough there were a few that kinda caught your eye. The ones that had the picture of the same beautiful young woman that looked somewhat familiar to you. One was of her posing in front of a big Chevy with her back turned wearing a cut-up top and daisy-duke shorts, one had her riding in the back of a motorcycle with some fat bearded dude in the front, one looked like a marriage photo with her in a silky white bridal gown with a rather slim tall blonde guy as the groom, and another of her french kissing another woman in a darkened bar (that's right. I said WOMAN!)... Looks like somebody had the time of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm... you know something? She kinda looks like the woman who 'politely' invited you into her home! That must be her from years ago! Sure, you gotta admit she didnt quite age badly, but..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about going off on you like that earlier,\" you overheard her calling to you, \"just got out of prison a month ago.\" ...Goody... \"Been there for about 10 years cuz of some b.s. charge I kinda forgot about! Got awfully lonely since then. You know how long it's been since I felt the touch of a man?!\" Oh dear.<br>\r\n\"Uh... um...\" this talk was probably NOT something a kid like you is used to, \"...uh... 10 years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" she shouted at you from the other room, \"it's been about 10 years and 52 days!\" You could hear her blowing smoke from her cigarette in the other room. \"Hope you dont mind hanging out with such a lonely old gal like myself, little boy.\" She finally came back into the livingroom... carrying a big bottle of tequila in her hand. Now youre REALLY sure your school sales meeting warned you about this kind of situation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down REALLY close to you on that couch! \"Y..y...y...youre not old at all!\" you stuttered as you gripped your box of chocolates even tighter!<br>\r\n\"Aw... arent you sweet?\" she grinned at you before taking a BIG swig of her tequila! The strong smell coming from that bottle almost burnt your nostrils! \"*Urp!* Want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...no thanks,\" you answered, \"I'm underage.\"<br>\r\n\"So?\" she simply remarked, \"youre a man, aintcha?! I'm sure a cute little man like you can take it!\" <br>\r\n\"B-B-B-but....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K,  how's 'bout this?\" she then gave you a huge offer, \"if you man up and drink a sip of this stuff... I'll buy that whole box off ya! What do you say?\" She'll buy the WHOLE box of chocolates if you'll just drink a sip of her tequila?! Awesome! But... it looks like some pretty strong stuff. It's smell could knock you out... imagine what it's taste could do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, boy! You a real man? ...Or a little wuss?\"</span></div></div>",
