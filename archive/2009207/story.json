You had bought it for like ten bucks at a local yard sale, the creepy old guy running it claiming it was a copy of Pokemon his nephew hadn't wanted anymore. The only evidence to support this was that 'Pokemon' had been scrawled on the front of where the label usually would have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh at the situation; it was a lot like one of those Pokemon creepypastas you saw floating around on the internet about bootleg, hacked cartridges. What a joke. Grabbing your device, you stick in the cartridge and boot it up. Right as the game begins to load, you feel lightheaded. Suddenly, everything goes black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken, surrounded by a dark void. You can't feel your body. You feel as though your mind is just drifting in space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice rings out, saying a familiar phrase. \"<b>Are you a boy, or a girl?</b>\" You try to respond that you are a boy, only to find nothing comes from your mouth. Even still, the voice seems to understand. Suddenly, you can feel your body return to you, and you can move once more. \"<b>Your journey begins, young trainer. I hope to see you soon enough.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you know, you've blacked out again, only to awaken in an unfamiliar room, dressed like a Pokemon trainer. \"Holy shit,\" you think to yourself, \"I'm in the game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head downstairs, only to be shocked by what you find. You'd been expecting your character's mother, sure, but... well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back in a chair before you was a buxom blonde woman who looked like a pornstar. Even more bizarre was what was eating her out. Between her legs was a tall, slim yet sexy looking anthropomorphic \t<script language=\"JavaScript\"><!--\n\t\tvar notex, thisx, mmove;\n\tfunction showPopNote2(notex, event, thisx, mmove) {  var thisxPosY = $(thisx).position();  var ccTop = 15;  if ($('#Content_Column_Wrapper').length) {  var ccPos = $('#Content_Column_Wrapper').position();  ccTop = ccPos.top;  }  var thisxBot = thisxPosY.top + $(thisx).height(); $('#bigPopNote' + notex).appendTo('#Content_Column_Wrapper'); $('#bigPopNote' + notex).css({'top':event.pageY-ccTop + 15, 'position':'absolute'});  if ($('#bigPopNote' + notex).width() < $('#bigPopNote' + notex).parent().width() - 50) { $('#bigPopNote' + notex).css({'left':event.pageX-50});  }  document.getElementById('bigPopNote' + notex).style.display = 'block';   if (mmove == 1) {  thisx.style.borderBottomStyle = 'solid'; }  thisx.clicked = 0;  }\n\tfunction clickPopNote2(thisx) {  thisx.clicked = 1;  }\n\tfunction hidePopNote2(notex, event, thisx) {  document.getElementById('popnote' + notex).style.borderBottomStyle = 'dotted';  if (thisx.clicked != 1) {  document.getElementById('bigPopNote' + notex).style.display = 'none';  }  }\n\t\t\t\t//--></script><span id=\"popnote15925308851\" onmouseover=\"showPopNote2('15925308851', event,this,1);\" onmouseout=\"hidePopNote2('15925308851',event,this);\" onclick=\"clickPopNote2(this);\" style=\"border-bottom:2px dotted ;\" title=\"\">Pursian</span> <div id=\"bigPopNote15925308851\" style=\"position:absolute;display:none;z-index:200;\" onmouseover=\"$(this).show(); event.preventDefault(); return false;\" onmouseout=\"$(this).hide();\"><div align=\"center\">\n\t<table border=\"0\" class=\"shadowBox\" style=\"margin-top:5px;padding:15px;border-color:#000000;\"><tr><td align=\"left\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.serebii.net/pokedex-bw/053.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.serebii.net/pokedex-bw/053.sh...</a></td></tr></table></div></div>.

Outside, you notice that it seems to be a common trend here. In many places you see anthro Pokemon, all female somehow, many of which were getting intimate with a human.

Good to see you, my boy! Come in, come in, don't mind Candace here. So, it's finally time for you to go out and score with some Pokebabes, eh? Well, there are a few matters to take care of first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, even though you probably already know these things, I'm required to brief you on the basics. You catch Pokemon with pokeballs, and to do so you weaken them through battle or through sex. Pokemon are horny in the wild, but tend not to trust people too much. Once you properly train them, they become insatiable sluts for you to do as you wish with. You can only carry six with you at once. The rest get digitally stored away for you to access later. There are several products that can be used to enhance Pokemon, like the Bust-Up I used on Candace here to get her tits so big. So yeah, think that covers the basics...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, next, I have something to give you.\" He tosses you a pink pokeball. \"If you use this on another human, it will transform them into a loyal Pokemon slut. Candace here used to be my shy, flat assistant until she volunteered to help test it. It's still experimental, so any help you can give would be appreciated. One thing is that it currently requires the other trainer's consent due to legal reasons, so you have to catch them fair and square. I'd suggest beating them in a battle with the loser having to agree to being transformed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, last thing before I give you your Pokemon, I was instructed to give you this.\" He hands you a recording. \"For your ears only.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen to it, and the voice from the void speaks to you. \"I have brought you into this world to live out a fantasy. The only way to escape is to meet me, and the only way to do that is to fuck one of every Pokemon out there. If you succeed, I will allow you to return to your home... or... I will give you power like you would not believe. The choice is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recording ends, and you are left to ponder this enigmatic message. You return to the Professor as he gets out five pokeballs. \"Alright kid, take your pick!\"</span></div></div>",

The Professor handed you the ball. \"Careful with her, she's a wily one.\" He left it at that and turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the ball and shrug, wondering how bad it could be. You click it open and release her, getting a good look at your new companion. She was about your height with decent curves. What was notable about her was that she looked fairly strong, with noticeable muscles in her arms, legs, and stomach. The moment she laid eyes on you, she pounced, tail wagging and a sultry grin on her face. She licks your cheek and lets out a needy whimper, obviously wanting you to pleasure her. You refuse, not wanting to fuck in a public place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis upsets her, and she begins to attempt to strip you anyway, pining you down with her strength. Once she's gotten your pants down, she begins to penetrate herself on it, panting happily as she fucks herself on your cock like a dildo. It occurs to you that the Pokemon that's meant to service you is at the moment technically raping you, but you don't mind; you wanted to fuck her, just not here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, her bouncing causes you both to cum, her howling out in pleasure. You finally get her off of you and scold her for taking advantage of you. Then you caress her and let her know that you forgive her, as long as she behaves from now on. She whines in agreement, licking your face. It's the start of a beautiful relationship between trainer and Pokemon.</span></div></div>",

Gina would suffice. You grab your pokeballs and step out on the first route without once considering where you are. the route is foresty and short but grass patches are abundant enough that you are able to charge into one. the tall grass is taller than your head, definitely able to obscure any number of things. You bump into a body and the world being a game seems to extend the area around you into a clearing giving you plenty of space to see your random encounter. Before you stands a thin and sort blue skinned girl with a blonde hair. She seems oddly thin but quite acrobatic. You reach for your bag and find a pokedex within. \"Thank god.\" You pop it open and scan the girl. \"Oh... a surskit girl! Water will be great to deal with other fire types!. Go Gina!\" You toss your growlithe out onto the field. The surskit seems to grin and disappears with ridiculous speed and she appears behind Gina and blasts her with a oversize bubble she blows from her mouth. Gina jumps back afraid growling. \"And... this is already going great.\" You check Gina's moves on the pokedex. Roar and bite. \"Figures.\" With Roar you can try to get away but with bite you might be able to do some damage.

The surskit girl's eyes go wide and she dives off behind the tall grass, the world returning to its normal dimensions. Gina looks a little stunned but not too bad. Considering you don't know where a pokemon center is you decide it is most prudent to venture on down the route. It's tiny enough you can see the end of it but there is no shortage of grass between you and it. You try to skip through it quick but sure enough right before you make it another encounter begins. This time a metallic girl is found. She seems to be mechanical with claw hands that look like magnets, and a face plate with what looks to be a single eye on it. A quick scan later and it comes back as a Magnemite. This could be a great fight if the game is using Gen 6 type charts, but if it is using anything before then Gina's bite isn't going to be much good. It may be worth running form this battle too until Gina is fully restored.</span></div></div>",

You have her pull off, and suddenly the cum erupts out, splattering her face and chest. She licks herself clean, seeming to love the taste of your jizz.

As not everyone may not know what every Pokemon looks like, please link to a Pokedex entry of it using \t<script language=\"JavaScript\"><!--\n\t\tvar notex, thisx, mmove;\n\tfunction showPopNote2(notex, event, thisx, mmove) {  var thisxPosY = $(thisx).position();  var ccTop = 15;  if ($('#Content_Column_Wrapper').length) {  var ccPos = $('#Content_Column_Wrapper').position();  ccTop = ccPos.top;  }  var thisxBot = thisxPosY.top + $(thisx).height(); $('#bigPopNote' + notex).appendTo('#Content_Column_Wrapper'); $('#bigPopNote' + notex).css({'top':event.pageY-ccTop + 15, 'position':'absolute'});  if ($('#bigPopNote' + notex).width() < $('#bigPopNote' + notex).parent().width() - 50) { $('#bigPopNote' + notex).css({'left':event.pageX-50});  }  document.getElementById('bigPopNote' + notex).style.display = 'block';   if (mmove == 1) {  thisx.style.borderBottomStyle = 'solid'; }  thisx.clicked = 0;  }\n\tfunction clickPopNote2(thisx) {  thisx.clicked = 1;  }\n\tfunction hidePopNote2(notex, event, thisx) {  document.getElementById('popnote' + notex).style.borderBottomStyle = 'dotted';  if (thisx.clicked != 1) {  document.getElementById('bigPopNote' + notex).style.display = 'none';  }  }\n\t\t\t\t//--></script><span id=\"popnote15925308831\" onmouseover=\"showPopNote2('15925308831', event,this,1);\" onmouseout=\"hidePopNote2('15925308831',event,this);\" onclick=\"clickPopNote2(this);\" style=\"border-bottom:2px dotted ;\" title=\"\">link</span> <div id=\"bigPopNote15925308831\" style=\"position:absolute;display:none;z-index:200;\" onmouseover=\"$(this).show(); event.preventDefault(); return false;\" onmouseout=\"$(this).hide();\"><div align=\"center\">\n\t<table border=\"0\" class=\"shadowBox\" style=\"margin-top:5px;padding:15px;border-color:#000000;\"><tr><td align=\"left\"><a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.serebii.net/pokedex-xy/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.serebii.net/pokedex-xy/</a></td></tr></table></div></div> and the popnote tool.<br>\r\n5. No one line posts or \"something else\" options, as they ruin the flow of the story.<br>\r\n6. Rules to how this world works will be given in the first chapter.
