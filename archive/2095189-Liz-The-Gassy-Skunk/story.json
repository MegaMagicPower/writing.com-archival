Her personality was a little more on the hoydenish side, but there was something else that set her apart from the majority of her peers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Liz was born, the scent glands used to create a skunk's signature stink did not develop properly for her. The doctors had told her parents it was not a harmless or serious defect, but that it was rare. This meant, of course, that Liz lacked the ability to produce the potent spray a skunk usually could, but it instead caused her stomach to develop abnormally; it created far more flatulence than any normal fur's ever would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grew up, Liz found herself getting gas more majorly than anyone else she knew; even if she hadn't eaten anything particularly gas-inducing, her belly would swell up like a dirigible; in essence, Liz could never really run out of gas, her digestive system had an almost infinite stock of flatus that would only lessen the old fashioned way: by letting it out naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, growing up a girl with technically endless gas had not been a smooth ride for Liz; when she was very young, she was teased tirelessly by her peers--the nicknames of 'gasbag' 'farticus' 'cheese cutter' among others still remained in the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the years went on, people got used to having a classmate as gassy as Liz; it almost became part of her personality to anyone who knew her, and most people seemed to find it funny rather than offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had a nice, tightly-knit little friend group for a while, who didn't seem to care that their friend farted so often; they actually found it funny, but things were changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time had come for Liz to move on to college, which was in a completely different town. For most furs this prospect was a thrilling, exciting one, but for Liz, it came with a great deal of anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her suitcase to her chest as she briskly made her way down the corridor. She was on her way to her room, where she was going to meet her new roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was of roughly average height for a girl her age; just over 5'5\". She was a little chubbier than other furs, but certainly not <i>fat</i>. The skunk's silky white hair ran down to her shoulders, occasionally tied back into a ponytail but not always - this was dependent on her mood. Her eyes were full and dark blue, standing out on her face above her pert, cute little nose and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular day Liz was wearing a black short-sleeved shirt and pair of blue jeans, fitting tightly across the shape of her thighs and buttocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea who she'd be sharing a room with, but she prayed that they might have an immature sense of humour; that they might find her condition funny rather than disgusting, because if they were going to be sharing a room with Liz for the entire year, finding it disgusting would put a damper on things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she could hold her farts in... For long enough, but it was usually much more uncomfortable to do so, and she didn't want to feel like she wasn't free to do as she pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's <i>okay</i>, Liz,\" she muttered quietly to herself, checking she was standing outside the right dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they'll understand... Just explain you can't help it..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gulped, and held her hand against the worn, cold brass door handle, turning it and entering the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not a large dorm. There was one big room where both beds were placed end-to-end to her left, with a desk and small sofa to the right. The cheap, yellow-tinted White wallpaper ran around all the walls, coming to a halt at the sea green skirting boards and door frames. There were two doorways to the far side of the room; one which seemed to lead to the bathroom, and one to a small kitchen, though from where Liz was standing it seemed like more of a stove and sink than a full kitchen; looks like they'd be reliant on take outs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large window that sat over the beds let in the pale morning light, and as the door opened a shorter, rather skinny vixen turned from the sofa to look at Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this.. Uh, room 17C?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Yeah... You must be... Umm.. Laura? No... Lana?\" The vixen grimaced frustratedly as she tried to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <b>Liz</b>.\" The skunkette smiled weakly, but assuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah! I'm sorry - I'm really bad at names.\" The fox laughed and slapped her forehead self-deprecatingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, really. I am too.\" Liz tried to be as kind and friendly as she could, maybe if she got friendly then her 'condition' couldn't come off as badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit of a shithole in here, I know... They were supposed to give us a TV in here, but apparently ours broke, so now we're gonna have to wait like, weeks to get it fixed, so there's no TV for a while, I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded to the fox's rambling as she set her suitcase down onto what she assumed to be her own bed. The room felt dusty and not completely clean, but in that lack of spotlessness was a sort of cosy charm. \"that sucks, I brought some games and a console with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, by the way,\" Liz turned at the sound of her roommates voice to see a hand outstretched towards her.<br>\r\n\"I'm Morgan!\" The vixen smiled. It was a smile of warmth and accommodating friendliness, but that didn't mean she was going to necessarily be accepting of Liz's gassy nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Liz, as you already know.\" The skunk shook her roommates' hand, giggling along with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! I hope we get on well. I mean, I hope you can survive staying in a dorm with me.\" Morgan chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Liz smirked, \"I hope you can survive staying with <i>me</i>..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only Morgan knew how serious Liz was about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was certainly a girl that brought to mind the words 'dainty' and 'pretty' she had a real natural beauty to her, as far as foxes went, with bright red hair that neatly settled down the sides and back of her neck, and a wide, foxy grin that stretched to the fluffy whites at the sides of her face. She had a few small freckles along the bridge of her nose, beneath her large brown eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer frame was small and cute, more feminine and quaint than Liz's, but not tiny. She wore a light-grey T-shirt with some sort of logo worn away on it, and similarly to Liz, had a pair of slim-fitting black jeans. She had a body that most furs would consider very attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you studying?\" Morgan inquired, patting the seat next to her on the sofa, inviting Liz to sit there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing history. Love all that old stuff, yknow? But, I don't mind a little of the old video games on the side!\" Liz grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, cool, I'm doing art.\" Morgan responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My class doesn't even start till Thursday..\" Morgan complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither does mine. I suppose we can spend the time until then just settling in and stuff.\" Liz felt somewhat pleased she didn't have to get straight into classes or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she'd been in the room, the pressure in Liz's stomach had been accumulating rapidly, and she began to feel cramps. She'd usually have farted by now, and keeping it in was proving to be harder than she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she could try and let out just a little... No, the smell would drive Morgan away for sure..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk's stomach let out a deep, sonorous growling sound, like the sound made by a bath drain when the last slithers of water are running out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright? Hungry or something?\" Morgan inquired softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz wasn't sure what approach to take...</span></div></div>",

Break the ice, in a weird sort of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz stood up from the sofa, looking down at Morgan, who returned with a glance of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok, Liz?\" She asked, completely oblivious to what was about to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk smirked narrowly. \"I'm <i>about</i> to be...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz turned around, facing her plump, jean-clad skunk butt level with Morgan's face, and pulled her large, fluffy tail to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a lip bite and a steady push, the skunkette felt a deep, full fart rumble into her tight jeans, feeling the thick vibration of the noisy, bassy fart lasting for about six seconds: six whole seconds of uncouth, unsanitary skunk flatulence. Most furs would have felt some degree of shame letting rip into someone's face like that, but Liz had done it too many times in the past to care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut it off abruptly - she easily could have held it for a little longer if she wanted to, but she didn't want to subject Morgan to any more torment than she already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz grimaced awkwardly as she turned around to gauge Morgan's reaction...</span></div></div>",

She seemed to have a sense of humour just as silly as her's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my <i>God</i>, that stinks! That <i>absolutely</i> reeks!\" Morgan continued laughing loudly, holding a paw over her nose and coughing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they never exactly smell like <i>roses</i>.\" Liz grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I mean... <b>Jeez</b>, I don't think I've ever heard anyone fart like that before!\" Morgan's laughter died down a little as she got up and went over to the window, pushing it open to let the air filter through a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're gonna have to get used to it. That's sorta.. My <i>thing</i>.\" Liz sat down onto the sofa and laughed. Now she knew her gas wouldn't be badly-received, she was able to be her usual, gassy self, and it felt great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Farting like a fucking <b><i>stallion</i></b>!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda, well, it's a long story... Really.\" Liz flapped her hand dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon. Tell me.\" Morgan sat down on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really not that interesting!\" Liz laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me your 'thing' is to fart like... That!? There's no way I'm letting you get away with not explaining that.\" Morgan seemed genuinely interested, but having told the story many a time before, it was less interesting to Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, OK... Most skunks are born with scent glands in their butts, right?\" Liz pointed between her legs to her furry posterior to exemplify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't really born with any, they didn't develop properly, but I'm still a skunk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like, instead of having a skunk spray, your body just creates mad amounts of gas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prettyyyy muchhh\" Liz laid back into the sofa more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not really much of a long story, I guess, but that's one of the most important things you're gonna need to know about me. I'm practically a fart <i>machine</i>.\" Liz punctuated this point with a small, but very loud fart, which got another laugh out of Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That sounds incredibly difficult to live with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh. I'm used to it by now, really, it's mostly just about how other people adjust to it.\" Liz gave Morgan a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're lucky you've got me as a roommate, I guess. I have the humour of a little kid, I swear; I find farts hilarious!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank fuck! Seriously, it's like a god send that I found somebody like you! Farts are pretty hilarious, they get a bad rep in the comedy world.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded in agreement. \"It's kinda interesting too. I mean, having a roommate with a talent like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz waved her hand dismissively and grinned modestly. \"I'm not sure I'd call it a <i>talent</i>, but thanks.\" The skunk let out another bassy blast of gas, this time for about ten seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Jesus</i>.\" Morgan started up laughing again, scooting close to the window just in case the smell got to her nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just sorta my style by now. Kinda rare finding a girl who openly farts at all, let alone as much as I do.\" Liz chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, I think you fart more than most <i>guys</i> I know, let alone girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shrugged again. \"What can I say? I'm a natural gas producer.\" <br>\r\nShe stood up, cocking her leg and letting out another fart, just as powerful and steady as the ones before it, and just as long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many farts do you have in there? How haven't you run out yet?\" Morgan was genuinely pretty surprised Liz had let out so many farts in such a short space of time, and at that, farts which were consistently loud and booming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's nothing. That's <i>barely</i> scratching the surface.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're <b>kidding</b> me! Nobody has gas like that! No way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz didn't reply verbally, she simply shrugged and turned away from Morgan again, hitching her tail, sticking out her butt, and letting a cacophonous roar of stink rip through her tortured jeans for about twelve unwavering seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my <i>God</i>! Gross!\" Morgan fell over onto her back, back into a fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz laughed along with her, a couple of loose farts popping out, timed perfectly with her cackles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're like a machine! <i>Literally</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz simply bowed, letting out one long, wet fart as she did so, letting it rip up in pitch as she stood back up from the melodramatic bow. \"I try. I try.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna need to stick my head out the window.. It's starting to smell like a friggin' abattoir in here!\" Morgan huffed the cool, fresh morning air, while her skunky roommate sat back onto the sofa again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, hey, guess what..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan turned around. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>still</i> have more gas after that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After All of those? Are you for real!?\" The fox just started laughing again at the mere prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are <i>nasty</i>, girl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nasty and proud.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god... I think my chest needs a rest from laughing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz grinned. \"It's ok, I'll hold 'em in for a bit. I already let more than enough out to feel comfortable.\" She patted her little belly to emphasise this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe you. You're like... Like a never ending supply of gas! If skunk farts could be used as fuel then you could put an end to the fossil fuel problems... Worldwide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz found the idea hilarious. \"And another world over, probably.\" She was starting to get a little show-offy, but it was just her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually kinda curious here. I have so many questions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ask away. I've probably heard most of them before already.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... How long could you even fart for? You were just letting out MASSIVE ones like it wasn't even any effort at all, and seeing as you have so much..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... I've never really found out, not specifically, I mean, I could probably go for quite a long time without pausing, especially on a gassy day... I suppose we'll just have to find that one out, won't we?\" Liz started chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd probably make me pass out if you did that.. Jeez.. Who knew I'd have such an interesting roommate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz felt pretty flattered that she was 'interesting'. Granted, it was in more of a lab rat sort of way than anything else, but her gassiness being met with praise and entertainment rather than scorn and contempt was good enough for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway. We've got, like, all day. You wanna go do something?\" Morgan asked Liz after a moment of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Anything beats sitting around in here all day.\" Liz looked around at the four walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do? The university is pretty much next to the town centre, so there's a lot we could do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz thought for a moment. She wasn't very familiar with the town yet. \"I only just moved here, so I dunno what there is to do round here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's loads!\" Morgan exclaimed. \"Nearby there's a shopping mall, a pretty large food court area... Oh, and there's a movie theatre too! We could go see what's on.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were all kinds of shops to be found and all with sales thanks to the beginning of the university term - and it seems that Morgan knew all of the best ones to go to. The two went to five or six different clothes stores, numerous novelty stores, three jewellery stores of which only one had items that were affordable to the two girls - and even then, at least to Liz it felt as if the two of them had barely scratched the surface of what that mall had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, that may have been Liz's fault. Just because she could hold in the incredible amounts of gas that she had within her didn't mean that she was going to and farts constantly ripped out of her rear end the whole time the two shopped. The fox proved to be a fantastic audience. It wasn't just the unpredictability of when Liz farted or the incredible range of sounds and lengths she seemed to have that cracked Morgan up - it was the reactions that she got from other furs - or at least, those who didn't simply politely ignore the emission. It was how after letting one rip Liz's stink would make an unsuspecting fur cringe after walking right through the 'danger area. It was the way in which her brand new skirt - bought in the very first store they went into - would flap in the gassy winds if Liz decided to unleash a particularly powerful fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Morgan was somewhat self-aware at the attention that Liz was drawing onto herself but Liz's \"I don't care\" attitude was quick to rub off on her, to the point where she was pulling the skunk's finger, making an exaggerated show of plugging her nose after particularly volatile farts and even had Liz erupting in a laughing fit by taking credit for one of the skunk's loudest farts! The skunk's laughing brought with it a flurry of smaller but frequent poots which only made Liz laugh all the harder and had Morgan clutching her sides as well, neither of them able to breathe! The same could have probably been said for those who hadn't vacated the area where Liz's gas hung low and thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Liz's mind that was definitely one of the highlights of that trip out but when the two finally got themselves under control and collected the many bags that they had at that point...another fart, though this time it was from Morgan as she bent over to pick up one of her smaller bags. It had been completely accidental and for now it didn't hold a candle to what Liz could do but it was every bit as hilarious to the both of them and had them giggling for a good few minutes later as slowly the 'blast zone' of Liz's farting started to repopulate with other furs once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly wasn't going to be the only highlight however. When Liz and Morgan would in the future reminisce on the day they first met they would also have fond memories of...</span></div></div>",

The others furs gave them a bit of a look as the fox and skunk started browsing the overpriced clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Morgan..\" Liz grinned, causing Morgan to look over. The skunk had a very expensive handbag, one with a faux leather design, open and held against her furry butt, her tail swaying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, Liz! You can't do that! They'll see us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, nobody's over at this side of the store!\" The skunk laughed dismissively, readying her stance and blasting a very deep, muffled ripper right into the handbag, filling it up with her very own skunky scent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan had to hold on to the wall just to keep herself standing from laughing so hard, hearing the strain of the very muffled-sounding toot rumble into the bag, and it just kept going and going until Morgan was in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like, rumbling the bag!\" Liz laughed, finally cutting off the gaseous assault and bringing the handbag to her nose, taking a big whiff of it before making a disgusted noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck, that's gonna lower the price a bit..\" The skunk grinned broadly, placing the bag back where it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna take weeks for them to get that smell out!\" Morgan pulled Liz's arm, getting her away from the bag before someone saw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered another area of the store, the only fur around was an elderly badger, looking through some suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Liz..\" Morgan tapped her friend on the shoulder. \"The guy's got a hearing aid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smirked. \"Oh, he has, has he? I wonder if he can hear this..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz suddenly let out a loud, trumpety fart into her skirt, Morgan bursting into laughter immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn't even seem to react in any way, which only made the girls laugh even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz comically lifted her leg up to one side and let out another rip; this one was a little longer, but just as noisy, yet the old badger  still made no kind of movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea.\" Liz chuckled, and started walking over to where the man was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's face beamed in disbelief as the skunk began easing out a very long, very deep fart while she walked over, standing next to the man and looking through some shirts, and still letting the fart slowly rasp out the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger still didn't seem to be able to hear her, and Liz winked at Morgan as the fart was STILL going, causing Morgan to literally fall to the ground in hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz bent over, pushing out her fluffy derri\u00e8re in the direction of the man, and still sustaining her behemoth of a fart. She stood there for about another ten seconds, her emission not even lessening in tone or strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz eventually walked back over to Morgan, finishing her lengthy effluvium with a loud quack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls both broke out into even harder laughter - he hadn't even heard it for a second! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Morgan cackled, and as the girls quickly left the area of the store they noticed the old man start to sniff, and retch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one more area of the store that Morgan and Liz knew they had to mess around with; the perfume display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt smelt horrible as they neared it, the smell of saggy old women enveloping the fox and skunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they should name this fragrance 'senile and stinky'!\" Morgan held her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz laughed at the poor joke, picking up a bottle shaped like a flower, getting a strange look from the clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see just how powerful this perfume really is!\" The skunk stated, taking the little bottle and spraying a few puffs of it below her tail, over her skirt and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god Liz, you can't possibly still have gas after that one in there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but I do! See if this smells any better!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz turned her skunky butt towards Morgan, sticking it out as a bubbly, juicy fart croaked from her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sniffed the air, gagging - but it wasn't due to Liz's fart smell, it was due to the overwhelming smell of the perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store clerk gasped in shock, not quite sure how to react to a skunkette ripping ass in her store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, cmon, I know my farts are stronger than that!\" Morgan watched as Liz forced out a collection of several more farts that progressively became wetter and nastier with each one, until the skunk was able to smell her own putrid stench through that of the perfumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! Refreshing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk marched over to them - an old, angry Labrador.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of here! What do you think you're doing!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said get out! That sort of juvenile, disgusting display is not tolerated in here, you impertinent, rude girls! Have some manners!\" Liz and Morgan found themselves physically shoved out of the store, falling outside right on their asses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow..\" Morgan gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that happened.\" Liz said blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause, and suddenly the girls both erupted into fits of laughter, forcing out a small but noisy fart from Morgan which only made them laugh more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do now, then?\" Morgan asked Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. We could keep looking around the mall, or we could go back to the dorm, maybe?\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the girls set off, Liz noticed Morgan was noticeably less excited about headed to the arcade. \u201cSomething wrong, Morgan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, not really. Like I said, I\u2019ve not really been that much of a gamer so I guess I expect to feel a little out of my element, you know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Liz said. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans to make sure you have some fun there as well,\u201d Liz hinted at. As if there was any ambiguity in what she meant, she added, \u201cI mean, my two favorite things are video games and farts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan chuckled. \u201cFrom the sounds of it, you\u2019ve got the same favorite things as a typical eight year-old boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking they were the same favorite things as a typical guy,\u201d Liz said with a small shrug. \u201cThen again, don\u2019t most guys mature somewhere around eight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTouch\u00e9. Oh, we turn right here if I remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk, the girls found themselves in the arcade. Liz looked around to see which games were available. There was a racing game she liked well enough, a couple shooters, a rhythm game with a dance pad... the typical fare. What really caught her eye, though, was the <i>Furious Furs 5</i> cabinets. More specifically, the groups of furs gathered around them. It seemed a group of feline friends mostly around her age were having a sort of impromptu tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat looks like fun,\u201d Liz quietly told Morgan. \u201cC\u2019mon, follow me.\u201d Liz casually strolled up to the gang. \"Hey guys,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" one of the friends spectating the match took his eyes off the screen to greet her. A couple others glanced in her direction, then back to the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just looking for some Furious Furs competition,\" Liz said, stretching casually. \u201cAnyone mind if I play the winner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Someone needs to put this guy in his place,\u201d the frustrated cheetah who was clearly losing the match grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. But I doubt it\u2019ll be her,\u201d the tiger who was winning bragged. Within a few seconds, he delivered the finishing blow, knocking out his opponent. \u201cC\u2019mon, skunky!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d Morgan said as the cheetah stepped away from the player two side of the cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, but I won\u2019t need it,\u201d Liz said with a smirk as she took his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first round was surprisingly easy for Liz, given how one-sided the one she just saw was and she didn\u2019t even consider herself that great at fighting games. She\u2019d play them with friends, but she wasn\u2019t the type to compete in tournaments or anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her character\u2019s victory animation played, the tiger said, \u201cThis time I won\u2019t go easy on you just because you\u2019re a girl.\u201d This fight was more along the lines of what Liz was expecting. It was actually fairly even for the most part. It almost seemed as if they planned to take turns comboing each other, but that\u2019s simply how the match played out. Both players had only a sliver of health left, but the tiger got the last punch in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So it\u2019s going to a tie breaker round,</i> Liz thought. <i>Good.</i> Before the third round started, she turned her head to Morgan and told her only three words. \u201cWatch the timer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the screen, there was a timer. It was usually irrelevant to most matches, given the fast-paced nature of the game, but it was there to prevent things such as stalemates. It started at 90 and if it reached 0, whichever player had the most health left would win the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly leaned in a way that made controlling the game slightly awkward, but her behind was as close to her opponent as possible. Right after the game\u2019s announcer shouted, \u201cFight!\u201d Liz\u2019s behind began blaring its familiar sound. Despite being in the arcade, which was full of loud music and sound effects from various games and the noisy chatter of furs talking with each other, Liz\u2019s fart was clearly heard by everyone gathered around the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger sighed and shook his head once the smell made it his way. It wasn\u2019t exactly Liz\u2019s most unpleasant fart, but it was still enough to be a distraction. When it was clear the flatulent skunk didn\u2019t seem ready to stop anytime soon, the tiger hit the pause button with the timer at 81 seconds. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue when you stop,\u201d he said, putting his finger and thumb over his eyes, clearly looking impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess you forfeit then,\u201d Liz grunted, still pushing forcefully to make it loud as possible. \u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m not...\u201d her fart grew deeper in pitch, \u201cstopping,\u201d now it began to grow even louder in volume, \u201canytime soon!\u201d Liz smirked as she reached over and pressed the button to unpause the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger sighed and tried to play. But Liz wasn\u2019t making it easy for him. When Liz noticed he was playing especially sloppily, she looked over and saw why. The guy was playing with only one hand, the other was over his nose. She took a bit of time beating him. She wanted an excuse to make this one even longer, after all. When she won, the timer was at 64 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>26 seconds and that\u2019s not even counting the time it was paused,</i> Liz thought proudly as she ended her fart. <i>Not bad, not bad.</i> As she and Morgan laughed, she heard a couple of the guys laughing as well. She noticed one of them was the cheetah from before. No doubt he got some sense of pleasure in seeing the guy who defeated him going through something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon guys. We\u2019ll continue this once this place airs out,\u201d the tiger said. He shot Liz a dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ll be waiting a while. I just got here,\u201d Liz said. She lifted a leg and let out a brief, but exceptionally loud fart. It was not only audible over the sounds of the room, but actually seemed to drown out the other noises for the few seconds it lasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the friends cleared out, she saw the cheetah, still chuckling, mouth the word \u201cthanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez, girl!\u201d Morgan exclaimed, \u201cNow <i>that</i> was a good one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Liz said. She wanted to brag about how she could have easily kept one going for the full minute and a half of the timer. But she was still laughing just a bit too hard to form a complete sentence. <i>Besides,</i> she thought, <i>she\u2019ll be even more impressed when I show her what I can do one one of my</i> really <i>gassy days!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now that you\u2019ve scared off all the competition for this game, anything else you feel like playing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz gestured to the game with the dance pads. \u201cMy friends back home liked to watch me play that,\u201d she said. \u201cProbably because between my disorder and all the movement, you know there\u2019s <i>no</i> holding it in for me. So I add my own bass track to the songs,\u201d she said, patting her behind with a playful smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice,\u201d Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe we can play one of the co-op games around here. I mean, I know you\u2019re not that into games, but at least it\u2019d give you something to do.\u201d She left out the part of her plan that involved taking advantage of her gassiness and the close proximity they\u2019d be sharing.</span></div></div>",

I'm intrigued to see how good you really are at it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded, and the girls headed towards the little dance pad. Morgan leant against the metal bars as Liz jumped onto the different colored pads, reaching out to hit start on the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Welcome to Dance Fever!</i>\" an overly-enthusiastic voice came over the speakers. Liz smiled at Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Please select your song!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind if I do!\" Liz tried to find that one song she always used to dance to back home with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we are!\" She selected the song she wanted, standing back and getting into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go.\" Morgan chuckled, wondering if it was a good idea to be this close to the blast zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe song started up; a simple 4/4 techno rhythm with a loud bassy kick. Liz started to move around, slamming her feet down on the right pads at the right time - she had a surprisingly good sense of rhythm, but her real demonstration of this was about to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were a little quiet at first compared to the music, but Morgan could hear that on every kick beat, there was an additional bassy tone. She looked over, noticing Liz's tail crawling upwards like it did every time she needed to fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farts got louder and louder, seeming to sync up with the song almost perfectly as Liz started to laugh and kept stepping down on the right pads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is an especially chunky beat.\" Morgan added, making Liz chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... ugh... know... it!\" She responded between rips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impressive that Liz could fart in time to a beat, this was obviously what she used to do with her friends back before she moved to Anthro city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far none of the other furs nearby had seemed to notice what Liz was doing, but once Morgan was hit by the smell she knew it wouldn't be long before others payed attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz! That actually smells awful!\" The fox playfully waved her paw in front of her face, coughing between laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan watched as Liz hit every single step at the right time, also letting out loud, baritone farts at the right time as well. She was truly talented, even if that talent was rather disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, noticing that a couple of tigers playing a shooter in the next machine over were talking to themselves, pulling their shirts over their noses, and then after a few more minutes realising it was too smelly to even remain there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, you're scaring people off again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of responding to her, Liz simply took the short break in the song to extend her butt out backwards, firing off a loud ripping fart right in Morgan's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gahh!! Liz! That smells like shit!!\" Morgan laughed as she cupped her nose, moving back slightly before Liz gassed her in the face again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" The Liz flashed a grin back at Morgan - clearly it hadn't been an accident at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe song began to speed up, Liz adapting to this new speed with little popping farts coming out from under her tail on every beat, her face was twisted in concentration as she tried to land every beat - both with her feet and her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was in complete hysterics, wiping a tear from her eye as another group of people gaming headed over to complain about the smell. Liz's control over her butthole was immense; the fact she was able to precisely let out a little pop on every beat was surprisingly admirable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow falling into a laughing fit herself, Liz decided to stop her little game and just let out one big, very long fart that whined on and on for a good few seconds, using the metal bars around the edge for support as she lifted one leg off the ground, looking back at Morgan as she eased out this very long one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could keep It going even longer, a tired-looking beaver headed over to the girls, wearing mall uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've had complaints about a dead animal in one of the machines.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. yeah, we have no idea where that smell is coming from.\" Liz lied, letting out a little giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh! Yeah, that smells like a dead animal of some kind. If you two will clear the area I'll have a look at this thing..\" the beaver sighed to himself - he wasn't payed enough for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Liz quickly jogged out of the arcade before he realised he was just breathing in Liz's ass fumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey picked up a couple of soft drinks as they headed outside. There was a little grassy knoll just outside the mall, which seemed to be pretty empty and had a view of the city. They sat down, taking slurps of their drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! That was hilarious!\" Morgan was still wiping tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you enjoyed it.\" Liz grinned. \"My old friends used to love that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were they like? Your old friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, great. See, where I live - uh - where I used to live before I came to study here. It's kinda in the middle of nowhere. Nice forests and lakes and stuff but not a lot to do most of the time, so having good friends was super important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's always important!\" Morgan added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I had a kinda hard childhood with my condition. I got bullied a lot for it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine! Like I say, I managed to meet a good group of friends in middle school who all found it really funny, and kinda just saw me for <i>me</i> y'know? They were mostly guys of course, but we did everything together for a long time there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still keep in touch with them at all?\" Morgan smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh. I dunno. I mean I only got here today so I haven't had the chance to even call my parents yet, but I kinda feel like they resent me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Morgan seemed surprised. \"Why do you think that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they were a bit jealous that I came to college. They're all still back home, all in full time jobs I think, but they all wanted to go to college themselves. I sometimes wonder if they feel like I left them all behind.\" Liz seemed a little sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no! I wouldn't think so! I'm sure they all understand. It sounds like you guys were real close, so just going to college won't stop that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \"Yeah, you're probably right. It's just... my family were never really <i>rich</i> but they could afford to send me off here and stuff. I don't think it was the same for my friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look, you're a really great person. Well, I've only known you for a day but you seem genuine. If they stuck with you all that time, despite your gas, I'm sure they won't resent you now. You'll have time to go back and visit them in the holidays too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I was so scared earlier.\" Liz's voice sounded a little as if she were about to cry. \"I was so nervous coming to college. I had it in my head that maybe my room mate would hate me and find me disgusting - that maybe I found friends who accepted me and I left them, and would never find anyone else who didn't just find me gross and unladylike. You have no idea how relieving it is for me to have a room mate who accepts me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz leant onto Morgan's shoulder, and the fox pulled her into a hug. \"Liz, you're amazing! You're funny, you're smart, you're cute and you're talented. Anyone who can't see that is just dumb! I'm glad I have a room mate who isn't boring and who can't accept my weird sense of humor.\" Morgan smiled warmly, Liz laughed and wiped her eyes, sitting back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm glad you find it funny!\" Liz was clearly a lot happier now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hilarious!\" Morgan chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smiled and nodded, leaning off to one side and letting out a very forced-sounding, squealing fart against the grass, which sounded violent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow. That one hurt a little.\" She giggled, making Morgan laugh too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how about your friends?\" Liz asked the fox, taking a sip of her drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, my friends live in the city. Some of them are going to college next year, but a couple already went off to some of the other ones in the state so they're not that far away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they're great friends! They're, not as crazy or weird as you are,\" Morgan looked at Liz teasingly, \"but they're still good people. I really should call on them and let them know I've settled in and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we go visit them?\" Liz smirked. \"If they live across the city we could jump on the subway or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Uh, we could do! There's my friend Samantha who I've known for years... then there's Katie, she's a lot of fun! Oh, and there's April. She works in a diner on the other side of town. She's probably my closest friend in that whole group!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I'd love to meet your other friends! We could go say hi to April if the diner isn't far away.\" Liz giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but, uh, they're very different. You're gonna have to act normal if we meet up with them. No farting or they'll be grossed out.\" Morgan laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew. Normal.\" Liz joked. She could act perfectly normal when she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're nice friends, but I just don't think they'd find farts funny like we both do. You want to make some good impressions on them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \"It's fine. I can hold them in for a couple of hours. I'll try not to do this, either...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk downed the rest of her drink and let out a loud, manly belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan laughed loudly. \"Yeah, maybe not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you want to go somewhere else?\" Liz suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you and April will get on fine!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're sure. When we get to the subway station maybe we could see where else there is to visit in the city, though.\" </span></div></div>",

I still want to be friends with her at the end of the day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't! I won't! What, you want me to buy a cork to shove up there or something?\" Liz teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wouldn't be a bad idea. I trust you, it's just... no unexpected pranks where you fart on her anyway, alright? She's not a prude or anything but I think she'd find that gross.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded as the girls headed back into the mall to get to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanging around with you all day I've almost forgotten that most people don't really appreciate farts.\" The skunk headed towards the escalators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've forgotten than most girls don't do it so publicly. I don't think I've ever heard any of my old friends fart.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must be boring then!\" Liz joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, they're cool, they're just not as gross as we are I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Morgan made their way to the closest subway station, making sure they got the right connection to the part of the city April worked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train itself seemed to be more or less empty, which Morgan was surprised to see. The only other person was an older looking badger taking a snooze at the other end of the carriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthro city is pretty big, huh?\" Liz looked at a map on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, it is quite a major city. I forget you've never been here before.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. It's kinda crazy being in such a big, busy place. The place I grew up in was as small town as you can get.\" Liz smiled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The campus and the mall are kinda just in this district here.\" Morgan pointed to the lower area of the map. \"April lives up here.\"  Her finger moved up to the northern district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Is it just the same up there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda. It's more on the outskirts, so it's not <i>quite</i> as busy.\" Morgan clutched onto the handrail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you live?\" Liz asked the fox, who looked back at the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I used to live here,\" she pointed over to the northwest, \"but my parents are moving.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Moving state, or?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're moving closer to my grandparents who aren't too far away, just one state across really.\" Morgan was a little annoyed her parents had to move at such an awkward time, but could understand why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few moments of silence as Liz looked around the train. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Morgan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a guy sleeping over there. You think I should give him something rancid to dream about?\" Liz chuckled and shook her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, god... You said you wouldn't fart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't! I won't! Look - if I let some out here then I won't have as much to hold in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'll just have more to replace that.\" Morgan giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shrugged. \"It'll probably help to get some out of my system.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. You don't just wanna hold it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just as she began to wonder if she was going overboard, Morgan added, \"Don't get me wrong, it's what makes you the funniest person I've met in... well, ever, but if it'll hold you over while you're around April, I say better this guy than her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it should hold me over for one or two more minutes,\" Liz joked. She practically skipped on her way over to the other side of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... do me a favor. Go easy on him, will you? The poor guy's in no position to see you coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a bully,\" Liz said, spinning around to face Morgan. \"First sign he's upset, I'll knock it off. Until then,\" she said as her eyes began to shine with a mischievous glint, \"no promises!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked backwards the rest of the way, looking over her shoulder every now and then to make sure she wasn't about to bump into him. She raised her tail when she got close to him, shook her behind slightly as she shot a playful smirk at Morgan. The vixen had taken quite a few steps forward, herself, but was still some distance from the skunk. She appeared to have tried to be in the optimal position of being close enough to hear it as best as she could while being far enough away to avoid the brunt of the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz screwed up her face: one eye was closed while the other rolled back and her lip was slightly pursed. She kept her face like this for a dozen or so seconds as she kept a rumbling burst of gas going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz stepped to the side to show Morgan that the badger was still asleep, much to their surprise and mirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz took her place in front of the badger once again. This time, she bent forward a little further and looked over her shoulder to adjust herself so that her rump was as close to the badger's snout as possible without touching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she really focused. This next fart was not as loud as the last one, to the point that Morgan took a couple steps forward and leaned in to hear it better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on both girls' faces widened with the length of this fart. By now, Morgan was growing used to the surreal length of time her new friend could keep one going. It didn't make it any less funny to her, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stopped trying to time it somewhere around the thirty second mark. By then, she had to clutch at the wall just so she didn't collapse from laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the sheer length of Liz's fart wasn't enough, the skunk was also having fun comically reacting to it. She held an arm in front of her face, as if looking at a watch. She tapped her wrist where the face of the watch would be with a faux puzzled look, as if wondering if her \"watch\" was broken. Then she pretended to shrug it off and made an impatient face and a rolling gesture with a couple of her fingers as if to say, \"can we hurry this along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she was interested in hurrying. If anything, she was doing everything in her power to keep it going as long as she could. She stepped aside slightly to show Morgan the badger was still asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz put her still-farting rump in front of his face once more, but after several seconds, she started to walk away. Still not letting up, she walked over to Morgan, who was still doubled over in laughter. Naturally, Liz took advantage of this position by spinning around and farting in Morgan's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww!\" Morgan exclaimed, but had obviously been more amused than grossed out. Nevertheless, she pushed Liz's butt so the skunk was no longer farting directly in her face, but somewhere off to the side. Liz tried to get her behind in Morgan's face a couple more times, but never kept if there for more than a couple seconds before Morgan pushed her away again until Liz gave up and finally allowed this one to taper off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, why can't I get a reaction like that out of <i>him</i>?\" Liz asked, as if she hadn't just passed more gas in a single fart than most furs produce in several days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know but you don't have to take it out on me!\" Morgan half-joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" Liz said, snapping her fingers, \"let me check something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back over to the napping victim and took a close look at him and grinned. <i>I knew it!</i> she thought. As she turned to walk back to Morgan, for good measure, she farted a few more times. They were in quick succession and were focused more on volume than length. But even at her loudest, she didn't get more of a reaction than a snore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the badger from before!\" Liz said when she took her place next to Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Guess it's a small city after all,\" Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy must need to get his hearing aids checked or he has them off or something,\" Liz said. \"I was worried I was losing my touch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <i>I</i> was worried you knocked him out with that long one,\" Morgan half-joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the train came to a stop. Suddenly, the girls had a bigger problem than trying to give a hearing-impaired badger a rude awakening.</span></div></div>",

Then the accusatory looks over their shoulders, followed at last by a desperate pinching of the snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan had to bite down on her cheeks just to keep from laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air in the carriage had been ripened by Liz\u2019s astonishingly lengthy release, and these poor, poor members of the public were stewing right in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t stop there. Whispers built into murmurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz listened closely and picked out a few <i>\u201cwas that you!?\u201ds</i> and <i>\u201cwhat\u2019s that smell?\u201ds</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the initial reactions were subdued, they quickly became more vocal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair to the passengers, it was a particularly bad one. Its length likely didn\u2019t help that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like sitting in a heap of sulfur-fried onions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was surprised to see that even Liz needed to pitch the collar of her shirt over her muzzle - though this might have been a display to throw the blame away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant the train pulled into the next station - whether it was their stop or not - every single fur evacuated the train car with a flurry of pushing and shouting, everyone scrambling for some fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the sleeping badger was stirred from his slumber and departed hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the doors closed again, the girls broke out into peals of uncontrollable laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt encouraged another short rip from Liz\u2019s rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my <i>goodness</i>! Liz! That thing reeks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! Is it bad that I\u2019m just a little impressed?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train continued through the tunnel and eventually slowed to stop at the next station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out here.\u201d Liz tugged on Morgan\u2019s arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? This isn\u2019t our stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but a whole bunch of other passengers are about to hop on and sooner or later they\u2019re gonna trace the source of this smell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cHow could they possibly? A girl is the last person they\u2019d suspect!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor now, but I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep these held in. Sooner or later something\u2019s gonna slip.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked at the crowd building on the platform and then back into the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments she decided...</span></div></div>",

She smirked slightly at her own double entendre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check it out,\" Liz told Morgan as the subway door behind them closed. \"Looks like we have the whole tunnel to ourselves! You know what that means, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan had a feeling she did. She nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to test this place for an echo!\" Liz said. She lifted one foot ever so slightly that she was on her tiptoes with it. The sound was beyond violent. Morgan laughed not only at the sound, but at Liz's face that matched this one's aggression. She was baring her gritted teeth with her brow furrowed, clearly pushing as hard as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan didn't get to see that face very long, though. Once again, mid-fart, she had turned herself around so that her backside was aimed at Morgan. The vixen took several steps away from the skunk, thankful she had more room to avoid the blast zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not Liz's longest fart, but between its sheer volume and its dozen second length, it still packed plenty of gas. Liz breathed a deep, satisfied sigh that morphed into a small laugh when she heard the end of the fart reverberate off the walls. \"Looks like we've got an echo after all,\" she announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, however, didn't acknowledge Liz's excuse for ripping this latest one. Instead, she said, \"You have <i>got</i> to stop pointing that thing at me! I swear, you must be violating some kind of international law against chemical weapons or something when you do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure were singing a different tune when I farted in your face this morning,\" Liz said with a playful smirk. She put a paw near her rump and wafted the smell up to her nose, evidently admiring her own stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nowhere near as bad and you know it\" Morgan protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I see what you mean,\" Liz said, instinctively wincing a bit when she got a particularly strong breath of the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I'd kind of like to start farting, myself, just to make it stink less around here,\" Morgan joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there's an idea,\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Morgan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we get you a bunch of gas before we meet April?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox's face turned a shade redder. \"I was just kidding! Besides, I thought I told you, I've never done <i>that</i> around her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Liz said. \"You've been friends with her for years, right? Well let's say you accidentally-on-purpose fart in front of her. It's not like she'll stop talking to you over that. Worst case scenario is she's a little grossed out for a minute and you can play it off like an accident and I'll know to hold it in. But if she has a positive reaction, then maybe I can join in without making a bad first impression.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Morgan said weakly.</span></div></div>",

It was a 50s-inspired bar that sold milkshakes and coffee with a jukebox playing away quietly in the corner of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of warm coffee and donuts hit Liz and Morgan in a wave, Liz's stomach grumbling quietly - though she wasn't sure if it was due to hunger or gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the bar, dashing from customer to customer, face feigning a smile through the obvious stress of having to deal with a busy afternoon, was who Liz assumed to be April.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a bright-eyed doe with a fair complexion, wearing the white apron over a neutral pink shirt and shorts. She had some pretty fortunate natural looks, Liz thought. She could bet all of Morgan's friends were in the 'super pretty' crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, and upon seeing Morgan her face lit up, calling out across the diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hey! Morgan! Hold up... gimmie a few and I'll come say hi. You can take a seat.\" She smiled warmly at Liz and Morgan, running over to a customer to fill his coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls walked over towards an empty cubicle and sat down, Liz instantly looking over the little laminated menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's never usually this busy in here.\" Morgan looked out the window into the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those donuts smells <i>amazing</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they are. I always get one when I come here. Well... I haven't been here too many times but sometimes when April and I hung out I came here to wait while she finished up with work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan laughed and shook her head at the fact that that was the only piece of information Liz took away from the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, April came over and sat beside Morgan, wiping her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez. I think it's calmed down for a while. How are you doing, Morgan? And, uh, Morgan's friend?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Liz.\" Morgan introduced the skunkette, who did a little bow and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz! Hey!\" April reached out an arm for a handshake; something Liz usually found pretty pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! April! Morgan's been telling me all about you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I hope not.\" The deer laughed as she settled back into the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're at Anthro University, then? How is it there? You two settling in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not bad so far.\" Morgan smiled at Liz. \"We don't even start classes for another few days, so we're kinda having a look round the city. Liz has never been to Anthro city before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no? How are you liking it so far?\" April asked Liz, her demeanor incredibly welcoming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very loud, and busy, but it's also kinda cool. It's nice not having to drive like a mile out to buy some milk or something.\" Liz joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is indeed, and there's some great food here, too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Liz were just talking about how good those donuts smell.\" Morgan said, grinning and looking over at April.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Do you two want a couple? I can get you some on the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! We'll pay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril waved her hand. \"Nope, you're already college students - you need any free shit you can get!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist.\" Morgan grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril got up and ran off towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's nice.\" Liz said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How're you, uh, holding up? Or holding <i>in</i>?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shuffled around on her seat.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Believe me. I've had to hold my farts in for a long time before; I can do it now. I can just ask to go to the bathroom later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was somewhat relieved that Liz wasn't going through some immense pain just to appear normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go!\" April reappeared with two donuts and the same friendly smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat back down as the girls thanked her and started to eat, Liz making an effort to do so as delicately as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My feet are killing me.\" April grimaced and pulled one of her shoes off, massaging her leg. \"I've been serving, like, all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time do you get off?\" Morgan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty soon. Well... if there aren't any more customers coming in then I guess I'm already sorta finished.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna do something?\" Liz asked, wiping the sugar away from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, I'm sure April's busy!\" Morgan smiled weakly, not wanting to take up too much of her friend's time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? I've got nothing to do! I've always got time for my friends! Besides, I've barely seen you recently with all the packing up for college stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm super sure! Hey, there's this pretty cool spot I found just up the hill near here. Maybe we should go hang out there, if I spend another minute in here I think I'm gonna die.\" April laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure you can just leave like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"Yeah, sure thing. Let's get out of here!\" <br>\r\nThe deer threw her apron into the door leading to the back room, then walking out into the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, she's pretty cool.\" Liz smirked at Morgan, who smiled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. My friends are awesome. You included, of course.\" The vixen laughed and the girls headed outside to meet April again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's this spot, exactly?\" Morgan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril pointed to the hill past the end of the street. \"It's up there down this little path. I think high schoolers go up there to drink beer and smoke weed, but I doubt there'll be any this time of day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, it's funny, I'm still getting used to the fact I'm not a high schooler anymore myself.\" Liz started, making conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure once the lectures start you'll get used to it pretty quick.\" Morgan laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't go to high school round here then, I guess.\" April walked along with the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Back home. It was a kinda sucky high school, too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think there's such thing as a great one.\" April giggled. \"We had fun though, right, Morgan?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah! Classes made me want to kill myself after a while, but we had a good friend group.\" Morgan said, thinking back to even a few months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey up to the spot April was taking them to wasn't far away; just up through a small street full of residential houses and down a slightly overgrown path, and the three of them emerged into a little field. There was a bench here, covered in graffiti, and a little statue that kids would often climb up onto. There was a view up here of the north of the city, similar to the view Morgan and Liz had enjoyed earlier outside the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was doing a good job of it so far, it was becoming a little uncomfortable for Liz to hold her gas in, and with every step she was worried a little toot might slip out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go. It's nice and quiet here.\" April took a seat down on the grass and closed her eyes, feeling the wind over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so damn hot in that diner.\" She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was cramped in the dorm room too so we had to get out.\" Morgan said, taking a seat beside April.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heard the dorms there are pretty small.\" April rested on her arms as she looked over at the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shifted on the ground, the nagging desire to release some gas was getting more and more every second - she clutched as hard as she could but her stomach let out a long, whiny gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril and Morgan looked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still hungry?\" The deer said with a smile, not aware of the real situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Liz feigned a smile, rubbing her stomach but only making the gas more restless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh, doing ok, Liz?\" Morgan tried to smile too, though she could tell from her friend's facial expression she wasn't holding out too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz pulled her legs up to her chest, eyes narrowing slightly as she tried with as much force as she had to hold the floodgates. April seemed like maybe she wouldn't mind too much if she let out one little fart, but she'd promised Morgan she wouldn't... </span></div></div>",

She looked at Liz. \u201cWhat kind of pranks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighed, awaiting the inevitable answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, she\u2019s gonna have to find out eventually!\u201d Liz said to Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFind out what?\u201d April asked, growing visibly impatient at how cryptic the other two were being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something you should know about me,\u201d Liz said. \u201cI have this disorder that, well... long story short, I can\u2019t spray like most skunks. So my body makes up for that by giving me <i>lots</i> of gas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that it?\u201d April asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... yeah,\u201d Liz said. She and Morgan exchanged a quick look at each other, both clearly surprised at April's nonchalant reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril shrugged. \u201cHey, a little gas never hurt anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, in Liz's case, it's <i>way</i> more than just a little,\u201d Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz demonstrated her friend's point. For a little over twenty seconds, she blared a fart that grew louder and louder with time. That was the only part of it that was consistent: its tone and pitch seemed to change with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril snickered, which led the other two girls to feel relaxed enough to laugh at it as much as they normally did. \u201cI'll bet you're really looking forward to sharing a tiny dorm room with her for a year!\u201d April joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, at least I know I won\u2019t ever be bored!\u201d Morgan said. \u201cBelieve it or not, this girl's only getting started!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Well, then I guess I can see why you'd worry about how I'd take it.\u201d She turned to Liz, \u201cBut, hey, you seem friendly enough and it looks like you and Morgan have become fast friends. And, well, as cheesy as it is to say, I guess any friend of Morgan's is a friend of mine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear!\u201d Liz said. She smiled, feeling relieved that making new friends for her was much easier than she expected. Perhaps her gas wasn\u2019t as big a deal to others as she thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, pranks,\u201d Liz said, adopting a somewhat more business-like tone. \u201cAs you can probably imagine, having an endless supply of gas has turned me into quite the prankster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I wouldn\u2019t have imagined that,\u201d April interrupted. \u201cI think I\u2019d still be too embarrassed to do that around others. Although, come to think of it, if you\u2019re as gassy as you two claim, I suppose you'd <i>have</i> to have a sense of humor about it just so you don\u2019t go insane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Liz agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if my sense of humor would be so gas-powered if I weren\u2019t like this. I don\u2019t like to imagine what it would be like to be normal.\u201d Her expression changed into an exaggerated horrified expression as she added, \u201cUgh, <i>normal</i>,\u201d and jokingly shuddered as if it were the most terrible thing she could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz paused for a moment for Morgan and April to chuckle before she finally concluded her original train of thought. \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t exactly know the city that well, so I'm not sure where the best place to do some pranking would be. Any suggestions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and April looked at each other, thinking for a brief moment. Suddenly, they both opened up their mouths to speak at the same time. \u201cYou go first,\u201d April said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom a practical standpoint, I was thinking we could probably use some groceries for the dorm. Our meal plan only goes so far and we can\u2019t afford to eat out everyday. You should have no shortage of victims there and we can stock up on grub.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a bad idea,\u201d Liz said. With a devious smirk, she added, \u201cPlus, beans are pretty cheap!\u201d April and Morgan shook their heads and giggled. \u201cWhat about you, April? Any suggestions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d April said. \u201cI was thinking of the gym not too far from here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft, you just want an excuse to ogle all the guys!\u201d Morgan teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that doesn\u2019t exactly hurt the gym's case, does it?\u201d April retorted. The skunk and vixen didn\u2019t disagree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm,\u201d Liz said, \u201cI've never really gone to a gym before, but I'd imagine they smell like BO. So I'm sure they wouldn\u2019t mind if someone came along to introduce some <i>fresh air</i>,\u201d she said, patting her behind as if the joke was lost on either of them. The other two giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet used to the puns, by the way,\u201d Morgan told April. \u201cI only met her today, but I feel like I've already heard a million of them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on, you know you like them!\u201d Liz said. \u201cBesides, people who don\u2019t laugh at my puns become the <i>butt</i> of my other jokes.\u201d April and Morgan laughed in a forced, exaggerated fashion, as if trying to avoid that fate. \u201cJust kidding!\u201d Liz said, \u201c<i>no one</i> is safe from that!\u201d She punctuated this with an evil laugh. \u201cOkay, enough stalling. I know where we're gonna go.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Wanna just head back to the dorm?\" Morgan asked as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Liz said. \"I mean, if we stick around here long enough, I might get us banned from <i>every</i> store here!\" She punctuated this by ripping a quiet, yet audible fart that made a slight purring sound that she stopped as soon as she had gotten back on her feat, as if the force of the fart propelled her upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" Morgan said as the two headed for the exit. \"Still, Liz, that was <i>insane!</i> That one super long one that poor badger didn't even notice...\" Morgan chuckled a bit at the recent memory and shook her head in disbelief. \"You know, at first, I wasn't sure I believed you when you told me in the dorm how gassy you were. Now I'm starting to think you were actually making an understatement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz giggled and opened her mouth to say something, but Morgan interrupted. \"And don't tell me... there's still <i>way</i> more where that came from.\" Liz enthusiastically nodded, her lips forming into a proud smirk. \u201cYou really are a never-ending supply!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to confirm what Morgan had said, Liz began ripping an extraordinarily loud fart that got the attention of most of the nearby shoppers. Morgan giggled and looked around everyone's reactions. Some were glaring at the skunk, a few pretended to ignore it, and others were smiling or laughing. The group of shoppers who had been behind the girls quickly retreated to a nearby store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething drew Morgan's attention back to Liz \u2013 the tone of her fart significantly changed. It was still loud, deep, and rumbly, but it sounded muffled, similar to a muted trombone. When Morgan looked back at her new friend, she realized the cause: Liz had placed a paw on her rump. Morgan guffawed quite loudly as Liz rapidly alternated between taking her paw off and putting it back on until she finally finished her fart with an exaggerated sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore joining Morgan in laughter, Liz took the paw she had been farting on and put it next to Morgan's snout. Morgan had hardly caught a whiff of the sulfurous stench, as she had instinctively swatted Liz's paw away almost instantly, but still smelled enough to realize how foul it was. \u201cLiz, that is <i>awful!</i>\u201d Morgan said, still chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, look on the bright side,\u201d Liz said, \u201cat least I haven't eaten anything today that <i>really</i> gets to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stopped in her tracks, clearly caught off guard by this comment. \u201cYou mean to tell me, you can get even gassier?\u201d Liz nodded with a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez,\" Morgan said, shaking her head in surprise at the mere thought of Liz being even gassier than she had already demonstrated. \"You know, I bet you never had to learn how to swim: with all that gas, you should be buoyant enough to float.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz laughed. \"You know, I haven't gone swimming in a while. Maybe we should go when it's warm so we can test your theory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... before today, I didn't think I'd ever talk about farts this much,\" Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say?\" Liz slyly said, \"I bring out the best in others.\" Morgan bit her lip a little nervously. \"Something wrong?\" Liz asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is probably gonna sound weird, but... I gotta admit, I'm a little jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jealous!?\" Liz practically shouted in surprise. \"Of what, my farting!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it down, you don't have to let the whole mall know!\" Morgan said, blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Liz said, speaking softer, \"It's just... that's the first time I've heard anyone say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Morgan asked. \"I figured some of your other friends would have felt that way too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they did, they never said anything,\" Liz said with a shrug. \"I especially never expected to hear one of my <i>girl</i> friends say that. I mean, when you fart like I do, guys don't exactly line up to go out with you,\" Liz said. For the first time since she met Morgan, Liz had adopted a straight face. \"That's the only downside to my condition. It's like guys always see me as one of them, you know what I mean? Yeah, I've had plenty of guy friends, but I never really had a boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Morgan said, \"all I meant by it was that if I could fart like you, you have no idea how much fun I'd have with that!\" After a brief pause, she added, \"Okay, maybe <i>you</i> know how much fun I'd have, but it's a figure of speech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's smile returned to her face. \"You know, it'd be nice to have a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e,\" she said. \"When we get to the dorm, I might try my hand at teaching you a thing or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Morgan asked with an eager smile. \"Gosh, I feel so immature getting excited over that,\" she realized aloud a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" Liz said with a nod. \"I doubt I can quite get you up to my level, but I'd like to find out what a regular fur is capable of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether subconsciously or consciously, the girls started walking faster after this part of the conversation to get to the dorm faster. They barely caught a bus as it was about to leave.</span></div></div>",

How can you create something that smells like that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz wiped a tear from her eye - partly from crying and partly from the horribly piquant gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, don't roll the windows down, we got a nice little Liz-brand sauna going on in here!\"<br>\r\nThe skunkette put her weight onto one butt cheek and allowed another loud fart out, fanning her paw comically towards Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just keeps getting worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh yeahhh! <i>Embrace it!</i>\" Liz took in a deep, full breath, immediately regretting the decision and breaking into a little coughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sniffled, grimacing at the intensifying odour. <br>\r\n\"We're gonna run out of air in a minute..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz laughed. \"Who needs air? My butt fumes are better than any stupid old air!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz lifted her right leg up over the passenger seat, a quiet squeaker began to ease out, growing in volume and intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Stop!\" Morgan was trying to keep control over the car, in absolute hysterics and also very distracted by the stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz rolled around on the backseat, taking little sniffs of her own noxious byproduct. <br>\r\n\"This smell is gonna be singed into these seats forever!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God, I don't even have a hard time believing that. I swear they're smelling extra worse right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they are pretty potent today. No idea why.\" Liz shrugged, continuing to browse stuff on her phone; the strong smell around her didn't bother her too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like... breathing in fumes from burning plastic, mixed with a whole load of rotten eggs.\" Morgan felt her eyes water, breathing in more tainted air and feeling her lungs burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sat up straight, leaning on Morgan's seat, letting out a short little rumbler into the upholstery and gasping with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan coughed. \"As funny as this is, I genuinely feel like I'm gonna pass out in a minute, so I'm putting an end to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down and held the button to put her window down, taking a huge gulp of fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! All my beautiful farts! Gone forever!\" Liz dramatically grasped out before playfully laying back down onto the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you're not exactly gonna run out anytime soon...\" Morgan chuckled, and was proven right almost moments later as Liz ripped a trumpety blast from the backseat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to improve your gas-passing abilities, you're going to need to be able to endure gas!\" Liz pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're almost back at the dorm now, so we can get to the training, can't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Teach me your ways, oh gassy one!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz let out a little wet pop to clear the air. \"What element do you wanna focus on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... element?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Like... do you want long farts? Smelly farts? <b>Loud ones?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I have all three?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz laughed. \"I guess so, but it's easier if we focus on one type and perfect that!

Uh... what should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz stepped back, paw resting against her chin. \"Let's see what you got so far...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's large brown eyes widened for a second. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hit me with your best shot! Let 'er rip! Let's see how long you can go for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, geez, I'm not even sure I need to fart right now, uh..\" <br>\r\nShe shuffled around on the bed, leaning over to one side and letting her tail flick upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz observed the strain on the vixen's face as she tried to summon something, anything, from her lower intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was generally not a very gassy fur; she'd let a few go since meeting Liz but it wasn't something she did very often before - not unless she had bad gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result of her pushing was no more than a short, half-airy parp of a fart, barely brushing against the bedsheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. <i>we-eak!</i>\" Liz mocked in a singsong tone, crossing her arms and giving Morgan a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, ok, I can't just do it on the spot like you can!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded in agreement, lifting her tail and letting a short wet one ring out to prove Morgan right. \"That's what we're here to help you with! If you've got <i>loads</i> of gas in there, then making them long shouldn't be too hard... it's all about control!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Control. Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kinda effortless for me, but you're probably gonna need to let them out slowly and evenly, not just force them out, or they're not gonna last long!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded again. Maybe she should have a notebook to be writing this stuff down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the longest one you've ever done?\" Morgan asked Liz, who responded with a look of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Hmm... uh... y'know, I'm not really sure. I don't really time them with a little stopwatch or anything, but I mean... I can kinda go as long as I want.\" She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already seen that first hand...\" Morgan recalled the monster of a fart Liz had let out earlier in the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway! Food time. Let's get you nice and full!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stared down at the pile of take out wrappers, boxes and cups laid out on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... not sure I can eat all this.. how many fast food places did you order from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... there's a little of everything - the Mexican is of course a good go-to gas inducer - burritos are classic fart fuel! We've got a little lamb and veggie kebab in there somewhere - that's probably gonna help out, too, but I think you'll want to try the pizza and vanilla milkshake.. lots of dairy means lots of gas, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded, eyes still fixed on the intimidating pile of food. \"Yeah, I blow up like a blimp, but that's what I want, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \"Eat up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan began to pick at different food items. She didn't exactly have a huge stomach, and she wasn't sure how much of this was gonna fit in. She started by grabbing a burrito, unwrapping it and taking big bites from it, struggling to chew and swallow it fast enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz simply watched on like a soccer coach, occasionally making little comments and trying to encourage Morgan to eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved on to a pizza - one slice, two slices, three, four; by the fifth slice she was starting to really feel bloated, taking large sips of milkshake to wash the pizza dough down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen laid back into the chair, letting a loud belch rattle up through her throat.<br>\r\n\"I can't... eat anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nonsense! You can keep going! C'mon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan forced another couple of slices down her throat, finishing off the milkshakes and then sinking back into the chair again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok, that's my limit... really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked a little disappointed, but still impressed. \"Ok, fine. I'll put the rest of this stuff in the refrigerator for the next time you wanna refuel!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan breathed heavily, rubbing her swollen belly and letting out burps every few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, how long does dairy usually take to kick in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... maybe fifteen minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \"Ok, I think we should head out to test out your abilities once that all starts to take effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now? It's getting pretty dark outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz waved her hand. \"No worries, there'll be plenty of test subjects out on campus!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked over. \"I'm not ruining my reputation here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... there's another campus just a walk away, let's try there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk, Liz and Morgan found themselves on the outskirts of Wolf State University - or WSU as it was more commonly known. It was not far from anthro university, and generally had a worse reputation, but was altogether a very similar college. It seemed weird for there to be two places so similar so close to each other, but it meant Morgan wouldn't become known as the fart girl of AU. Well, the <i>second</i> one after Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan halted, paws immediately grabbing the sides of her stomach.<br>\r\n\"Ugh... L-Liz, I just felt the dairy kicking in... oh boy, I don't think it's agreeing with me at all..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz clapped her hands and grinned widely. \"Perfect! Now, who are we gonna try this out on? Aren't too many folks out this late..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked up, taking a little survey of the targets within their vicinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty empty out this late - down near one of the college buildings were a group of rowdy-looking dogs. They were gathered round a tree, chatting loudly and playing music as they sipped on beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around a little more, Morgan noticed another vixen, sitting on a wall and smoking. Unlike Morgan, she was white, wearing all black with a small piercing in her ear. She looked pretty miserable - maybe a little fart humor would cheer her up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s what I thought. Typical girl trying to be one of the guys.\u201d The Dalmatian snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Can\u2019t I have one more try? Just one more?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works!

It\u2019ll be even funnier the second time!\u201d The Rottweiler decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz, clearly putting on a quaint and girlish manner, rubbed her tummy again, her face scrunching up as she cocked one of her legs up and slightly askew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few delayed seconds, a sound much more familiar to Morgan came barrelling out of the skunk at a thousand miles per hour; a brash, creaking volley of gas that was not only wet, but genuinely quite loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan had to hold back laughter as she watched the faces of the three dogs drop completely; their mouths practically dropping open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz leaned forwards, somehow making this fart even <i>louder</i> and more violent, like the staggering ripping cacophony of a chainsaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good few seconds, Liz cut the fart off and resumed normal position. <br>\r\n\u201cHow was that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dogs were speechless, until eventually one chimed in...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just follow my lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls walked across the gas, Morgan lagging behind a bit. The pressure on her belly slowed her down to such a degree she was surprised how perky and energetic Liz tends to be if this is anything like how her insides feel all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dogs didn't notice the girls approach: they were too busy looking at the Dalmatian. Evidently it was his turn. His fart was loud, but at only a couple seconds in length, pitiful compared to what the girls were about to release. The guys laughed a bit, raised their beer cans in unison, and took a swig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Morgan's surprise, Liz was laughing as well. She knew the girl had a soft spot for fart humor but didn't expect one so mediocre to get her to laugh as hard as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unfamiliar laugh got the dog's' attention. They looked at Liz, a little unsure of what to make of her unannounced presence. \"Oh man, that's so funny,\" Liz said. \"Sorry. I just can't get over how you guys think a fart <i>that</i> pathetic is any good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the violent  pangs in her belly, Morgan couldn't help but smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well,\" the Rottweiler said, \"a <i>girl</i> who thinks she knows a thing or two about farts. Now I've seen everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta say, this is probably the saddest farting contest I've ever seen,\" Liz said. \"You guys really ought to be ashamed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" The Rottweiler said. He grunted. What followed was a low purring noise that lasted about five seconds. His buddies cheered him on and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a bit more like it,\" Liz said, \"but if you wanna know what a <i>real</i> fart sounds like, just ask my roommate here.\" She gestured to Morgan, who the dogs just now seemed to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys exchanged glances with each other and nodded. The Rottweiler, their apparent leader spoke up. \"Alright, bring it on,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec,\" Liz told Morgan. She dug out her phone and opened a stopwatch app. She wanted an idea how much their training paid off. \"Okay, now go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after being granted permission, a powerful fart came thundering out of Morgan's behind and Liz pressed start. Even following Liz's advice and barely pushing, it was no doubt the loudest fart the dogs had heard since their contest began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's smile grew with the length of Morgan's fart. She felt prouder of her friend with each milestone she passed. First was ten seconds. Then fifteen. Liz could no longer contain her laughter at twenty. At twenty-five the volume died down a little and it developed a spluttery tone, making Liz think it was close to ending. Then thirty came. Thirty-five to forty, Liz had to take a break from laughter simply because her jaw has dropped in astonishment: this was the first time she heard anyone besides herself fart this long. And it was still going. Forty-five. She was back to howling with laughter. Fifty. It started spluttering again but this time it was no false start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan had just farted for fifty-three seconds. Liz showed Morgan the stopwatch once both their laughter has died down enough. They almost forgot to check the dogs' reaction. They looked and saw three dogs staring at them mouth agape. Their silence was broken when the Rottweiler leader finally spoke.</span></div></div>",

Remember - do it slowly, don't rush!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded and the girls both headed over to the wall the vixen was sat on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood in position a few feet away, Morgan's butt facing towards her - she could feel the violent bubbling in her tummy, the gas building up and waiting to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Liz, bit her lip, and then started to push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made sure not to rush, as Liz had instructed, letting the gas ease out slowly. It was already loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz starting breaking out into hysterics as Morgan concentrated super hard, trying her best to sustain this one fart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got louder and louder, sounding not unlike a motorcycle engine as the segmented pops grew closer together into a loud revving sort of sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the vixen on the wall stared, and pulled one earplug from her ear. Her mouth didn't curl in disgust, her eyes didn't widen in surprise, she didn't recoil in sheer horror - she just watched, face stone cold and straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan kept it going, using a paw to spread one of her cheeks - she knew she was gonna have to breathe in a second, that she couldn't keep it going forever, but it was still turning out to be pretty lengthy by her standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter roughly ten seconds, Morgan gasped for air and the fart cut off. Liz was still chuckling loudly and clutching her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl on the wall was still staring: unabashed and unflinching. After a few seconds of silence, she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. Can't say I was expecting to see that this evening. Well done.\" Her voice was as flat as her facial expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Morgan shared a glance. They weren't exactly sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, better out than in!\" Morgan joked, feeling pretty embarrassed but fueled by adrenaline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen's eyes shifted from Liz to Morgan, and then back and forth again. Her nostrils flinched.<br>\r\n\"Hm. You're lactose intolerant, aren't you? Smells like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had never received this kind of reaction before, and Morgan certainly wasn't expecting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... not really, it just doesn't agree with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white fox nodded slowly. \"I can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz decided to step forward - maybe she could illicit something other than deadpan from this girl.<br>\r\n\"You, uh, don't seem too phased by that. Girl just comes up to you and farts on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl took a moment to respond. \"It took me a little by surprise, but that was kinda rad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rad?\" Morgan and Liz shared another glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl tapped her phone to turn the music off. <br>\r\n\"You don't see girls ripping ass usually. Especially not like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not usual girls.\" Morgan grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I haven't heard that one before, but this time you're not wrong.\" The vixen commented cynically, still taking a few tokes from her cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was pretty surprised that she didn't even seem to care about the smell, which was pretty foul for what it was worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Liz! This is Morgan.\" The skunk outstretched a hand towards the girl, wearing a beaming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at Liz's paw, almost as if she wasn't sure what to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ashley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's hand stayed out, but clearly Ashley wasn't intending to shake it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, uh, this isn't exactly going the way we expected it to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley half raised an eyebrow. \"Oh yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually when we do that, people get all pissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or run away.\" Morgan added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two do this often? Come up to strangers and then fart on them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls both laughed and nodded in union.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. That's kinda hardcore. Weird, but kinda hardcore.\" Ashley's face remained flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should see what <i>she</i> can do!\" Morgan gestured towards Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded, leaning over to one side and letting out four rhythmic toots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You fart on command or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda. More than that... it's all natural, and I never really run out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded slowly again. It was hard to tell if she was weirded out or impressed.<br>\r\n\"Prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Liz looked at one another. They'd certainly never had a stranger say anything like that to them before, but Liz wasn't afraid to show off her abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, if you insist.\" She started Ashley off with a squeaker, lifting her leg up in the air and moving into various poses as she kept it going and going, her face showing no signs of concentration or strain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz comically yawned, jumping up and down and making the fart undulate loudly; she started to do jumping jacks as she kept the fart going and going. Morgan watched on, awestruck, as Liz seemed to hold a 25 second fart without even breaking a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut it off, letting out little bursts of flatulence and pumping her arms down with each one, starting to let them out in some sort of little rhythm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley continued to stare on, eyes fixed on Liz as she waved her butt around, pushing out loud, airy, wet, bubbly farts one after the other, humming to herself to show just how little effort this all took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute of showing off, Liz decided to stop, standing back against the wall and sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley narrowed her eyes. \"Weird, but cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird but cool is our style.\" Liz smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't ever like, crap yourself doing that?\" Ashley asked blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all air, baby! I mean, I still need to use the bathroom but I have enough control not to soil myself.\" She laughed. \"Although I've come close more than a few times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Morgan let out a loud, pretty wet-sounding blast; all that food was tearing her stomach apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And by the sound of it, Morgan just nearly did herself.\" Liz giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan laughed along with her and fanned her paw by her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley spoke up again.<br>\r\n\"I'm lactose intolerant. Got it bad. I know the smell anywhere.\"<br>\r\nShe jumped down from the wall. She was around the same height as the girls, a little taller than Morgan. Her hair came down in a fringe above her eyes, which were a striking shade of green. Her wardrobe was almost exclusively black and leather, and Morgan could make out part of what seemed to be a tattoo peeping out below her sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna hang with us for a bit?\" Liz asked Ashley warmly, not expecting any warmth in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Haven't got a whole lot else to do. Can't sleep. What do you dudes wanna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. I'm not sure. Do you have any suggestions?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley thought for a moment. \"There's a concert going on across town. Maybe you two can clear out the venue or something. Probably some diners open. Your choice.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They're pretty heavy. A little too heavy for my taste but they're good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, I think I've heard of them.\" Liz nodded. She was just trying to think of potential fart jokes opening up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could head over. I think it's free entry. Over at the Brix club.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Brix club? You mean that super hipster venue?\" Morgan smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Ashely responded quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all set out walking. They were on the very outskirts of the city, but fortunately the Brix club wasn't too far away; only a couple of blocks. One advantage WSU had over Furry heights was that it was actually close to a few shops, clubs, and restaurants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshely opted to walk ahead of Liz and Morgan, almost leading the way. She walked with struts, her large black boots clicking against the sidewalk as she continued her cigarette in silence and blew the foul-smelling smoke back in Liz and Morgan's direction. It was hard to tell, but she appeared to be about the same age as the girls, maybe a little older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while, Ashley was far ahead enough that Liz and Morgan could chat quietly to one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're your thoughts on her?\" Morgan asked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's interesting. Never had someone act so calmly to my gas.\" Liz responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seems kinda cool, but kinda... moody?\" Morgan watched Ashley from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's her thing. Moody, troubled art teen, y'know?\" Liz smirked a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being an art student I can assure you: that describes every art teen.\" Morgan laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio arrived at the venue, the sound of heavy rock music was already blasting from inside, muffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion at the door took a look at the girls. \"Hey Ashley.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox responded with a simple nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's free entry tonight, girls, but feel free to buy a drink or something in the lobby.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls entered, the music was getting louder now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your plan?\" Ashley looked round at Liz, throwing her cigarette to the ground and stomping it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I'm not sure. I have a couple of ideas. We could head in there, find some furs to gas up, see if we can't get ourselves some front row spaces.\" Liz smirked as she said this last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forcibly get them, I'm guessing. It's so loud in there, nobody's gonna be able to hear these farts - including us.\" Morgan added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not, but that doesn't stop them from stinking!\" She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded slowly.<br>\r\n\"Sounds kinda funny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all grabbed a can of energy drink and then headed inside. It was about a hundred times as loud as any of them expected; sharp noisy guitars over the top of booming drums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hall was pretty large, and filled with a massive crowd of furs, leaving an empty space at the back where some tables sat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was jumping up and down and pumping their fists into the air. The music wasn't really to Liz or Morgan's liking, but the music wasn't what they were there for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls settled over on the far wall, a raccoon waltzed over to them. He seemed pretty drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyyy, ladies!\" He shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, dude.\" Ashley responded, without even giving him eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!! You girls are like.... <i>pretty</i>! Always nice to see some hot girls at a place like this? You all like Damned Beaver?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" Liz smiled. The raccoon sort of stared back, not expecting that answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's hard to hear in this place! Maybe we should, like, head outside! Wouldn't want to miss a chance to talk to some cute girls like you three!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Morgan looked at each other. Ashely didn't even seem to be paying this guy that much attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might be an idea to have a little fun with this guy... it could be funny to see how he'd react to 'cute girls' ripping ass, but if they went out with him they weren't sure if they'd get back in anytime soon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were both thinking of the fun they could have with this opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley blinked silently at the girls, as if to confirm her indifference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Liz shouted back the raccoon. \"You lead the way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA drunken smile crawled across his face as he headed towards the entrance, the girls following behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncer gave them all a look as they left out the front, but then got back to his business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, what're you thinking, Liz?\" Morgan made sure the raccoon was far away enough not to hear them, although he seemed too drunk to pay much attention to anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno... let's see how this plays out, wait for my cue!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This seems like a bad idea.\" Ashley added, with about as much concern in her voice as a wet flannel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fun!\" Morgan tried to encourage the quiet fox, who was now lighting another cigarette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey followed the raccoon across the car park; at least nobody would hear them this far away from the venue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the music died down a little as the girls all approached the raccoons truck. The paint was peeling, and he had seemingly fitted the back of the van with some kind of bed - he swung the back door open and grinned widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were nearly on the outskirts of forest at this spot in town. Liz had almost forgotten what nature felt like with how constantly busy Anthro city was. Back home there was almost nothing but quiet nature, but here it was a rather nice surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, girls. I like to call this the chick wagon, though I'm sure it can double up as the wolf and skunk wagon!\" He was seemingly trying to be funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Morgan raised eyebrows at each other, while Ashley stared on, eyes narrowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a serial killer?\" She asked the raccoon bluntly, who stared back at her just as blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... no?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was pretty surprised by how forthright Ashley seemed to be. She didn't seem to care what other people's impression of her was at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, what's in there?\" Liz tried to peek in cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a sick music setup, some cushions, y'know, fancy lights. You ladies want to come inside?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Gee, a small, crowded space? This guy is really signing his own death warrant...</i>' Liz thought to herself, grinning at Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty cramped inside the back of the truck, but somehow everyone managed to fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz, Morgan and Ashley sat on some small cushions on one side of the van, while the raccoon took a seat over by the speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of music would you girls like?\" He slurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Liz began, \"We have our own brand of music.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Morgan added, \"We make it ourselves.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon nodded. \"You're musicians?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that.\" Liz was trying not to giggle. \"We play very unique instruments.\" At this point she raised her eyebrows at Ashley, as if her very obvious double meaning wasn't coming through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. do you have your instruments on you?\" The raccoon picked up a beer can that had been left on the floor and tried to see if any was left inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. At all times.\" Morgan smiled, sharing a glance with Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'd love to hear a song!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz grinned deviously and leant forwards on the cushion, squinting one eye and letting a deep, sonorous fart purr from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds she let it stop, sighing in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh..\" the raccoon wasn't sure how to respond. Was he more drunk than he realised?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" Liz laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay! Everybody farts, right?\" He smiled, though the girls could tell his spirit was slightly broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true! Even me.\" Morgan added, leaning to one side and firing out a loud popper of a fart in Ashley's direction. The white fox looked down at where the sound was coming from, sniffing and then looking back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. are you two ok?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine. I guess those energy drinks gave us a little gas..\" Liz suddenly unleashed a masculine belch, beating her chest as it rumbled out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Maybe I should let some air in...\" The raccoon was starting to look upset at the smell and the fact that these girls had turned out to be not quite what he expected. Liz and Morgan took some pride in knowing that their farts could even be gross to a drunk fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need! There's <i>plenty</i> of air in here!\" Liz let out another fart, this one a bit wetter but still full and beefy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. Oh God.. you girls are gross..\" The raccoon started to cough, now regretting his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we were cute!\" Morgan played up an innocent voice, laughing as she stood up and walked around the cramped space in the back of the van, one eye squinted as she eased out a very lengthy fart, really testing out her newly discovered ability, making sure she stuck her ass out right into the drunken, disgusted raccoon's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's laughter turned into wide-eyed amazement as it kept going, and going, and going... it was almost turning out as long as some of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshely, on the other hand, was watching stone-faced, almost like someone intensely watching a serious play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHips thrust confidently backwards towards the raccoon and hands rested firmly on thighs, Morgan continued to push, push push, until a quieter, very wet and soggy squish could be heard. Her eyes bolted open immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God! Get the hell out! Last time I trust skanks from a Damned Beaver concert!\" He gagged, opening the doors and physically shoving the three girls out from his van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, Morgan!\" Liz let out spluttering laughter. \"You, uh, sure that was just air?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you didn't shit yourself?\" Ashley added, bypassing any innuendo Liz was attempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's expression was one of genuine fear. <br>\r\n\"N-No. I don't think so! I mean... oh God, you think I did? Maybe, but it felt normal.\" She was clearly visibly panicked at the idea she might have just soiled herself. Farting was one thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz dramatically wafted in front of her face. \"Oh, man! That one was a stinker! That was as potent as a bag of onions!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it sounded very wet.\" Ashley corroborated, looking Morgan up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, I'm hoping I didn't...y'know..! Geez... I should probably get to a bathroom...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could check it here.\" Liz suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? In the middle of the parking lot? What if somebody sees?\" Morgan looked around cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then they see. So what? Just slip your hand down there, check it's all clear, and you're good to go!\" The skunk took another sip from her can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could try the bathroom in the venue.\" Ashley suggested. A far more sensible idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh. You could. They might not let us back in, however.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I guess so.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, I\u2019ve got some little pills which alleviate nausea, but they\u2019re in my back pocket!

Did you just fucking fart in my face!?\u201d He clawed his nose and recoiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee, Sorry!

It\u2019s not embarrassing?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you couldn\u2019t already tell, I don\u2019t usually hang around with a whole lot of people, so I\u2019ll take what I can get.

There comes a time where every student must go their own way and leave the nest, so to speak.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs if you\u2019re going to stop farting even a little bit.\u201d Morgan grinned, walking away from the girls and wading through the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to even work out which way <i>was</i> the front, with sweaty bodies pushing into Morgan from every angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two of shoving and squeezing and nudging, Morgan was at the front, where furs were jumping and moving their bodies in time to the music, the lead singer on the verge of screaming into the mic, drowned out by the drums and guitars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dGuess this is as good an opportunity as I\u2019m gonna get.\u201d</i> Morgan thought to herself, bracing herself against the metal gate at the front of the crowd and feeling the gas loosen slowly and steadily, once more practicing the technique Liz had tried to impart on her, and feeling that it was working. Although she couldn\u2019t hear whatever sound her ass was currently making, she could feel the warm stream of air leaving it, leaking out into her pants and also the space around her. Hopefully it was a stinky one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took no longer than ten seconds for furs to start reacting. First by sniffing their own shirts to check it wasn\u2019t them, then holding their noses in disgust and gradually moving away from where the smell <i>seemed</i> to be coming from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan felt pretty proud of herself, watching as the crowd dispersed around her, leaving a nice gap, which Liz and Ashley promptly filled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk leaned over to Morgan and shouted in her ear \u201cNice one.\u201d Imitating a hand wafting in front of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that Morgan stopped to smell her own stink bomb, realising just how bad it really <i>did</i> smell. It was as if her fart-smell was getting worse with each one she ripped, but she felt pretty happy with that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls looked up from their newly acquired space as the song the band were playing died down and came to an end, followed by enthusiastic applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Morgan could lean over to speak to Liz, though...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"A concert seems a little counter-intuitive,\" Liz said. \"After all that work training Morgan to do some long ones, it almost seems like a waste to go somewhere where we can't hear them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're <i>not</i> going to a diner! I don't think I can eat another bite,\" Morgan said. \"Actually, hold on a sec.\" She bent a leg slightly. At first, the deep, brassy fart was incredibly loud. It quickly dropped in volume once she followed Liz's earlier tip and pushed gently, tapering off after about a dozen seconds. \"<i>Maybe</i> after a few dozen like that, there'll be enough room in my belly for food.\" Morgan and Liz chuckled, shooting brief glances at Ashley, in the vain hope that her face would show any sort of reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz wanted to remark about how she never had trouble making room for food despite her being constantly flatulent, but quickly figured the feeling of having that much gas must be new to Morgan. Instead, she merely turned to Ashley and asked, \"Anything else come to mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought, Ashley had an idea. \"Well, if you wanna hear those long ones loud and clear, the campus library is literally just around the corner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz liked this idea. She held back a laugh and exclaimed, \"Ash, you're a genius! Why didn't <i>I</i> think of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't call me 'Ash,'\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Sorry,\" Liz awkwardly apologized. She shot Morgan a quizzical look. This girl was a strange one: she barely reacted to a couple strangers walking up to her and ripping enormous farts around her, but calling her a nickname was the closest to seeing her express any emotion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. You didn't know. Anyway, the library's right over there. Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe library wasn't completely silent, as there were a few small groups of friends talking quietly amongst themselves. Still, the noise level was quiet enough that Liz felt even a weak fart from her would turn heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz walked around the large main room of the library, smiling to herself now and then. \"What's she doing?\" Ashley asked Morgan as the two vixens watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's looking for the best opportunity to let 'er rip,\" Morgan explained. \"I just hope she makes up her mind soon. I don't know how much longer I can hold it.\" As if on cue, her stomach growled a bit, but not out of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, so it was her idea to put me in the blast zone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it was mine,\" Morgan sheepishly admitted. \"We vixens gotta stick together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Ashley said, deadpan as ever, still watching the skunk at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few feet away, Liz gently tapped on the seat of a wooden chair. She then sat in it and nodded to herself, looking satisfied. She slowly got up, making sure to not accidentally let anything out as she rose and walked back to her new vixen friends. \"The way I see it, we got two main options.\" She gestured to the chair she just sat in. \"Those chairs over at that table are nice and hard. They're bound to amplify our farts and make them extra loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other option?\" Morgan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I looked around, I saw the door to the computer lab was open. Some poor schmuck is in there by himself. What do you say we keep him company? And block the door so he can't get out, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's just cruel,\" Morgan said with a chuckle. \"Hilarious, but cruel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I say we let Ashley decide,\" Liz said. \"It's only fair after subjecting her to our gas.\" Morgan's stomach churned once again. \"Sounds like you gotta think fast,\" Liz quickly added.</span></div></div>",

I'll bet if you make them extra loud as well, you could really freak people out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Liz said. \"Morgan, let's get ready to rumble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sniggered at her friend's pun and followed her. They sat on opposite sides of the table. \"Ooh, I see what you mean,\" Morgan said as her rump pressed against the hard chair. She lowered her voice so nearby patrons wouldn't hear her. \"Yeah, I can already tell this is gonna be like farting into a megaphone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded enthusiastically. \"Where's Ashley? Guess she's not sitting with us?\" The girls looked around and soon saw the white fox. She was a few feet away, arms crossed, leaning against a bookshelf. \"Guess it makes sense for her not to draw too much attention to herself. We don't go here, but she does, so she'll probably not wanna get into too much trouble. Anyway, you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan hesitated, still a little uncomfortable with the idea of just openly farting like Liz. Then her belly gurgled once more. This time it was a bit higher in pitch, as if her gas was whining to be let out. Finally, she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Liz said. \"Two butts are louder than one, so join me on the count of three. One... two... three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls felt the chairs vibrate underneath them as they began unleashing their duet of flatulence. Morgan's was very deep, whereas Liz's had a more raspy tone. What they had in common, however, was they were both extraordinarily loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the seconds droned on, the two couldn't help but notice it seemed everyone in the library was either starting at them or at least shooting occasional glances. Reactions varied from stifled giggles to faces twisted in disgust. What Liz found funniest was an otter who didn't look amused or grossed out, but rather concerned. From the look on his face, he seemed more worried about the girls' health than anything: surely there must be something wrong with them if they have this much gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Twenty-three... twenty-four... twenty-five,</i> Liz roughly timed in her head. As she looked around a bit, she noticed the only face that didn't seem to be wearing some kind of reaction was Ashley's. <i>How can that girl keep a straight face?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's face was far from straight. Especially when Morgan's grew even deeper and slightly wetter. The skunk seemed to view this as a challenge. She shut her eyes and focused. With enough concentration, she managed to bring hers nearly down to the same pitch, although it kept its dry, raspy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz estimated it was around the 45 second mark when Morgan finally dropped out. The vixen sitting across from her breathed a sigh of relief and chuckled as quietly as she could. <i>Oh,</i> now <i>she worries about making to much noise in here,</i> Liz thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shot a sly glance over to Ashley to make sure she was still watching. After a moment of thought, she stood up. As she lifted her behind from her seat, still farting, as expected, it got much quieter now that it wasn't rumbling against the chair. Again, Liz closed her eyes for a moment to concentrate. She began pushing harder and harder, until her unamplified fart grew very close to the volume it was at moments earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept it going as she slowly inched her way over to Morgan and aimed her rump at her new friend's face, just like when they first met earlier that day. Morgan, though still giggling, fanned the air in front of her face as she scooted her chair away from Liz, who didn't bother chasing her friend. Instead, she stayed put for a few seconds as the gas slowly but surely decrescendoed, growing quieter and quieter... until it picked back up again for a few brief seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was finally no longer able to contain herself. She burst into hysterics. She considered taking a bow after such an incredible \"performance.\" However, she soon spotted a security guard headed her way. \"We gotta go,\" she whispered to Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Liz rushed outside the library. They ran a few feet, until they were sure they were no longer being trailed. Still breathing heavily after sprinting, they burst into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Liz!\" Morgan said, \"I'll bet that library's gonna smell like your bitt for a whole week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, your smell's in there too!\" Liz reminded her. \"Good stuff back there. You really caught onto this whole long farting thing quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Morgan said. After a brief pause, she added, \"you know, I never really expected to feel like this, but I kinda felt a sense of pride back there. Like, that was easily the longest fart of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, trust me, I feel the same way when I do a really good one... wait a second, where's Ashley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here,\" a familiar monotone voice said a feet behind them. \"Figured I'd wait a bit to catch up so campus rent-a-cop back there wouldn't realize I was with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Liz said with a smirk. \"What did you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pause that felt like an hour to Liz, the white vixen finally offered her thoughts. \"That was cool.\" Liz waited a bit for her to elaborate. She was mainly used to people calling such displays funny or gross. She couldn't recall them being called cool. But Ashley didn't continue. Instead, she changed the subject. \"It's getting pretty late. Wanna sleepover at my place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Morgan said, stretching her arms and letting out a small yawn. \"I'm beat. I could really go for a--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slumber party!\" Liz interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was thinking more of a--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Slumber party!</b>\" Liz repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, if you insist,\" Morgan said. \"Lead the way, Ashley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Story continues here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/2095189-Liz-The-Gassy-Skunk/map/11111221112321\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interact/it...</a></font></span></div></div>",

Seems more subtle somehow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz chuckled. \"You just like the more torturous option, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe narrowed her eyes. \"I do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed over towards the door to the little room. It was over in a quiet corner of the library, meaning less furs were around to hear the soon-to-be goings on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls stepped inside, they all looked towards the yellow Labrador who was sat in there on his own. He rolled back and forwards gently in his chair, headphones over his head as he listened to some sort of music and typed up an essay on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's studying in the library this late?\" Morgan asked Liz quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Student life.\" The skunk responded with a smile, taking a look around and scouting out for some good pranking ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Ashley, can you stand by the door? Block the way out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean I just get to stand here and do nothing?\" She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\" The quiet fox closed the door behind her, resting against it as she watched what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Liz both took seats along the little row opposite the busy dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we just gonna let rip?\" Morgan asked Liz, still struggling to hold her gas in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if he's even gonna hear them.\" She gestured to the headphones. \"Let's see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her ass slightly up from her seat and expelled a little trumpety fanfare fart, causing Morgan to giggle. The student didn't seem to even hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess not.\" Morgan laughed, as she grabbed hold of the desk in front of her, leaning forwards on her chair and finally loosening the tight grip she'd had on her gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt it flow out warm and slightly wet against the seat, croaking loudly - a little like a moist frog, Liz thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even really trying to, Morgan managed to keep this one going a while, she released it nice and slowly, though she felt very little pressure against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked on, impressed, as Morgan passed the ten second mark. She counted each second off on her fingers, as roughly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's face scrunched up a little as she gasped and kept it going; it felt like such a relief to just get rid of all the pent-up gas, she wasn't even too conscious of how long it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz kept looking back and forwards between Morgan and the labrador. His music must have been turned up really loud...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty three seconds, Morgan's rip tapered off to its end. She gasped loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Dear God, Morgan!</i> That was your longest yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Liz, slightly breathless. \"Yeah? How long?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around the twenty second mark!\" Liz announced, watching Morgan nod to herself proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's like one of yours!\" The fox grinned triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was going to make some comment about how it might have been close to one of her weak ones, but she didn't want to squander her student's self esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked at them both with a blank face, as she had done throughout the entire fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He still didn't hear you, but I wouldn't be surprised if he picked up on the smell pretty soon.\" Ashley scrunched her nose up a little to accentuate her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang. It's ironic that we're a library and we're having trouble getting our farts heard.\" Morgan pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz agreed. \"Looks like we're just gonna have to get his attention.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up from her chair, waltzing over to where the Labrador was sitting and turning around, her shapely skunk butt hovering merely inches away from the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you do the honors?\" She held an extended index finger out towards Morgan, who smiled and obliged, giving it a quick tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz squeezed out one of her louder ones, ripping through her jeans and popping out behind the student's head. Within seconds he turned round, surprised, to see a skunk bent over In front of him ripping ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" He pulled his headphones off.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smiled at Morgan and turned round to face him. \"Oh! I'm sorry - I didn't see you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pinched his nose, looking between the three girls.<br>\r\n\"Eugh... that's fucking gross!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sorry</i> - something I ate.\" Liz giggled girlishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan lifted one of her legs and freed a deep, wet fart from underneath her. Although she tried letting this one out slowly too, it only lasted about three seconds. <br>\r\n\"Something I ate, too.\" She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley watched the situation play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh My god! You girls have no manners, do you? I'm out of here!\" He angrily logged out and marched towards the door, only to have Ashley stand in his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Get out my way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said get out of my way, freak!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Liz watched as Ashley's eyes widened. Though her face was still expressionless, they could tell she was pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed the dog with a surprising strength, sending him topping over backwards, falling down on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Ow!!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked over towards Liz and Morgan. \"Do your worst to this asshole.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nodded, and both hurried over to where he lay on his front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz took a seat on his back, while Morgan squatted down in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls almost simultaneously let out loud, boisterous farts. Liz's was full-toned and loud, while Morgan's was bubbly and a little wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shouted out, kicking his legs and beating his fists against the floor as he felt the vibrations of Liz's gas against his back and the strong, disgusting smell of Morgan's right into his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! That kinda slipped out!\" Morgan commented jokingly, bearing down as she tested out her technique again. She grimaced and pushed - slowly - steadily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the sound coming out of her was gross and wet, but quieter than Liz's. she closed her eyes and focused on making this one long... pushing slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked over. Grinning to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt carried on, and on, and on a little longer... Morgan reached down and spread one cheek slightly, making the sound brighter and more crackly. She could still feel some gas pooled by her butt as it flowed out slowly, and she felt as if she could just keep it going and going...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Labrador tried to hold his breath, still struggling. His eyes watered slightly as Morgan managed to keep going past her previous record... 24 seconds.. 25, 26, 27, 28,29...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt died down and Morgan breathed in and out loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! You're acing these long ones, gurl!!\" Liz cheered on her friend, giving her a little round of applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... I felt like I nearly passed out on that one..\" Morgan looked over with a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of passing out..\" Liz stood up.<br>\r\n\"Better let this one go. I don't wanna give him too much.\" She patted the lab on the back as she stood up slowly, close to sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls are... inhuman! I'm telling the principal..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley allowed him to leave, glaring at him, the smallest traces of a smirk almost crawling across the sides of her mouth - but only almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awesome.\" She said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! Morgan put on a really great display, huh? Still got gas after that one?\" Liz elbowed her friend in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. I think so. I'm sure I do, my stomach still feels a bit shaky.\" Morgan responded, giving it a little pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should probably get out of here pretty soon. Before that guy brings security back with him.\" Ashley stepped outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. Let's run!\" The girls headed off out the library as fast as they could manage, with Ashley walking behind them at a moderate pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were far away enough from the campus, the girls stopped. \"That was fun.\" Liz caught her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think that was too far or anything? I farted right in his face... that must have smelled pretty awful.\" Morgan laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shook her head. \"Nah, that guy was a huge jerk to Ashley. He deserved a little gassing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked between the girls. She had enjoyed watching them get payback on him, even if it was in a really weird way. \"I'm used to it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, people being jerks?\" Morgan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Got it a lot in highschool.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, that sucks! You seem pretty cool so far!\" Liz grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. You two are interesting.\" Ashley commented in her usual monotone way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I'm kinda tired. Might be time to hit the hay.\" Morgan yawned quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two can come sleep in my dorm for the night if you want. Saves you the walk back to yours.\" Ashley offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure about that? Your roommate won't mind?\" Morgan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't have a roommate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I was supposed to, but I didn't get one. Just me, but it means I've got a lot of room. Enough room for you two to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure having us both in a confined space is a good idea?\" Liz smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley shrugged. \"I sleep by the window.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it's okay with you, maybe we could sleep over.\" Morgan smiled warmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, slumber party!!\" Liz exclaimed, getting excited at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I'm kinda tired... I was just gonna head to sle-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Slumber party!!!</b>\" Liz interrupted Morgan, throwing her arms up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez. Okay.\" Morgan rolled her eyes and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have snacks and stuff.\" Ashley added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled. Lead the way!\" </span></div></div>",

The main area housed Ashley's bed, along with a pretty large TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls had a few posters here and there, of TV shows, movies, some bands Liz and Morgan had vaguely heard of and some they'd never come across before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilarly to their room, two doorways led off to a small kitchen and small bathroom respectively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little crate full of vinyl records sat at the end of Ashley's bed, with a turntable set up beside them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a pretty neatly-kept room, aside from a few wrappers and cans here or there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bigger than our room!\" Morgan observed frustratedly. \"And we have to fit two people in ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AU are known for their small dorms.\" Ashley pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've actually got a TV, too.\" Liz smirked to Morgan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, slumber party time!\" Liz grinned widely, the last time she'd actually had a slumber party was when she was about eight or nine. She desperately wanted to experience all that fun she'd missed out on all these years. Nobody had really wanted someone as volatile and gassy and Liz sleeping over, but now she was with someone who found it funny, and someone who didn't seem to care, it didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mentioned snacks?\" Liz's ears almost pricked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Check the kitchen. There's some soda, some chips, probably some popcorn somewhere around.\" Ashley scooted over to the window by her bed and pushed it open, pulling a cigarette out of her pocket and lighting it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... are you sure you can do that in here?\" Morgan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was silent for a moment. \"I just do it by the window.\" She continued lighting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her window she could look out across the campus; it was mostly quiet at this time. She could also see the edge of a forest that sat behind the university on the very outskirts of the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz walked back out of the kitchen, carrying several bags of potato chips and popcorn and a six pack of soda, wobbling around as she tried not to drop it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're loaded! It's like snack heaven in there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never know when you might need some.\" Ashley eyed Liz up, watching as she placed the food down on the floor where Morgan sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what slumber party stuff are we gonna do?\" Morgan looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz tapped her bottom lip, taking a look at what was on offer. \"Do you have any movies or anything?\" She asked Ashley, who was currently blowing smoke out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. There's a box of some old DVDs by the TV. Bunch of old horror movies and stuff.\" She responded as blankly as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Movie night is a possibility. That's a sleepover-y thing to do, right?\" Liz asked Morgan, open for more suggestions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, don't girls usually, like, give each other make overs at slumber parties?\" Morgan suggested as she looked at both Liz and Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not touching a single hair on my head.\" The vixen responded, eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like that's off the table.\" Liz laughed at Ashley's constant nonchalantness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about truth or dare.\" Ashley suggested, taking a puff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! That's a typical slumber party thing!\" Morgan suggested with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's two choices!\" Liz tried to pick one...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz thought her options over quickly as she shoved a handful of popcorn into her mouth. \"We gotta play truth or dare!\" she declared after swallowing. \"You can ask first,\" Liz said, turning her head to Ashley. \"Your idea, your room, it's only fair.\" She cracked open a can of soda and took a big swig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works for me,\" Ashley blankly said. \"Liz, truth or--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dare!\" Liz interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley took one final drag of her cigarette before she put it out and flicked the butt out  of the window. Liz thought to call her out on being a litterbug, but soon realized it was almost certainly to get rid of any evidence of her smoking in the room, as it had to be against the rules, so she held her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dare you... to go a full hour without farting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it?\" Liz asked cockily. \"Pfft, easy!\" She made a dismissive gesture with her hand. She was used to holding them in during classes and at formal events she had to attend, although in her case it was mainly to help get them over with as quickly as possible rather than out of embarrassment or even a fear of getting into trouble. Plus she liked letting them build up for a while...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just gonna give you a chance to change your mind,\" Liz said. \"The longer I hold it in, the bigger it's gonna be next time it comes out and you've already seen what I can do without much buildup. So, are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley simply nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Liz said, \"don't say I didn't warn ya! Not sure why that's the dare you wanna go with, but I'm more than happy to take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It probably was a dare mostly for her own benefit,\" Morgan pointed out as she opened a can of cola, herself. \"It at least buys her some time before you start stinking up the place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo.\" It was a bit surreal to hear this word said with about as much enthusiasm as a math teacher explaining quadratic expansion, so Morgan and Liz giggled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why not dare me to go longer or something?\" Liz wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't want you to explode,\" Ashley said with just a hint of sarcasm in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you're not allowed to smoke in here, I'd say I'd be doing you a favor by helping mask the smell!\" Liz joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, you might wanna take a break from using your lighter once that hour's up,\" Morgan chimed in. \"That is, unless you <i>want</i> to burn the whole place down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz chuckled at this. Ashley, however, <i>might</i> have moved a corner of her mouth into the very beginning of a smirk. There was a very understated change in her face that was so subtle and went as quickly as it came that it could have just as easily been seen as a trick of the light. Aside from this, her only reaction was a dry, although apparently sincere, \"That's funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess it's my turn to ask. So, Morgan... truth or dare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan thought for a moment. \"You know what? Dare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping you'd say that.\" A mischievous look was on Liz's face. \"I dare you to call the last person you talked to on your phone... and fart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan blushed a little. It wasn't so embarrassing to do it around Liz or Ashley since they expect it from her. But she couldn't recall the last time she farted around her usual group of friends. Morgan took a deep breath. The last person she called was Samantha, a close friend of hers since middle school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was just about to press the button to call her back when Liz spoke up again. \"Put it on speaker,\" Liz said, \"I wanna hear their reaction!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan took a deep breath and reluctantly complied. After a couple rings, Samantha answered. \"Hello?\" Came a tired-sounding, quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam,\" Morgan said. \"Hope I didn't wake you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, don't worry, you didn't,\" Sam replied with a yawn. \"You caught me right when I was about to go to bed. So what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shot a glance at Liz, who was making a rolling motion with her finger in a \"get on with it\" gesture. But it was still taking Morgan a bit of time to work up the courage to do it. She looked at Ashley to see if she, too, was growing impatient, but after a couple seconds, Ashley just started looking out of the window, hard to read as ever. \"Morgan?\" the voice on the phone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" Morgan said. \"I know you still live with your folks, but those of us living on campus moved in today,\" Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right,\" Sam said. \"I almost forgot your parents are moving so you gotta stay in those tiny dorms. That's gotta suck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't actually seem like it'll be too bad,\" Morgan said. \"My roommate seems nice and she's really funny! Oh, and this: she's a skunk that can't spray! She says her scent gland never developed or something like that.\" Morgan left out the other, more significant effect of Liz's disorder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's great that you got one that you get along with! I've heard some horror stories from my brother about when Roommate Roulette doesn't go your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Morgan said. \"I mean this girl, Liz, I can already tell she's a pretty energetic gal: total extravert. But, hey, that just means I can't see myself getting bored around her anytime soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like I should meet her sometime!\" Sam said with a small chuckle. Liz shot Morgan a smirk and nodded, clearly interested in showing off to Morgan's friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe.\" Morgan said. This time, her tone was almost as flat as Ashley's. She had no idea how Sam was going to react to the real reason she was calling, let alone Liz. Speaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan finally decided she had stalled enough. With a small grunt, she forced out a rather loud fart. She did not use any of Liz's earlier tips. She had no interest in potentially grossing out her friend any more than she had to, thus the trumpeting blast only lasted a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... did you just...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta go, bye!\" Morgan quickly said, blushing profusely as she hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on!\" Liz groaned. \"Hanging up right after defeats the entire point of putting it on speaker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Morgan explained, \"I got nervous. I never really did that around any of my friends besides you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't <i>I</i> feel honored?\" Ashley sarcastically said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan took a sip of her soda, letting out a small belch after she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I'm still allowed to do that!\" Liz said. She chugged the rest of her drink and unleashed a massive, most unladylike belch. It almost sounded more like the roar of a ferocious predator than a burp. It didn't last anywhere nearly as long as the gaseous emissions she was more known for, but she still kept it going for a surprising 15 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we don't have to worry about not waking the neighbors anymore,\" Ashley quipped. Liz responded by swallowed some air and burping once more. Nowhere near as long, but loud enough to prove Ashley's point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You done?\" Morgan teasingly asked, \"Because I'd like to move this game along!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it,\" Liz said, shoving some popcorn into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth or dare?\" Morgan asked Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earlier, you didn't like it when Liz called you 'Ash.' Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sighed. \"Had a falling out with some people who I thought were my friends. That's what they used to call me.\" There was a long pause. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I was hoping for, you know... details? A story?\" Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't ask for them. And, to tell the truth, I'd prefer not to waste another minute thinking of those backstabbers.\" Morgan and Liz exchanged glances. There was another ominous pause. Ashley pulled out a cigarette, but seemed like she didn't know whether she wanted to smoke it or not, so she indecisively fidgeted with it. \"Look, I'm sure it's pretty obvious I'm a bit of a loner. I never had many friends. Then one day, I realized I had even less friends than I thought,\" she said cryptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got me and Morgan!\" Liz said. \"I mean, I know we just met, but at least you trust us enough to invite us over to your place. That's a start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard not to trust someone who farts in front of you,\" Ashley said. Morgan and Liz couldn't tell whether this was a joke or not. Their confusion showed clearly on their faces, so Ashley explained, \"There's just something about you two that seems genuine to me. It's hard for me to put into words. I guess it's like, if you're not going to hide your farts, then what <i>are</i> you going to hide, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought of it that way!\" Liz chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley ultimately decided to put the cigarette back in its pack. \"Anyway, back to the game...\"</span></div></div>",

With Liz's gas put on mute for the rest of the hour, she had to find a task equally as gross for the skunk to carry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I know... heh. You may not be able to fart, but <i>I</i> can! I dare you to sniff one of my farts point blank!\" The vixen looked up at Ashley, half expecting the white fox to laugh at the idea, but unsurprisingly getting her expressionless eyes staring back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! That's easy! When are you guys gonna start giving me some challenges?\" The skunk chortled confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, get this one out of the way first and next time I'll give you something <i>really</i> disgusting.\" Morgan was already cooking up ideas in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shrugged, as Morgan put down her can of soda and stood up, squatting slightly and lifting her tail away from her butt. She wanted to show Liz what she was really made of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunkette scooted over on the floor and stuck her sniffer against Morgan's jean-clad butt, giggling intermittently as she closed her eyes and braced for what was coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan squeezed slowly, allowing a bubbling, wet-sounding fart out against Liz's snout, leaning forwards slightly as it rumbled her butt for a solid seven seconds; nowhere near as long as some of her earlier farts but still fairly impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley watched Liz's face immediately crumple up, taking a sniff and trying her hardest to stifle the coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh... I'll give it to you, Morgan, that does smell rancid! I'm getting you back for that. Just you wait!\" She comically wafted her hand In front of her face and produced a kittenish giggle, sitting back and coughing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that so easy, huh?\" Morgan taunted jokingly, sitting back down and noting the smelly gas still lingering in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That really <i>does</i> smell bad!\" The fox laughed along with Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical lactose fart.\" Ashley added bluntly, her nostrils flaring a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Morgan. Your turn, and Ashley's giving you the dare this time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm gonna go truth on this one. Somehow I get the feeling Ashley's gonna try and dare me to stop farting, too.\" Morgan referenced the potency of her last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley thought for a second, eyes looking up in concentration, before they slowly settled back on Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna be generic here. Who was your last boyfriend?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, geez.\" Morgan had been thinking of farts so much lately she'd forgotten some of the dares or truths might not be related to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there was this guy in senior high. Ugh. He was a bit of a jerk, I was just dating him because I thought he was kinda cute, but his personality didn't match his looks...\" Morgan rolled her eyes as she remembered the whole affair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything interesting happen there?\" Liz asked, opening another bag of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. We went out for about two months and then he left me for some cheerleader. I can hardly believe how polite and innocent I was back then. You would never have caught me farting anywhere near anybody\" Morgan laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, glad to see you've come such a long way!\" Liz laughed with her. \"It's no fun being scared of farting!\" Recalling how polite Morgan had been even a few hours ago when they met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Your turn now, Ashley!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen nodded. \"I'm still gonna stay safe here and go with truth. I can't even imagine what you two would have me do for a dare.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got one.\" Liz raised her hand halfway, still munching loudly on chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that tattoo about on your arm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked down, lifting her sleeve to expose a little tattoo of a lighthouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lighthouse.\" She responded blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Yeah, but like... Is there a story behind it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"I was in high school. A bit tipsy one night. Out with a guy somewhere, just kinda happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why a lighthouse?\" Morgan asked. Even when Ashley was opening up, she still managed to sound elusive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like lighthouses. Wouldn't mind living in one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't argue with that.\" Liz laughed. \"I've always toyed with the idea of a tattoo one day in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah - a big stamp that says 'warning: toxic gas leaks imminent' on your ass.\" Morgan chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A skull and crossbones.\" Liz added, laughing loudly. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This time with Liz giving you something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen grabbed her pillow, fluffing it up and using it to sit against the wall, letting a biting breeze in through the open window.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you better go with a dare this time!\" Liz commanded jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded. \"Fine. Dare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smirked. Morgan could tell just by the expression on her face she had something devious up her sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dare you to chug a carton of milk.\" The skunk let out a hammed-up evil laugh and rubbed her paws together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God. That's brutal!\" Morgan concurred, laughing and looking over at the white fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so, but I can't guarantee good results.\" Ashley got up from her bed, heading over to the little kitchen and grabbing a carton of milk from the fridge. She brought it back in with her and sat on her bed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear..\" Morgan laughed, feeling a little bad for Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox used her thumb to flick the cap off in one movement, lifting her head back and gulping down the entire carton of milk, not even stopping for air until the whole thing was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez. You're gonna go nuclear!\" Liz grabbed her sides in a laughing fit. She could hardly even imagine Ashley farting at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white vixen used her hand to stifle a burp, throwing the carton to the floor. \"You guys made me do this. Don't say I didn't warn you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, while that's brewing, it's your turn, Liz! And I believe it's Ashley's turn to give you a dare.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" Liz was expecting something as payback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you wanted something gross, right?\" Ashley wiped the little milk mustache from her top lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me your worst!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Ok. I got one. You and Morgan... have to switch underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Morgan was a little surprised Ashley had come out with something like that, but also amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. One of you goes in the bathroom, takes your panties off, the other one goes in and changes. You've gotta keep them like that for the rest of the night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's gross.\" Morgan chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it.\" Liz added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz got up and went into the little bathroom off to one side of the room, locking the door, and emerging a few moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. They're all yours.\" She gestured the way for Morgan, who got up herself and headed inside. After a few seconds she came out, looking slightly disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're warm.\" She shivered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably from farts.\" Liz pointed out, as she went into the bathroom to change for the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh la la, pink!\" She shouted out mockingly, appearing from the bathroom a few moments later adjusting her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least they're not <i>green</i>.\" Moran teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, those were white when I bought them - I've just farted in them <i>soo</i> much.\" Liz joked, laughing at her own dumb joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know. It feels really weird wearing someone else's underwear. Thank god they didn't have skid marks in them or something.\" Morgan shuffled her butt around on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Morgan. I have control.\" Liz laughed. \"If anything the ones you've been letting out sound more dangerous.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, that's just how junk food affects me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost on cue, a very audible, low groaning sound came from the bed. Liz and Morgan looked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my stomach.\" Ashley said, rubbing her belly a bit but still showing no emotions. It was as if this girl couldn't feel pain or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beginning!\" Liz clapped her hands together - she was eager to see what Ashley was able to produce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you probably wont have to wait much longer. I already feel like I need to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep, resonant rumbling thundered through the bed sheets. Ashley exhaled quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...fart.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one!\" Liz giggled. She was about ready to demonstrate one of her own for comparison, but quickly remembered the little fart ban Ashley had put on her. She was already feeling the gas turn over and brew up in her belly like a storm waiting to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That shook the bed!\" Morgan laughed in her cute singsong way. With Ashley there was no 'excuse me' or 'sorry'. She cared as much about breaking wind as she did most everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My stomach hurts. Maybe I should have stopped at half that carton.\" Her brow furrowed very slightly as she felt her abdomen cramp up painfully. The vixen had managed to avoid mostly anything containing dairy for a good month and a half, so her body was reacting even worse to the sudden reintroduction of it than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah! Now you can be as gassy as me and Morgan.\" Liz's lips curled into a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley didn't respond verbally, instead leaning slightly to one side and letting another tuba-like blast graze her bedsheets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got some powerful-sounding farts there!\" Morgan was still surprised to hear the vixen letting farts out, though she wasn't totally surprised at her lack of attention towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. I'm going to take that as a complement, I guess.\" She responded flatly, reaching to take a cigarette from her pocket but then thinking against the idea; she couldn't help but take Liz's joke about using her lighter half seriously now her own gas would be polluting the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh. I've got my next dare for you, Morgan.\" Liz was looking evil again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says I was gonna pick dare anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, cmon, of course you were!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded. \"Go on then. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well - as punishment for that last one you gave me, I dare you to take a faceful of one of Ashley's farts!\" She pointed at the vixen who just sort of looked up, eyes going between Liz and Morgan as she scratched her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God... I guess I deserve it.\" Morgan giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley didn't protest, she didn't seem grossed out; she just shuffled along her bed, lying down on one side so her butt stuck out over the side of the bed, primed for Morgan to get her snout in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My stomach feels a little better in this position.\" The fox grumbled to herself, an aggressively loud fart ripping from her butt, followed by a burdened sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was even more nervous after hearing it go off. She knew from her own experience that lactose intolerance lead to some pretty nasty results, and she didn't even have it as badly as Ashley claimed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan very hesitantly slid across the floor, sticking her neck out so her nose approached the back of Ashley's short skirt. She understood how Liz probably felt moments before she'd blasted her in the face, but Morgan had no idea what to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear the whines and groans of Ashley's belly protesting against all the milk she had given it. Ashley herself was looking down at her phone, barely even paying attention to the face in her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning another loud, slightly long fart gulped out from Ashley's butt, sounding a little like a growling dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan closed her eyes and chanced a sniff, immediately she was hit by a 100 tonne stink, so alarmingly rancid it sent her jolting back a couple of meters, paws clasping her nose as she gagged loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my <i>God</i>! That is awful!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warned you.\" Ashley said simply, still tapping her fingers against her phone screen casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that even rivals how bad your ones stink, Liz!\" Morgan flapped her paws desperately in front of her face, tongue outstretched in pure disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really? Let me try.\" Liz shuffled over towards Ashley's butt, as if it were some kind of public service anyone could waltz over and smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" Ashley massaged her stomach slowly. It felt volatile enough that she didn't have to wait around long for some gas to be produced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother full-toned fart grumbled from Ashley's butt. She pushed it a little, making it rise up in volume at the end. Her farts were more expressive than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz bravely took a deep whiff, Morgan could see her grimace almost immediately, but she managed to keep her head in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like sour milk.\" The skunk commented through gritted teeth. \"Yeah, ok, that does smell pretty pungent! I'm impressed, Ashley!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen looked round at Liz. \"Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz scooted back across the floor to her original position, rubbing her nose a bit which was stinging slightly and opening a new can of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sat back up, leaning against the wall and deciding she would, in fact, have another cigarette, despite the increased methane within her vicinity. The vixen sniffed, paused, and pulled her shirt up over her snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things are gonna get even more interesting now!\" Liz was already trying to think of dares she could give Ashley now she had a little fuel in the tank, and as a payback for her still-ongoing fart ban.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear Ashley didn't particularly care about farting, but then she didn't <i>appear</i> to care about anything. She seemed shy enough that she still wouldn't be as open about doing it in front of loads of other furs. She wasn't someone who did it for fun and pranks like Liz and Morgan, but her apathy meant she blended in pretty well with the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, who's next?\" Morgan asked cheerfully. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOoh! Ooh! Pick me!\u201d Liz enthusiastically volunteered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I even have to ask?\u201d Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess not,\u201d Liz said. \u201cJust hit me with your best dare!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Ashley said. \u201cI\u2019ll need some help from Morgan for this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sure,\u201d Morgan said, a little awkwardly, not knowing what she was agreeing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you wanted a gross dare,\u201d Ashley said. She shifted her position, now sitting up straight instead of slouching. \u201cNastiest I can think of right now is trapping you under the sheets while we fart into them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, the old dutch oven! A classic, for sure,\u201d Liz said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame I never really got to pull that one. People seem to know better than to fall asleep near me, I guess.\u201d She briefly considered farting to emphasize her point, but then remembered the dare she had taken earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stood up to let Liz crawl into the bed.  She lied dead center on the bed as a vixen sat on either side of her. It was a bit of a tight fit on the smallish bed. They foxes soon adjusted themselves so that they were sitting on the edge of the bed with their rumps mere inches from Liz\u2019s head. <i>I guess I deserve this,</i> Liz thought. <i>It</i> is <i>my fault that Ashley\u2019s like this right now, after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought had barely entered her mind when two farts started sounding in unison. Morgan quickly covered Liz\u2019s head with the covers while Ashley simply messed around on her phone. At first, Liz found herself laughing. It was instinctual to her: something about the sound never got old to her. Then Morgan\u2019s started growing fuller, deeper, and wetter. While Morgan kept hers going an impressive amount of time, Ashley was simply ripping a barrage of smaller farts, one right after the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Liz was about to make a snarky comment telling Morgan to go easy on her panties, the smell began to finally start getting her. She could tell most of the stench seemed to be coming to her from Ashley\u2019s direction. The eggy, sulfuric smell actually caused her to dry heave a little. It would have been difficult to bear on its own right, but when it was combined with Morgan\u2019s, it almost felt too much for Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like she\u2019s had enough,\u201d Ashley said. Morgan nodded in agreement, although it took her a few seconds to actually gain enough control to stop herself from farting. She finally pulled the covers off of Liz\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz coughed a bit. \u201cI gotta hand it to you. That was a lot tougher than I thought it\u2019d be!\u201d Though she was gasping for air, she was also laughing. It was as if the part of her that wasn\u2019t grossed out by the smell was impressed at what her new friends had managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like you finally got a dare that actually challenged you!\u201d Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say!\u201d Liz said. She sat up and maneuvered her way off the bed, sitting back on the spot on the floor she had been sitting on earlier, clearly eager to get away from the smell, although she didn\u2019t seem quite ready to admit it. To Liz\u2019s surprise, Morgan stayed put, still sitting near Ashley on the other side of the bed. \u201cAlright, Morgan. Truth or dare?\u201d Liz asked as Ashley put her phone away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTruth,\u201d Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, that\u2019s no fun,\u201d Liz said, disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t even get the full brunt of that, but do you think I\u2019m gonna go dare when we\u2019ve got someone here who can outstink a skunk?\u201d Morgan giggled and shot Ashley a glance, but the only reaction the other vixen gave her was a small shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point, I guess,\u201d Liz said. She quickly tried to think of a question to ask Morgan. \u201cThat phone call with that one friend of yours\u2026 Sam, was it? When she talked about meeting me, it got me thinking. I\u2019m still new to this city so I could really use some new friends. Think there are any of your friends who wouldn\u2019t mind hanging with a gal like me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I knew for sure,\u201d Morgan said, \u201cbut I just don\u2019t know. Maybe a couple of them wouldn\u2019t mind your, er, talent after they\u2019ve known you for a while? I mean, I can already tell you\u2019re smart, friendly, and funny. As long as you don\u2019t meet them on a full stomach, you could probably make a good first impression with most of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe problem with that is that I\u2019ve <i>always</i> got a full stomach,\u201d Liz said. Her stomach gurgled loudly, emphasizing her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan chuckled. \u201cTrue. But I meant as long as you don\u2019t, like, eat a whole can of beans before you meet them. Maybe I\u2019ll introduce you to a couple of them later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Liz said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Guess that means you\u2019re next,\u201d Morgan said to Ashley. \u201cTruth or dare?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTruth,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan thought for a moment. \u201cYou know, I can\u2019t help but wonder. If you know milk does this to you, why did you have a whole carton of it in the fridge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if on cue, a soft, almost purring noise came from the white vixen\u2019s rump. It was far from the loudest fart the girls had heard that night, just barely audible over Morgan and Liz\u2019s snickering, but it was surprisingly long, considering it didn\u2019t come from either of the gassier girls. Liz estimated it was a good ten, maybe twelve seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that answer your question?\u201d Liz answered on Ashley\u2019s behalf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if ignoring both the fart and the remark, Ashley answered, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I bought the thing planning to chug it all at once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Morgan said, \u201cbut I mean, why did you have it at all? I mean, there are plenty of dairy-free alternatives out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust never really cared for them,\u201d she said. \u201cPlus regular milk\u2019s more affordable when you\u2019re on a college student budget. Besides, it\u2019s not like I have to worry about having a roommate to deal with the fallout.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cI should\u2019ve I guessed the reason was something like that. You don\u2019t exactly strike me as the type of girl who goes out of her way to get gas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean like you?\u201d Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan blushed slightly. \u201cHuh, I guess you\u2019re right. You know, it\u2019s kind of weird\u2026 I\u2019ve only been like this today. I mean, yeah, I\u2019ve always found farts funny, but until I met Liz, I\u2019ve never really acted like this. I\u2019m still not used to being thought of as the gassy girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz held back a laugh. \u201cWell, then, I\u2019m glad I was able to improve your reputation!\u201d Morgan rolled her eyes and threw a pillow at Liz, although the smirk on the red fox\u2019s face showed she wasn\u2019t entirely annoyed at this interruption. \u201cOoh, pillow fight! How did we forget that when we were coming up with slumber party activities? Although I\u2019d still like to play at least one more round of Truth or Dare. After all, there\u2019s only like five more minutes left until my first dare ends!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess that gives me time to smoke one more cigarette before this place turns into a complete fire hazard,\u201d Ashley said, her deadpan delivery getting a few chuckles from the other girls.</span></div></div>",

She didn't even need to ask 'truth or dare' at this point; she knew what Liz was going to choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, let me think...\" the vixen pushed her lower lip out and looked around, trying to think of something gross enough to meet Liz's quota. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley let out another very low, growling fart into the bed, her cigarette lit as she held it towards the open window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ashley, is that your laundry over there?\" Morgan pointed to a small basket of clothes by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white fox looked over, then back down at her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has it been washed yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Liz, you've got to find the dirtiest item of clothing in there, and <i>lick</i> it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, you sure Ashley won't mind a bit of skunk salvia on her dirty laundry?\" Liz was trying to worm out of the dare if she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna be washed anyway.\" Ashley pointed out, and Morgan flashed a sly little '<i>told you so</i>' look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine...\" the skunk scooted over to the basket, rooting through like an adventurer hunting for treasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh, you have a lot of black in your wardrobe, huh?\" She called over to Ashley, who was still doing... something on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of these are that dirty..\" she gave a pair of socks a sniff. \"Smelly, maybe..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everyone goes around soiling themselves like you two.\" The vixen responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! We don't go <i>that</i> far!\" Morgan laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These seem good.\" Liz pulled out a pair of tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost furs would probably be embarrassed at someone going through their laundry, but Ashley, as always, didn't seem to show much of a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz didn't waste any time in giving one big lick along the sweaty pair of tights, Morgan seemed to show more of a repulsed attitude than her skunky friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tangy.\" Liz commented jokingly, throwing the piece of clothing back into the basket and shuffling over to her original spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gas was almost at breaking point, and as she eyed up the clock every few seconds she was told that she didn't have long left before her ban was lifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it's your turn, Morgan!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll have to go dare this time.\" She looked at Ashley, whose turn it was to administer the dare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white vixen put her phone back into her pocket, stopping whatever it was she was doing on it to think up another gross dare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dare you to call one of your parents and fart.\" She said softly, with little delay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez. Ashley coming out with the brutal dares...\" Liz had to say she was impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, c'mon... I can't... no way!\" Morgan blushed, it was one thing to call her friends and let one rip, but her parents? Though she'd probably done it around them a few times in the past, something about doing it intentionally just seemed too embarrassing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could probably convince Sam that I was drunk calling her or something, but I just can't bring myself to do that with my parents..\" Morgan, as confident as she'd become in the span of a day, felt she might have to chicken out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I dunno, Morgan, you'll have to take the forfeit if you can't do it!\" Liz jeered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What's the forfeit gonna be?\" Morgan looked between the two other girls nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a good idea.\" Ashley said bluntly, getting up from her bed (letting out a short fart in the process) and walking over to a cupboard. She opened up and had a little look through until she seemingly found what she wanted - a belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you forfeit, you have to have your head tied to Liz's ass when her hour is up.\" She pulled the belt out between her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you have a belt in there?\" Liz looked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I think some guy left it here. Maybe it was in the room when I got it. I don't know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God..\" Morgan laughed. \"You know what? I think I've inhaled enough Liz farts today to put up with that. How long for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's say five minutes.\" Liz suggested, \"We don't want you to pass out or anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowing you, after five minutes you'll still be on the <i>first</i> fart...\" Morgan chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shrugged. \"It's your choice. You can always take the plunge and go for that dare..\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't think I'd be up for calling my folks right now, either.\" She followed this with a low fart that sounded as monotonous as her speaking voice. As it droned on, it became clear that it would still take a while for the effects of the milk to wear off. Liz would have felt bad for subjecting Ashley to that dare if the fox seemed capable of expressing any kind of discomfort, embarrassment, or <i>any</i> emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, I'm sure your folks would understand,\" Liz said to both vixens. \"Wait, what am I doing?\" She quickly added, \"I'm not gonna talk you out of forfeiting! Not if it means I get to fart in your face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan chuckled a bit nervously. While a part of her felt like she could handle anything Liz could throw at her, given how much she already had endured from her, she wasn't exactly looking forward to putting her face right next to her incredibly gassy friend's rump. The rather mischievous smirk on Liz's face wasn't exactly reassuring, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Morgan knew her parents. They raised her to be rather ladylike in certain regards. In fact, it was probably largely because of the way they brought her up that made her still a bit shy about doing it in public. Although, now that she thought about it, perhaps flatulence being such a taboo subject in her house was also part of what wound up making it so funny to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ashley, wanna bring that belt over here?\" Liz asked, interrupting Morgan's train of thought. \"By the time we get her strapped in, I'd say my hour will be up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley responded wordlessly with a simple, subtle nod. Morgan fell to her knees as the other vixen quietly approached. Liz raised her tail, allowing Morgan to assume her position. Though still a bit hesitant, Morgan mostly got over her reservations when she reminded herself this wasn't the first time Liz farted in her face. Given her new roommate's condition and personality, it likely wouldn't be the last, either. Still, the rather loud noises coming from Liz's belly was almost enough to give her second thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some reluctance, Morgan scooted in a bit closer. She knew she'd have to be as close to the blast zone as possible for the belt to fit. \"You might wanna let me do the buckling,\" Liz half-jokingly warned when she saw Ashley was about to do it. \"You're right next to my belly and that's a really sensitive area right now!\" As if on cue, her stomach produced a high pitched whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself,\" Ashley said. \"If you don't mind, I'll be by the window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, rub it in, why don't you?</i> Morgan thought, although when she tried to enunciate this, all that came out were muffled grunts. \"Sounds like someone's eager to get this show on the road!\"  Liz joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme open the timer so we'll know when it's been five minutes,\" Ashley said, pulling open an app on her phone. \"Something tells me Morgan doesn't wanna be there any longer than she has to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\" Liz asked, \"She's only got a front row seat to the greatest show on Earth!\" Liz playfully (although cautiously so as to not knock anything loose) shook her behind a bit for emphasis. This made Morgan feel as if she was shaking her head \"no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead whenever you're ready,\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words had barely left her lips when Liz began to finally relieve herself of the pressure that had built up inside her for the past hour. To Morgan, who was right next to the source of the sound, it seemed unnaturally loud, even with her snout muffling the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround ten seconds in, Liz's fart grew even louder still. Morgan thought it almost sounded painful coming out. This change in volume was short-lived, though, as it soon returned slightly softer than its volume. Morgan figured this meant Liz began pushing lighter to draw it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it droned on and on, Morgan realized something: though she was a little anxious going into it, those feelings had quickly faded away. <i>I guess it's hard to be nervous when you're listening to something that funny,</i> she thought. While she probably would have preferred being somewhere where the thick stench wasn't all she could breathe, it was a lot easier to bear than Morgan thought it would be. Had she already gotten used to Liz's scent? Now the only thing Morgan was worried about was that she'd burst out laughing because something told her it couldn't be a good idea to open her mouth this close to Liz while she was still unloading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan came dangerously close to accidentally laughing out loud a few seconds later. Without warning, Liz's fart went from very, very deep to squeaky and high pitched. It reminded Morgan of a pubescent boy's voice cracking. Morgan managed to keep her mouth shut as she snickered at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the smell wasn't exactly letting up. Morgan was just surprised it wasn't bothering her as much as she thought it would. It was far from easy on her nose, but she found herself gagging quite a lot less than she expected. <i>I wonder whether I'm, like, developing some kind of tolerance to the smell of farts or whether this is just a walk in the park after those downright</i> lethal <i>ones from Ashley,</i> she pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if Ashley somehow knew Morgan had just thought about her, Morgan heard a second fart as her other new friend joined in. Morgan only heard it faintly, as the much louder point blank one from Liz all but drowned it out. All she could tell was that, while Ashley's would have been long by any normal fur's standards, it had nothing on the behemoth that was still thundering out of Liz's behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan started to wonder how long it had been. This had to have been the single longest fart she ever heard in her life: even noticeably longer than anything else she had heard from Liz. It was incredibly surreal: how could this much gas even fit inside that girl? She could tell Liz was fighting back laughter in order to keep it going. <i>It's hard to believe someone who farts this much still finds it as funny as she does,</i> she thought. <i>Then again, I guess it would be harder to believe someone could fart like</i> that <i>with a straight face.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds, it became clear Liz would not keep this one going much longer. While still loud, something about the tone made it clear that less gas was coming out. Gradually, it had gone from a roar to a growl to a purr. Then it finally stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long was that?\" Liz asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two minutes, thirty-two seconds,\" Ashley said, looking at her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz chuckled, though not as much as she normally would have, as she knew she didn't have much more time with her captive audience. \"Well, when you said my first fart in a while would be five minutes, I guess you were half-right,\" Liz said. Though she said this jokingly, there was something else to her tone: she sounded quite proud of herself. \"Anyway, can't spare too much time to talk, so back to the show...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz fired off one fart after another as rapidly as she could. Morgan had a difficult time telling where one ended and another began. As amused as she was, Morgan also couldn't help but feel at least a bit of awe. It wasn't everyday you hear someone fart for two and a half minutes. It's even less frequent that the same person has enough gas left over to keep going...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had been mid-fart when Ashley's phone began to beep, signaling the end of the forfeit round, bit she didn't seem ready to stop just yet. Morgan tried to reach around Liz's waist to undo the buckle, but had a difficult time since she was unable to see what she was doing. To make matters worse, Liz had been playfully trying to fight her arms off as she tried to make her friend endire this one last point blank fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, though, Morgan managed to figure out how to unbuckle the belt. She took a good several steps away and collapsed onto the bed next to Ashley. Then she laughed harder than she could recall laughing in quite a while. It was a rather infectious laugh that got Liz to join in the guffaw, bringing her current fart to a premature end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was ridiculous!\" Morgan finally managed to say when she was able to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Liz agreed with a nod, still laughing, herself. Unsure of what to say to Ashley, who was as inscrutable as ever, she awkwardly apologized, \"Sorry your room's not gonna smell the same for at least a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I'll notice the smell of <i>your</i> farts,\" Ashley said. Afer a brief pause, she ripped a short but loud fart of her own that got Morgan and Liz's laughter started up once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Morgan said with a yawn after a few seconds, \"I've been beat before we got here and inhaling a bunch of knockout gas isn't making it anyneasier to stay awake. Is it bedtime yet?\"</span></div></div>",

It had been an eventful day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. where are we gonna sleep?\" Morgan asked Ashley, who looked over slowly. <br>\r\nShe shrugged. <br>\r\n\"I don't know. I think I have some blankets in the closet.\" She pointed towards the door at the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz walked over and pulled out a few sheets, throwing Morgan a couple. It wasn't exactly going to be the epitome of comfort, but then their dorm room probably wasn't either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley, realising it was now time to go to sleep, took her shirt off, revealing just her bra underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to... go change in the bathroom or something?\" Morgan laughed at her straightforwardness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quieter vixen just shrugged again before climbing beneath her sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Morgan got settled too, stripping off slightly and pulling the blankets over themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night!\" Morgan said softly, followed almost immediately by a yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep, rumbling fart poured from Liz's backside for a few seconds before she punctuated it with a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n\"My butt says goodnight.\" She giggled, laying down on her folded arms and closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few seconds later there was another sound from the other side of Morgan; a wet, husky rip muffled slightly by Ashley's sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I even can get to sleep with you two ripping ass every few seconds!\" Morgan laughed, lying on her back and looking up at the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one sounded wet!\" Liz called out to Ashley, \"Might wanna give your panties a check.\" She snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sound of Ashley's sheets shuffling around as she reached her arm down to check.<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" She said blankly and rolled over again to try and sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. good night. For real.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it didn't stay silent for long. After a few more rips from either side of her, Morgan eventually managed to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't totally remember her dream, but it definitely included farting in some way. It would be strange if it didn't after what she'd done all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan awoke slowly, opening her eyes, rubbing them, and then rolling over and sighing. She could hear birds chirping outside, feel the heat and the light of the morning sun pressing against her eyelids.. and all she could smell was a gross amalgamation of both Ashley and Liz's gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was sour, sulfurous, and made her need to cover her snout with one hand. Obviously they had been farting in their sleep as much as they had been when awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan opened her eyes and rolled over to see Liz awake, doing something on her phone, looking up from it as she saw Morgan was awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning sleepyhead.\" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what time is it?\" Morgan yawned, still rubbing the sleep out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, eleven. You slept in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Guess I was tired from yesterday. Is Ashley awake?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked over. \"I don't think so, but then that would be kinda hard to tell.\" <br>\r\nShe paused for a moment, and then a huge smile crept across her face. <br>\r\n\"Hey, Morgan... what do you say I give her a special wake up call?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan grinned. \"You're an alarm clock as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk giggled and got up from under her blanket. \"There's gotta be a good use for this terrible morning gas I have.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really? I guess it's just as terrible as your evening gas, your night time gas, and your afternoon gas?\" Morgan chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz held her finger to her lips to silence Morgan as she crept over towards Ashley's bed. She had put a baggy white T-shirt on over her bra, but was still in her underwear on her bottom half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leant over, flicking a little hair out of her face as she bit her lip and shuffled along so her butt was in the optimal position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hefty grunt, Liz unleashed a long, squealing fart right onto Ashley's head, trying to hold back the laughter as she kept it going a long time. Morgan wondered if she really did have worse gas first thing in the morning - especially as she seemed to have been ripping farts all night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the long, satisfying ripper came to an end, Liz sighed and stood up straight to have a look at Ashley's reaction. She was awake, but just staring straight ahead, expressionless as usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was having a dream that I was mopping up spilled milk and rotten eggs with a damp old mop. Now I know why.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis response elicited a chuckle from Liz, who enthusiastically bounced back over to her bed on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Ashley.\" Morgan smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox nodded back, sitting up and rubbing her eyes, smudging her makeup over her face and yawning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to get me back?\" Liz grinned as she pulled her jeans back up her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really have gas right now. I think I got it all out overnight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz remembered that not everyone else had such a limitless supply of methane as she did. \"Aww. That's a shame! How about you Morgan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen grunted softly and laid a rumbling fart into the floor. \"That was morning gas. I think I'm almost completely out too. Although... I kinda need to take a dump.\" She laughed, slightly embarrassed - although it was surprising anything embarrassed her after what she'd done the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get you girls filled up again!\" Liz clapped her hands together, clearly very excited at the fact she had two friends now who either didn't care or found it funny to rip ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley narrowed her eyes, rubbing her belly. \"I don't know. Maybe. I kinda really hurt my stomach having all that milk last night. I don't think it's good for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farting with you is too much fun to not do again.\" Morgan smiled at Liz. \"Although I need to take care of, uh, business first.\" <br>\r\nShe got up and skipped towards the bathroom, accidentally letting a short wet fart slip out as she passed Liz, who wafted it towards her face as if she were wine testing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, a very exotic odor today!\" She giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up!\" Morgan laughed as she shut the bathroom door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two really are gross.\" Ashley rolled her eyes and checked her phone. Liz could tell she was texting someone, though she thought it would be rude to ask her who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... breakfast!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen looked up slowly, reaching to her jacket and pulling a cigarette out for a morning smoke.<br>\r\n\"Is all you think about food and farts?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Liz answered with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to do for breakfast. There's a diner close by. They do good pancakes. Or I guess I could try and cook something here. Depends if you wanna stay in or go out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. How about we ask Morgan?\" The skunk knocked on the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna go out for breakfast?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Otherwise you wouldn't have kept us around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, thanks for letting us spend the night,\" Morgan sheepishly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Gets lonely here sometimes.\" Lighting a cigarette, she added, \"By the way, this restaurant we're going to accepts my meal card. So it'll be my treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that?\" Morgan asked. She started playing with Liz\u2019s belly. \"College is expensive enough without having to feed this black hole!\" Liz giggled, partly at the truth of Morgan's statement and partly at the ticklish feeling of Morgan rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t worry. My meal plan covers more than I need and I\u2019ll just lose what I don't spend anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Morgan said. \"I should probably stop rubbing your belly before I shake something loose.\" She blushed lightly and clasped her hands together as she withdrew them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would be wrong with that?\" Liz teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026\" Morgan scoffed. \"I don't know!\" Her face relaxed as the pinkish hue disappeared. Sorry, I guess I\u2019m just not used to being so touchy-feely with my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing wrong with that,\" Liz said. \"I\u2019ve got like no sense of personal space, myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I kinda noticed when I woke up with your butt in my face,\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Liz's turn to blush. \"Heh, hope I didn't go too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't. You'd know if you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz raised an eyebrow at Morgan. The notion of Ashley breaking her streak of stoicism was certainly intriguing. But it seemed to be in their friendship's best interest if they never saw that side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where\u2019s this diner?\" Liz asked, ending the brief awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s not too long a walk from here. It\u2019s right off campus,\" Ashley said. \"Lemme just text a friend real quick to meet us there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019ll be on my best behavior, then,\" Liz said. \"As long as I can, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno why you two are so interested in making a good first impression all of a sudden,\" Ashley quipped. She put her cigarette out and hid it in an empty soda can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz would have answered her, but was interrupted when her stomach growled ferociously. Morgan shot her a \"here we go again\" smirk, prepared for the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s just hunger,\" Liz said. \"<i>Mostly</i> hunger, anyway.\" She playfully stuck her tongue out, ready to give yet another demonstration of the gargantuan flatulence she was notorious for, even on an empty stomach, but decided against it. She was secretly hoping to get an enormous one built up for later. Hopefully Ashley's friend would be just as laid back about it as the fox, herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three walked through the hall, Liz couldn\u2019t help but wonder if anyone in the nearby rooms had heard their farts last night. She was almost embarrassed for Ashley. If the neighbors didn't know any better, they might think the white vixen alone was responsible for the loud noises all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz didn't dwell on it for too long, though. Soon enough, she and the two vixens were in the warm late morning air. Ashley led the way a few feet ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This friend of Ashley's\u2026 what do you think she'll be like?\" Liz nearly whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno,\" Morgan mumbled with a shrug. \"She seems to hang around weirdos who are obsessed with farts. Maybe she'll be a lot like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you mean like <i>us?</i>\" Liz corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled sheepishly. She couldn't deny that in the past 24 hours, she thought about farts more than she did in her entire life. Which seemed natural after meeting Liz, although in the back of her mind she wondered what her old friends would think about this new side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have much time to ponder such matters, however. In a few short minutes, Ashley stopped in front of the diner: a quaint dimly-lit place with an old worn-down sign that read \"Famous Joe's.\" <i>If he's so famous, how have I lived here my whole life without hearing of him?</i> Morgan thought. It hardly seemed like the place she expected Ashley to take them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit cooler inside than the girls expected and it smelled of coffee. It wasn't especially busy at this hour between a normal fur's' breakfast and lunch, but there were still enough patrons that Ashley had to stop for a few seconds to scan the restaurant for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley headed to one of the booths by the window. Liz and Morgan were taken aback when they saw who she sat next to: she didn't tell them her friend was a guy! He was a black cat, dressed as dark as his fur. His shirt bore the logo of some band Liz hadn't heard of. The girls slid into the seats across from Ashley and the stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the girls Ashley said she'd introduce me to,\" he said, stretching out a paw the girls took turns shaking. \"Name's Devin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Liz,\" the skunk said, \"and this is my roommate and new best friend Morgan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA waitress came by to take the girls' order. After silently lamenting the lack of particularly gassy food on the menu, Liz took Ashley's suggestion and ordered the pancakes. Morgan followed suit, but made it a point to order hers with some milk. Liz smirked. <i>So much for trying to make a good impression,</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" Devin asked, noticing the look on Liz's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing,\" Liz said. \"Just an inside joke that I don't think is gonna <i>stay</i> inside much longer.\" Morgan elbowed Liz in the ribs. Liz took the hint and changed the subject. \"So, what's the story with you and Ashley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We dated for a while,\" Ashley said. \"Then we broke up and I couldn't get rid of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I appreciate your company too, you wonderful ray of sunshine,\" Devin joked back. \"What about you? She says you go to Anthro U, so you couldn't have met her there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz glanced at Morgan. Should they tell him about Morgan stuffing herself with gassy foods and Ashley just happened to be the one they chose to try to get a reaction out of? They looked at Ashley to see if she was going to be the one to spill the beans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't all chime in at once,\" Devin teased. Despite his somewhat warmer and more outgoing demeanor, it was already apparent he shared Ashley's sarcastic sense of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We happened to pick her for a prank of ours. She took it surprisingly well,\" Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of prank?\" Devin asked, clearly intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they'd rather show you than tell you,\" Ashley said. Under her breath, she added, \"I know <i>I'd</i> like to see them demonstrate on you, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Morgan exchanged intrigued glances. Did Ashley not only give them permission, but actually encourage them to fart on this guy already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the waitress came back with their food. Liz instinctively began tearing into her meal, devouring it at quite an alarming rate. \"I swear, I just blinked and half this girl's plate disappeared,\" Devin said, who had barely started on his own pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded, barely further along in her breakfast than Devin. \"I swear, she's got a bottomless stomach. The way I've seen her eat, I'm surprised she's not as big as a sumo wrestler!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz ignored them and continued to scarf down her food, finishing with a satisfied, though most unladylike belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised when Devin responded with, \"Nice one. I'd challenge you to a contest but I don't wanna shatter any windows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and especially Morgan felt a wave of relief wash over them. If he had a laid back attitude about that, perhaps he'd have a similar attitude when the gas made its way out of the other end. Morgan drank her milk much more confidently now. She even wound up going through a second glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs promised, Ashley paid for the girls' food as well as her own. They stepped outside, debating on what to do next. Now that Morgan was a ticking stink bomb, they especially wanted to plan a course of action - and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, we could just hang out at Ashley's,\" Devin nonchalantly said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it. I didn't get dressed today just to stay in,\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You just wanna give the place a chance to air out,</i> Liz thought. Instead, she asked, \"Is there a GameLand nearby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you a couple gamer girls?\" Devin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just Liz,\" Morgan answered. \"Although as an artist, I gotta admit there are some games that have some unique art styles.\" After a pause, she added, \"Wait a second, our TV's busted right now, why would you wanna go there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't mean I can't get something to play when it does get fixed. Besides, you never know what kind of merch they've got. And I'm not hearing any other suggestions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anywhere we can go that's a bit more private?\" Morgan asked. \"Oh, come on, not like <i>that!</i>\" she added when she saw the look Devin was giving her. Just because Ashley and, from the looks of things, Devin wouldn't mind the results of her lactose intolerance, it didn't mean it wouldn't offend other furs. She was almost regretting that second glass of milk. Her bloated stomach felt as if it were going to burst. She wondered how Ashley managed to stand chugging a carton of milk in last night's game\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose if Ashley's place is out of the question, we could always go to my place. Me and a couple buddies are renting an apartment just off campus. But they're out of town on a fishing trip right now. Last chance for them before classes start. Don't know how they don't get bored to death doing that, though. I've never been the outdoorsy type. But if privacy is what you're after, we'll have the place to ourselves.\"</span></div></div>",

That way, I\u2019ll have a nice little defence mechanism if I need it!\u201d Morgan chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Okay! Smelly we can work with.\u201d Liz tapped her chin with her finger, trying to think about what usually made <i>her</i> farts stink. In actual fact, they seemed to smell pretty bad anyway, but certain foods did heighten the odor to something truly repulsive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me see what your farts smell like at the moment.\u201d Liz suggested, watching as Morgan\u2019s face immediately went bashful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, jeez, I\u2019m not even sure I need to fart right now..\u201d although Morgan didn\u2019t find farting much of a big deal (and certainly not since meeting Liz), the reality of actually farting in front of someone, purposefully, was suddenly quite embarrassing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded to herself. \u201cI know,\u201d she started, standing up as if she were about to give a lecture, \u201cThere\u2019s this one position that <i>really</i> gets the ol\u2019 vapors flowing. You want to lie on your belly with your butt right up in the air!\u201d The skunk pointed to her posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Morgan shuffled around on her bed, raising her rump upwards with her head low to the mattress. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh. It makes all the gas rise up and out! Not that I really need to do that, but when I was younger I used to just to see what would happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight..\u201d Morgan said into her sheets, wiggling her ass slightly in an effort to shake up whatever might be dormant in her lower intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, actually...\u201d Liz looked around the room, spotting something and then quickly reaching over to the waste paper basket, pulling out an old empty water bottle. \u201cI\u2019m gonna try and bottle this scent, so later on we can compare the smells!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan laughed, which coincidentally seemed to make some gas bubble up in her belly. \u201cI feel something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk!\u201d Liz turned towards her friend, placing the bottle against the Fox\u2019s butt and trying to manoeuvre it around so the neck of the bottle lined up with Morgan\u2019s butthole. \u201cYou, uh, don\u2019t mind, of course.\u201d Liz let out a half-nervous chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already let more than enough farts out around me, so I\u2019d say I feel comfortable with you.\u201d She snickered too, finding the idea of bottling her own farts hilarious, and also weirdly somewhat exhilarating. She wasn\u2019t sure why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, it\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s coming!\u201d Morgan began to push slowly; it felt surreal to be doing this not only around another person but so purposefully. Morgan usually made it a point to hold her farts in in social situations, but Liz had definitely brought her out of her shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan never could have imagined she would be in a situation like this; with a roommate she only met today holding a bottle against her ass to collect her farts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quiet, squeaky fart reverberated around the inside of the bottle, quite tinny and quiet but certainly audible. It was a very short fart - by Liz\u2019s standards, at least, only lasting maybe a second or two. Morgan rarely managed more than that anyway, unless she was particularly gassy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz made sure the fart went entirely into the bottle, before using her thumb to stop it escaping and quickly putting the lid back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! That shouldn\u2019t be going anywhere anytime soon.\u201d She giggled. \u201cAnd now how about one for me?\u201d She lowered her face towards Morgan\u2019s ass, expecting to sample how good or bad her friend\u2019s farts currently were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, Liz, I can\u2019t just pump them out at will like you!\u201d The vixen laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sucked her stomach in and out, gasping quietly as she tried to squeeze out any more toots. It felt even weirder <i>deliberately</i> farting into someone\u2019s face, especially a girl\u2019s, but Morgan was feeling less and less uptight about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Ahh... there was one there, but it was silent.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \u201cYep. I can smell it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna have to be honest, Morgan, as your friend, that one smells pretty weak.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, it does?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, maybe my nose is a little worn away after all these years of smelling my <i>own</i> farts, but I definitely think we can get a nastier smell out of you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, well you\u2019re the expert here\u201d. Morgan sat back up again, picking up the pamphlet once more.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, What food do you think will give me the smelliest gas?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, salad usually does it for me... oh! And kebabs!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good... uh, you want something too?\u201d Morgan handed it to Liz, who looked over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll just get myself a pizza. I\u2019m not too hungry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201donly hungry enough for a whole pizza..\u201d</i> Morgan thought to herself, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan leant up against the wall, rubbing her stomach as she let out a groan.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever - <b>herrp</b> - eaten so much in one go before..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the several empty kebab boxes, still covered with remnants of sauce and hummus. <br>\r\nStifling another burp, Morgan could taste every kebab, pita bread, French fry and chilli she\u2019d just eaten, feeling her stomach rumble and try to process the sheer amount of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t even move\u201d. She groaned, looking over at Liz, who was effortlessly slipping the last slice of meat-feast pizza into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. When it digests a little more you\u2019ll be fine\u201d. The skunk laughed, having been in a similar state of debilitating-fullness herself many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUghhhh..\u201d Morgan titled her head back. \u201cSo, when will my farts start to stink? I can taste like overwhelming onions so I guess that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \u201cIt is. Onions usually lead to stinky farts, and you\u2019ll probably start to see- uh, <i>smell</i> the effects in the morning. Usually takes like six to ten hours to go through your system,\u201d she looked over at Morgan, \u201cI\u2019ve tested it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope I won\u2019t be on the toilet all night. That kinda food usually goes <i>straight</i> through me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk laughed, and looked over at the water bottle again. \u201cHey, uh, do you have any little sticky labels in here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan thought to herself for a second. \u201cUh, maybe in my bag. With some art supplies. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, tomorrow I want to get another bottle of your farts to see how the smell has improved, but I had an idea.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should bottle up some of my farts, too, and maybe we could label some. Like... the days they came from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour farts smell bad enough when they\u2019re coming out of you, why would you want to ever go back and smell them again?\u201d Morgan tried to laugh, but her stomach hurt too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it would be interesting to revisit some old scents.\u201d She leant over to Morgan\u2019s bag, rooting around until she managed to find a roll of labels. <br>\r\n\u201cSometimes I get these ones that just smell really unique, and besides, it would be fun to build up a little collection of farts, right?\u201d Liz laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that would be interesting. If one of us ever gets a - <b> uuurph </b> a blocked nose or anything, we can just pop one open and clear it right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need to get some more water bottles tomorrow. Maybe there\u2019s some by the trash cans here on campus.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly you would want to go searching in dumpsters.\u201d Morgan smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I smell like one already so what\u2019s the harm?\u201d The skunk wrote onto the bottle: \u2018Tue. Night. Morgan\u2019, before sticking it onto the bottle. It still felt warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, tomorrow your training continues!\u201d Liz said triumphantly, snuggling into her own bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her voice was raspy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, sleepyhead.\u201d The skunk chuckled. \u201cSleep well?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot too bad, but, uh, I really need to fart.\u201d The fox laughed, rolling onto her back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Wait - hold that fart..\u201d Liz jumped into action, quickly searching the trash can, grabbing another empty bottle and moving over to Morgan\u2019s bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let it out yet, the first fart of the morning is always one of the smelliest!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk! I don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold this in, though!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz pulled away Morgan\u2019s sheets and nestled the neck of the bottle down between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>L-Liz!!</b> too high! Too high!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry!\u201d Liz giggled awkwardly, trying to get the bottle in the right position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I think it\u2019s in place.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Liz finished her sentence the floodgates were released, and a loud, boisterous fart sent vibrations into the bottle, she sighed heavily as a long, loud fart began to fill up the plastic bottle, coming out hard and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz could feel the bottle get warmer as it filled up, but to her surprise Morgan\u2019s fart was much longer than the weak effort from last night. It kept going, and going, nearly overflowing from the bottle which Liz kept pressed in place firmly. After what must have been close to ten seconds, it finished, and Morgan expressed an audible sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly <i>shit</i>, Morgan! That was a good one!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat felt so good.\u201d The fox started to laugh. \u201cMan, that one really needed to get out!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz quickly put the cap back on the bottle, but with such a long fart, some of the excess gas managed to escape out into the air, and the smell hit Liz like a huge, gloved fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a shocked gasp, quickly putting the back of her hand against her snout. \u201c<i>Fuck!</i> Morgan! That smells <b>so</b> bad!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was the aim, right?\u201d The fox looked up at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but... wow!! It\u2019s like a chemical spill at the onion factory!\u201d The skunk laughed, half out of shock, and half out of pride that she had been successful - she wouldn\u2019t admit it to Morgan, but she was even a little bit <i>jealous</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sat up. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan for today?\u201d She asked, rubbing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we could have a look around campus. Maybe find a spot to try out some fart techniques.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTechniques?\u201d The fox have Liz an intrigued smile, arching her back and letting a short, bassy fart rumble into the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we can try out your new, smelly farts if anything. I haven\u2019t even seen the whole campus, yet.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe neither, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too big though.\u201d Morgan\u2019s face visibly changed as she picked up the warm odor of her last fart. <br>\r\n\u201cDamn!\u201d She exclaimed, \u201cThat\u2019s sour...\u201d She wafted her hand in front of her face, laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight??\u201d Liz laughed along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt makes my stomach feel all queasy just sniffing it.\u201d The vixen was secretly rather impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, you\u2019re gonna really break some hearts with that gas\u201d. Liz teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I\u2019m gonna break with a smell like that is people\u2019s will to live.\u201d The fox chuckled to herself, starting to get dressed: today she decided that to combat her more unladylike gas, it might be fun to go in the opposite direction and dress more girly. She chose a yellow blouse with a small floral pattern, a short black skirt and a pink jacket. <br>\r\nShe already felt fairly comfortable getting dressed in front of Liz, something that she usually wouldn\u2019t feel so comfortable doing with someone she had only known less than 24 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz, being lazier, decided to wear the same pair of jeans, with a slightly different shirt, this one was dark blue and had some sort of video game character printed on the front of it that Morgan didn\u2019t recognise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where should we head to first? There\u2019s a cafeteria, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded. \u201cYep. There\u2019s also the main courtyard... usually a few people out on the grass there. There\u2019s also the football field. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a game on today, so it could be a little quieter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlready anxious about farting around other furs, huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that... maybe I wouldn\u2019t mind getting, y\u2019know, used to it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, shoot..\u201d Liz suddenly remembered, \u201cI wanted to go and get some bottles too..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, where should we head first?\u201d Morgan asked from the bathroom, spraying herself with a little perfume - not that it would make much difference with the perfume coming from her own ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour call, stank-butt!\u201d Liz smiled teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two girls played up their exhaustion and breathlessness. \"Whew! Only just caught it!\" Morgan said loudly to Liz, wiping her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the elevator with them was a wolf who looked quite a bit older than them. He smiled as they got on, he immediately had a very polite demeanour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which floor are you girls going to?\" He asked, his paw hovering over the buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottom floor.\" Liz grinned warmly, and he pressed 'G'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, how fortunate!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls looked at each other, sharing a certain grin that meant they both knew this was their latest victim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator began to rattle away as it slowly made its journey downwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fairly spacious elevator, as far as they went, but that didn't mean it wasn't just as cramped and enclosed. It ran down the middle of the mall, with glass walls so that you could look around the building as you descended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf began looking through his phone casually, resting against the wall that was on the opposing side to Morgan and Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan felt a light jab on her shoulder and looked to see that Liz had her hand behind her back, her finger outstretched and begging to be pulled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan tried to stifle her laughter as she reached down and gave it a tug, hearing a very very soft hissing sound for a couple of seconds coming from behind Liz. It was barely audible, and so quiet that only Morgan was able to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, the smell had reached the fox, and she moved away from her gassy comrade as the thick, rather eggy aroma filled her nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls stared at the wolf, and after a few more seconds they could tell the smell had reached him too. His nose flared, and he stopped for a second, wide-eyed as he started trying to work out where the smell was coming from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing as polite as he was, he simply ignored the smell, trying to subtly hold his paw over his nose until it passed, but Liz was not done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few more moments of silence as the fart smell dissipated away, but out of the silence came a sudden, abrupt blast of noise, sounding a little like an out-of-tune trombone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan once again had to force herself not to laugh out loud, Liz grinning over at her before the skunk started putting on her performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew!\" Liz pinched her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf looked up as soon as he heard the fart, his face filled with confusion, and then disgust as he got a whiff of the latest emission of Liz'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan, was that you?\" She was clearly acting, and Moran had to do her best to play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! It was him!\" She pointed at the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that wasn't me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it wasn't either of us, and I don't see another fur in here!\" Liz accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously! It wasn't me! I swear!\" He began to get defensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, just... Don't do it again, ok?\" Morgan held back the laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf scowled at the girls and got back to his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Morgan exchanged another look, and this time it Morgan's turn to show her finger to Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk was very surprised Morgan was offering to fart like this; lost in heat of the moment, she supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz pulled the fox's finger, and immediately heard a little peeping fart from Morgan; it was pretty weak in comparison to how Liz's sounded, but still loud enough for the wolf to hear it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it again!\" Liz held her nose again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I didn't! It's you two, knock it off!\" He began to sound a little angry at the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please,\" Morgan started. \"You <i>know</i> girls don't fart!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tutted angrily. \"Whatever. That smells horrible, though, so please stop it.\" The wolf pulled his shirt up over his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were about to burst out into laughter, when...</span></div></div>",

As Morgan and Liz struggled to hold in their laughter, the soon-to-be victims shot him an annoyed look as he escaped back into the fresh air of the mall. A tigress and a rabbit, around the same age as Morgan and Liz, boarded a moment later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tigress\u2019s expression changed slightly as the smell hit her at full force. In contrast, her rabbit friend managed to keep her friendly smile despite the less-than-welcoming atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tigress looked over at Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez, what was his problem?\u201d she asked, clearly aware of the situation that forced him out of the elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shrugged nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno.

Her smiled had yet to falter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tigress on the other hand looked less than thrilled at the prospect of riding the elevator all the way to the top of the mall with the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s really something.\u201d The tigress said with a half-masked irritated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elevator began its sluggish ascent, Liz began to wonder if the shorter girl had already caught on to the joke. If that was the case, then would it be better to just skip the SBD\u2019s and just jump straight into a full, gassy onslaught? Morgan lightly nudged her with her elbow to remind her what they were there for. But it was alright. Liz had already made up her mind. She decided to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The idea of a nice bit of fast food really appealed to her right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food court it is!\" Morgan started getting ready as Liz got some money together. She wasn't exactly <i>hungry</i> per se, in fact, she still had some gas, but Liz was not unlike a bottomless pit when it came to fast food; she could keep eating burgers and fries for days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short bus journey from the university, Morgan and Liz arrived in the plaza where all the food joints were located. It wasn't such a busy area this time of day, a couple of hours before most furs' lunch breaks, but the cheap-looking plastic chairs and tables set out across the cobblestone square were quite full with furs nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I'm starving!\" Morgan rubbed her belly, smiling a little. \"I suppose you're always hungry, considering you're always producing gas.\" The fox smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz laughed. \"Pretty much.

There's certainly a lot of choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were different fast food restaurants around the sides of the plaza, each cheaply decorated with tacky items related to the country of origin of each food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ones sticking out to me...\" Liz looked around \"Would be the burger place, Mexican, of course, and.. Hmm... The salad bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salad bar!?\" Morgan looked to her skunky friend with an expression displaying her confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, believe me, salad gives me some pretty horrific gas. All that broccoli, those sprouts... It's not a pretty smell when it comes out.\" Liz laughed, adding to her point with a stifled little squeaker of a fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan started laughing too. \"So each place gives you different types of farts, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, logically, the food you eat changes how you fart.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked around. \"Okay, so how about the burger place? How does that hit you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burgers... Hmm... Well, I guess they don't really smell <i>as</i> bad as the others, but I think a good burger would give me some beefy fumes.\" She snickered at her own description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Mexican is self explanatory, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man... Mexican's the worst of them all! I usually try and avoid it, but, you don't seem to mind my gas, so maybe you can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded. \"Mexican doesn't really settle well with my stomach either.\" She felt a little embarrassed, Morgan didn't usually fart all that much, but seeing Liz in action earlier made her feel a little more intrigued to do so, if only to find out if she could match the skunk's abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, basically,\" Liz found them a seat. \"Salad's gonna make them reek, Burger's gonna make them huge, Mexican is gonna do a little of both! Your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz gave Morgan a flashy grin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had to wonder what such healthy eating could do to her skunky companion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz got up from the seat. \"Ugh. Always a shock to the system eating vegetables, but it's a shock to my digestive system too, so oh well.\" The skunk giggled as she marched past Morgan and towards the open salad bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz grabbed a plate from the rack, looking at what was on offer, and what would instigate the most gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan dolloped some pasta salads and potato salad onto her plate, watching as Liz plopped down a helping of Brussel sprouts, followed by some broccoli. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take it all!\" Morgan chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz rolled her eyes, taking a nice big amount of coleslaw - it always seemed to do terrible things to her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan had already payed for hers as Liz was still adding to her plate: eggs, potato salad, artichokes, onions and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Liz had payed, the girls went and found their table again, starting to eat the salads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uch. Sprouts.\" Liz cringed. She clearly wasn't a fan of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you hate sprouts, why did you get so many?\" Morgan laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz patted her large butt. \"Booty fuel.\" She giggled, making Morgan giggle along too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even want to think about how bad that's all gonna smell on the other end...\" Morgan stared at Liz's plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't have to think about it soon enough; you'll be able to smell it.\" Liz laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna be toxic, Liz!\" The fox finished off her comparatively small portion of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. This skunk is gonna need a hazard sign on her butt.\" Liz chuckled at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never eating that much broccoli again..\" Liz moaned after she'd eventually finished her food, pushing her plate away from her, stifling a burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did have quite a lot... I can't even have one bit.\" Morgan cringed at the thought of eating some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. It'll produce some pretty impressive results, I promise.\" Liz worked her belly with her hands, trying to encourage her digestion to speed up tenfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can't just let them off in the middle of the food court!\" Morgan was already laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Liz smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Because everyone's gonna look at us - at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shrugged. \"Then let them look. It's funny when people react.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan giggled. \"I guess it is. Just try not to like, gas everyone out here, you'll get us thrown out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz laughed loudly. \"My stomach is bubbling up like craazy.. Listen..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan listened to the loud gurgling coming from her friend's belly. \"Oh god, here we go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the expression on Liz's face, Morgan could just tell she was trying to fart again, her teeth gritted and eyes fixed in concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz let out a little sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Did you fart already? I didn't hear anything.\" Morgan grinned amusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \"Silent.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin about five seconds, the skunk's face dropped, and she flapped her hand at the side of her plump skunky butt, pinching her nose. \"Whew! And very, very deadly!\" She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't much longer until Morgan caught wind of the gas, and it was akin to a wall of stench hitting her at full force, a sharp, onion-y, spoilt-mayonnaise-y smell intruding her nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Jeebus, Liz!! That's so bad!\"<br>\r\nMorgan started laughing loudly, coughing every time she sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told ya.\" Liz grinned, quite proud of how stinky her farts had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like... That's SO bad! That isn't natural, Liz!\" Morgan spluttered between laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've Gotta put these stink bombs to use..\" Liz said, letting out a very airy fart onto her seat, adding another wave of stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Morgan chuckled, in the mood for some pranking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could just go up to some furs, not explain anything, and I could just fart.\" Liz giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan noticed a large display of plants and flowers in the middle of the square. \"Maybe we could give those flowers a new smell..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Liz and Morgan got a place in the queue, Liz licking her lips at the image of a nice loaded burrito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm probably gonna get some gas because of this too.\" Morgan chuckled slightly uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo! You can join the farty party with me, then, although I don't think you're gonna quite be on my level.\" Liz laughed immodestly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think any fur on the face of the <i>planet</i> is gonna be on your level, Liz, but it would still be more fun with both of us farting, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When it comes to tooting, the more is most definitely the merrier!\" Liz exemplified this point by shooting out a short, but very wet-sounding fart, forgetting momentarily she was in a queue and receiving a myriad of disgusted and shocked looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan burst out into laughter. \"Liz! You can't just fart in a queue like that! Jeez!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz waved her hand. \"I can fart anywhere, and anywhen I want!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then keep them silent, for the sake of my embarrassment!\" Morgan chuckled amusedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls had now reached the front of the queue. \"What'll it be?\" The weary-faced clerk asked for the hundredth time that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz started looking at the menu, and Morgan noticed her face practically light up as she spotted the option she knew she was going to have. She poked the fox's shoulder and pointed to the little box on the menu reading 'all you can eat buffet'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two of those, please!\" Liz said with a charming smile so innocent and feminine you'd never guess she was capable of clearing the entire building with nothing more than a few 'shakes' of her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk nodded. \"Be seated and we'll bring you your order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls found a little booth that was separated from the rest of the restaurant, giving them a degree of privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they were out of earshot of the rest of the restaurant, Liz raised her fluffy tail and let out a domineeringly bassy fart, that gave itself a real presence as it powered on for a good eight or nine seconds, and then she sat down.<br>\r\n\"Ahh! I was holding that one in for a while!\" The skunk chuckled to herself and flapped her hand around by her butt, diffusing the smell slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you can eat? Really?\" Morgan laughed. \"Won't that be too much food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too much food? There's no such thing!\" Liz stated melodramatically. \"Trust me, if you want to start farting even slightly close to my level, then we're gonna want the buffet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded and smiled, still finding the prospect of letting rip as casually as Liz did alarming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what stuff will give me the most gas?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Changes from fur to fur, but I'm gonna say you'll want to go heavy on the beans, the cheese, and the meat!\" Liz smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, gotcha, but I doubt I can eat as much as you, so wait up for me.\" Morgan giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure.\" Liz nodded, and the waiter brought them their plates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buffet was like a vision of heaven for Liz; a huge array of Mexican snacks and meals so large that about twelve furs could stand around it at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz dug in immediately, putting big, beefy burritos, enchiladas, cheesy nachos and helpings of salsa onto her plate, licking her lips and silently snarling her white teeth with desperation to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was a little less enthusiastic, neatly setting out a huge pile of burritos onto her plate, and dolloping on a few spoonfuls of nacho sauce and ground meat for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls returned to their table after getting drinks, and placed their loaded plates down with a heavy thunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful! Just beautiful!\" Liz admired her plate, taking a burrito and guzzling it down in only about three bites, washing it down with a swig of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Liz, slow down a little or you'll choke!\" Morgan laughed, starting to eat her food too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been to Mexico,\" Liz began with a mouthful of spicy enchilada, \"but they must all be farting nearly as much as me if this is all they eat\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd fit in perfectly, then.\" Morgan said, also with food in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox watched as Liz devoured her entire plate of four burritos, three enchiladas and nachos in about five minutes, letting out a belch of satisfaction and heading back for seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting more!?\" Morgan started chucking into her hand as she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz returned with about twice as much as she had before, digging into it immediately; Morgan watched the contents on the plate diminish slowly and steadily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's already getting to me, I think..\" Liz leaned herself to one side and let out a very loud, very juicy ripper onto the poor leather seating below her, her face seemingly calm and unmoved as the monstrous twenty second fart sharply ripped against the seat, not getting any weaker at all in the entire twenty seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Liz!\" Morgan fell onto her chair, laughing uncontrollably. \"That was so long! You can't just fart like that in public!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I so can!\" Liz laughed back, proving her point by letting out another fart: just as steady and powerful, just as juicy, but only half the time of the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your bowels are just neverending, are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smirked, feeling proud of herself again. \"That wasn't even the best I can do, that was like warming up.\" She snickered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a liar!\" Morgan tried to eat her food without breaking out into another laughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did tell you I pretty much never run out of gas, didn't I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still so hard to believe.\" Morgan wiped a tear from her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sniffed the air and flapped her hand around a bit. \"I think I oughta keep a hold on it for now though, wouldn't want all this lovely, Mexican-inspired flatulence to go to waste on a cheap leather seat, would we? I propose we make the most of this gas after we're finished here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shrugged. \"We play some pranks on some furs, maybe. 'With great gas comes great opportunities...' Wasn't that Shakespeare or something?\" She asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that.\" Morgan chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liz went to fill her plate up with food a third time, Morgan was starting to feel the Mexican drop into her belly and mess it up, the feeling of churns and glorping reels started making her feel the uneasy need to pass gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz returned with another mountain of food; it was a mystery how she fitted it all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Liz.\" Morgan grinned wryly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Morgan?\" Liz started chowing down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pull my finger.\" The fox extended her index finger out to the skunk, who looked at it, before a broad, knowing smile grew out across her face. \"Oooh, has Morgan got gas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan has.\" The fox chuckled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz tugged at Morgan's finger, causing the fox to lift her leg and lay a pretty short, but very wet-sounding fart into the seat below her with a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh-hoh-hoh! That one was <i>juicy</i>, Morgan!\" Liz laughed loudly, responding with another fart of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mexican gives me terrible gas.\" The fox grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hold it in for the moment, we'll have to put it to use after I'm finished up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on your third round!? What is up with that belly of yours!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shrugged. \"Honestly, if I was on my own here, I could probably fit in three more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan laughed yet again. \"Ok, well finish up, I can't hold my farts in for that long, I'm sure <i>you're</i> used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz quickly choked down the rest of her burrito pyramid and licked her lips, letting out a huge, intimidatingly long burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan returned with a belch of her own, not as powerful or long, but still full and bassy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice.\" Liz snickered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do now? It's like a friggin' ocean down in my stomach at the moment!\" Morgan clutched her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... So many options..\" Liz tapped her finger against her lip, holding back every attempt her body made to let rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could just go back to the dorm and let it out there. Maybe we could have a contest...\" Morgan proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be a very fair chance.\" Liz smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but I really feel like a lie down after all that food!\" Morgan burped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could just go around the city, look for a few victims to try our gas out on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan laughed. \"Publically farting like you do!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded confidently. \"It's always good to share good things with others.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk's face lit up. \"Ooh! Orrrr, I have another idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could go to the ladies' room, prank a few of the girls who come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we both go into the stalls, whenever someone else comes in we just let loose right into the toilets, imagine the look on their faces when they hear that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea was pretty hilarious, Morgan had to admit. \"Wow!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You'll get over it soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Performance anxiety?\" The vixen repeated, nearly laughing, \"I'm talking about <i>farting</i>, not playing a piano recital!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still applies,\" Liz said with a shrug. \"Anyway, where do you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan thought for a moment. \"How about the park? It's a nice enough day out.\" With a smirk, she quickly added, \"Plus it's outdoors so I don't have to breathe your fumes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're the one who said we should get Mexican,\" Liz said, throwing her hands up defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just teasing, Liz... although that doesn't exactly hurt the park's case.\" Suddenly a very violent, loud churning noise came from the fox's belly. \"But we should get going soon, I don't know how much longer I can hold this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, sounds like that meal really did a number on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mexican always does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it does the same thing to me.\" The girls took the short walk out of the restaurant and to the bus stop. After a short wait, they boarded the bus and found an empty pair of seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm glad we made friends with each other so quickly,\" Morgan said as the bus took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? We've only met, what, an hour or two ago? Yet we're already getting along pretty well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're gonna have a great freshman year,\" Morgan said with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Liz agreed. After a brief lull in the conversation, she added, \"So you're studying art, huh? What do you plan on doing with that?\" After seeing the glare on Morgan's face, Liz quickly blurted out, \"Whoops, I guess that sounded judgmental - I didn't mean it that way at all! I'm just genuinely curious about what you plan on doing after college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the <i>practical</i> thing to do would be getting into graphic design or illustration. Although as unrealistic as it sounds, my dream job would either involve working on comics or maybe even doing something in animation. I'll admit, I'm a bit of a dork,\" Morgan said adopting a nervous smile, \"Just about all I watch on TV these days are cartoons and most of my favorite movies are animated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, nothing wrong with that. Besides, it's not like my gaming is any less nerdy,\" Liz pointed out with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" Morgan said. \"What about you? You said you're majoring in history? What are your plans for the future?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I'm not quite sure just yet,\" she said with a shrug. \"But, hey, I got a few years to decide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know plenty of furs aren't completely sure what they want to do when they start college. You'll figure it out. Oh, get ready, we're getting off at the next stop.\" Moments later, the girls stepped off the bus and found themselves by the entrance to the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they passed through the gate, Liz's felt a rush of excitement. Since the weather was agreeable, the park was ful of furs of all ages and species. To Liz, this meant there was a potential prank victim everywhere she turned. She eagerly looked around in every direction, debating on who would be her \"lucky\" first target. Then she noticed her new friend's face: Morgan was hanging her head down and biting her lip. \"Something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just a little nervous about going through with this,\" Morgan admitted sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you gorged yourself on Mexican, the damage has already been done,\" Liz said. \"Might as well have some fun with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy for you to say,\" Morgan said, \"you're the kind of girl who farts in someone's face like five minutes after meeting them. I'm a little more shy than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Liz said, \"in that case we should probably start you off with something a little low risk. See those wolves over there?\" The skunk gestured to a group of four male wolves around the girls' age who were tossing a flying disc among themselves, \"Let's start with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because farting in front of cute guys isn't the <i>least</i> bit embarrassing,\" Morgan sarcastically quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at their shirts,\" Liz said, \"they go to Furry Heights. Even if you embarrass yourself in front of them, it's not like you'll ever see them again anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighed. \"I guess you're right. Let's get this over with before I have time to change my mind.\" The girls rushed, nearly running toward the group of guys. \"Wait a second, Liz, what's the plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me do the talking and wait for my signal,\" Liz said. The girls approached the gray wolf, who was the closest to them. \"Hi, I'm Liz and this is my roommate Morgan. We were just wondering if we could join your little game,\" she said, putting on the most feminine smile she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gray wolf gestured to his friends to come over. Three wolves were soon by him: one white, one brown, and one black. \"These young ladies - Liz and Morgan, was it?\" he asked, gesturing at the girls, who nodded to confirm he got their names right. \"They say they'd like to play with us,\" the gray wolf explained. \"Personally, I see no reason not to let them, I was just making sure it's cool with you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other wolves looked at the girls, then exchanged grins and nods with each other. Liz could tell from their faces they seemed to be thinking it was their lucky day: two attractive girls from out of nowhere seemed interested in them. Little did they know the girls' plans...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, looks like everybody's cool with it,\" the gray wolf said, reaching out a paw for the girls to shake. \"I'm Jake,\" he introduced himself as Liz, then Morgan quickly shook his paw. \"This is Mike,\" he said, pointing to the white wolf, \"John,\" he said, pointing at the gray one, \"and Greg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're perfectly capable of introducing ourselves,\" Greg teased. \"Nice to meet you, girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise,\" Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now that we met each other, everybody spread out,\" John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Liz,\" Morgan said softly, tapping the skunk on the shoulder as the guys walked out of earshot, \"Now I <i>know</i> I'm gonna embarrass myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, lighten up. Everybody farts, just learn to laugh at yourself and it's not embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not that,\" Morgan said. \"I'm not exactly the most coordinated girl around so I know I'm gonna screw this up somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, that could work...\" Liz said, tapping her chin in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Morgan could ask Liz what she meant, Mike called out, \"Hey! You girls ready to play or what!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Liz shouted back, \"Yeah, we're ready!\" She began walking to her position in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the closest fur to her was several feet away, Morgan was tempted to relieve some of the pressure in her belly. However, she knew the longer she held it, the bigger it would be. <i>Besides,</i> she thought, <i>Liz told me to wait for her signal and she's the one with the pranking experience.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan held her breath as the disc started flying her way. She closed her eyes, sure she was going to somehow miss it and make a fool of herself... but a relieved smile spread across her face when she felt it land in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer relief was shortlived when she remembered now she had to toss it. Since John was the closest wolf to her, she tossed it to him. She missed miserably. The mortified vixen blushed as she covered her agape mouth with her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn, however, didn't seem to care too much. He picked up the stray disc and walked to Morgan. He put it in her paw and stood behind her. \"Now what you wanna do is move your wrist like this,\" he said, slowly guiding Morgan's arm to help her get a hold of the technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan saw something move in the corner of her eye. Suddenly, she realized Liz was now only a couple feet away from her. In fact, because the game was interrupted, the other wolves were now standing rather close to her as well, a couple of them chiming in with their own throwing advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan found it hard to pay attention to anything they were saying, though. All she could do was look at Liz, who, after a couple moments that felt like hours to the fox, finally mouthed the word, \"Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat, Morgan raised her tail slightly. What followed was a deep noise so loud, it took even Liz by surprise. \"Gross!\" John cried, taking several steps away from the farting fox. Nervously, Morgan glanced around and saw Mike was also looking as though he was sucking on a lemon. Morgan tried to stop the loud flow of gas, but it just kept coming and coming. While Liz laughed, Morgan noticed more than just a smile on her face. The skunk's eyebrows were raised in a rather impressed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the noisy rumbling finally subsided, Morgan opened her mouth to apologize, but before she could say anything, Liz turned to the disgusted wolves, telling them, \"Lighten up. It's natural.\" Following this, the skunk began farting, herself. Hers was nowhere near as long as Morgan's. Instead, Liz was firing off a barrage of farts. Deep ones, high pitched squeakers, wet ones, dry ones... every fart sound imaginable came bursting from her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidway through her friend's onslaught of gas, Morgan noticed something: she and Liz weren't the only ones laughing. The remaining two wolves seemed to be getting just as much a kick out of it as the girls, practically doubling over in laughter. Morgan felt her embarrassment melt away when she realized these two could see the funny side of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you guys can hang with these nasty girls all you want,\" John said to his laughing friends, \"Mike and I will be back in the dorm.\" The two upset wolves stormed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you girls are something else!\" Greg said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jake agreed, wiping away a tear of laughter, \"you have <i>got</i> to hang out with us!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was hilarious!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Morgan exchanged a look of confusion, but also satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you thought that was all we had to offer, you were mistaken!\" Liz smirked proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls still need to fart?\" Greg looked at Morgan. \"Especially after that massive one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had Mexican before this.\" Liz spoke bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. That'll do it.\" Jake nodded and laughed in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz presented evidence to the jury, balancing on one leg and leaning to one side as she freed a fairly long, very deep ripper through her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow!\" Greg started laughing, joined by Jake. \"I've never heard girls farting like you two!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled. \"Most girls don't, but we just find it so hilarious we can't resist, and in Liz's case she kinda <i>has</i> to fart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has to fart?\" The boys looked at each other. \"You've Gotta explain that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded, grinning to herself. \"I was born without any scent glands in my butt, you see? So, instead, my body has alllll this excess gas, and I don't really have any other option than to let it out. I'm a farting machine.\" The skunk chuckled awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, never heard of that before.\" Greg seemed interested. \"You're constantly gassy, then? That's hilarious!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \"Yup. That's about the gist of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" The boys both laughed just at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan accidentally slipped out another audible fart, short but very powerful-sounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, here we go..\" Jake grinned and looked to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My stomach really hurts..\" Morgan grimaced and then laughed, forcing out a couple of wet ones that synced up to her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz followed up herself with a much longer fart that strongly sustained for about six seconds before tapering off airily. She sighed, wafting the gas towards Jake, who jumped back and shielded his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Liz! That smells like... I'm not even sure what that smells like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like someone dumped a bunch of rotten eggs and used diapers in a dumpster in the middle of summer and left it there for a month.\" Morgan chuckled, flapping her own hands to diffuse the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah - that's literally it!\" Jake laughed and coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smiled proudly. \"I try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about yours, Morgan?\" Greg asked the fox, who looked back at him with an awkward smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme see.. I'm gonna need a tester here..\" Before Greg could even react, Morgan skipped over to him, pulling his head down and turning herself over so that his snout was pushed up against the seat of her pants. Once he was forced into position, she strained out a very loud fart that bubbled against her jeans for about as long as Liz's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg immediately broke out into a mix of laughing hysterically and retching, pushing the fox's butt away from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Morgan! I can't feel my nose!\" He rubbed it to make sure it was even still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did mine smell then?\" Morgan grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smells like rancid cabbage! And.. And cheese or something..\" Greg was just laughing at Morgan's little fart maneuver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's not fair!\" Liz called out. \"He got to sniff it close up, so of course it's gonna be worse, we need this to be a fair contest!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was already nervously grinning in anticipation and dread as the skunk marched over to him, similarly turning herself round, sticking her left leg out behind his head and pulling him in so his face was planted against Liz's jeans, her plump, fat butt jiggling as she settled in her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire in the hole!\" Liz blasted out a tooting fart that sounded like a trombone being played badly, it was twice as long as Morgan's but not quite as wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake could feel the hot rush of fart air against his face, he tried not to inhale but he wasn't able to hold his breath for twelve seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was already laughing at how long Liz's fart was, but when Jake pulled himself away and started dry heaving on his paws and knees he started laughing even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yours are worse.. Definitely worse, oh god..\" Jake was coughing, but still laughing, finding the absurd length and smell of Liz's flatulence hilarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, girl..\" Greg pinched his nose and the smell wafted over to him and Morgan. \"That's nasty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it's outside. You should smell how bad it is when we were in our dorm!\" Morgan laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of dorms... You girls could come back to ours, if you'd like?\" Greg asked warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure your friends would be too happy about it.\" Liz remembered their reaction earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, who cares about them! I'd rather bring a couple of cute girls back to our place than keep those guys happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'd murder us if we brought them home!\" Jake added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. We don't have to leave just yet.\" Morgan pointed out. \"We could stay in the park, maybe go grab something to eat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you girls just had Mexican.\" Greg smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, we can always manage more food!\" Liz patted her belly, letting another small toot rip out of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up to you girls.\" Jake grinned. </span></div></div>",

What's that?\" Jake leaned in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm thinking, those two buddies of yours - uh, John and Mike right? Maybe they just need to be shown how funny farts can be.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning what exactly?\" Greg asked, just as anxious to hear Liz's plan as his friend was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We head back there, we act normal, we apologise for grossing them out or whatever, then when they least expect it, both me and Morgan let rip big time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolves almost fell over laughing. \"Oh, geez! Imagine the look on Mike's face!\" Greg clutched his stomach as he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! That would be hilarious!\" Jake agreed. Liz smiled proudly that her little scheme had been met with such a positive response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already feeling a big one brewing, if I hold it in it'll be like twice the size by the time we get there.\" Morgan added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And by the sounds of it, you could produce one TWELVE times the size anytime you want!\" Jake giggled to Liz, who sort of humbly shrugged her shoulders and grinned in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg collected himself. \"We are gonna get kicked out of our dorm, I just know it, but it's gonna be worth it just for their reactions alone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of four set off towards furry heights, which was, according to Jake and Greg, within walking distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dorm room door knocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it.\" Mike got up from the sofa where he and John were playing games, scratching his side casually as he opened the door, Greg and Jake looking back at him on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey guys. You decided to finally ditch those-\" <br>\r\nBefore he could finish his sentence, he noticed the girls standing behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You brought them here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They want to apologise, Mike.\" Jake pushed his way into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked over with contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'm not having them in here! They'll stink the entire dorm up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They promised not to do that anymore. Seriously! And it's not just your dorm - we live here too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike sighed, dragged his paw across his forehead and stepped out the way, allowing Greg, Liz and Morgan to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really are sorry.\" Liz pulled a look of feigned sincerity, her hands held behind her back innocently as her and Morgan bowed their heads in front of John and Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I guess it's ok, it's just, really gross.\" Mike was still unsure about letting the girls in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know we went too far. We just have a kinda silly sense of humor, I suppose\" Morgan adopted the same apologetic tone as the girls walked over to the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the others were distracted, Jake grabbed the door key from the small table beside the entrance and quickly locked it behind him, stuffing the key into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! I remember playing this game as a kid! Super dragon warriors, right?\" Liz sat on the arm of the chair, causing John to look over suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the second one, actually.\" He corrected her bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan took a seat on the chair next to John, lying back into the sofa and spreading her legs. At this point she was still trying to hold in what felt like a mammoth fart, though she knew any sudden movement could cause her to lose her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls were sat either side of the unsuspecting wolf, who seemed to ignore their presence and continued to play his game silently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Greg took a seat on another sofa, looking over at the girls and wondering when they would let loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg, meanwhile, had lightened up a little. Besides, it wasn't everyday they had attractive girls hanging out in their dorm with them, even if the two girls in question had just been ripping ass like a couple of sailors earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Greg couldn't help but admire just how good looking Morgan and Liz really were, and their sense of humour was a huge plus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz flashed a look over to Greg and Jake, shifting from one cheek to another as her eyes seemed to narrow in concentration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a low, very loud fart rumbled into the arm of the chair, Liz gritted her teeth as the fart eased out for about twenty seconds, John looking over in pure, petrified shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! Get the fuck out of here - now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike went over to the door, fuming with anger as he stomped his foot and pointed to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of listening to him, the girls just laughed, and it was Morgan's turn to let rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, that's awful!\" John quickly shielded his nose with a paw. Before he could get up and away from Liz, the skunk took the opportunity to quickly hold the wolf down against the sofa. She was surprisingly strong when she wanted to be, and every time John tried to break free and push her away, she just pushed back harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan lifted herself away from the wolf, arms balled into fists as she released the floodgates and unleash a very loud, bubbly rasp from her butt. She bit her lip and contorted her face in various ways as she tried to sustain the massive fart ripping through her jeans - as she held down the struggling Wolf, Liz counted the seconds in her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt surpassed ten seconds, fifteen, twenty, twenty five, thirty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy hell!\" Greg was laughing hysterically, as was Jake, but Mike continued to shout at the two girls to leave, reaching for the door and finding it was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's eyed widened as she looked over to Morgan, who had just naturally loosed a 43 second long fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are disgusting!!\" John's eyes were watering at the combined stink of the girls' massive farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was starting to push back harder and harder, but Liz had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly turned around and sat down on the wolf's lap, putting all of her weight down onto him as he screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no way to talk to a girl!\" She clicked her tongue and forced out a number of loud, long, very wet rippers into his lap, her tongue lolling out as they rumbled deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan joined in, letting out another massively long fart into the poor sofa cushion. She wasn't able to beat the length of her last one, but came about halfway close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UNLOCK THIS DOOR OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY!\" Mike threatened Greg and Jake, who were still wiping tears from their eyes - partly from laughing too hard, and partly from the potent smell that had crept over the room and towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Morgan looked at each other. Had they gone too far, or was their lesson only just beginning?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As tempted as Liz was to ignore the wolves' anger and keep going, she saw that Morgan was looking a little uneasy at how confrontational John and especially Mike had become. Plus, she decided, it was probably best not to get Greg and Jake in too much trouble with their roommates. \"Oh, lighten up, it was all in good fun!\" Liz said as she rose to her feet, attempting to calm the angry wolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Fun</i>?\" Mike asked. \"Sorry, but unlike <i>those</i> idiots,\" he said, pointing to Greg and Jake, \"it takes a lot more than that to get me to laugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz saw that this was going nowhere so she decided to try another route. \"Well come on, you couldn't seriously expect us to hold all that in, could you? Do you want us to have painful gas cramps or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you might have a point and maybe I'd be willing to let it slide a little if you didn't fart <i>on</i> us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nodded and added, \"Besides that, it's not normal to fart like that. You should probably see a doctor about that or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz thought this could segue into telling them about her disorder, but the thought had barely entered her mind before Mike spoke up. \"I'm not gonna ask again. You've got to the count of ten to unlock the door. One...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" Jake said dismissively as he stood up. \"I should've known you two couldn't take a joke,\" he muttered as he pulled the key out of his pocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remind me what part of that was supposed to be funny,\" John said. He coughed a bit from the thick cloud if stench that had engulfed the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair, Jake, I think John has a point,\" Greg said. \"That wasn't funny at all... it was freaking hilarious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course <i>you</i> would think that,\" Mike said. Before Greg could ask what that was supposed to mean, the clicking sound of the door unlocking sent John and Mike darting toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna give the room a couple hours to air out,\" Mike explained once he stepped out into the comparatively fresh air of the hallway. \"We <i>don't</i> wanna see those girls here by the time we come back.\" He nearly slammed the door. The four were silent for a few seconds as they gave Mike and John a chance to get out of earshot. Then they laughed. It started as a chuckle from Liz until the whole room had burst into a powerful guffaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Morgan, I never knew you had it in ya!\" Liz joked. \"I timed that sucker. Guess how long it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I guess about 30 seconds?\" Morgan asked with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try 43!\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Haha... wow! Hard to believe I <i>still</i> have more after that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, you said you loaded up on Mexican, so it's not too hard to believe,\" Greg half-joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's true,\" Morgan admited. Without warning, she blasted another noisy one. This one still didn't come close to breaking her record, but clocking in at around a dozen seconds, it was still quite impressive, especially given its ludicrous volume that refused to let up. On the contrary; the longer it went on the louder and louder it got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Morgan... any louder and I think you would have shook the walls!\" Greg teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my ears are ringing,\" Jake joked, rubbing his ears in an exaggerated fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Liz asked, \"'Cause that would mean you wouldn't be able to hear <i>this!</i>\" While Liz's fart wasn't quite as loud as Morgan's recent one had been, she was not necessarily trying to rip the loudest one possible. Instead, she decided to prove that Morgan's long one, while impressive in its own right, was child's play compared to what the skunk was capable of when she was actually <i>trying</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was deep, almost alarmingly so. She closed her eyes when she saw the amused looks on her friends' faces; she wanted no distractions as she focused on keeping it going as long as she possibly could. Concentrating proved more difficult than she had expected when her usual urge to laugh was only exacerbated by the contagious laughter of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's been going for a full minute!\" She heard Jake, who had apparently been timing her exclaim, \"How is that even possible!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sniggered at this a little. For several seconds, this resulted in the force she had been pushing with to erratically alternate between soft and gentle. \"It sounds like her butt is laughing!\" Morgan pointed out, much to the wolves' amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz soon regained her composure by biting her bottom lip. After a moment of thought, she got an idea. She placed a paw on her rump, muffling he noise. While she sometimes liked to play with the tone by moving her paw on and off her behind, this time was different. For the last couple dozen seconds, she left her paw there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and breathed a sigh of relief as the gargantuan fart came to an end. But before joining her friends in laughter, there was just one thing she wanted to do. She took a few steps over to Jake, then placed the paw that had been on her rump moments earlier on his snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, this got him gagging a bit, but only got more laughs from Morgan and Greg. \"That's some powerful stuff!\" Jake said as he coughed and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might wanna text Mike to tell him to give this place <i>another</i> couple hours to air out!\" Greg said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jake, you were timing me. How'd I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One minute, thirty-eight seconds,\" Jake happily reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez,\" Morgan said, shaking her head in disbelief, \"nearly a full minute longer than mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's any consolation, you're the only person I've heard besides me to fart like <i>that.</i> You've got potential, kid!\" She shot Morgan a reassuring smile. \"Anyway, while I was blowing that last one, I had some time to think and I got an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we <i>all</i> had plenty of time to think,\" Jake joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, your friends said they didn't wanna <i>see</i> us here,\" Liz said, ignoring Jake's comment. \"They never said anything about smelling us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you, a law major?\" Greg teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because they're gone doesn't mean we can't gas up the room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you've proven that quite thoroughly,\" Jake said. \"But I dunno, maybe we should go somewhere else to hang out. If they come back and the room smells worse than when they left, I don't think they'll be too happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what wouldn't be hilarious about that?\" Greg shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" the gray wolf admitted, \"but I kind of value having four functioning limbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you've got a point there, but let's leave it up to the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Liz looked at each other.</span></div></div>",

Lemme toot on his games console!\" Liz tiptoed excitedly over to the TV, squatting down so her tail curled up across the screen, her butt poised carefully over the console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels like some sort of betrayal given how much of a gamer I usually am, but still...\" her fart came out immediately beefy and very loud, she bit her bottom lip as she laid the loud stink bomb down over the console, wiggling her butt around a bit to ensure it coated every part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Liz, that sounds like a creaky door opening!\" Greg grabbed his gut as he laughed. The smell was already strong, but the girls were making it even stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do those guys usually hang out in here?\" Morgan flashed the wolves a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... well John usually sits on the couch playing games or whatever. Mike sometimes hangs out in his room. He's always listening to music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we give him a new genre of music to listen to?\" Liz giggled to Morgan, finishing her territorial gassing of John's games console, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God..\" Jake began to laugh just as hard as Greg was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed towards the room Mike and John shared together. It was nearly as big as Liz and Morgan's <i>entire</i> dorm room. Those furry heights tuition fees sure went somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is huge.\" Morgan looked around; there were two beds and a little hifi system next to one of them - that had to be Mike's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen stepped over to Mike's bed, leaning down to look at his music player and letting a little squeaker fart slip out accidentally in the process. \"Whoops! I'm ripping farts so much they're getting eager to come out.\" She laughed, causing the others to laugh along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz took a dive onto the bed, \"Cannonball!!\" Doing a little roll and landing sitting on Mike's pillow, instantly sending a few dampened blasts into it, still very bassy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz, meanwhile, was taking a look through his CDs. \"Which one does he listen to most of all?\" She looked back at the boys, who thought about it for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg reached down and picked one up, handing it to Morgan. \"This one, I think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, Greg quickly stepped out of the blast zone before she held the CD case against her butt, giving a little push and letting some gas out onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe case cut off the sound slightly, even more so as Morgan pushed it against her plushy rump a little more, almost silencing her bubbly blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was still ripping a few farts casually onto Mike's pillow, occasionally planting one on her hand so she could take a smell of her palm - there was always something satisfying about smelling her own product, especially how it smelled today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the next hour, the girls continued to lay their gas all over the dorm. On the beds, on the cushions, under the covers, on the sofas, in the kitchen, in the bathroom - they thoroughly left no spot un-stinked, and Greg and Jake watched on hysterically as they managed to produce enough gas to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to run a little low, I think.\" Morgan laughed as her and Liz were giving the main couch another dose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the ones you've been ripping, I'm hardly surprised!\" Liz chuckled. \"I sometimes forget not everyone has my condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg quickly looked down at his phone as a text lit up the screen. \"Ah, shit! They're coming back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hide! Hide!\" Jake gestured the girls towards a sliding wardrobe door, and they quickly scurried inside, letting Jake shut them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were small slats all the way down the wardrobe door, meaning Liz and Morgan were able to peek out without being seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, even the wardrobes here are spacious.\" Morgan relaxed against the wall as Liz continued to look through one of the gaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep a hold on that butthole of yours.\" The skunk whispered. \"I think they're back now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stepped forward and looked through with Morgan furtively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg and Jake sat in one of the sofas that hadn't been totally stunk up by Liz and Morgan, trying to look casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn and Mike walked through the dorm door, and their reaction was instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh! God! I told you they would still be here!\" Mike covered his face with his forearm, angrily stepping inside and looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They went ages ago!\" Greg looked over at them, \"You guys are so rude, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it smells like they're still here... Jeez, are you sure there isn't a dead animal in the floorboards or something?\" John went to sit down on the sofa, unknowingly releasing even more saved-up fart fumes into the atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, that smell only got here once those ''girls'' arrived.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys, stop overreacting!\" Jake was a little pissed at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not. Do you guys not have working noses or something? It smells even <i>worse</i> in here than when we left! Eugh... I'm telling you, it just ain't natural to have something that smells like this coming out of your body. Not at all.\" Mike walked towards his room, standing against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg rolled his eyes. \"I hope you two are happy. We finally bring some cute girls back here and you two force them to leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn and Mike shared a look. \"Dude, those were not cute girls. Cute girls don't rip ass like a guy... no - like a horse!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny.\" Jake added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you're under the age of twelve. I think it's good they left. You guys shouldn't be hanging round with girls like that. They're weird.\" Mike walked into his room to listen to some music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you guys are boring! You just can't accept the fact two girls can fart even better than you guys, that's it I bet.\" Jake mumbled to himself, occasionally shooting glances at the wardrobe. He was impressed that he hadn't heard a peep from it the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no. Not at all. I would never want to fart like <i>that</i>. They must have a horrible diet.\" John went to reach down to turn on his console, and was hit by another wall of skunk gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh! Even my console stinks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike came storming out of his room. \"My bed smells like crap! So does my music! You guys can't expect us to believe this is all the same gas they left earlier? It would have dissipated by now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Greg giggled to each other. \"You guys are getting paranoid now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan quietly tapped Liz on the shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Liz... I need to fart..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I, but you've gotta hold it.\" Liz whispered as softly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying... but I can't... it's gonna..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>brrrrp</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Mike immediately looked round at the wardrobe, brow furrowed in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Greg looked at each other - if they wanted to keep Morgan and Liz a secret, they had to act fast.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I told you! I knew you had them here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They... I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Mike shouted across the room, his voice filled with anger.<br>\r\n\"No more excuses. You know what? You two... you two slobs can get out of this dorm room right now, or I'm going straight to the dean and I'm getting you kicked out - and maybe get myself a new room while I'm at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, man!\" Jake protested. \"You guys are such drama queens, you know that? God, you can't have any fun, can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we don't want to leave? Jake and Greg want us to stay.\" Liz raised her eyebrows boastfully, standing up to Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care! You are both disgusting! You've made our entire room stink of... of... fox and skunk flatulence! How can you not see that it's unacceptable!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just having a little fun.\" Morgan added. \"You two need to chill out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike searched for some kind of reply, but instead just let out an annoyed grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is mine and Jake's dorm, too!\" Greg stood up, crossing his arms defensively.<br>\r\n\"If we want Liz and Morgan to stay... well, that's two against two, so you can't make them leave!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn got up and seemed to be getting more annoyed himself. \"Look. How about this? If you can all go into Jake and Greg's room and leave us alone, you can stay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike went to argue against the idea, but realized it was probably the only compromise they could come to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, but if you fart anywhere near me again I'm gonna get you kicked out.\" The wolf went into his room and slammed the door, leaving Liz, Morgan, Jake and Greg to go off into the boys' bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake closed the door behind them all. \"Geez. I'm sorry, girls, I really don't know why they're acting like this. They are kinda uptight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Liz smiled \"but now I have the chance, I need to get something out of my system.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped towards Jake, grabbing him around the neck and pulling him round into a position so that his snout was pressed against her butt, eyes squinting casually as she pushed out one very loud, popping fart into his face. \"Ahh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man... I can't feel my nose...\" the wolf quickly pulled away and rubbed his snout, Morgan and Gregg laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got something too.\" Morgan announced, letting out a quiet croaker of a fart that slowly grew in volume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz took a seat on Jake's bed, sighing. \"Hey, Morgan, bring that butt over here. I want to see what kind of ammunition you're carrying.\" The skunk giggled. Morgan waltzed over to the bed and stuck her rear toward's Liz's face, the boys watched her eyes roll up to the left as she squeezed another deep, rumbly fart out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sniffed, and then coughed. \"Nerve gas.\" She laughed between coughing fits. \"Very deadly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not so silent.\" Greg added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz laid down onto the bed and released a very long fart as she did so. \"Excuse me.\" She joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's the first time I've heard you say that.\" Jake laughed, taking a risk and sitting beside the skunkette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I guess usually my butt does the talking.\" She demonstrated with a couple of short toots that came out rhythmically, almost as if they were saying something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still not quite believing you never run out of gas.\" Jake giggled. \"I mean... I do, but it's crazy. You must be able to do so many party tricks with a skill like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Party tricks?\" Liz looked up at Jake. \"Like what? Got any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf took a look around the room at what was on offer, thinking of some way Liz could demonstrate her talents.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The one you got in high school?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Morgan immediately stared laughing at the suggestion, Greg following behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. It's not a real trumpet, though, more of a kids one.\" He started to rummage through a big pile of stuff at the foot of his bed, through all the old books he'd never gotten round to reading, and all the the old DVDs he no longer had a use for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Got it!\" He produced a small, faux-brass plastic trumpet, with three little buttons that could be pressed to mimic a real trumpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to give us a performance, Liz?\" Morgan giggled as Greg handed the trumpet to the skunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can certainly try! Can't say I'm much of a musician, but maybe my butt is!\" Liz gave said butt a little shake before putting the trumpet to her mouth and trying it out, pressing the buttons to produce three different notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk then laid back onto the bed, her legs raised apart as she nestled the trumpet mouthpiece somewhere between her cheeks, pushing it around to make sure it was in exactly the right position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta get it in place!\" She said playfully, Jake watching her brow lower in concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gathered around Liz's ass - though not too close of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet everyone.\" Jake was trying not to die from laughter. \"We're about to hear Liz's first symphony.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the key of quesadillas!\" The skunk announced before discharging one loud fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>preeeeeepp!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others immediately clutched their sides in a violent fit of laughter. Liz herself had to hold back the need to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to push out more farts, pushing down on the different valves with each one to play a little song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! This is so gross!\" Jake wiped a tear from his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up! Here's the grand finale!\" Liz's legs spread apart a bit more as she made another harsh-sounding fart sound through the little trumpet, Morgan could already tell she was trying to make it a longer one, pushing the valves up and down so it went up and down in pitch, only making everyone else laugh even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, stop! I'm gonna explode!!\" Morgan called out, rolling around on Greg's bed, before she really <i>did</i> explode, a loud, wet fart slipping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you!\" The fox snorted with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz finally cut off her long, surprisingly tuneful fart. \"Thanks for supplying the harmony.\" The skunk chuckled, handing the trumpet to Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only imagine what they're all thinking next door.\" Jake cautiously took a sniff of the trumpet, immediately cringing and putting it down on the bed. \"That stinks. Worse than usual.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can it even get any worse than usual?\" Greg asked from the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, there's nothing Liz can't do with that derri\u00e8re of hers.\" Morgan warned as she smiled at Liz. She'd seen enough examples today to know that statement was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do now?\" Liz sat up again, stretching her arms out, before leaning against Jake's shoulder. He looked down in surprise, but couldn't say he had a problem with Liz resting against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. What do you girls want to do? We're kinda limited to this room unless we go out somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Morgan followed Liz's lead and shuffled up close to Greg. She wasn't sure if it was a romantic gesture or anything, but she felt like she was friendly enough with the wolf to snuggle up to him a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz snapped her fingers, pulling that face as always did when she had an idea.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She usually preferred showing off her ability in situations where everyone found it every bit as funny as she did. Although she had to admit there was a certain schadenfreude to seeing the reactions of people who found it less than amusing. In those situations, she made a distinction between doing it once or twice to get a grossed out response and doing it to the point where it became bullying. She had to admit this situation was starting to feel closer to the latter. Although between her big Mexican meal from earlier shifting her gut into overtime and the encouragement of the others, it was certainly becoming hard to resist keeping it going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Besides,</i> she thought, <i>I don't think the guys would be encouraging us if they knew their friends couldn't handle it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly, she rose from John's lap and pushed her butt as far back as she could make it go. The result was pinning John's head between the headrest of the couch and her behind, her snout directly against her rump. With a small grunt, her behind began to produce an extraordinarily loud noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot content to let her roommate outshine her, Liz decided to try to keep this one going as long as possible. It was certainly a difficult feat to avoid joining in the contagious laughter of her new friends. Especially when she saw the wide-eyed, horrified expression on Mike's face as the fart's length became increasingly surreal. Just to avoid that distraction, she closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, poor John had long given up trying to push her away. At this point, he was simply gagging too much to put up any physical resistance. Liz almost felt bad for him. Then she remembered him calling Morgan disgusting. <i>If she's disgusting, I must be downright revolting,</i> Liz proudly thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to confirm her thoughts, she heard Mike say in a most disapproving tone, \"Look at her smiling. She actually <i>enjoys</i> it. Sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" Jake exclaimed. \"Isn't she awesome?\" Mike's only response to this was a disapproving groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why shouldn't I...\" Liz grunted. It was quite difficult for her to speak while farting and she was attempting to avoid cutting this one off prematurely. \"Take pride in...\" she added, having to take another couple deep breaths before she could finally finish. \"My talent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Talent?'\" Mike repeated dryly. \"You've clearly got something wrong with you. I'm not sure if it's more physical because having that much gas is not normal or whether it's mental because you seem to think it's a good thing.\" Suddenly his voice began shaking, \"H-hey wait a minute, what are you doing to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz opened her eyes to see what caused this dramatic shift in tone. Greg and Jake had grabbed Mike by either arm and were moving him next to John's spot on the couch. They held him in place as Morgan took a few steps over and stood next to Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz held up a single finger to let Morgan know she wanted her to wait before Morgan began joining in on the gassing. After ten or so seconds, Liz's gargantuan fart finally began to taper off into a halt. Morgan held up a hand for Liz to high five. She did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was like... two minutes, I think,\" Liz said. \"I dunno, I tried timing it but there towards the end, I got a little distracted from my counting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was still trying to squirm free, but between Morgan's behind and Greg and Jake holding him down, it was futile. \"Here, let's trade places,\" Liz said, giving Morgan enough room to scoot over to where she had just been standing. \"I got this one warmed up for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a better idea,\" Morgan said with a sinister smirk. \"Let's give John a break. I don't think he's going anywhere anytime soon, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz briefly looked down at John, who alternated between desperately gasping for air and choking on the air he <i>did</i> manage to inhale. \"Yeah, you're probably right. So that leaves me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helping me out with Mike,\" Morgan said with a nod. \"He's got some catching up to do, wouldn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz found it hard to disagree. She hesitated, still a little leery about leaving John unattended for the moment. But Morgan was probably right: he didn't exactly seem ready to get up and move around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked around and sat on the armrest next to Mike. As she took her place, she shot a smirk to Jake, who returned it with a grin of his own and a thumbs up. Once the girls were both situated, Greg and Jake took a few steps back to enjoy the show - and to be able to keep an eye on John in the unlikely event that he'd try anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, neither Liz nor Morgan went out of their way to try to produce insanely long ones. They had already proven their point in that regard. This time, they went more for quantity - although they did not necessarily sacrifice quality for it, either, as plenty of them still surpassed the 15 or 20 second mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite (or perhaps because of) the fact that he had to deal with two flatulent girls as opposed to one, Mike had surprisingly put up more of a fight than John, who just seemed to give up after a while. Mike would manage to push Morgan's rump away from him long enough to curse or insult the girls, his friends who had brought them there, or whatever else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him, the girls had more than enough gas to outlast the adrenaline his anger and frustration were providing him. After dozens of farts to the face from both girls, he had more or less become pacified and, like John, seemed to have a hard time deciding whether he wanted to breathe or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Morgan turned around to look at their handiwork. \"Dunno why he seems out of wind,\" Liz said. \"We gave him plenty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan rolled her eyes at this pun. \"So... what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Doesn't look like they wanna play with us anymore,\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Anymore?'\" Mike repeated. \"Like I'd want to...\" he trailed off into a hacking and coughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might I suggest something?\" Greg asked with a smirk. He, Jake, and the girls huddled a few feet away from the couch, talking low enough to make sure the other two couldn't hear them. \"They want the key, right? My idea is we play a game with them where we hide the key and tell them they can keep it if they find it. But we hide it in a place they wouldn't <i>want</i> to look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where would that be?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In one of the girl's back pockets!\" Greg said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three laughed at this. \"Dude, that's just plain evil,\" Jake said. \"I love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably beats my idea of having them be our judges for a farting contest,\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a bad idea, either,\" Greg admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better make up your minds soon, I don't know how much longer the guys'll stay down,\" Jake said.</span></div></div>",

The new friends chuckled at this synchronized outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I guess you've got me there,\" Liz admitted with a shrug. She then demonstrated their point by lifting a leg ever so slightly as she blared out her loudest fart yet. Though the four were in a relatively secluded part of the park, Morgan and the wolves glanced around, expecting it to be loud enough to catch some stranger's attention. After a good couple dozen seconds of this booming noise, Liz laughed with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a gasbag!\" Jake playfully teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I've been told,\" Liz said with a smile. While it was true that that word had been used to describe her in the past, this was the first time she could recall it being used as a term of endearment rather than a pejorative. It took her no time at all to decide she much preferred being called a gasbag in this context.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he was still chuckling at the skunk's flatulence, Liz noticed something about Jake's expression: there was something about the look on his face that was a little more than amusement. Her smile adopted a much slyer character when she realized what it was. <i>He's already impressed and I've barely gotten started</i>, she thought. <i>Looks like an encore is in order</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could provide one, a sound caught her off guard and made her laugh. The sound was coming from Morgan's behind. The deep, wet fart droned on for quite some time. Now it was Liz's turn to be impressed. <i>I know she said Mexican really got to her, but now she's almost sounding like me,</i> the skunk thought. <i>Awesome. Maybe I'll actually have some competition for once!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just making some room for the ice cream,\" Morgan jokingly explained once it came to a sputtering halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice,\" Greg said. \"So does dairy give you gas too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" Morgan said with a playful wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I like that answer!\" Liz said. \"So where is the ice cream, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's not too far from here,\" Morgan said. \"C'mon, follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, after a short walk, a concession stand came into view. \"I don't think Jake and I want anything,\" Greg said. \"We'll be on that bench over there while you girls get your ice cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, see you guys soon,\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe our luck?\" Jake asked as he and his friend sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, no,\" Greg admitted. \"First these two chicks walk up to us from out of nowhere. Then it turns out that they're not only smoking hot, they're hilarious as well. <i>Then</i> Mike and John bail so we don't even have to fight over them!\" Greg recapped. \"Seriously, what are the odds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With luck like this, I'm almost tempted to go out and buy a lottery ticket,\" Jake joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" Greg agreed. After a brief pause, he added, \"And to top it all off, it seems we've got our eyes on different girls so we don't even have to fight each other!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Jake asked. \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive,\" Greg said with a nod. \"'You're such a gasbag!'\" he repeated, imitating Jake's slightly deeper voice. \"C'mon, man, you were so obvious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I was,\" Jake admitted, gazing at Liz as she waited in line. \"Can you blame me, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you wanna date Old Faithful over there as she 'erupts' every other minute, I'm not gonna stop you. As long as that vixen's booty is mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in line, it was getting close to the girls' turn to order. \"I kinda wish they stood in line with us,\" Liz said. \"I would have 'accidentally' dropped my change and asked Jake to pick it up. Then when he was down there, I would've ripped one right in his face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez,\" Morgan said with a chuckle, \"can you turn <i>every</i> situation into a fart joke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, when you've always got gas and a sense of humor, you're always looking for opportunities,\" Liz declared. \"With the way today's been going, looks like you'll understand soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next!\" The jaguar behind the counter called out. The girls stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smirked when she saw the name of one of the ice cream flavors: Chocolate Pecan Explosion. <i>Oh, I bet it'll be a</i> real <i>explosion once it goes through me,</i> she thought. \"I'll have two scoops of that... Chocolate Pecan <i>Explosion,</i>\" she emphasized the last word and shot Morgan a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good to me too.\" Morgan said. \"Thanks,\" she said when the jaguar produced it quickly. The girls paid and promptly left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess what they named this ice cream,\" Liz said once they were back at the bench. She took a lick of it as she gave the guys time to guess, but they merely shrugged. \"Chocolate Pecan Explosion!\" She took another lick. \"Y'know, I'm tasting chocolate and pecan... I'm not tasting any explosion yet. Maybe that's supposed to come after,\" she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys laughed. \"She even turns dumb dessert names into fart jokes!\" Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" Jake exclaimed in agreement, \"isn't she the funniest!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere seconds after Liz finished her ice cream cone, her stomach gurgled very loudly. \"Jeez, have you even had a chance to digest it yet?\"  Morgan asked, only halfway done with her dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Liz announced with a smirk. \"I think that's just some of the Mexican catching up with me. I'll let you know when the ice cream starts kicking in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't that hurt?\" Jake asked. \"I mean, on top of all the gas your body makes naturally, you've been gorging yourself on stuff that gives you even more gas. I can't imagine your belly feels too good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit,\" Liz admitted. \"Especially when I eat like this.\" She slapped her bloated belly, resulting in a much louder and more violent noise. \"But, hey, that feeling of relief combined with how much it makes me laugh is totally worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan popped the final bite of her cone in her mouth. She let out an enormous, satisfied belch. \"You've got both barrels loaded, huh?\" Greg joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Jake asked Liz when he noticed the thoughtful expression on her face as she tapped her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was just wondering how to make the best use of all this gas,\" Liz said. \"Do I share it all with my new friends or should we look for more furs to prank? Decisions, decisions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, make up your mind soon, I don't know how much longer I can hold this!\" Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she decide?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well... you guys look so comfortable there,\" Liz said. \"Might as well give you a little show.\" She slowly approached the bench with a smirk on her face. When she got close enough, she held out a hand with a single index finger extended. \"Jake, will you do the honor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly!\" Jake eagerly said. He wrapped a hand around Liz's finger to give it a tug...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jake could react, Liz swiftly turned around, kicking a leg up as she did so and just as quickly planting it back on the ground. The result was the skunk straddling Jake's arm with her rump mere centimeters from the gray wolf's snout. Greg and Morgan laughed at this maneuver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was an angry sounding, dry, loud growler of a fart. \"Oh man,\" Morgan said with a chuckle, \"that one sounds like it hurts coming out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Greg agreed, leaning away from Liz in a futile attempt to get away at least slightly from the smell without getting up. \"It probably hurt more holding it in, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging by her face, you're probably right.\" Liz's eyes had rolled into the top of her head. Her mouth was slightly agape with her tongue hanging out a bit. She was obviously very relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face didn't stay like this for long, though. Her eyes closed, as if in deep concentration as the long fart rumbled. When it became apparent that Liz was trying to make this one as long as possible, Greg stood up and walked over next to Morgan. \"I'm not sitting in the blast zone if I don't have to,\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should have timed this one,\" Morgan said. \"How long do you think it's been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. 45 seconds or so?\" Greg shrugged. \"How are you holding up back there?\" He called out to Jake. Jake didn't answer. He was simply sniggering with his mouth closed. \"Yeah, I probably wouldn't open my mouth in your position either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Morgan began farting too. \"You too, huh?\" Greg said. Morgan's was much deeper and louder. Greg wanted to make a snarky remark, but as Morgan's fart grew even louder and louder, he couldn't hold in his laughter anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz laughed a little as well, almost interrupting her enormous fart. However, she soon regained her composure and kept it going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another forty-five seconds, Morgan sighed in relief and joined Greg in his guffaw. \"And of course <i>she's</i> still going.\" After a few seconds, Liz sat down on Jake's lap, still going strong. Jake was now laughing very hard, now not only at the unbelievably flatulent skunk, but also at the ticklish sensation on his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like farting in his face wasn't enough,\" Greg said. \"What, does she want him smelling like her butt from head to toe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a couple dozen seconds, Liz's fart kept growing in volume. Even against Jake's lap, it was now at a comparable volume to Morgan's from moments earlier. Suddenly, however, it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz took a deep breath, scooting off of him and onto the seat of the bench next to him. Finally, she began laughing uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, that was incredible!\" Jake said now that his own laughter had died down enough for him to be able to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Liz said. After a brief pause, she added, \"Honestly, with how I've been eating, that probably won't even be my biggest one today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tempted to say 'You can't be serious,' but you always seem to prove me wrong,\" Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, you're learning!\" Liz joked, leaning back in the bench, getting more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet you're really looking forward to going back to your room,\" Greg jokingly said to Morgan. \"Those small AU dorms are just the place you wanna be with Liz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, to be fair, I <i>did</i> encourage her,\" Morgan admitted. \"Besides, I'll be firing back too!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, speaking of our room, do you guys wanna check it out? It's had time to air out. Can't promise it'll stay that way, though.\" She let out a short fart (for Liz's standards) to emphasize her point.</span></div></div>",

Greg nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls drive here?\" Jake added, looking towards Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. Morgan has a car, but we kinda got the bus from the food court, however the campus is only a little walk away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't both gas the bus out on the way here?\" Greg asked jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't, but that would have been pretty funny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pack headed back towards Anthro U, chatting casually amongst each other. Any passer by would just assume they were a simple group of normal friends, not that the two girls were walking gas machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Morgan both held their farts in every time the need to let rip surfaced; clearly they both had the same plan in store for Jake and Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe campus wasn't too busy at this time of day. Most furs seemed to be in lectures, or lazing around in their dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is...\" Jake wanted to avoid being rude. \"...<i>smaller than furry heights</i>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz chuckled. \"It's okay, you can say it - it's shitty compared to where you guys study. We're not all posh boys like you two!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Greg laughed together. \"Oh, we're not posh. At all. Mike and John are a little... uh... stuck up sometimes. If we were all posh and snooty we wouldn't be hanging with girls like you, would we? <i>no offence</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz giggled. \"None taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the block where Liz and Morgan's dorm room was - the dorms were almost all same sex, but the rules seemed to be pretty lax about allowing guys in to visit, or even sleep over. If there were rules in place, Morgan had already seen plenty of students breaking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Liz announced, grabbing the door knob to 17C \"casa de la Liz and Morgan!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door, revealing their pretty poky little room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. It's a lot smaller than the one we have at Furry Heights, but it's cosy I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't even have a TV in here! Can you believe it?\" Morgan sat on her bed frustratedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, now I understand why you two were outside so much.\" Greg giggled - him and Jake decided to play it safe and sit down on the sofa opposite the beds. Liz sat down on hers, immediately releasing some gas as if she'd just sat down onto a whoopee cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It surprisingly doesn't smell like total ass in here.\" Jake commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just you wait. Now we're in here it's gonna get worse.\" Morgan leant over to one side and squeezed out a decently beefy fart, which ended up sounding about ten times as wet as she thought it would. She shared a glance with Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh! You're already back at it!\" Jake waved his paw in front of his face expectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was holding that one in the whole walk over.\" Morgan smiled weakly, a little embarrassed that such a disgusting sounding fart had come out of her own rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I was holding <i>this</i> in while you were both having that conversation...\" Liz lifted her leg slightly, eyebrow raising as she let out a quiet five second rasping fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Greg rolled their eyes. \"Like you need to even hold anything in.\" Jake quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but they still build up more if I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still kinda curious how your whole condition works. I mean, if you were to just hold your farts in, would you explode or something? Does your stomach just keep creating more and more gas?\" Jake leant on the arm of the sofa as he asked Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"I usually don't hold it for that long, but I can pretty easily.\" She laughed. \"If I do for a super long time, I get pretty bad cramps. I think the gas kinda fills up in there constantly, but I'm sure it would cap off eventually. See, most skunks have their spray stored up, instead of that I have flatulence.\" Liz flashed a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed you can keep up with her when she's got such an advantage.\" Greg addressed Morgan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's certainly difficult. I'm not as good as Liz, but Mexican food does give me pretty bad gas. It's not as constant as Liz's, of course.\" Morgan paused for a second. \"Jeez, here I am talking to two guys about farts! I never once expected to be in this situation!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake chuckled and changed the subject. \"So, what do you two study here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing art.\" Morgan responded politely and with a sweet little grin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"History.\" Liz replied, picking something out of her nose and examining it on her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both doing different majors, huh? You seem like close classmates.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shook her head. \"Actually, we only met earlier today. Liz just arrived, this is her first day here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolves were both visibly surprised. \"No kidding. You seem like you've been friends for years! Being comfortable enough to let rip around each other like that... I've been friends with Greg for ages and I would feel a bit weird about doing that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you two should try sometime.\" Liz suggested. The guys weren't sure how to respond exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You never know, maybe sometime you'll get us doing it too.\" Greg grinned awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan laughed. \"Well, when you're around Liz it's kinda contagious. This time yesterday I was the sort of fur who never really farted, and kept it to myself, but look at me now!\" <br>\r\nShe tugged on her tail and rumbled the bed for a few stinky seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake laughed, still impressed. \"Haha! Point made. Hey, uh, you girls want to do something? I mean, I'm enjoying talking, but maybe we could go out... do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a date?\" Liz replied, smirking suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake immediately went a little red. \"N-No.. not exactly... unless you want it to be.. I, uh, just mean go find somewhere to eat or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or,\" Greg began to make his own suggestion, \"Maybe we could stay in tonight and have ourselves a little competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Competition?\" Liz's ears perked up at the mention of the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. A little fart contest, me and Jake can judge it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz is bound to win that!\" Morgan pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries. We could order in some takeout so you can refuel some of that gas.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both solid suggestions.\" Liz nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what'll it be, girls? Out or in?\" </span></div></div>",

It's a really big pool, too, so it's pretty nice.\" Gregg was liking this idea, unlike Morgan, he was pretty keen on the idea of seeing the girls in swimwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like it's sorted, then!\" Liz exclaimed, leading the gang off towards the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... please try not to get us kicked out or anything, Liz.. I feel like everyone's gonna immediately notice if you start farting in the pool.\" Gregg laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, as if that thing isn't already about 60% pee!\" Liz waved her hand dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's big enough that we'll have our own space, and knowing Liz and Morgan they'll be sneaky about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded in agreement. She was still feeling a little nervous about getting into her bikini, but - as with the farting - having Liz around made it easier to be open and not fearful; the fact that the skunk was so confident in her grossness and didn't really seem to care about what anybody thought of it was starting to rub off on Morgan, which she really liked. She'd always usually been a bit shy and awkward but Liz managed to bring her out of her shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk through some trees, Liz, Morgan, Jake and Gregg emerged on the sun-heated tiles along the side of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really was a huge pool, Jake and Gregg were right. The main pool was shaped in a sort of curve, with some parts being deeper and some more shallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere did in fact seem to be already be a sort of jacuzzi-pool, which was next to the main one and a lot smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a pool clearly for younger kids with a large plastic elephant that sprayed water from its trunk every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above all the pools, though, were the huge water slides. There were five, each one higher and more exciting than the last, with furs shooting out into the main pool area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the side of the pool were a few shops: a large store which sold pool toys, swimwear, goggles and snorkels, an ice cream stand similar to the one they had just visited, and then a tiki-themed restaurant down at one end that seemed to serve burgers, hot dogs, and various Mexican junk food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Morgan looked around her. \"This is pretty nice for a public pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregg nodded. \"Yeah, you can see where most of the park's funding went.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first thing's first, we need some swimming stuff.\" Liz pointed out, heading towards the swim store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of foam, rubber and chlorine hit them as they entered. It wasn't a huge store, but there seemed to be enough of a selection of swimwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys have no idea how hard I'm having to hold my gas in right now. I think that ice cream is starting to really kick in..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan chuckled discreetly so they wouldn't alert everyone else in the store. \"Me too. I don't know what was in that stuff, but it's not sitting well with me, and I never got all that Mexican out of my system..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her taut stomach to prove her point, hearing a deep, displeased growl, and then letting a short, quiet belch escape her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you two are crazy!\" Jake couldn't help but laugh, as he and Gregg picked out any old swimming trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. I kinda like this one.\" Liz picked out a bikini which, funnily enough, was covered in a cloud pattern along with a nice shade of cobalt blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah. If those clouds were tinted green it would be more fitting.\" Jake pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, farts are invisible, so they could be any color!\" Liz grinned excitedly, walking over to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregg tapped Morgan on the shoulder. \"Hey, how about this one? It's cute.\" He gestured towards a very small, pink bikini which seemed like it would do a pretty bad job of covering everything up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking more... this one.\" Morgan laughed nervously, picking up a black swimsuit that covered most of her torso. She was way too nervous to wear anything revealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the group had payed for their costumes, they all headed towards the changing rooms, which were located to one side of the swimming shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should buy one of those toys. The inflatable dolphin looked cool.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure! When me and Gregg are changed we'll head over and buy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two wolves and the girls parted ways, heading to their respective changing booths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz entered her own booth and began to undress. She hadn't worn too much today so it didn't take long to slip off her jeans, her t-shirt, and then her bra and panties, making sure to take her socks off before putting her new bikini on; she gave them a little sniff before putting them in her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blegh... my feet sure do get sweaty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure was building more and more in her belly. She wanted to have it saved up for whatever pranks her and Morgan were soon going to soon be perpetrating, but at the same time it wouldn't be a bad idea to relieve the pressure ever so slightly and take some of the pain away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the skunk leant over to slip the bikini bottoms on, a short, but very loud fart slipped out, sounding almost like a discordant brass fanfare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz!\" She heard Morgan call from a few booths over. Luckily there didn't seem to be anyone else in the changing room right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! That was an accident.\" Liz laughed, taking a sniff and then pausing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God.\" Liz's voice dropped to a deadly serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I just caught wind of that fart.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the worst smelling thing that has ever come out of my butt. Oh GOD!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan only laughed at Liz's extreme reaction. \"Oh, wow, looks like you've got some pretty toxic ammunition there then. I'm gonna save mine, I don't imagine it will smell much better than yours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get out of this booth, my eyes are watering!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz began to laugh hard, still holding back the storm that was brewing in her bowels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shortly came out of her own booth, now dressed in her swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was fairly small, and her figure was not nearly as voluptuous and shapely as Liz's, but still cute and attractive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, girl, you look good!\" Morgan whistled jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good too!\" Liz grinned.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure the boys will really appreciate that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shook her head. \"I do not have a body for swimming, not like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shrugged. \"I mean, I constantly eat junk food and I can't remember the last time I really did any exercise, so why my body looks this way is beyond me\". <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Man, it's true that girls take forever to get changed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Liz went and let something slip out.\" Morgan smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! I thought you were holding it in!\" Jake almost found himself weirdly disappointed that Liz had let gas out and he hadn't been around to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was just a little, don't worry - I have far more. I mean, it's not like I'm running out any time soon, and... I think I have poisonous farts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded. \"Apparently they're the worst smelling ones she's ever had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked concerned. \"Oh god, that can't be good! They already smell bad enough as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait until you get a load of these ones!\" Liz patted her bottom and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, let's go put these bags down somewhere. Me and Greg bought some towels while we were in there, we kinda need some for when we get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the pool was a pretty large green area surrounded by trees. Furs put their towels down, and either sat and sunbathed or left their bags while they went for a dip in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group settled with a spot right on the edge of the trees, away from everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure what we should try first.\" Morgan watched as a young tiger cub came flying out of the water slide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It all looks fun.\" Liz agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first thing's first, we need to get this thing inflated.\" Jake picked up the large rubber dolphin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, shoot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We forgot to buy an air pump. I don't want to have to go back there a second time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mischievous smile crawled across Liz's face. \"You don't need to. You've got your own air pump right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do?\" Greg asked, looking around, before picking up on the point Liz was trying to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunkette took the dolphin from Jake and began to fiddle with the little plastic air stopper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not seriously gonna do that, Liz?\" Morgan was already chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Nothing wrong with putting my gas to good use.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Morgan should help out, too.\" Greg clapped and laughed. \"Two butts are better than one, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \"As much as I'm one for farting in public, I think maybe we should do this behind those trees..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others agreed. They didn't exactly want to get thrown out before they even got in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gathered in the little forested area, making sure they were far away from anyone who might be looking at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg, Jake and Morgan stood together, while Liz stood opposite them and quickly looked around her one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her bikini bottoms down slightly, taking the little inflation tube from the neck of the dolphin and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh!\" She grimaced. \"I<i>t's in</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were already laughing like crazy, but their laughter seemed to only increase as they began to hear the muffled, whining sound of Liz's gas inflate the dolphin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so full of gas that it was effortless to ease it out, letting it blow the inflatable toy up surprisingly quickly, the crinkling sound of rubber was all they could hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! It's actually inflating!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz still looked if she were deep in concentration. It wasn't hard to keep the fart going without any interruptions - she was more trying not to burst out laughing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dolphin was beginning to form into shape, and while still holding the stopper, Liz's fart died down suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, your turn, Morgan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! You blew it up that much with one fart!?!\" Jake wiped a tear from his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smiled as she pulled the little rubber tube out of her behind. <br>\r\n\"Oh, I only stopped so Morgan would get a go. With the gas I've got right now, I could probably inflate about five of these all the way up and all with one single fart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez... looks like your butt does have its uses.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan took the dolphin off Liz, making sure not to let any air out as she shoved it into place herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately the quiet, but unmistakeable sound of a raspy fart could be heard, it didn't come out with quite as much force as Liz's, but the dolphin continued to blow up into shape, Morgan biting her lip. She'd been holding her gas in for so long that it felt like pure bliss to let it out, and was no challenge to keep it going for five seconds... ten seconds... fifteen... twenty....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Greg laughed and spluttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half a minute the dolphin was fully inflated with the girls' gas. Morgan quickly put an end to her lengthy rip before she popped it or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... I needed that..\" she pulled the stopper out, quickly closing it and holding the fully-inflated toy in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels warm..\" she laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make sure nobody goes and tries to blow that up with their mouth.\" Liz chuckled and beamed at the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! Catch!\" Morgan threw the inflatable towards Greg, who reacted almost as if someone had just thrown him an atomic bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe you both filled that entire thing up with gas..\" he threw it to Jake, who threw it back again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't imagine how bad it smells in there right now, I'm telling you that ice cream has given me grim reaper farts.\" Liz shuddered, as her belly glorped and groaned again as if to warn the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Morgan agreed. \"It certainly felt like it kicked in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get to the pool!\" Jake held the dolphin carefully under his arm and lead the others back across the grassy area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped at the edge. \"What do you girls wanna do first?\" Jake looked back at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were the water slides - Liz was already thinking of a few pranks they could be used for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the spa area - with there already being so many bubbles it would make some sneaky fart jokes easy to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, there was the main pool itself. Some underwater farts would be hilarious, and the inflatable dolphin seemed like fun.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think I'd like to try them first.\" Morgan looked to Liz for her opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too, I've got some ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Gregg looked at each other and laughed. \"Ideas? You mean some pranks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just thought of a little challenge me and Morgan could try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Morgan was feeling in a slightly competitive mood: she really wanted to show off the gas that the ice cream had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, there are five slides, and all of them of different heights. I think we should see if we can rip a fart the entire way down!\" Liz chuckled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the challenge, but it'll also be hilarious for whoever has to go down the slide after us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan laughed loudly, garnering some glances from people sat around her. \"Oh wow! Yeah, I like that idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are evil, Liz!\" Jake and Gregg giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna stink that slide out for a whole week, they'll have to shut it down.\" Gregg added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz chuckled. \"Probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a very long ten minutes waiting in line, Liz and Morgan finally neared the top of the steps and the entrance to the second highest slide - they had both decided to start with this one, and then if they both managed to sustain a fart for the entire slide down, they'd both move onto the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was in front of Morgan, and behind them was a wolf who seemed to be a few years younger than them and his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when they were at the top, and it was high enough that Jake and Gregg seemed miles away, the highest slide in the park was still considerably taller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. next.\" The complacently bored looking hyena waved Liz along. She looked back at Morgan with that little grin she had become so used to seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz grabbed the metal bars above the entrance to the large plastic tube, and hoisted herself along, at the same time loosening her bowels and letting a very loud, bubbly fart blast out of her in a long drone which got quieter and quieter as she flew down the slide, every now and then it would go under the water and then out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan tried to contain her laughter as the hyena watching over the slide looked perplexedly at the entrance, trying to work out whether he'd just heard a girl fart or if there was something wrong with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. probably just the bolts.\" He said under his breath, still the distant sound of one long, continuous fart echoed up through the slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. Next.\" He gestured towards Morgan, who stepped up to the slide, keeping a tight hold on her gas until she was inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregg and Jake looked round as Liz splashed down into the water, sending up a bigger splash than a skunk of her size should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it weren't enough that she'd held a fart the whole way down, as she swam over to the side a large torrent of bubbles surfaced for about another two or three seconds, before Liz cut the flow off and gasped in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello boys.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, everyone could hear that! That was so loud!\" They were both almost rolling around on the floor from laughing, clutching their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, that was easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, another muffled, but very reverb-heavy sound began to blast out above them. They all looked up to hear the sound of Morgan farting her way down the slide, it wavered in pitch ever so slightly as she rounded a bend, but still sustained for the entire trip down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan splashed down shortly after, resurfacing and immediately holding her muzzle in her paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh!! Liz, that was terrible! I could smell yours all the way down!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz laughed. \"Well, you just added your own dose of stink yourself, you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan swam over to the side of the pool to join the others. \"It just kept coming out of me! I did it all the way down, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Gregg could respond, the younger wolf who had been in the queue behind them appeared from the exit of the slide, splashing violently and coughing. \"Oh, man, something died in there!\" He announced to a few furs who were swimming nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Liz looked at each other and laughed. \"That's gonna be trapped in there for ages. I almost feel sorry for everyone in that line.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz grinned. \"Almost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, girls, time to try the next step up!\" Jake encouraged, he knew that with the amount of gas Liz had - or rather the fact she never seemed to run out - she could easily tackle the highest slide in the park, she could probably fart all the way down one twice as long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo! Time to contaminate another ride here!\" Liz pulled herself out of the pool, accidentally loosing a moist fart in the process and giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls and guys walked over to the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.. look..\" Morgan pointed to the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregg gave it a read. \"Oh, it's like a ride down on an inflatable raft... four people only.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at each other. \"Perfect.\" Liz stepped towards the queue, leaving the others to follow behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wait was almost twice as long as with the previous ride, but before they knew it, they were at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're... high up.\" Jake gulped. He was less scared of heights and more scared of how long he would be stuck in a tube with Morgan and Liz farting all the way down, if they were really as bad as Liz made out, his lungs were in for a ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I can see the whole park from up here..\" Morgan looked over and tried to see if maybe she could spot the university from here, but they weren't quite that high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all got onto the large yellow raft, each person had their own little seat and handles they were instructed to hold tightly onto as they went down. Liz sat next to Jake, with Morgan and Gregg sat just opposite them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go!!\" Liz shouted out as they were pushed on their way, disappearing into a dark tube, being carried downwards by the strong current.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were surrounded by darkness, and not even five seconds in Liz's butt sputtered into action; it sounded like a bee buzzing, getting progressively louder the longer it went on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, Morgan grunted and began releasing her own monstrous fart - a lot bassier than Liz's was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god! They're filling both ends of the frequency spectrum!\" Gregg chortled along with Jake as they rounded a corner and came out into an open-topped section of the slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Morgan were both posed like statues with their tushes raised slightly off the raft, their gas ripping loudly against the waterproof surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at them... it's like they're deep in thought or something..\" Liz's eyes shifted over to Jake, teeth gritted as she stared him in the eyes and kept her fart going.. it was really quite impressive how long she could do this without needing to take a breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was giving off an equally impressive performance herself, and an equally unpleasant smell. Despite the fact the raft was moving down at a pretty fast speed, Gregg and Jake got occasional gusts of stench, making loud retching noises everytime they did, followed by boisterous laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of boisterous - Liz's fart didn't show any sign of slowing or stopping, in fact, it seemed to get louder and more aggressive as they progressed down the slide, rivaling Morgan's own sustained butt note, although still a little more squeally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I.... think... we're... nearly.. out...\" Liz grunted between short, shallow breaths. She'd have to teach Morgan how to breathe and fart at the same time, as the vixen suddenly took one huge gulp of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, damnit! I could have kept that going!!\" She demonstrated this point by ripping several more farts, each one just as rumbly and loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was still going, though, it had to be at least fifty seconds now, but her butt hadn't lessened in intensity once, and the most impressive - or most insane part was that she didn't seem at all phased. Her expression was complacent and relaxed, as if unleashing such a behemoth of a fart was as effortless and trivial as breathing to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good god, Liz!\" Jake shouted out as the raft spun round, crashing towards the exit of the slide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Liz didn't stop, she didn't seem like she needed to. She simply looked over at Jake, eyes a little strained, and smiled, lifting her leg up to her chest and causing her fart to become a little more raspy and airy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raft splashed down into the water, sending all four furs down into the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all pulled their heads above the water, and laughed, but there was still a quiet sound droning on in the background... bubbles surfacing..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked round at Liz, who leant against the side of the pool, head leaned to one side casually and still letting the one single fart escape from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz! You can stop now! You won!\" Morgan chuckled and pulled the raft out of the water to return it, but the skunk shook her head, shaking some water out of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregg, Jake and Morgan all shared a glance as Liz pulled a hand out of the water and began to count the seconds on her fingers, one.. two... five... ten... twenty....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's eyebrows raised. \"Whoa.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept going and going, it really didn't seem like she was going to stop, but after counting roughly sixty seconds, the bubbles stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! There we go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's face was plastered with pure astonishment. She'd heard Liz rip some very long farts in the short time they'd been friends, she was easily the queen of long farts, but this was something else entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just letting a bit of pressure out.\" She giggled to herself and climbed out of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How can anybody fart for that long!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply shrugged. \"<i>Ew, that really doesn't smell healthy..</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregg looked over at Jake and gave him a glance as if to say 'are you sure you still have the hots for this one??' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake just laughed, genuinely impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man!!\" Morgan was the first to really catch wind of the smell. \"I feel sick just sniffing that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Jake and Gregg had to have a little sniff themselves, both coughing and clutching their noses.<br>\r\n\"Oh, God, Liz! That's really, really bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all laughed at just how stinky it really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz released a quick fart onto the palm of her hand, raising it to her nose and cringing slightly at the sheer pungency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she had done before, she proceeded to give her own explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It smells like somebody left a glass of milk on a windowsill for a month..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's about right..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz interrupted \"I'm not finished. Then, they got a bunch of eggs and broke them into the glass, and left that for another month, and then fed that to a dog, waited for the dog to shit it out, and put that in a glass..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! I'm still not finished! Then... they mix that together with some rotten fish and a little more milk, and they leave that in the sun for about a week, they take that, and give it to you smell - that's what it smells like!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, that's it. Once again, that's <i>exactly</i> it.\" Morgan laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz puffed her chest out proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that massive one you must be running low.\" Gregg pointed out as the group went to give in the inflatable raft, watching the people behind them exit the slide and gag loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Oh, oh, no... I have a lot more where that came from.\" Liz snickered and rubbed her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... how can any fur let out that much gas and still have more? Surely that makes no sense..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, my body never makes sense.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also still have quite a bit of gas.\" Morgan added, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? But... you don't even have a weird gas condition like Liz, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"I don't, but I'm really, really lactose intolerant. That ice cream sent me into overdrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's impressive what you can do with natural gas.\" Gregg pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's a natural!\" Liz patted Morgan on the back. \"She'd ripped some that would even put me to shame... on a bad day.\" She winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Gregg nodded and laughed. \"Yeah, Jake added, \"we were there to hear.. and smell.. most of them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do now, then?\" Liz asked everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... by some miracle we haven't been kicked out of the pool yet, so we may as well still enjoy ourselves here. We haven't tried out this dolphin yet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, we could always head off and do something else. I'm cool with that.\" Gregg suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan piped up with her own suggestion. \"Or, yknow, that restaurant over there looks tempting..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls think you can handle any more food? You've already had Mexican, and Ice cream..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably gonna disable us for a while, but we could hold a little more food, I'm sure.\" Liz let off a short ripper as she backed up Morgan's suggestion.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He and the others followed her out of the pool. \"That\u2026\" he trailed off, speechless for the moment, still softly chuckling at the most enormous fart he had evee witnessed. \"That was incredible!\" he finally managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Incredibly disgusting,\" a voice behind them repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang spun around. A fox that appeared a bit older than them was scowling at them, especially Liz. With a whistle hanging from his neck and set of shades that gave of an authoritative look, it was clear he was the lifeguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's heart felt ready to pound out of her chest. She had been having so much fun amusing and impressing her new friends (as well as herself) that she had nearly forgotten how disgusting some found her talent. \"I'm\u2026 sorry,\" Liz said. Apologizing for her sense of humor and a part of her she had grown somewhat proud of felt like she was fumbling over a tricky phrase in a foreign language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan took a step forward. \"She can't help it, she has a digestive disorder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" The lifeguard said, \"Well then, what's your excuse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red fox turned even redder. She stepped back to where she originally was and shrank a bit into herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, what's the big deal?\" Greg spoke up. \"Since when was it a crime to have gas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The big deal,\" the lifeguard said in a way that seemed to mock Greg's tone, \"is that your girlfriends here are grossing out our other patrons and making them uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not our --\" Jake attempted to butt in, but the lifeguard interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what these guys see in you,\" he said, leaning forward so he was practically in Liz's face, \"but if they want to put up with a couple nasty broads like you and that disgrace-to-foxes friend of yours, that's their problem. But we don't have to. You got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. For the first time since meeting her, her friends saw a frown on the skunk's face. It seemed so out of place. It didn't last too long, however: Jake had a plan to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, since I'm feeling generous, you'll only be banned from the pool for one week. Sound fair?\" The four friends grudgingly nodded. Their punishment could have been worse. \"Good. Now go to the changing rooms and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was speaking, Jake was inconspicuously fooling around with the dolphin toy. He did a good job of making it just look like a nervous habit. When he was ready, he made sure the air stopper was pointed at the lifeguard and then\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick flick of his thumb, the gas came rushing out of the pool toy. The lifeguard began gagging almost immediately. The combined stench of Morgan and Liz's best efforts left the lifeguard doubled over, gasping for air. Jake dropped the toy, still deflating as the four took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't bother heading into the changing rooms. They were so paranoid about the lifeguard catching up to them, they just took their clothes from their lockers and slipped them over their swimwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ran until the pool was out of sight. The four were winded, gasping for air, feeling like a gang of convicts that just escaped from prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what felt like forever, the four of them just stood there taking deep breaths. Then Liz started chuckling. Before they knew it, the whole gang had burst into guffaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was some fast thinking, Jake!\" Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny,\" Liz agreed, \"right when I was thinking 'Man, this guy's a jerk! I'd like to fart in his face,' Jake kind of makes my wish come true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll never see that dolphin again,\" Jake said, \"but I'd say we got our money's worth of fun from it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely!\" Greg chimed in. \"So what do you guys feel like doing now? Up for getting us kicked out of anywhere else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd kind of like to go back to our rooms for a bit to change into something drier,\" Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you got a point,\" Greg said, dripping with a combination of pool water and sweat from their run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, the sun will dry us off in no time,\" Liz said. \"And if it doesn't\u2026 you can always use my blow dryer,\" she said. In case the joke wasn't obvious enough, she began ripping a very deep fart. The wetness of her swimsuit and the clothes she was wearing over it affected the timbre, but certainly not its length or volume. Naturally, the joke and the fart was met with applause and laughter from the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tempting offer,\" Greg sarcastically said once he was done chuckling, \"but I'd rather dry off in a more conventional way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're just getting started!\" Liz pouted. \"We don't have to split up already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be back in no time,\" Greg said, \"it's not like we'll be apart for long. It'll be like an hour tops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An hour?\" Jake groaned. \"Do you know how many farts we'll miss in that time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These girls are both freaking hilarious, I get it,\" Greg agreed, \"but unless anyone's got a better idea, I'd like to dry off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Jake looked at each other, hopeful the other would think of something fast.</span></div></div>",

After a moment of quiet contemplation, their growling stomachs being the only things to break the silence, Morgan settled on her desired prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think our best bet is going to be the bathroom\u201d Morgan said tentatively. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to show off in public just yet\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded knowingly. \u201cI understand. It\u2019ll take a while to get used to the idea of farting in public, but it\u2019ll be all kinds of fun once you do.\u201d She emphasized this point by ripping a short, meaty fart directly into the battered leather cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan tried to suppress her laughter as the strong odor hit her nose. A low growl emanated from her abdomen a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201d Ooooh\u2026. Okay let\u2019s get going. I\u2019m not sure how much longer I\u2019m gonna be able to hold this\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright alright. Just be sure to wait until we have a captive victim. We wouldn\u2019t want any of these delightful farts to go to waste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan grinned \u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say. You\u2019ve got a lot more experience with this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz gave a sly smirk in reply \u201cYeah I guess that\u2019s true, but you\u2019ll get the hang of it. After all, we\u2019ll be doing a lot more stuff like this from here on out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan chuckled as she considered the gravity of that statement. In just the last few hours the assumptions that she had made about Liz had been completely destroyed. Ultimately, she had believed that they would be nothing more than passing acquaintances. Now she was about to pull a very un-ladylike prank with the girl that may very well become her best friend. Or maybe her only friend depending on the kind of reputation they gain. Either way, this was already proving to be a much more interesting day than she could have hoped. And they were only just getting started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pulled from her thoughts by Liz holding open the door to the ladies\u2019 room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz gave an exaggerated wave as a gesture for Morgan to go inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter you.\u201d Liz said with an overly posh accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, thank you.\u201d Morgan replied with an equally ridiculous tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom itself wasn\u2019t special. Its walls were a standard beige set against white tile floors and muted fluorescent lighting. In the air hung a mixed aroma consisting of cheap air freshener and lemon-scented cleaning products. A short row of sinks lined the wall to their left. Opposite that sat the stalls. Three to be exact. A brief inspection revealed that none of which were currently occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect!\u201d Liz exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls took to their respective cubicles with Liz taking the stall nearest the door and Morgan taking the stall farthest back leaving an empty stall between them. The room fell into a short moment of silence as they got themselves situated. Morgan took this time to set down a makeshift seat cover made from toilet paper. Liz on the other hand plopped down directly onto the toilet seat, germs be damned. Morgan was the first to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long do you think we\u2019re going to wait?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno, but I bet it won\u2019t be long. There\u2019s bound to be at least one fur who'll need to use the toilet soon. And when they do, that\u2019s when we let loose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re right. This gas is starting to get painful.\u201d Morgan gave a light prod to her bloated midsection to punctuate this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax. It\u2019ll be worth it in the end. I promise you that.\u201d Liz emphatically stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the bathroom door opened signaling the presence of their unsuspecting target. A few moments later the middle stall was finally occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s phone buzzed a second later. It was a text from Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Follow my lead\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relative silence of the bathroom was instantly shattered by a series of bassy ass-rippers that exploded into the first cubicle. A sound reminiscent of a horn quartet violently echoed into the toilet only to be muffled by Liz\u2019s behind.  After recovering from the initial shock of experiencing some of Liz\u2019s true farts, Morgan started dropping a string of high-pitched farts that surprisingly matched Liz\u2019s output. However, after hearing Morgan join in, Liz doubled-down on her already impressive display of flatulence; increasing the volume of her farts while giving her gas a sickly, wet tone. Morgan, not wanting to fall behind, started pushing out her own brand of nauseating farts into the soiled atmosphere of the bathroom. Shockingly, she was able to hold her own in this Thunderdome of Thunderous Blasts. What was once just a minor, brassy warm-up had turned into a full-blown fart symphony as the two unleashed some of the most impressive gas the tiny restroom had ever witnessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both continued their performance for another 20 seconds before Liz decided that they\u2019d done enough for one victim. Morgan dropped a few more farts before realizing that Liz had stopped. The once tolerable atmosphere of the ladies\u2019 room had been completely wrecked. As Liz quietly basked in the glory of the absolutely horrendous smell that plagued the air, Morgan was trying to catch her breath while holding back the laughter that was welling up inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the sound of movement in the middle stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two waited eagerly for the response of the middle stall\u2019s occupant. After a brief moment of silence, their mystery guest\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I've been coming here my whole life! See any movies you like the look of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. The way I see it, there are three worth seeing.\" Liz took a look between the posters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan laughed. \"I'm going to assume that you're not going to be polite and hold your gas in during the movie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's lips curled up into a smile. \"You already know me too well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I had as much gas as you, I wouldn't <i>want</i> to hold it in all the time. Not when there are so many opportunities for pranks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, Morgan, how about you choose which movie we go and see?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen nodded. \"Well, there's the new Blood Lust movie. You seem like the kinda girl who enjoys a good horror movie. I'm a nervous wreck with them, but I'll happily go see one if you want to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not necessarily. They scare the <i>farts</i> out of me.\" She snickered, watching as Morgan laughed with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... there's also High Octane III. I kinda like action movies.\" Morgan looked at Liz for her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I. Might be some good opportunities. Lots of <i>loud explosions</i>.\" Liz raised her eyebrows as she said this, implying the dual meaning behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Lastly... we could check out The Marriage Claws 2... man, there sure are a lot of sequels... Looks like a romantic comedy, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could provide some <i>laughing gas</i>.\" Liz chuckled. She had a particular disliking towards RomComs in general, but a room full of sappy couples there to laugh seemed like a good playing field for flatulence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just full of puns, aren't you?\" Morgan shook her head as she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Full of puns and full of gas!\" Liz patted her butt softly and smiled humbly. At least she had two things she was good at.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, which one do you like the look of most?\" She asked Morgan, impatient to start pranking people.</span></div></div>",

You should be the one to decide what we do. I've already done fart pranks hundreds of times so I'll let you take the helm.

She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d expected to happen, after all\u2014 perhaps she had gotten too used to being around people who\u2019d gotten used to her gas? Thinking about her predicament began to flood her mind with memories of being a little girl in grade school, being scolded by the teacher in front of the whole class for her gassy outbursts, which only made her face even hotter with shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 really control it,\u201d she finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Morgan said, her once amicable tone replaced with spiteful indignation. \u201cWell, isn\u2019t that just fucking peachy?\u201d With a huff, she shouldered past Liz, stomping towards the door. \u201cI\u2019m going to see if it\u2019s too late to get a new roommate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz flinched as the vixen slammed the door behind her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz took a moment to collect herself, looking around the room, taking another whiff of the rancid air slowly clearing itself of her fetid gas. She knew now that her idea of a first impression was a little bit... Impolite and to the average fur a little bit disgusting, that Morgan had full rights in being disgusted, that Morgan had the right to be pissed off, that this was a dick move on her own part. But what she came to the conclusion of was that the vixen might have completely overreacted to the situation, was a little more brutal and unforgiving than the foul act really warranted, that she forgot the strongly scented reason one doesn't piss off or scare a skunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck her, I was being playful, I really couldn't have held that in if I wanted! I'll give her something to complain about!\" Liz said to the empty room psyching herself up for her next few actions, potentially crossing a line. From that little moment of stress and humiliation her stomach was all fired up once again, groaning and giving off little bubbling noises if once listened closely and carefully enough, new cramps growing as more gas built than she started off with. Liz knew this one was going to be bad, <i>these ones</i>, were going to be bad; horrible! Devastating! Only enhanced by the moistness collecting in her jeans, those few drops of sweat one gets in the worst places in the moments when ones face turns red, the making of a truly cruel blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz made her way over her own bed and over to Morgan's, clutching her lower abdomen, giving off a groan while she crawled up to the head of the bed. Turning around anyone looking on could guess what was about to happen, though what one might not have expected was the fact the skunk took it to a whole new level, jeans and even her undergarments being pulled down to the midway point on her thighs, thick and deadly skunk cheeks pressing bare against the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's tongue lolled out. She didn't even need to push, she didn't grunt or groan, she didn't give off any sign that she let one rip except a sick and moist bubbling muffled only from the pillow. A wet burst of air that went on for several seconds, six to be exact before she even put on any effort, taking a sharp breath and tensing up her abdomen, forcing everything out. At that point it continued on, the skunkette rubbing her rear up and down along the pillow, smearing the scent and that light coating of sweat all around the vixen's pillow, pushing out that monstrosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I hope you can fucking stand rooming with me!\" She shouted as her first, the FIRST, fart went on. Ten seconds, twelve, fifteen before even dying down. The skunk was panting, probably enjoying this much more than she really should have, finishing off the blast of air with a little squeak. Taking the pillow between her thighs she squeezed it, compressing the pillow before she gave off a grunt and let out her second monstrosity, simultaneously loosening her grip on the pillow so it would draw her gas into its fibers. Was it a little cruel, yes, very much. But in the skunk's eyes this was a very fitting punishment for the vixen's offence, and that's all that mattered, especially since this went on until Liz felt as if every ounce of gas was gone for now and even she felt uncomfortable putting her face anywhere near that pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on after having finished ruining her roommate and nemesis' pillow she was laying in her own bed, letting out a quick trumpet of air every now and again with a flick of her tail, keeping the pressure down while masking the pillow and plainly making the room less bearable for Morgan. That was until she return with a shy and flustered look on her face, somewhere between ready to kill the skunk and cry in her embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen... I might have been quick to yell but that... That was gross as hell. You really shouldn't do that, especially to new people, especially to me...!\" Despite the appearance, Morgan is....</span></div></div>",

I mean, I don't really have anything to do for a few days other than settle in.\" Morgan got comfy on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe, if there's anything on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was already feeling another bundle of gas brewing up inside her; pressure building in her abdomen that she had to try and stifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yknow, these beds are surprisingly really comfortable for a college dorm. I was expecting <i>cockroaches</i> crawling out under the pillows and stuff..\" The fox giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're ok.\" Liz grinned, trying to verbally ease Morgan away from her pillow; if she realised what had been done to it then there was no way she'd forgive her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, I kinda feel like another lie down. God knows I got barely any sleep this morning.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's eyes widened in panic as the fox gradually lowered herself onto the length of the bed, her head sinking into the pillow she'd just assaulted only a few moments ago, and the gas in her gut was only rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ew</i>..\" Morgan's face convulsed into a snarling grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What?\" Liz looked over from her own bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This pillow.

It seems we are stuck with each other for the rest of the term, so we may as well try our best to get along... wouldn't you agree?\" Liz just shot her back a smug grin that made the Vixen glare and stomp over to her bed. Wanting to get some schoolwork done, she grabbed her books and laid down on her bed. As soon she leaned back and rested her head on her pillow, an absolutely horrid, rancid stench hit her and made nostrils flare. \"EWW did you just fart again?!\" She shouted and gagged, covering her nose as she jumped off her bed and backed away from her roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had watched her lay down and could now only laugh in response. After Morgan glared at her again she composed herself enough to reply. \"No, I didn't actually! Though I did fart a few minutes ago... your pillow may have been near my ass, its not my fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan gasped and snarled as she still coughed, she had really gotten a huge whiff of it. \"So... that's how it's going to be then huh? I'll show you you aren't the only gassy one around here!\" Before Liz could react, the vixen had tackled her off of her bed and onto the floor. The two of them rolled around briefly, each trying to overpower the other, though before long Morgan managed to get on top of her and laughed as she sat on her opponent's face, covering it under her thick thighs. She looked down at her and smiled, squeezing her head tightly. \"Not so fun when you're the one about to smell some gas is it?\" She giggled and wiggled her butt, Liz unable to respond as any noise she made was muffled under her. \"Well get ready, cause here it comes!\" She leaned to the side slightly and let a slow, quiet fart that dragged on for over ten seconds. The heat was uncomfortable against Liz's face, and the stench was down right horrendous even for her! Unable to breathe through her mouth, she was forced to sniff up all of the disgusting, eggy fart as Morgan just laughed and rubbed it in. Unable to take much more of the smell, the skunk thrashed under her, managing to soon throw her off and pounce on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I was actually going to try and stop with all the gas after I farted on your pillow... but now that you just farted right on my face, I think I have to return the favor!\" Liz shouted, getting into a similar position on top of Morgan except she was turned around the other way. She slowly lowered her ass down onto the vixen's face, smirking as she decided to pull her pants down leaving her tight panties exposed. Their brief fight had caused her to work a sweat and her ass was dripping with it. Morgan could only gasp as the huge, sweaty and smelly skunk ass came down on her and smothered her whole face, she even noticed the skunk's tail wrapping around the back of her head nestling her in further between those deadly cheeks. Liz just got comfy on top of her and prepared to let out another storm that was brewing inside of her. \"If you thought what you smelled before was bad... just get ready.\" She warned ominously.</span></div></div>",

Already she was starting to get desperate for oxygen and buckled underneath her, she was a lot heavier than she looked! Liz just kept herself seated, her weight easily pinning her down, and groaned as her stomach started to gurgle loudly. Morgan immediately knew what that meant, and her eyes went wide as she tried even harder to get free. It was all for naught as Liz soon let out the first of her gas, a massive, loud fart that solved the vixen's oxygen problem, but now she was choking on the disgusting, horrible stench that had no where else to go but in her. Her mouth and nose were practically burning from the vile smell, as she couldn't even turn her head as the tail kept it in place. The only thing she was glad for was the relatively thin panties that were blocking her from the no doubt terrifying asscrack of the skunk. The smell was already so bad, she couldn't imagine it getting much worse. Just as Morgan thought that, Liz let out a warm, silent but deadly fart that proved her very wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh what a relief, I was holding all that in for awhile! It feels so good to let it all out.\" Liz moaned, wiggled her ass slightly as she forced out a few smaller, but equally foul farts. By now some of the smell had wafted up to her and made even her recoil, it was particularly bad today. She almost felt bad for Morgan, but quickly remembered her farting on her. \"Whew, that sure smells bad huh? I guess I ate too many eggs? Or maybe it was the veggies... what do you think?\" She laughed and mocked, blasting her with a long, wet fart that just didn't seem to end. It was by far the worse thing the vixen had ever smelled and she was worried the panties weren't going to stay clean for long... Morgan felt like she was in hell as her nose and mouth was continually assaulted with fart after fart, but just when she thought she couldn't take anymore...</span></div></div>",

Her cheeks jiggled with each movement, splashing sweat onto the vixen's face. The smell practically doubled, as all the fart gas that had been trapped in her panties was released. Gagging and choking on the stench, Morgan was soon silenced as the skunk sat back down, sealing her in her disgusting prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh this is wonderful.

She just couldn't take the disgusting smell anymore and wanted far, far away from this skunk and her horrible ass. She yelled and pleaded, hoping she would listen before her rancid gas killed her.

She bolted into the bathroom across from the torture scene, and immediately slammed the door and locked it shut. The air wasn't much better in here, but there were 3 cabinets below the sink. Morgan opened cabinet 1, and found some air freshener. \"Thank fuck.\" Morgan said, with a low raspy voice. She sprayed it around, and it smelled of peaches. She opened cabinet 2 and found shampoos alongside rolls and rolls of toilet paper. She shook her head. She opened cabinet 3 and found a large gray bucket with a small metal handle. Morgan chuckled, because this was part of her plan. \"I knew there would be a bucket in here. Every dorm has one here.\" She said, and grabbed it. Then she filled it with the coldest water that the faucet could provide. She then opened cabinet 2 again, and found that there was a bag of ice, half melted. \"How did I miss that?\" She asked herself, and grabbed it.

It's not like it's that far to go.\" Liz jumped up from the sofa and began to root through her bag to see if she had anything she wanted to take with her. She slipped her old, crappy cell phone into her pocket, along with a little loose change. Morgan quickly put on some makeup, puffed her hair up in the mirror until she was satisfied with it, and then the two furs left the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lovely morning, and Liz and Morgan looked around at the colourful selection of different students filling the courtyard in little social group clusters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This college isn't half bad.\" Liz concluded. \"It's not exactly the richest in town, but it's not exactly the poorest either.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded. \"Well, originally my parents wanted me to get into that furry heights place, but I didn't get the grades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh. Who needs good grades, really, it's about having fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right, yeah.\" Morgan smiled, as if Liz's enthusiasm had assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz started looking around; started scanning the area to see if she could let any gas out yet. Her stomach was churning away slowly and painfully, leaving a lingering ache in her lower abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis place was no good. There were too many people, and besides, Morgan would be able to work out where the smell was coming from almost immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two furs left the university grounds and entered the main city, the sense of business and activity became gradually more surrounding. The park was just a little walk down the road, but it seemed to be the noisiest road in existence: there was a construction site to their left, a loud, persistent drilling could be heard from it. There was a huge garbage depository further up and on the right, with the loud, industrial beeping of the garbage truck coming down the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, well you certainly get a nice location here, don't you?\" Morgan smiled sarcastically to Liz, who smiled just as sarcastically back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed like it could be a good chance; there was so much noise that Morgan was unlikely to even hear her fart, and as they passed the garbage depository there would already be a putrid stench in the air, so Liz adding a little of hers to the mix couldn't do much harm, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel a particularly beefy one rumbling away and trying to get out, pooling in a hot bubble of gas by her sphincter before she pushed it back up again to delay it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould she fart? Or not..?</span></div></div>",

Normally, she would have let this fart go quite a while ago, but she had decided against it and it was taking its toll on her innards. She figured the nearby garbage truck would provide a nice place to let one rip unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   While walking alongside Morgan, Liz let out a decent sized fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"brbrbrbrbrbroooooooompt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It was particularly deep and bubbly in the beginning. Drowned out by the clanging of dumpsters and the beeping of the garbage truck, it was only audible to Liz. It rolled out of her in a nearly sensual way. The thick and meaty smell floated out of the back of her pants and into the open air. Morgan quickly took note of the fumes, but, all according to Liz's plan, assumed it was simply the garbage truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Whew! That's some pretty ripe garbage.\" Morgan said, fanning her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Liz nervously chuckled. \"Hehe. Yeah. Yeah, it sure is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Liz and Morgan continued walking, looking for something to do.

The server turned and headed back to the kitchen, and Morgan leaned across the dirty table. \"So what's your story?\" She asked \"y'know, before you came here\". \"Oh you know\" Liz smiled coyly \"the usual. Unpopular, but I got by\". Morgan raised an eyebrow \"you? Unpopular? But you're so nice\". Liz winced, knowing she couldn't keep the gas in any longer. She bit her lip, shifting her butt in the seat, and raised her fluffy tail. With a grunt, she dropped a positively atomic stink bomb, the smell filling the small diner. The couple at the booth next to them immediately left without paying. \"That answer your question?\" Liz asked, embarrassed. However, Morgan's response took her by surprise, doubled back with laughter \"oh my god that's incredible\" She laughed \"absolutely disgusting!\". \"You're not like, totally grossed out?\" \"Of course I am. That's why I love it\". Before she could respond,  the server returned with their food. \"Who, might wanna check yer panties there\" he joked crudely.

She always tried to avoid using portable toilets when she could, but there weren't many other options now. The moment she locked the door her butt just let loose its tight hold, a very loud, very raspy toot rumbling thickly into the seat of her tight jeans, getting denser and bubblier as if assaulted her trousers for a good ten to fifteen seconds. She grimaced and sighed in a mixture of pain and relief, leaning against the door of the toilet and stretching herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God... I needed that..\" Liz sighed breathlessly, sitting down onto the seat, but not removing her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat with her arms resting on her legs, letting out little blasts of gas into the hole, hearing it echo around the box below the toilet seat itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk began to feel an immense sense of relief as the farts emptied the pressure in her gut; with each muffled blart into the depths of the toilet below, she felt more and more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz remembered hearing her cousin tell her once that they knew someone who'd used a portable toilet and realised a snake was living down in the waste collection area below the seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there <i>was</i> any kind of animal hiding down there, judging by how bad her farts smelt today, Liz doubted it'd still be alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes spent letting out sporadic farts, Liz decided she felt just about comfortable enough to go and rejoin Morgan again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk took a nice, deep sniff of her ripe product; her farts were especially eggy today, but then again she'd be hard pressed to find a day when they weren't eggy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had effectively stunk up the entire enclosed space of the toilet, which made her smirk a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up to leave, letting loose a final bubbler of a fart before unlocking the door and stepping outside again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled as the two rejoined. \"You survived then.\" She said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just about.\" Liz answered just as sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls continued walking, heading towards the pond they began making small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you liking Anthro city so far then, Liz?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. Very noisy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded in agreement. \"Cities usually are, but I've kinda lived here my whole life, so I'm used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pond wasn't as exciting as Morgan had made it out to be, it was more of a puddle than a pond, but Liz and Morgan sat beside it nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz wasn't sure about things still. It had been a real struggle to hold her gas in earlier, and the idea of having to do that every day hardly seemed appealing to her. Sooner or later Morgan would need to find out about Liz's little condition, and Liz was starting to realise that it would be better if it were sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hardly a shy skunk; far from it, and Morgan seemed cool. Surely she'd understand it... Wouldn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz cleared her throat, causing Morgan to look over. She could tell by the look in the fox's eyes that she knew Liz was about to get real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time Morgan found out about Liz's gas...</span></div></div>",
