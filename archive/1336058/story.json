Just wait for me, ok?\" said the voice of Kudo Shinchi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand Shinchi, but please...hurry back soon.\" replied Mouri Ran, who's joy was quickly diminishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, but I have to go now. Ja!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ja ne...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the phone back in the cradle, Ran sulked back to her room, where she thought more about the boy she loved. She could remember clearly when she first starting falling in love with her best friend back in junior high. Even then, she could remember staring in awe whenever he solved some petty theft or found some missing items (or persons).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only I could say those three words, maybe then he could just forget about this case of his and come home. If I could just tell him about how much I love his stupid detective mania, his amazing voice and his piercing, deep blue eyes. I love him so much, but I feel so lonely right now. Maybe I should take up Haru-kun's offer this weekend...I might even get to touch that amazing belly of his...\" she said with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she knew that her heart was with Shinchi, her body was much more attracted to the heavier type of man. She always got so excited when she saw someone with a belly, whether it'd be a man or child. In fact, she hoped to some nice, round children herself when she grew older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they get Shinchi's metabolism however, they're probably going to be as stick thin as he is.\" she said with a sigh. \"I could try to fatten him up, but I wouldn't know where to start...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she heard yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ran-nee-chan, I'm home! When's dinner?\" she heard Conan's high, soprano voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming Conan!\" she said, as she walked out to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dinner started, she went to chop some vegetables as Conan rambled on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to stop making such good food Ran-nee-chan, I'm starting to get fat. Soon, I'll be as big as Genta!\" he joked, puffing out his stomach with air as so to emphasize his point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she knew that her cooking wasn't that fattening, Ran couldn't help but envision a plus-sized Conan, and couldn't stop herself from plotting out his weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'As much as I want to, It wouldn't be right to Conan.' She thought, dishearteningly. However, as the image of a bigger Conan came to mind again, this time clad in only a pair of boxers, she could almost feel her hands touch that imaginary belly, and the non-existent face which was twice the size of the actual Conan's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave in almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's not as if he'd be in any danger,' she thought as heated some rice. 'He'd be perfectly alright...and could possibly make for some great eye candy when he's older.' She blushed furiously with that last shameless thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Plus, if I can fatten up Conan, then I can certainly do the same for Shinchi! I mean those two are so alike, it's actually a little frightening... '<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, it's decided then,' she thought as she started setting the table with food, 'I'll start fattening Conan first thing tomorrow. I can hardly wait!'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Ran found herself digging through the storage closet. She was knee-deep in boxes littered with junk and other worthless trash. Most of it were things that her mother had left behind when she had moved away. Ran couldn't help but feel a little sad at seeing the various mementos of when her parents were still living together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ha!\" Ran thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had found the box she was looking for. It was a small container labeled \"pregnancy holdovers\". Naturally they weren't things her forty year old mother would really need to take. Ripping it open, Ran poked inside and quickly found her target. It was a small bottle of weight gain supplements. Apparently, during her pregnancy with Ran, Eri had trouble putting on the necessary birth-weight. <br>\r\nTwo pills were all it took to remedy the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wicked smile Ran left the closet and reentered the kitchen with pills in-hand. She dropped two of them into the meal that she left stewing on the stove. The little white capsules dissolved instantly, leaving behind only a cloud of mist. She leaned forward and breathed in the wonderful aroma as the door opened behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ran-nee-chan, is dinner ready yet? I'm starving!\" Conan whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, Conan,\" Ran said as she shoveled some of the slop into a bowl, \"all you talk about is food these days. You're gonna be as big as Genta if you don't slow down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConan slapped her flat stomach playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, with all the soccer I play there's no way that'll happen,\" he replied as she passed him the bowl. He wasted no time in digging in. Ran took a seat beside him, watching him scarf it all down. Seeing him piggishly devour the fattening solution filled her with an odd pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, would you mind eating it all? Dad's going to play some Pachinko and I've already ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehehe,\" he laughed, \"sure, I'll guess I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed his emptied bowl. For the next half an hour the continued the process. Ran would fill his bowl and Conan would suck it down like a vacuum cleaner. The four gallon pot, nearly filled to the brim, had been emptied entirely. Somehow the ace detective had managed to stuff it all in his tiny stomach. He belly bulged outward like an over-stuffed balloon. Conan fell back into his chair, moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing Conan,\" Ran said, admiring his gut. She pressed a finger into it and found it to be as hard as a sheet of cement. The bespectacled youth didn't respond; he had passed out. Ran picked up his limp body and placed him in bed, clothes and all. She gently rubbed his stomach, enjoying every second of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This may not be fat yet, but it will be\" she thought, gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRan herself then went to bed, dreaming dreams of an ever-fattening Shinichi. She didn't realize it at the time, but she had made a grievous error. Putting the pills in the piping hot stew had effectively vaporized them. While most of the solution went to its intended destination, Ran had inadvertently been exposed to the gaseous form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth her and Conan would be subject to the powerful drugs, but as it turned out...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He went into the dining room and sat in his seat.<br>\r\n\"What's for breakfast, Ran-nee-chan?\" Conan asked<br>\r\n\"Here, Conan!\" Ran said as she placed a bunch of fattening foods and snacks in front of him. There was eggs, bacon, sausage, pizza, fries, chocolate chip cookies, cake, chips, and much much more!<br>\r\n\"Wow, you made a lot of food today, Ran-nee-chan! I don't think I can finish it all!\" Conan said<br>\r\n\"Oh nonsense,\" Ran said \"You'll finish it all just fine I bet!\" as she left the room to make more food, a clever smile forms on her face. Conan shrugged and digged in, after a while, Conan finished the pizza, eggs, sausage, fries and chips, but there still was much more on the table.<br>\r\n\"I hope you're not full yet!\" Ran said gleefully as she walked in. \"Because I made seconds!\" <br>\r\nConan moaned and rubbed his small but stuffed tummy. \"Oh, I'm really full, Ran-nee-chan! I don't think I can eat anymore!\" Ran came over and placed her hand on Conan's belly, and rubbed it with skillful fingers.<br>\r\n\"I hope this'll make you feel better\" Ran said with a smile<br>\r\nConan blushed and smiles, Ran's hands moved heavenly. \"Wow, that feels really good, but no matter how much you rub my stomach I don't think that I-mmmph.\" Conan said with a full mouth as Ran stuffed a spoonful of cake in his mouth.<br>\r\n\"Well if you can't finish the food, I'm going to have to spoonfeed you! If you don't eat all your food now, you can never grow up to be big and strong!\" Ran said as she stuffed another bite of cake into Conan's mouth. Conan tried to struggle out of Ran's hands, but with the fact that he was stuffed silly, seven years old, and Ran's champion of the Karate team, He didn't stand a chance to get out. So Conan had to spend a morning being forcefed by Ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter every morsel of food is gone from the table, Ran finally let Conan go, but he really couldn't go anywhere with all that food inside him.<br>\r\n\"uhhhhhhhh\" Conan moaned as his stuffed belly churned and gurgled. <br>\r\n\"Are you still feeling stuffed? well how about I give you a nice bubble bath? That'll take your mind off it!\" Ran said after she finished washing the dishes. She picked up a still sluggish Conan and marched him down to the bathroom.<br>\r\n\"Now take your clothes off and wait in the tub, I'll come a little later to start the water\" Ran said as she walked off.<br>\r\nConan obeyed and started takeing off his clothes. As he stripped down to his underwear, he looked at the mirror and was shocked! His belly seemed to grown to the size of a beach ball, and he was developing noticeable boy boobs. 'How could this have happened with just one food stuffing session?' he thought. He looked at his poofy arms and legs and then turned around, his back fat was straining his underwear and his butt was really round. He grabbed his butt and let go, sending it jiggling quite a bit. He shook his belly and a whole wave of fat jiggled. Before he could do further, Ran came in and started the bath water.<br>\r\n\"Ok Conan, in the water you go!\" Ran said as she picked him up and put him in the water. <br>\r\n'Wow, he has gotten a lot fatter, my plan is going better than I thought!\" She thought cleverly. <br>\r\n'Little does he know that I rigged the bubble formula with a weight gain powder, if he drinks the bath water he'll deffinately gain 10 pounds more\" she thought as she unscrewed a bottle of bubble formule and poured it into the water. <br>\r\n\"Ok, let's get you nice and clean!\" Ran said as she grabbed a brush and started bathing Conan. She put one hand on his stomach to hold herself from falling into the water. She felt his stomach all round and soft. Her dream was coming a reality. She gave him a pinch to feel how fat he really was<br>\r\n\"OW!\" Conan yelped as he jerked back wards. Ran lost her grip and fell into the water, getting water in her mouth and in Conan's mouth too. <br>\r\n\"Uh-oh\" she squeaked as she covered her mouth quickly</span></div></div>",

It has a sour taste.\" asked Conan while Ran was starting to scrub Conan again and responded \"It's a not soap Conan, it's a new fragrance that I bought yesterday in a shop nearby. It helps relax the body and it's not a problem if you drink it. \" \"Are you sure?\" asked a not entirely convinced Conan \"Of course I'm sure of this  Conan, now to wash your hair\" responded Ran by putting a hand on Conan's head and pushing him under the water \"\"BbBBbrrr\" said Conan with his head underwater while Ran was smiling by the success of her plan. When the bath was over, Ran took her chubby little friend out the water \"Wow I thought he has gained even more than ten pounds, I think it's around 15 pounds more than before of taking the bath, I can't wait for him to become even bigger\" Ran thoughtt by herself but then she said to Conan \"There you see, isn'it a lot better after a nice bath?\"\"It was until you pushed my head underwater, causing me to drink that soury water, Ran\" responded Conan a little bit angry. Ran counterattacked \" Sorry Conan but the shower doesn't work so I had to push your head underwater to wash your hairs\"\" Oh well, no problem, but next time try not to push so hard\" Conan asked \"Sure thing Conan, not let's get you all dry and clean\" responded Ran while taking a towel and then she started drying Conan, spending most of that time massaging his big belly and moaning \"Oh wow, I did a marvelous work, Conan is going to be a nice plump kid sooner than I expected\" thought Ran, When she finished drying Conan, Ran took him upstairs to her room and when they arrived she said \"You know Conan, I bought some new clothes just for you and I'd like if you tried one today\" Ran said while giving Conan a puppi face; Conan didn't have much of a choice and responded \"Sure Ran-nee-chan, let me see them.\"<br>\r\nWhat clothes did Ran bought</span></div></div>",

Ran then look at him with a suprised look, that quickly changed into a grin \"Oh you are not a kid anymore? I know, I know Conan\" responded Ran \" you are a BIG young man now ( especially after all the food I made you eat ) but you know, you should relax a little bit more, and start acting like a kid of your age, so will you try the clothes for you pretty please?\" asked Ran again with a puppi face. Conan felt many different emotions, relief because Ran didn't find out the truth, but also see that look on her face was not easy, so after a few seconds of Ran's puppi face, Conan surrendered \"Ok Ran-nee-chan, I'll wear it\". After hearing that, Ran gave Conan a very big hug \"That's my Conan-kun ( wow and he also is a lot more soft, like a cute fat teddybear, I'm going to enjoy making my little baby here grow BIG and strong) now let's change you\" and so Ran started changing Conan. After taking of his clothes, Ran could give a better look at Conan's body ( he now was like a smaller version of Genta )and so she thought \"Oh yes, my plan is working perfectly, I will make Conan my first dreamboy\" and so she started putting the new clothes on Conan. A few minutes later Conan was wearing a pair of yellow shorts, with a blue shirt which had Kamen Yaiba characters printed on it. \"Now that's a good looking young man, now why don't you go play at the Beika Park, while I'll go to the supermarket to buy the ingredients for lunch\" said Ran to Conan, who responded \"Ok Ran-nee-chan, but don't buy too much staff, I think I gained a few pounds\" \"More than a few Conan-kun, trust me\"thought Ran, but then she responded, with the fingers crossed behind her back \"Sure Conan, don't worry\". After that they both went out and Conan went to the park. On his way, Conan heard a voice calling him \"Conan, hi\" said Ayumi with Genta, Mitsuiko and Ai right behind her. \"Are you going to the park?\" continued Ayumi \"Yes I am\" \"Wow you sure put on a few pounds lately, and those clothes are definetely not your style\" exclaimed Ai with Genta and Mitsuiko ageeing \"I know, Ran decided to cook even more lately and she bought these new clothes\" Conan  explained while they were walking all together to the park</span></div></div>",

In fact, Conan had reduced his metabolism by half with that 16 oz. bottle he just drank and would probably be reduced more later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, as he took a nap to help digest his enormous meal, he could swear that he was feeling a bit funny. <br>\r\n______________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choices below are when Conan starts realizing he's about to or is bigger.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he looked at the meal he felt something within him want to suddenly eat. He didn't know what it was but what he did know was that he wanted to eat and eat until he was absolutely stuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like the food on the table was teasing him, wavering the delicious smells coming from it around his nose, pragtically asking him to eat them. Conan knew that this wasn't quite normal of him, so as much as he wanted to just sit and eat he decided not to, for he had already eaten a lot the day before and didn't want to get a stomach ache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without Conan's awareness, out of the kitchen came Mrs. Kojima, a smile on her plump round face. \"Oh Conan-kun good morning\" she said happily. \"Good morning Mrs. Kojima\" Conan said. Mrs. Kojima however, had quite a lovely smile on her face, a smile a mother would give to her child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Conan-kun you must be hungry\" she said smiling, her plump arms together with her fingers clasping together. \"Um well actually I didn't want to- he wanted to finish but Mrs. Kojima insisted with her motherly ways. \"Don't be shy, your welcome to eat anything you want here at our house\" Conan knew that he couldn't resist such a hospitable gesture, so naturally he agreed to eat. \"Ok Mrs. Kojima\" he said. She smiled back at him, looking happy toward the cute little now 7 year old who would probably remain that way if he did not find a cure for his age regression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Conan was walking toward the table he noticed Mrs Kojima stayed close behind him to give him a good seat. He sat on the chair with only half his head showing above the table to see but only slightly above his plate seeing as he was so short. Seeing that he and Mrs Kojiwa were the only ones here he knew that Genta and the rest of the family were still upstairs in bed or preparing. As he prepared to put a piece of bread on his plate with his little hands, Mrs. Kojiwa grabbed his plate and filled it high with yummies. He saw that she had placed mostly sweets like cake, cookies, and chocolate, not the most nutritous breakfast in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mrs Kojiwa, maybe I'll get something a little bit um... healthier\" he said, trying not to make her feel sad. \"Oh nonsense Conan, the way I see it, you need sweets to grow a bit\" Conan couldn't believe it. (Why would she deliberately make me eat sweets) he wondered to himself. He didn't want to upset her, but he also didn't want to have so much sugar injested into him. \"Now eat, I want to see that plate empty\" she said, placing the plate in front of him. Her face showed a stern look. It would seem that she was seriously intent on having him eat sweets for breakfast. Conan took a bite out of a slice of cake, savouring its sweetness, lettining the cream swish on his mouth and humming to the taste. It was hypnotizing, as though the food was telling him to chew and swallow with every bite. The whole time though, Mrs Kojiwa looked with a satisfying smile. Although he didn't notice it before Mrs. Kojiwa had changed a bit from her kind motherly demeanor to a strict one, and it was clear that she wanted Conan to grow the way she and her family did.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It has been four years since Conan, pardon Genda was adopted into the Kojima family &amp; boy did he love it. As the time passed, both the youngest sons &amp; the whole family itself grew, upsizing everything, from clothes, to furniture, to well, even the whole house till it looked almost novelty-sized. Mrs. Kojima looked like a busty supermodel in modest clothing, Mr. Kojima was a fine restaurant manager &amp; was well over 600 lb. &amp; still growing. Souta was a hugely fat, yet comically rounded beachball-sized blubbery butterball of a boy who was about to graduate into secondary school. Hiroshi was the only member that wasn\u2019t hugely fat, though he wasn\u2019t hugely muscular or completely skinny either; he was a growing linebacker for the football team he was on in America &amp; well on his way to a sports scholarship at UCLA. The biggest growers however were \u201clittle\u201d Genda &amp; Genta. They were so huge that they were about their father\u2019s size &amp; still had the potential to grow till their mid twenties, but they lacked Hiroshi\u2019s strength or Souta\u2019s proportion, so they were mostly blobbish in their asses &amp; guts which took up most the ginormous bed they share.<br>\r\nGenda was 594 lb. of fat with about a 5/6 ratio of fat to muscle completely immobile in the lower body, though somewhat more free in his arms &amp; upper torso. Genda\u2019s belly was like a glob of dough with extra yeast inside of it that kept it rising for hours, or should I say falling as it smothered his useless legs &amp; went five feet over his pipe-sized toes. His ass were two hugely padded &amp; dimpled orbs ready to grind &amp; crush anything that got stuck inside. His hips &amp; waist were so wide, that they needed two measuring tapes to fully measure his waist &amp; his bellybutton was deep enough for a bo staff to fit comfortably inside. His moobs were the size of monster truck tires &amp; the nipples as wide as a cannon mouth, though they were oozing to the sides &amp; smothering his even more engulfed arms as thick as tree trunks &amp; sucking them into his tiny but massive body. The strangest thing was Genda\u2019s head, it was a dimpled pimple of oozing lard that was constantly puckered &amp; sleepy from constant feeding with lips as thick as wax &amp; his cheeks were the size of bowling balls. All in all Genta was about the same proportions as his brother but he could still get up &amp; around easier than Genda as he cared for his immobile \u201clittler\u201d twin brother.<br>\r\nAll these years were filled with so much feasting, that it came to realization that the Kojima family would need to move soon to get a bigger house for their \u201cgrowing family\u201d. They then discovered a nice little countryside home away from civilization, &amp; only accessible by car. IT was a widely distributed mansion with many layers &amp; facilties, but it allowed Genda &amp; Genta all the privacy they needed to grow &amp; gorge. &amp; speaking of gorging, here comes our two butterballs now. \u201cGen-(huff)-ta\u201d Genda puffed as loud as he could.<br>\r\n\u201cYes Genda\u201d Genta said without many gasps &amp; as he slowly shifted out of bed like a shuffling mass of dough.<br>\r\n\u201cCan (huff) you bring (puff) me some food  (gasp) from the tubes (pant)? I\u2019m famished!!!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing my twin\u201d Genta responded with a gentle yet slowly dimpled smile. Then he rang the bell system to get some food for his brother\u2026 Into their massive room came\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Souta brought in a few other things to help his \u201cBigger Blubbers\u201d relax during their meal; it was lotions for moisturizing, oils to prevent stretch marks, fancy vibrating pads for massages, &amp; XXXXL headphones for them to listen to music while they eat. This was the life for the Kojima Twins Genta &amp; Genda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay time to feed big brothers Hiroshi!!!\u201d Souta responded giddily almost dropping his equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy there Souta, don\u2019t rush. We should take our time &amp; enjoy this. Now who\u2019s hungry?!?!?!\u201d Hiroshi asked coyly. Two gurgling/rumbling sounds accompanied by jiggling flesh responded to Hiroshi\u2019s question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes. Now come on Souta, set them up while I prepare the pumps &amp; tubes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Hiroshi.\u201d Souta responded with a waddle in his footsteps. Hiroshi put the tubes in to feed a new type of food to Genta &amp; Genda, it was called, Insta-Fat Food. It was a highly concentrated cocktail of lipids &amp; shakes laced with pheromones &amp; other medicinal chemicals that allowed them to gain weight faster, &amp; with limited bloating. By mixing it in with other lipids &amp; foods, this causes a fattening explosion to happen in the body while retaining a semi-soft, but also firm shape with minimal bloating. The minimum amount of recovery time after drinking it is two horus. But since already at Genta &amp; Genda\u2019s size, age, &amp; girth they would become unstoppable eating machines for at least five hours, &amp; require around three to four hours recover time, minimum. That\u2019s right, the minimum amount of recovery is three to four hours, after at least five hours of pure expansion &amp; ecstasy. So whose P.O.V. do we follow; either Genda\u2019s (formerly known as Conan, also known as Shinichi) perspective of their prominent pudge, or Hiroshi &amp; Souta\u2019s P.O.V. as they care for &amp; watch their brothers grow in girth?</span></div></div>",

Thanks to a few well choosen investments        (expecially thanks to Genta's brain) the Kojima family became pretty wealthy. Now they were living in a very big house with 16 rooms, and also Mr Kojima's activity of selling of liquors grow. From just one shops, they got 10 in all the city of Tokyo. Even if they have become richier many things didn't change, well maybe they change in size. Mr kojima was now a little bit fatter then five years ago ( since he had to carry box of liquors everyday he did gave me the time to do some workout), Ms Kojima, instead was still the plump woman of 5 years ago, a great cook that loved to make meals for her children. Speaking of which, they have gone through some changes as well: Hiroshi, the oldest one, was now a 17 years old guy with great muscles, that was about to go to an American college, since he won a scholarship for football. Souta the youngest instead was now a 10 years old fat child that was about to change school. That leaves us with the 11/12 years old Genta, Genda and Ginko. Genta was without a doubt the smartest child in the family, he had a very big fat belly, because of his love for food, but since he was planning one day to become a commissioner of police, he knew he had to do some workout, so besides eating, playing and studying, he also sports with his brothers. Genda was instead another story, his dream was to become a sumo wrestler so all he does is eating and practicing to become a world champion, and that's why he was the biggest among all the Kojima children.  Finally there was Ginko, the only female between the Kojima children, and she was as big as her brothers , not exactly the brightest one but since her dream was to work in a circus as a clown, she always said \"Clowns have to be fun not smart\" and that was why she always had a big smile on her face, acted goofy and had very funny clothes. Despite all their differences, Genta, Genda and Ginko all attended the same school, with their old friends Ayumi and Mitsuiko. One morning when all five of them went to school they met</span></div></div>",

Conan wanted to be part of the family and when all was clear we decided he would get a new name. He chose his name himself. The change of his appearance was just the tip of the cake.

Ginko remained upstairs. <br>\r\n\"Okay, I will take it from here, Genda, you go upstairs and help Ginko a little to adjust\" Genta requested Genda after having laid the other two down.

Your new name will be Gindo Kojima, you love your whole family and will be very loyal to your brothers Genta, Genda and Genma (Mitsuhikos new name) and to your twin sister Ginko. You are cleverer than your sister and the two younger of the triplet brothers, but not much. You also love to eat everything. Your dream is to be a member of the police because you have a high sense of justice. You will remember being Ayumi Yoshida, but only as a distant memory.\" It took five minutes to complete the changes in Ayumis mind.<br>\r\nHaving everything set for the new mindset, Genta decided to use the helmets to transfer the intelligence form Mitsuhiko (Genma) to Ayumi (Gindo) while setting it so that Mitsuhiko is as intelligent as Genda. That set Ayumi really a bit above her would be siblings like Genta had planned. After having waited for three minutes for the transfer to complete Genta put Ayumi in the sarcophagus before starting that process with the picture he had used to change Ai into Ginko.<br>\r\nWhile Ayumi changed into Gindo, Genta starts to change Mitsuhikos mindset. \"Your new name will be Genma Kojima, like your sisters you love your whole family and are very loyal to your triplet brothers Genta and Genda as well as the twins. You will be the youngest of the three of us and as intelligent as Genda. You are a heavy eater like everyone in the family. Your dream is to become a well known cook, so you help your mom in the kitchen as much as possible. You will remember being Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya as a distant memory more like a dream.\" With Mitsuhiko it took nearly ten minutes to adjust his mind. After it was finished, Genta put the helmets back to their place before putting Mitsuhiko in one of the chairs. Then he goes to check on Genda and Ginko upstairs.<br>\r\nAfter an hour he goes back down to see how far the process is. Seeing it is nearly at 55% he looks at Mitsuhiko who is still out cold. He waited the remaining hour for Gindo to be finished, trying to invent something to clean the memories of others from Ai, Ayumi and Mitsuhiko by replacing them with their new identities.<br>\r\nWhen finally Gindo (Ayumi) was finished changing, he switched her with Mitsuhiko in the machine, giving him a small drug to keep him asleep for two more hours before starting his changes. He then brought Gindo upstairs to her new siblings.<br>\r\nHe got back down after half an hour, Gindo still asleep, to invent further, the base already covered. By the time Genma (Mitsuhiko) is finished Genta had nearly completed his new invention. Deciding to finish it later he took Genma upstairs as well. Gindo was still asleep, Ginko had laid down next to her and Genda had dozed off on an armchair next to them.</span></div></div>",

Now it was really late and she had a guilty conscience for her children. That's when she saw not three, but five children in the room. She looked shocked at the third boy who looked like Genta and Genda before switching to the two girls, not knowing who was who. One was what had been Haibara, but the other?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenta having a short break of playing took notice of the shocked look and quickly asked his mother to talk alone. Pulling her into the kitchen while the other four played he started to explain.<br>\r\n\"Sorry I didn't talk to you first, but we got a problem while you were away. You see shortly after Ginko woke up Ayumi and Mitsuhiko came to visit. They had known that Haibara should be here, but found us three here instead. <br>\r\nAfter telling them about our new family members Genda and Ginko, Mitsuhiko put it together and I explained something to him. He seemed to accept their decision at first, but Ginko had problems with answering Ayumi's questions, with made him suspicious. I had to knock him out and when Ayumi started to panic, Genda knocked her out as well.<br>\r\nWe decided that they both should join our family too, so I changed Ayumi into Gindo, Ginko's older twin sister and Mitsuhiko into Genma, my and Genda's youngest triplet brother. <br>\r\nThey both remember their old self as distant memories. We told them that I tripped and hit Genma on his head knocking him out and that Gindo just fainted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Kojima took a bit to fully understand Genta's explanation, but after she did she looked proud and happy at her son. \"Now I have a house full of children that see me as their mom, how wonderful. I must really thank you, Genta.\"<br>\r\nThen she went back to the others to properly greet them. They hadn't noticed she had came home so they were all happy to see her. After checking Genma and Gindo over for injuries like a good mother, she headed for the kitchen. \"I will prepare a feast for my lovely children.\" She was surprised when Genma followed her to help. \"You know mom, I want to be a cook, so I should start learning things in the kitchen by helping you.\"<br>\r\nMs Kojima looked at Genta who nodded to her before he played with the others.</span></div></div>",

With the mc-device ready he could just let the world forget that Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya, Ayumi Yoshida and Ai Haibara ever existed, changing it so that in their place were Genma, Gindo and Ginko Kojima. The only exception were their original families, their memories would forget their children, but not replace them, because then it would be like his new siblings were still their children. Beside that he would change the solved crimes by Conan alone to be solved by the DBs. That would make them even more known by the public.<br>\r\nPowering the mc-device up he gave all the necessary information in that would affect all people outside the house. Soon it would be done, but for now Genta had to wait, because he didn't want to change the memories of his father and original brothers.

To others it seemed as Conan had been friends with the family and had adventures with them before finally deciding he would join the family. He had decided that for now that was okay, seeing as Genda was the only one of his new siblings that knew who he was before. Maybe he would change that, but only later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Genta quickly checked his mc-device, seeing it had in fact finished the process successfully. He would have to ask someone outside the family about them for a last confirmation, but that could wait for the next day.

He had the slight feeling that their was something that Genda was hiding from him about his past, so he decided to ask him.<br>\r\n\u201cGenda, have you any secrets from your time before joining the family I should know about?\u201d Thanks to his former adjustments to Conan's mind before and during his changes into Genda, he knows that Genda trusts him fully, meaning that if there is something to tell he would get an answer.<br>\r\n\u201cThere is really something that I have concealed from you all. I have been the high school detective Shinichi Kudo before I was poisoned. That poison should kill me, but it just shrunk me down into a small kid. I took cover as Conan Edogawa at first to find a solution for going back to being Shinichi, but now I want to stay who I am which is your brother Genta.\u201d<br>\r\nGenta looked slightly surprised at that information. That would also explain why Conan had been so smart before. \u201cBut what about your old life then? And who knows about your true identity?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy old life wasn't anywhere near as good as it is now. My love to Ran changed to one of an older sibling over time and I don't want to go back and pretend I like her any other way. For who had known there isn't much. First is the professor, second are my real parents, third was Heiji Hattori and last was Ai, her being a member of the ones who poisoned me but quit later and took her own poison to kill herself, but instead she did shrink too. Others I wouldn't know about.\u201d<br>\r\nThat also explained Haibara's intelligence then. \u201cAnd you haven't told us because you thought we could be in danger?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes. But with me and Ai no longer looking like kid versions of ourselves they will never find us.\u201d Genda replied smiling.</span></div></div>",

If Genda believed Shinichi was killed and he had no connection to him, what would be his memories for the time before he shrunk? Maybe Genta should change some memories of Genda first to be safe. But he would think about it for a couple of days, maybe Genda would profit from the memories later. So he switched the mc-device off again, but it saved the changes he wanted to make.

He had asked Ran about him only to hear that Conan had wanted to be part of the Kojima family, not that he understood why. So he came by only to run into Genda, who he mistook for Genta and asked him about Conan. <br>\r\nGenda had explained his old friend Heiji that he had been Conan after they had sat down in the living room where Genta found them. Heiji had laughed about that at first only to stop when seeing Genta looking a little mad at him. That was just like it had been with Haibara before.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should I do now? Changing something on Genda's memories while Heiji is here isn't good, and letting Heiji keep the knowledge isn't good either. But knocking out Heiji while Genda his here also won't work. Hmm...\u201d<br>\r\nAfter standing there for a couple of minutes, Genta had decided what he wanted to do. \u201cGenda, I need your help downstairs.

When what the boy called Genda had said was true, then the boy in front of him, Genta, had somehow changed his best friend into a copy of himself and could be dangerous. Not answering for a some time, Genta took it into his own hands by taking out a stun watch similar to the one Conan had before and shoot Heiji with it. Heiji was to slow to escape the dart and quickly succumbed the effect.<br>\r\n\u201cHe should be stunned for half an hour, enough time to change Genda's memories.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Placing Heiji in the machine was also not easy because of his size. The machine was originally designed to change Conan into a copy of him, not someone who is bigger then himself. With Hattori being a teen instead of a kid he had to improvise with it. He had to bend his legs forwards, positioning his knees in the big belly area of the metal box while his feet landed where they should be. The same applied for his arms, his elbows pointed to his chest while his hands where to the sides. With that and a slightly pressed down head to his chest Genta manages to put Heiji in and closed the lid.

The only difference between the two , beside the missing clothes, was that Heiji was a bit darker skinned, not as much as before but still noticeable. \u201cJust like Genma still has Mitsuhiko's freckles. Only Genda has no sign of his old body anymore.\u201d Genta thought. <br>\r\nWhile Heiji was occupied with the mirror Genta got the helm and put it on Heiji's head, leaving the boy confused about what would happen now. But Genta was quick to start the process to suck out the intelligence and put it into a unit to keep it. He had thought about giving some intelligence back to his siblings later but wanted to keep the difference between them the same, so he had needed something as a kind of temporary storage. <br>\r\nHeiji started to panic because he could feel himself getting dumber and that wasn't pleasant because for one, the sucking wasn't painless to him and second nobody liked it when something you know just vanished. \u201cPlease stop\u201d was a whimper from Heiji, still not having the energy to fight or do more then that. But it didn't stop until it was finished, leaving Heiji on the same level of intelligence as Genda and Genma were. If he wasn't bound to the chair and had the strength, Heiji would have massaged his temples to ease the pain.</span></div></div>",

From now on you will be known as Genja Kojima, second youngest of the quad after Genma. You will be very loyal to the whole family, a little more so to your other quad brothers Genta, Genda and Genma as well as the twins Ginko and Gindo. You are as intelligent as Genda and Genma, a little bit behind Gindo but much ahead of Ginko. Like everyone in the family you are a heavy eater. Your dream is to become a sumo wrestler to show your fighting spirit. Finally you will remember being Heiji Hattori as a distant memory, but nothing concrete. Therefore you have memories of growing up alongside your new family.\" With that he started the helmet.<br>\r\nHeiji could do nothing as the helmet worked through his brain, changing his mind and memories just like Genta had said before, suppressing his old identity more the further the process progressed. <br>\r\nHe could only ask weakly \"But what will happen to the people who know me?\" <br>\r\n\"They have already forgotten about you. With another device I changed the memories of others so that to the world you died alongside Shinichi Kudo. Genda has no longer any recollection he had been born as him, but as Conan Edogawa.\" <br>\r\nAfter hearing that Heiji started to cry while the helmet worked. But the tears slowly decreased when Genja Kojima took place in his brain, who had no reason to cry.<br>\r\nGenta only found it slightly cruel of himself that Heiji had been awake through the whole process, but that was now the past. Genja wouldn't remember what happened after it finished and any ache would vanish over time. Heiji plead a last time, thinking about Kazuha, his last effort as Heiji Hattori before he vanished, imprisoned in the very back of the new mind of Genja, never to resurface again. With that only Genta had the knowledge who his new brother had been before. He cut the bindings, freeing Genja, only for him to fall unconscious the moment Heiji had finally vanished. \u201cSo now the body took his toll. But that is good for me, when you wake up again the pain should have vanished mostly, if not completely.\u201d He put the clothes on Genja before he took him upstairs.</span></div></div>",

And there's his son Goro, he's trying to be a sumo wrestler! He's about the same age as Hiroshi and are good friends. I hate that they always pick on me and Souta at reunions. But with you there, I'm sure they're leave us alone! Right Conan!\" said Genta as he was packing up his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet! I won't let you down!\" responded Conan, who was done packing and was sitting on his futon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Although, since I'm a 4ft., 65 pound weakling right now, I doubt I'll be much help.' he thought inwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that was certainly true, Conan was however a bit wrong when stating his body's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the week that Conan was at Genta's place, he had gained about 15 pounds, so he was really 80 pounds. Conan was still oblivious to his increasing weight, as he had not stood in a mirror for more than a few minutes in the morning, and had casually batted away any thoughts that may have concerned his expanding girth when he had gotten clothes 2 sizes bigger than what he usually wore, stating that it was logical that he'd gain a little weight with having to spend that summer at Genta's place and he could just melt of the 5 or at most 8 pounds he'd gain with a bit of soccer and criminal chasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, he was dressed in a way that resembled Genta's own clothing style, with a green shirt and blue shorts, which were smaller than Genta's, since they were his when he was five. Although, wearing a five-year old Genta's clothing on a seven-year old Conan would have him look like a clown, had he not had the extra weight. In fact, it fitted him pretty well, it even was starting to feel a bit snug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, Genta, Mom and Dad said for you and Conan to hurry up! It's a long drive to uncle Daiki's house in Osaka!\" yelled Hiroshi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming! Come on Conan, let's go.\" said Genta as he and Conan ran down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenta's uncle Daiki owned a huge estate and a large staff of butlers and maids with his wife and two kids on the outskirts of Osaka. Being a CEO of a large software company, he made enough to invite and house his entire family for one week, which included his parents, his Genta's family and his brother's Genji's family, his parents' siblings and their family, their parents' siblings' families and some of the closer but still a bit distant relatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the estate and parked into the driveway, they were greeted by Daiki, who had come out to greet his first visitors and to catch up on old times with his younger brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Jiro! Come in, come in! How are you and Fujimi doing?\" said Daiki, as he led his them to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're doing great, and the store's fine as well. Although, I've noticed I've gotten a bit more pudge around the middle as of late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha, the woes of aging! Those pounds just seem to pile on once you've had children! Which reminds me, unless you've managed to pull a prank on me for the last seven years, I'm pretty sure that you had only three children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Conan! He's Genta's friend. His guardians couldn't take him with them this summer and asked us to take care of him. Great kid, although I'm afraid our eating habits have rubbed off on him. Seems I'm not the only with more pudge around the middle lately. Makes me feel a bit guilty since Fujimi's cooking is what probably caused most of his weight gain. And with every other Kojima woman coming, I'm sure we'll all need a bigger set of clothes after this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself, I've already bought my clothes. So, how much has young Conan gained?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look for yourself. Here's a picture I was given by his Nee-chan, Ran, in case something happened and the police needed to identify him. Look at that for a moment and compare it to Conan. Let me just call him over. Conan-kun, would you please come here for a moment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, coming Kojima-san!\" said a startled Conan as he was jostled out of a Yaiba discussion between Souta and Genta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Anything to get out of talking about Yaiba. I mean really, those two obsess way too much about that for it to be healthy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Kojima-san? Did you need anything?\" he asked, wonder what he could be needed for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing much, my brother just wants to get a closer look at you, being a famous detective and all and living with Sleeping Kogoro too. Isn't that right Daiki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Conan, Daiki could indeed see that the Conan he was looking at was much bigger than the one in the picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh? Oh, right, right. Well, I'm done, it was nice to meet you Conan-kun. Well you run off now, and don't get any bigger then you have already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Conan left, Jiro turned to his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Conan was following Genta and Souta as they went upstairs with their twin cousins, Tokujiro and Tokujaro, both the same age as Genta was. He was pondering what Daiki had said as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What did he mean don't get any bigger? I haven't gained that much weight, have I? And none of it should be noticeable.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued walking, he passed by a mirror hanging on the wall, took one look at it and asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tokujiro-kun, where's your bathroom, I need to use it really badly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um...there's one down that hallway on the second door to the left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Conan shouted, running as fast as he could down the hallway. Which, if he had taken the time to notice, was considerably slower than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That can't be right! I couldn't have gained that much to look like that! I've got to see this myself.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the bathroom door, he went inside and closed it quickly and locked it. Then, he proceeded to strip down to his underwear and stood on a stool as to better see the bathroom mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What...what happened to me...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReflecting back at him was not a svelte grade-schooler, but a round, startled boy with a round, tan potbelly with a navel so deep, he could fit an entire finger all the way in. His chest poofy and round were soon becoming boy breasts. Looking down, he found that his belly obscured his view enough that only his toes were visible. And, later in a very private moment, found that his crotch was smaller than before. His arms and legs were plump and round with chubby hands and feet that had fat fingers and toes. His face had become much more fuller, with plump cheeks and a modest second chin. His butt had grown twice as large as before and stretched his briefs to the max. And his backside had started to sag down a bit with all the fat and merged into his new love handles and other fat rolls throughout his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've got to see how much I weigh...' he said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a scale, he look down as the number 80 came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fifteen pounds! At this rate, I'll weigh as much as Genta! I've gotta start doing something quick!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, for his waistline, Genta was knocking on the door with one of the greatest desserts known to man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Conan-kun, hurry up! You've been there for twenty minutes! Uncle Genji's already here and he's brought his three-fudge-chocolate cake!\" yelled Genta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on his clothes, he stepped out...only to have a mouthful of cake shoved in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Conan-kun, how does it taste?\" said Genta with a sly look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's delicious!\" said Conan, who grabbed the rest of the cake and started scarfing it down, the cake being the only thing on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then come downstairs! There's a lot more food that's just as great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they went and gorged themselves. They laughed and talked and Conan met some of Genta's relatives, all who were on the heavy side themselves, and felt a bit embarrassed as the females cooed over at how cute he was and gave him more food. And the entire time, he ate those offerings and more too. He had seconds and thirds and fourths, he just couldn't believe how great it was! And as he ate, he felt his worries slip away. He could do something next week, when the reunion was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, it was a very full and tired Conan who went up to the guest room he shared with Genta. This was also a Conan that decided to drink a bit more of Genta's stomachache cure, due to his gorging causing a huge stomachache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling asleep, Conan never noticed that his body's metabolism had slowed again, to the point where it was only a quarter of what it was. No more bean pole Conan for him and gone were the days where he could eat like a pig and not gain an ounce. There was only more and more fat for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch were the facts that those of the Kojima family had to know, who had always been made to be heavier than others, and Conan himself was considered part of Kojima family now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, in a peaceful slumber, it was Conan Kojima that dreamed of dancing fudge cakes and steaming chicken. Not Conan Edogawa nor Shinchi Kudo. It was Conan Kojima who was drooling at the dream of buffet, full of food of all kinds, and it was Conan Kojima who woke up the next morning, eating a stack of pancakes piled high with eggs, bacon, french toast, and a bowl of cereal. It was Conan Kojima who was sitting with the other young Kojimas, talking about the days activities while being hugged by aunts and grandmothers and partaking in a eating contest. Which, he had done very well at considering he was smaller compared to Genta and other kids his age who had come to the reunion, all of them themselves round like butterballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch that, Conan was definitely part of the Kojima family now!</span></div></div>",

And remember, no running near the pool!\" shouted Daiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai!\" shouted the small crowd of about 30 kids, all of them about 5-14 years old with their weights ranging from chubby to worryingly obese. Then, completely ignoring Daiki's warning from just a few moments ago, they ran towards the pool in a very childish manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, Conan played various pool games with the children. Ranging from games like Marco Polo, Chicken, even just some laps around the pool. Then, most of them started calming down and started talking about trivial things, most of them along the lines of:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! I haven't seen you in so long! We have got to catch up! Tell me about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad's restaurant is doing fine so and sumo's been going great! You should really try out for it you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaiba's the best manga ever! I can't believe you would even say something like that! Why I otta...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were talking, Conan opted to float around the pool and reflect on his life so far. How his life used to be before he shrunk, as a seventeen year old ace detective and high school soccer star. He had a nice home, all the freedom he could want, and a chance at seducing his childhood friend. Now, he was instead a seven year old grade schooler living in a small apartment with the same childhood friend, who was now completely untouchable, and her alcoholic father, who's ego had inflated tenfold since he became a famous detective himself, courtesy of Conan. And of course, living with Ran had completely taken away most of his teenage freedom, such as staying out past 8 o'clock for example. Plus, while he had used to retain most of his athletic ability...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, he paused to lay a hand on his stomach, and frowned a little as he felt his body jiggle with the waves the others were making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...he was reminded about the lost of that too due to his recent weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought, he shook his head a bit to clear off the few touches of drowsiness he had gotten from floating around for so long so he could think better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'4 feet, 80 pounds...I can't believe I'd ever be this short again...or that I'd ever be fat period.' he thought, his frown increasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't believe this I've let this happen for so long, I need to lose all this weight before Ran comes back! First thing I need to do is stop eating so much food...no matter how great it tastes...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes more of thinking, and Conan was filled with determination to lose all his excess weight as fast as possible. In fact, he was about to get out of the pool and see if there was a workout room somewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...if it wasn't for the fact that a huge wave cause by the consecutive cannonballs of the 10 most heaviest kids there prevented him from moving for a few moments as his body once again quivered furiously with the wave along with the smaller aftershocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave after wave kept hitting his body, but instead of being swept away, he floated unharmed thanks to his new weight. Watching himself to make sure he didn't get hurt, he watched his body take on more gelatinous properties as it shook. While he felt himself wobble, he felt something that he hadn't noticed before. And realized something:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It feels nice, like I'm big again.' he thought, 'It's not the same, but it's better then before I suppose. And it feels...funny, in an almost ticklish kind of way when those waves hit...it's not a reason I shouldn't try to lose weight though.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that there probably wouldn't be a workout room since very few of the adults he saw looked to be in any shape at all, he decided he would try instead to swim laps with the other kids, since they were getting ready to have another race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really am going to lose this weight, even it takes me the whole summer.\" he said to himself. Although, it seemed to lack a bit of the determination it had from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that they were about to start, he swam as fast as he could, hoping to get their in time before they started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LUNCH TIME!!!\" yelled Tokujiro and Tokujaro in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them getting out the pool, they raced towards the adults, where a bunch of tables were there stacked high with all sorts of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit clumsily, Conan walked along with Genta, not used to walking on land after being in the water so long. Seeing the piles of food however, almost made him sprint towards the buffet and grab as much food as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost. Saying his newly formed weight loss mantra with even less determination than before, he regained his self-control, and reluctantly walked as fast as he could where he proceeded to get as little as he possibly could. However, many of the female adults noticed and were in the firm belief that a child should eat as much as they want and that a children should be plump. So, Conan soon found his plate being stacked high with yummies as he made half-hearted attempts to resist the food. In fact, as soon as his plate was filled, they gave him four more plates, each filled with enough food as humanely possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Conan walked towards where Genta and brothers were sitting with three of their cousins in a daze, followed by 2 women who were holding his food, both of them dotting on how cute he was. As he finally sat down, he was able to take his first bite...and started to ravenously devour it all as he threw away all his inhibitions about portion control and the like. So focused into his food, he was unaware of Genta stifling his laughs as he snuck up behind him until his shirt was lifting up and heard Souta's giggles as his belly was grabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mphmm!\" he said, startled out of eating his third plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You're right Genta! Conan has been getting fat!\" Souta said amongst more giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm not!\" Conan reacted almost automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Conan, I'm not dumb. I'm part of the Detective Boys too, remember?\" said Genta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was true. Genta, while always thinking about food, was part of the Detective Boys, and as such, had picked up enough from watching Conan that he could logically deduce things that normal 7 year olds shouldn't. Not enough to solve a murder or anything, but enough to solve a logic puzzle, a theft, even the rapid weight gain of one of his best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was all there. The bigger clothes, the increased appetite, all we needed was the final proof, your belly!\" Genta said, concluding his deduction with a slap of Conan's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I know, but you didn't have to be so dramatic you know!\" Conan said, a hint of anger in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you don't have to be angry yourself you know! Being big is fun!\" Genta said, trying to defuse the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to be fat!\" Conan said, not believing himself 100%.

Not enough that he was able to grab a handful of it, but it had enlarged enough that his waist had probably gone up a size or two. The rest of him thickened as well. His arms, once stick-thin, were now noticeably larger. His legs gain another layer of fat, his calves became soft, and his rear had widened too. His normally cherubic face, looked even more cherubic with his even rounder cheeks. Again, all of these changes weren\u2019t really that much, but it was enough that he looked no longer like a sporty, athletic child, but more like an average, sedentary boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a beep, the aging doctor stood up, and walked towards one of the machines currently attached to Conan\u2019s body, which had started printing a readout. After giving the paper a through read-through, he started to turn off the remaining machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026,\u201d said Dr. Agasa, his face molded in such a way as if he were thinking deeply, \u201cIt appears that your recent weight gain is due to a slower metabolic rate. Seeing as you lack any of the normal causes for your subdued metabolism, we can only assume that this is a side effect of the APTX 4869 that has only just surfaced. Unfortunately, since this is a side effect of the apotoxin, we really can\u2019t give you any medication or anything else to help you manage your weight, as we don\u2019t know how if it would work correctly due to the drug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d yelled Conan, \u201cWhat am I supposed to then!? I\u2019ve already gained ten lbs. this week, who knows how much I\u2019ll gain in a month! I\u2019ll be a blimp by then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust because I said you couldn\u2019t take any medication, doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t anything you can do Shinchi,\u201d replied Agasa in a lecturing type of tone, \u201cIt just means we\u2019ll have to use more conventional methods, such as portion control, diet, and exercise. With any luck, we\u2019ll have you back down to your normal 40lbs. in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he ended their discussion, and sent Conan on his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the Mouri Residence, Conan was planning on taking Prof. Agasa\u2019s advice to heart. He had ate a smaller portion tonight and was getting ready to put his plate in the sink when Ran stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConan-Kun, are you done eating already? You haven\u2019t eaten even half of what you usually eat,\u201d said Ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGomen Ran-nee-chan, I\u2019m just not hungry tonight,\u201d said Conan, hoping to end their talk there with a simple excuse. Unfortunately, his stomach growled just then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConan-Kun,\u201d began Ran, her voice taking on a scolding tone, \u201cJust because you\u2019ve gained a little weight doesn\u2019t mean you should be starving yourself. You\u2019re a growing boy, it\u2019ll even out eventually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing his plate, she filled it back up again before setting it down in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, sit back down and finish this up. It\u2019s not healthy to deprive yourself of the nutrients your body needs Conan-Kun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, he sat back down, knowing he wouldn\u2019t be going anyway until his plate was clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, he decided to forget about Agasa\u2019s advice for now, until he was able to properly practice it. However, it seemed like it would be a while before that happened, as Ran appeared to be unwilling to let Conan allow himself, in her, to damage his own health.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Conan wondered, but then realized something odd about Haibara; not only was she our of breath an struggling to keep up with Genta and Conan, but she looked different, she looked... fuller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed, her body had filled out, not a lot, but enough for it to be noticeable to Conan.

Her arms were covered in a thin layer of fat, and jiggled slightly with each step she took, along with her legs, which were considerably thicker. She had developed a small paunch, just enough for it to stick out about an inch, if not less.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oof\" Conan went as he bumped into someone. He could feel the touch of smooth velvet as he stumbled back. As he pushed back his jiggling bloated belly burst out of his pants and shirt. His squishy round gut resting on his lap as he fell to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gomen\" Conan said apologizing to whoever he bumped into. Rubbing his head and looking up he saw the most beautiful woman in the world. His eyes lay widened on her gorgeous form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a beautiful red dress and a skirt that went down to her lower thighs. Her feet were bare in high heels that were red as well. She was skinny too, her toned arms and legs complimenting her slim waist that looked so constricted and squeezed. She had the most beautiful brown hair. In fact she almost looked like Ran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman looked down on the chubby boy she let out an apology as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gomenosai\" she said in a concerned and worried tone. \"I'm so sorry, you aren't hurt are you\" she said looking at Conan. Conan just sat dumbfounded and blushing a bit but soon regained his composure. \"Uh yes, I-I'm ok\" he said rubbing his head. She gave him her hand and he grabbed it, lifting himself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConan had failed to notice that his jiggling belly was sticking out. The jiggling globe of flesh hanging over his waist. It wasn't that big mind you, but it was still big and round and it hung over his pants like the jiggling jelly sack it was. The woman became a bit embarassed as she looked at his belly. \"Oh, oh my um..your pants\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\" Conan said as he looked down at himself. He immediately turned bright red as he saw his flabby belly roll hanging down from his pants. \"Aa-aaah, I'm sorry\" he said completely embarrassed as she stuffed his jiggling belly into his pants and zipped them up quickly, stuffing his shirt into his pants to provide extra cover. \"I'm so sorry about bumping into you little boy\". \"Uh its fine, i should've watched where i was going\" Conan responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was glad he was alright. Taking better look at the boy she noticed that he was a bit portly. He had slightly pudgy fingers, a round pudgy face, thick arms and legs, and a jiggling round belly. It stuck out like a small round ball from his stomach. Suddenly remembering how cute his little belly was from it sticking out earlier she looked at the boy and saw upon closer inspection..that he was SO CUTE. He was like a small, squishy teddy bear and she could tell by the look on his face that he was hungry. She assumed that he must have loved eating. Her face turned warm and hearts filled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAHH so kawaiiiii\" she squealed. She grabbed Conan by under his arms. Conan was surprised when she did. She picked him up and held him to her level. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are so cute\" she said. Conan was flustered as she hugged him to her chest, Conan turning bright red. She stroked his smooth shirt as he hugged her back with his arms so he wouldn't fall. She brought her face to his fat cheeks and kissed them \"smooch\" \"smooch\" \"smooch\". He was like her big fat baby. \"MM-mm so sooooft\" she said as she took a long nailed finger and pinched his squishy cheek, feeling the soft and smooth fat in his cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um hold on a second\" Conan said. The woman stopped abruptly as Conan told her to. \"Oh oh my, I'm so sorry I don't even know what..came over me\" she said. She gently put Conan down to the ground. \"I'm so sorry, you were just so cute\" she said with a smile. \"Uh thank you\" Conan said. \"You were just so cute and fat\" she said, Conan inwardly groaning and making a sad face. \"By the way, I'm Kumiko\" she said. \"Conan\" he replied, introducing himself back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It so nice to meet you Conan\" she said as she bent down and pinched his cheek again. Conan pushed her away in slight embarassment. \"Uh you too.. Kumiko\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for doing that earlier, you are just cute and..well, so soft\" she said. \"Yeah i noticed\" he said looking at himself, observing his chubby arm and pudgy fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well anyway, I was here because i heard of the Marketplace exhibition. I wanted to go meet some friends of mine in one of the tents and i rushed and bumped into you\" she exclaimed. \"Well i just heard about this place so i wanted to check it out\" Conan said. \"So where's your mommy Conan, she must be worried about you\" Kumiko said concerned. \"My caretaker is Ran-nee-chan. I was on my way back from school with my friends and decided to come here\" he explained. \"Ah ok. By the way I'm guessing you're a bit hungry aren't you\" she asked. \"Well no not really\" Conan went. Unfortunately his bulging stomach growled loudly just then. He glared at it in betrayal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, little boys are always hungry Conan-kun\" she said poking his round tummy, her finger receding into its soft flesh. Conan blushed at this. \"Say, would you like to come with me Conan\" Rumiko asked.<br>\r\n\"Well i don't know\" Conan said. After all, he only just met this woman and it really wouldn't be right, but something seemed trusting about her. \"Its fine Conan-kun. I've been here before and I can show you around and get you something to eat too. Theres a lot to eat here\" she said. Conan wasn't sure. the last thing he wanted was to eat more and get fatter. In his current state his metabolism would make him grow a huge beer belly the more he eats. But he was so hungry and he didn't want to be rude. \"You can bring your friends too\" she added as Conan had completely forgotten about Ayumi and Genta, who were standing there watching the scene the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right my friends\" Conan said. \"These are my friends Ayumi and Genta\" he said gesturing to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh hi\" Genta said. <br>\r\n\"Hello\" Ayumi went. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry for leaving you out of the loop like this. Would you like to come with me\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Genta and Ayumi could see that Conan was going to be busy with this woman who curtiously invited him over to her place in the market exhibition. While they were happy for their friend, they decided they wanted to see some more of the fair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for the offer Mrs Kumiko, but i kinda want to see the rest of the fair\" Ayumi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we just got here and wanted to check it out. Maybe we'll come by later\" Genta added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConan looked desperate as he didn't want his friends to actually go so he wouldn't have to eat so much, since it sounded like she was gonna feed him as a complimentary guest and he didn't want to have to do it alone and get a fatter belly with his metabolism halved. He gave them a stare telling them not to go, but they simply ignored it. Before turning around and going though Ayumi gave him a wink with a face that said she knew what was going to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ok, but anytime you want to come over just head over to that yellow tent all the way over there to the left\" she said pointing forward. Ayumi and Genta nodded and said \"arigato\" as they both turned around to leave. \"See you later Conan\" Genta said as he followed Ayumi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConan was about to call out to him but remembered Kumiko behind him. Turning around, his fat cherubic face met her beautiful eyes and ruby red lipstick. \"Well then, shall we go then Conan-Kun\"?<br>\r\nConan turned a little red and took her large hand with his petit one. His chubby soft fingers felt nice in Kumiko's slim smooth palm. They walked together hand in hand as Conan short and chubby body walked beside Kumiko's tall skinny one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, what a polite boy you are\" she said. Conan simply smiled and blushed a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way to the yellow temple Kumiko was talking about earlier to Genta and Ayumi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading inside, Kumiko let go of Conan's hand and waved at three other women sitting in the tent. \"Girls, i have company\" she said. In an instant the three women fixed their eyes on Conan, and they immediately gushed with happiness and adoration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAHH KAWAII DESU\" \"HE'S SO CUTE\" \"I WANT TO HUG HIM\". The women rushed over to Conan. Immediately they picked him up and started smooching him. Conan was assaulted with attention, but then how could he not be? He was a small 7 year old fat boy, a lot of women dream of kissing such a cute thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConan tried to get a closer look at the women. There was a skinny woman with a yellow sundress on and sandals on her feet. She looked like she was in her 20s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was another young woman with black hair wearing a T-shirt and Jeans with sneakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third however, was a very fat and heavyset woman. Her arms were wide and flabby and her fingers were puffy like sausages. Her face was covered with jiggling fat and was very round with some flab on her neck and her legs were jiggling fat tree trunks. Her biggest feature however was her jiggling fat belly. It was huge and poured over her pants and stuck out of her shirt just a bit. Conan couldn't see it that well, but her butt was a big jiggling fat bubble butt. It seemed as though she was fat all over her body and not in one specific place. She was wearing a large green t-shirt, her jiggling fat belly that cascaded over her shirt and over her pants. There was a lot to describe about this woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConan could feel himself being lifted off the ground and pulled in different directions as they went crazy. Something told him that they were a bit..eccentric to say the least. Who would go this crazy over a little 7 year old boy anyway? Perhaps they were lonely mothers who wanted more children to love. Who knew..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LADIES\" Kumiko shouted. Soon enough the girls put Conan down and sat down calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gomen Conan-kun\" she went. \"I'm so sorry for that sudden surprise. My friends are a bit excited when they see a cute child\" she explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry for that\" the second woman said. \"Allow us to introduce ourselves. I am Meling\" the woman in the yellow sundress said. \"This is Miko\" she pointed to the second girl in the green shirt. \"And this is Megumi\" she said pointing to the vastly overweight woman across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its nice to meet all of you\" Conan said bowing in respect. The ladies just laughed at how cute he was for being so polite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are my friends Conan-kun. They've been at the marketplace exhibition as well\" Kumiko said to Conan. \"They are a bit ecstatic upon seeing you though. They're mothers so they like seeing children\" she added. Conan would've guessed that, and it seems he was correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats right we just love children. We've raised them and of course they are very rambuctious but still we love them since they are our little babies\" Meling said. \"But of course, we love seeing other cute little babies, especially cute chubby ones\" Miko said. Conan blushed a bit again, looking down at his protruding stomach. The women just giggled. \"I know, I love cute chubby children. The sign of a fat child is the sign of a healthy eater\" Megumi said, patting her own jiggling fat belly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nConan simply smiled again. He didn't know why she was towards chubby children though. It was healthier to be skinnier, but looking at her he could see why she would think that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKumiko broke the conversation by saying \"Well I've come to introduce Conan to the market and maybe go out and explore it together\". Then she remembered \"Oh oh my that's right, you haven't eaten yet huh Conan-kun\" she asked him with a worried look. Conan was hoping she would forget that. \"Uh no no  really, I'm not hungry Kumiko-san\" he said with his chubby hands in front of him. The other women then spoke up. \"The poor baby is hungry? No need to worry, we'll feed you as much as you want\" Meling said. \"We have plenty of food here in the fridge\" Megumi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConan was a bit stuck. He didn't want to refuse their offer but he didn't want to risk gaining weight either. Then he got an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Kumiko-san. How about we explore the market first, then we can come back and maybe eat\" he asked her. Kumiko looked at him for a second and said...</span></div></div>",

Conan wrapped his arms around his stomach. \"Ugh....I'm so hungry...\" Conan grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're experiencing the new side effects...\" A voice came from behind Conan. He whirled around to see Haibara in a bulky sweatsuit with her hair covering the rest of her face. Conan felt his face feel hot as he realized that she would probably laugh at him. Haibara then raised her head and showed her face, Conan's eyes grew large as he saw Haibara's face had plumped up slightly, giving her an even cuter look than she already had. Conan stifled a chuckle as Haibara quickly lowered her head again, allowing her hair to cover her face once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not account for this when I invented the APTX 4869.\" Haibara murmured softly as she sat right next to Conan. Conan felt his face grow hot again as he felt Haibara's love handles spill out and touch his own. Haibara groans slightly as a soft growl is heard coming from her own stomach. Conan realized Haibara's face turn red as he pushed his uneaten sandwich towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, eat\" Conan urged softly. Haibara quickly took the sandwich from the table and took a bite from the sandwich and chewed frantically. Between bites, she managed to say, \"The APTX 4869 *munch* not only *chew* slows your metabolism *crunch* but also increases *munch* your appetite greatly\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConan felt his own hunger rise into his stomach and silently longed for the sandwich that was already half-eaten by Haibara. Haibara took two more small bites and then stuffed the rest of the sandwich into her mouth, filling her plump cheeks and making her look like a chipmunk. She swallowed the sandwich and took the juice pouch from Conan's lunch box and sucked it dry. As she finished, a small burp passed her lips followed by a series a tiny hiccups. Conan stifled another chuckle with difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you shouldn't have eaten so fast\" Conan managed to get out. Haibara eyed him with resentment and retorted,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so *hic* I'm still hungry. But *hic* at least I ate *hic* something.\" Haibara's words dug into Conan as his own gnawing hunger clawed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aughh, I gotta eat something\" Conan moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit, now here's what we do\" Haibara said as she grabbed Conan by the arm and raced out of the lunchroom into the bright sunshine.</span></div></div>",

Conan realized that she was breathing even harder than he was and her face was already covered with sweat. Haibara kept running until they reached Professor Agasa's house. As she ran through the door, she collapsed on the floor, her chest heaving up and down as she panted heavily. Conan supported his weight by leaning against a wall, he was tired beyond belief, but a scent of hamburgers drifted through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Haibara. You're home, I made the burgers just as you asked\" The professor said as he strolled into the room carrying a try of plump hambugers and cheeseburgers. Haibara slowly stood up by supporting herself with the hat rack. Agasa looked at both Haibara and Conan as a puzzeled look appeared on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both ok?\" Haibara didn't answer but took two meaty hamburgers in her small hands and took a bite out of both of the burgers, allowing the flavors to sooth her tired body as she plopped her body on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You *pant* You planned this?\" Conan asked, still out of breath. Haibara took a large gulp of the chocolate milk that she had placed before she went to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what of it?\" Haibara replied nonchalantly as she took more bites out of the burgers she held. Conan quickly took a burger from the professor's tray and plopped himself down next to Haibara on the couch, tearing at his burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, this won't do at all. I can't continue letting you miss classes just because of your insatiable appetites.\" Agasa said as he took a bite from a burger he was holding. Haibara finished both her burgers and let out a soft belch. She took off her sweatsuit as a trickle of sweat fell from his forehead, revealing her clad in her student uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well until we find a more suitable way, this is the only we have\" Haibara replied as she got up and grabbed two more burgers from the tray. Conan's attention on his burger wavered as he saw Haibara in his school uniform. She had already grown a small potbelly which quivered like jello whenever she took a bite out of one of her burgers. Her skinny limbs had plumped up and her hips had grown wider, making her rear shake side to side whenever she got up too quickly. After finishing her sixth burger, which no girl at her age could've finished without having a stomache, she patted her jiggly tummy contently and leaned back to stretch. Her school-issued blouse pushed up on her chest as she did, revealing her cute, quivering potbelly. She quickly grabbed her blouse and pushed it down, her face turning completely red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that's strange. I think we should go to the lab.\" Agasa said as he took the empty tray and placed it in the sink. Conan and Haibara got up from their seats and followed Agasa to the lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this may be a little awkward for both of you, but I need you to strip to your undergarments so I can attach these wires to your bodies.\" A loud roar of complaints filled the room as both Conan and Haibara refused to strip while the other was present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come now! We're all technically adults here. Now are we going to act like children or are we going to analyze what's wrong with both of you?\" Both Conan and Haibara fell silent except for a few grumbles as both stripped to their undergarments like Agasa instructed. The prof quickly attached electrodes to both their bodies and sat down at his computer and started to type information down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConan was trying to look at the direction opposite of Haibara but an itching curiosity made him turn around and glimpse over his shoulder. She saw that Haibara was staring at Agasa's computer, with her pudgy hands folded across her chest. Her face seems to be even plumper than earlier and her potbelly was jiggling with every breath. Her thighs had plumped up a lot as her hips were exceeding her stomach in growth. Haibara suddenly glared at Conan which made him turn around quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is peculiar business\" Agasa murmured loud enough for Conan and Haibara to hear, \"It seems that...\"</span></div></div>",

Before Conan could ask more, Haibara quickly pulled off her wires and got in her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do it\" Haibara said as-a-matter-of-factly. Conan's eyes widened as he hurried over to Haibara, his potbelly jiggling along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you nuts? What if this doesn't work?\" Conan whispered to her in an undertone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll never know if we never try. Besides...\" Haibara's words were interrupted by a large growling sound from her stomach, \"I'm still really hungry\" Haibara replied with a smug smile. Conan's eyes widened with shock at her gluttony until his stomach grumbled loudly too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but this better work!\" Conan said as he followed Agasa and Haibara into the deeper parts of the lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky for you two, I have invented a new invention that'll revolutionize the world!\" Agasa exclaimed proudlyas they arrived at two machines that were covered with a sheet, \"I am proud to present you with the feeder!\" Agasa said as he pulled off the sheet, revealing two dental-office like chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prisoners these days always escape! And no matter what you chain them to, they always seem to get out of it. So I thought, 'Why not chain them to themselves?'\" Agasa explained, \"This machine will feed the prisoner until he or she is too heavy to move! Then they will be so harmless that they will prove no threat to anybody!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this even safe?\" Conan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it's safe!...I think...well there's no better way to figure out something than to tackle it head-on, wouldn't you say?\" Agasa replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure about this\" Conan said in an undertone to his left where Haibara was supposedly standing, his eyes widened when he realized that she wasn't there and had already fit her expanding butt in one of the seats. Conan groaned and sat in the seat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, the machine will start in about 10 seconds\" Agasa said as he started pushing buttons on the machines. Conan felt something tighten around his hand as realized that Haibara had grasped his hand firmly and had her eyes closed shut as she awaited the start of the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3, 2, 1\" Agasa said and pulled a red lever. Just as he did, two arms came out of the machine and a conveyer belt on the left of both chairs started moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Machine set on slow\" Agasa said as he pressed more buttons. Soon after, burgers started appearing on the conveyer belts, one of the hands on both machines reached down and grabbed the burgers and held it close enough so they could eat it without using their hands. When Conan reached up for the burgers, shakles shot from the armrests of both machines and tied their hands down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops, that shouldn't be! Hold on, I'll try getting rid fo that\" Agasa apologized. Haibara didn't seem to notice and lost herself as burger after juicy burger were held in front of her. The burgers were big enough to eat in one bite, but just as filling as a normal burger. After a while, the second hand took out a thick shake and the hands switched between burgers and a mouthful of the shakes. Soon, Conan felt his stomach getting full and started to eat with decreased speed. He looked over at Haibara and saw that she was still eating at the pace she started with. Her small, pudgy face was covered with greasy sauce and her blouse was becoming strained as her jiggling stomach threatened to tear the blouse to pieces. Conan looked down and saw his own belly swell larger with every bite. His baggy sweatshirt and sweatpants started to feel less baggy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burgers were quickly replaced by chocolate as the hands started holding small bite-sized bricks of chocolate in front of their grease-covered mouth. Conan slunk back from the bar of pure sugar just as the hand stuffed the chocolate into his mouth. Conan started coughing as the smoothie hand appeared before him, he looked over at Haibara and saw that she did not hesitate a second and now has her chubby cheeks covered with a coat of sticky chocolate. The fibers in her blouse started groaning louder and louder as Haibara started groaning from the pain the constricting blouse was creating. Haibara abruptly stopped eating and struggled to move her arms so she could loosen her blouse. The persisted to force the clump of chocolate into Haibara's mouth, smearing her entire chubby face with chocolate. The hand quickly made Haibara swallow the chocolate and a loud ripping sound resonated through the lab. I large rip appeared on Haibara's blouse, revealing her ever-plumping tummy. Haibara let out a breath of relief and continued eating with renewed gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh...Dr. Agasa, I think I'm full now.\" Conan moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now let's see\" Agasa said as he started fiddling with the buttons on teh machine. As he pressed the last button, teh machine whirled and started feeding Conan and Haibara even faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Dr. Agasa!\" Conan managed to make out between bites. The look of contentment that was on Haibara's face throughout the feeding was replaced with a pained expression as she was forced to eat more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Uh, hold on!\" Dr. Agasa said clicking buttons rapidly. Conan felt a sharp pain at his stomach area and saw that his sweatshirt was ripping at the seams. He tried desperately to remove his sweatshirt but his hands were still chained. As Dr. Agasa pressed the last button, the machine died down and the hands froze in their spots. The chains on Conan and Haibara's hands disappeared back into the arm rests and Haibara started rubbing her copious belly flesh and groaned softly. Conan took off his confining sweatshirt and and rubbed his belly as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how do you feel?\" Dr. Agasa asked them both. Haibara looked at him with a pudgy face smeared with oils and chocolate, smiled and said, \"Is there anything to eat? I'm hungry.\"</span></div></div>",

He reluctantly held his mouth started wiped off his face too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Professor, what do we do now?\" Haibara asked him impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I have to make some mroe calculations, I'll be right back\" Agasa said as he rushed out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph, what are we gonna do, Haibara?\" Conan asked as he held his growling belly. He looked over to where Haibara was standing and realized that she had already taken off her confining school-issued skirt and plopped her widening butt on the feeder again, sending ripples through her new, softer body. Her pink panties were getting tighter and tighter but Haibara wasn't about to take them off, no matter how uncomfortable they get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are you waiting for?\" Haibara ordered, \"Start the feeder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? Agasa could hardly stop it last time, what if I can't stop it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it!!\" Haibara barked. Conan jumped and quickly ran to the controls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I guess if you're ready\" Conan said as he pulled the red lever. The two hands appeared on either side of Haibara and started stuffing slice after slice of cheesy pizza into Haibara's hungry maw. Her stomach started slowly expanding again after each slice. Haibara smiled contently as her empty tummy started filling back up into the doughy belly it was before. Conan eyed the pieces of pizza enviously and got an idea. 'If Haibara got stuffed faster, I can eat faster!' So Conan quickened the machine, the hands worked at a furious pace. Haibara's smile quickly turned into a frown as her belly started eclipsing her cute pink panties. Her naked tummy flesh hung over her thickening thighs and her great big fleshy butt. She started squirming uncomfortably in her seat and tried to yell out but her face was continuously stuffed with pizza. Conan quickly fumbled at the controls as he quickly tried to turn off the machine. Pizza was flying everywhere and Haibara's cheeks were stuffed full of it. Finally Conan pressed the right button and teh whoel machien died down. Haibara swallowed her mouthful of pizza and started panting heavily as her belly glorped forward a couple of inches. Conan panted heavily and grabebd a piece of pizza that was flung over and munched on it greedily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Co *pant* Conan, hand me your sweatshirt... *pant*\" Haibara managed to make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConan handed his sweatshirt to her and Haibara wrapped it around her fattening soft waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because,\" Haibara panted, \"My underwear...has um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it!

Conan and Haibara collapsed in a humorous fashion as they in a sense \"facepalmed\" at his obvious realization of what they already knew. \"We know that old man, just tell us how to fix it\" Conan yelled at Dr Asaga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, honestly these results aren't really showing anything\" he said. \"It seems that you're metabolisms are not just cut in half, but are slowly decreasing more and more\" he said. The two small 7 year old sized adult-turned kids looked at the Dr. in shock. \"De-decreasing!?\" Conan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, it would seem as though the poison of the Aptx 4869 are altering your systems. It\u2019s lowering your bodies' abilities to convert food into energy and instead makes it so the food automatically turns into fat with the energy being used up by the poison to power it, which in other words, means it is lowering your metabolisms more and more.  In addition, you are constantly getting hungrier and hungrier because no energy is being absorbed when you eat, leaving you in a constant state of hunger\" Dr Asaga said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait, we can control out metabolisms right? We can just try to control our eating\u2026if it\u2019s even possible\u201d Conan said.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid this isn\u2019t normal metabolism dropping by any means. It\u2019s caused by the poison and if you don't treat it right, it will continue to drop no matter what you do until you are permanently hungry, eating to the point of obesity and constantly eating and fattening up quickly because of your lowered metabolisms and constant drained energy. Because of the poison's effects your metabolisms will become very sensitive. The more uncontrollably you eat, the lower your metabolisms will get. Eventually your metabolisms will be so low that you will be constantly hungry throughout most of the day, so you will essentially becoming gluttonous consumers that eat everything\" he finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Conan grabbed Haibara's arm and said in a panic \"Haibara, if we don't do something soon, we'll be fat blobs that devour everything we SEE\" he said as he hyperventilated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you cool it Conan. There is a way to fix this\" she said. Conan relaxed if only a little bit taking his hand off of Haibara.<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s right Conan. Remember that , while we don\u2019t have a cure, your hunger could be controlled manually with the conventional methods I mentioned before. You can still try portion control, exercise, diet and other methods as I mentioned before to maintain your weight\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps it will balance your metabolisms and steady them, but they will continue to drop and your appetites will continue to increase greatly\u201d he said. To this, Conan\u2019s chubby face dropped sadly. \u201cIts fine Conan, just try to control your eating as I said. You too Haibara\u201d he turned and said to her. \u201cYes Dr. Asaga\u201d she replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, I will continue to work on a cure for the Aptx 4869, or at least a cure for your insatiable appetites\" he said. \"And besides, these may not even be 100% true results. Perhaps your metabolisms will rise again or stop dropping at some point and your appetites will be in tow\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, all 3 left the lab and walked into Dr Asaga\u2019s living room when Conan and Haibara sat on his couch, small bellies and butts jiggling as they plopped their rears down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw the results of the fattening on their chubby rounder faces, plump arms and puffy fingers until the heard something all too familiar, the growling noise from their cute jiggling bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well it looks like we're hungry again\" Haibara said looking down at her stomach, still puffy and pudgy and full of the hamburgers from before, but it craved more now. Their metabolisms were dropping faster than they thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And thus, when reminded about Conan's camp activities from a pan-wielding Ran, his massive hangover caused him to chose 'YamaUCHI's Junior Sumo Stables' rather than 'YamaNAKA's Sherlock Enthusiasts.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should be said in Kogoro's defense however, that Conan should have noticed all the pudgy, overweight kids wearing mawashis on his bus, but was unable to due to a late night case which would exhaust his young body. So, while Conan was asleep on the bus with his head against the window, the bus' hefty driver continued on, not at all knowing about the mix-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut back to the story. Conan was now stuck here, at a junior sumo camp for the summer, because while Wakaki said he was going to continue contacting Kogoro, it was unlikely he'd ever reach him, mostly because he out vacationing in the States and had only bothered to put his home phone on the application, which would never be picked up by anyone since Ran had decided to go participate in this year's International Karate Tour. And with Agasa only being a close family friend and not his legal guardian, he was pretty much stuck here for the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, he was currently in a large dojo as the stable master and some of his older wrestlers gave motivational speeches in an attempt to pump up the boys, which was obviously working seeing as how they were all jumping up and down and were already boasting about how experienced they were. All the while Conan was feeling a little upset about his new camp and also was feeling a little left out being around a bunch of sumo enthusiasts while he himself knew almost nil about sumo other than then the basics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and now for your schedules. Each of your days will go like this,\" said an older wrestler. \"You will wake up at 7 o'clock in the morning to practice your skills with each other 'till noon, where we have lunch until 2 o'clock, followed by a forty-five minute nap. Then, you have lessons, consisting of the history of sumo, tactics used, and more, until 8 o'clock in the evening. Afterwards, you will have a dinner, and then an hour in your dorms to do whatever you please until lights out at 10 o'clock. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young adolescents shook their heads in the negative, the older wrestlers began handing out dorm number, with Conan himself getting dorm number 5 along with 3 others. He sighed a little as he realized once again that he'd probably be in stuck in his room all day, rereading his detective books as the other children made friends. But he shrugged it off and began to walk towards the door and onto the hallways, when he was suddenly called by Wakaki, who was now running towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Wakaki-san?\" he asked, his innocent kid face set firmly on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking about what to do with you for your stay with us, and I've been thinking that its probably better if you participate with the other children rather then having you kept inside a stuffy room for the next two months. Of course, the choice is yours, but it's just an option I thought I should lay out there,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I probably should just wait until they call that bastard,' he thought and was about to said so when he remembered how unlikely that probably would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try being a sumo wrestler Wakaki-san!\" he yelled. 'After all,' he thought, 'I'd rather be around people my own age, even if my age is now seven again. Plus, I'd wouldn't really be a sumo. Gain a few pounds, try and win a few matches, make some friends, then go home and lose the ten, fifteen pounds I'd gain. It'll be cake.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Conan, a sumo wrestler's life made it so he'd probably be gaining close to thirty or forty pounds that would most likely stay on him. It also made habits that would be detrimental in helping one lose weight and would stack on more weight. Which was why it was huge advantage to kids wanting to be junior sumos, as it allowed them a head start on their peers. On a side note, it should be said that a sumo's life is a very a healthy life, as they eat mostly foods with 'good' fat and pack on a bit of muscle to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was something that Conan wouldn't learn until much later, when the above would already be happening. But like before, he was unaware of them, and was escorted to his dorm by Wakaki, where he talked a little with the other boys, all of them larger then he, before he washed up and went to bed, not all knowing the changes that would happen.</span></div></div>",

Instead, he felt a large surge of drowsiness, yawning he closed his eyes and settled into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dreams were strange. He dreamt he was sitting at a large table, alone with giant piles of food in front of him. He started drooling as the food floated onto the plate in front of him, a nearby fork levitating over it, taking pieces and placing them in Conan's open mouth. Slices of lemon pies, pizzas, sushi and countless other foods found themselves flying into the shrunken detective's mouth all of which he greedily chewed ad swallowed. As soon as he though about something to drink, a large straw appeared next to him, which he placed in his mouth and took a large drink. A sweet, carbonated liquid flooded his mouth, the taste making him moan in satisfaction. He looked down and saw his bare chest, with his stomach having had expanded to the size of a small grapefruit. He shrugged and continued devouring the feast in front of him until he could open his mouth anymore. After that he sat back, happily drinking from the straw and the seemingly endless soda it was connected to<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder Genta loves eating so much...\" he thought lazily, burping loudly before he continued drinking \"This is amazing...\" Suddenly, the world around turned white, his straw dissperead \"No!\" he shouted, looking around for it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kudo-kun!\" he heard a familiar voice shout<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haibara?\" he asked out-loud as everything turned completely white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\" the seven year old groaned as he opened his eyes, seeing a strawberry-haired girl standing over him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back to the world of the living Kudo-kun\" she said sarcastically \"It seems the drug worked. Much better than I though it would\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It did?\" he asked, before looking down, gasping at his stomach. His stomach had inflated to the size of a small soccer ball, his arms and legs had puffed up slightly with fat. He couriosly poked his chubby belly and couldn't help but giggle at the sensation and kept poking it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hem hem\" Haibara's fake cough brought him back to reality \"Well, if your done, then get up. I need to look you over and make sure your healthy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Haibara declared him slightly overweight but otherwise healthy, thought he didn't tell her about his new fascination with food. She passed him some clothes made for his new chubby form. After leaving his skateboard and suspenders with the doctor, he set out into the streets, looking around for the kidnapper.</span></div></div>",

After entering the grassy area, he looked to the soccer field, intending to play a little while. As he made his way over he smelled something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot Dogs\" he mumbled, his bloated stomach grumbling loudly. Forgetting about the game, he walked over to the nearby cart, his stomach growling louder. When he got the cart, he looked at the man behind it. He was tall, thin with aqua colored eyes, a large smile on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\" the man said, his eyes looking all over Conan, fixating slightly on his belly \"What can I get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One hot dog please!\" Conan said childishly, handing over 350 yen. The man smiled as he grabbed the cash<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then\" the man said, grabbing a sausage and bread, quickly preparing the food, covering it in mustard and ketchup \"Here you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Conan said gleefully, immediately taking a bite out of it. The taste was heavenly, it was completely different from other hot dogs he'd had before. Ignoring the strange taste, he sat down on a nearby bench, and continued eating his treat. As he ate, the hot dog man sat down next to him, but said nothing. Conan ignored him, simply continued eating. As soon as he ate the last bite, he layed his head back and sighted happily, rubbing his tummy. He yawned and rubbed his eyes, a surge of lethargy overcoming him. Suddenly remembering the strange taste of the hot dog, he quickly looked at the vendor next to him before falling asleep.</span></div></div>",

I thought that would be locked\" he glanced at the door and read the plaque \"<i>Chubby</i>?\" looking around at the other doors, he saw the other plaques had a similar theme \"What the heck? <i>Pudgy; Portly; Plump; Tuby; Bulky</i>... The heck is with these names?\" heating footsteps, he dropped his glasses' hidden microphone, then crawled back in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Por, why can't we come in?\" he heard a young boy's voice whine<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know why Tub\" another boy's voice explained (Por, Conan guessed) \"He's sick\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you get to go in!\" Tub whined<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only leaving Chubby food\" Por explained, opening the door and leaving a tray on the floor \"Come on, let's go to my room. I have a bunch of snacks\" the other voice cheered as the two cut off. Conan waited a few minutes to make sure they were gone before getting up and walking towards the door. Glancing down, he saw a tray full of junk food, french fries; a large cheeseburger; a bowl of chocolate and a large glass of soda. There was also a note<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">Get well soon Chubby :)</div></b><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Signed: Pud; Por; Plum; Tub and Bulk</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Conan asked \"Are these the other kids? Why are they calling themselves that?\" the loud growling of his stomach broke him out of his thoughts. He glanced at the tray and drooled slightly at the sight of all the food \"Well, I'll do a quick taste test. If he wanted me dead, he would have done it while I was asleep\" he grabbed the burger and took a large bite, smiling when he didn't detect nything out of the ordinary. After eating all of the food, he sat on the floor and patted his stomach and burped loudly. Despite the lethargy of being full, he got up and explored the rest of the room he was in. He opened the closet, seeing nothing but short sleeved white t-shirts and boxer shorts. No socks, no shoes, nos sandals. Nothing except that \"Strange\" he kept looking, finding nothing of note expect a small fridge. After about an hour of searching, Conan got into bed and fell asleep, hoping that Agasa and Haibara would get here soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Conan fell asleep, a small speak at the top of the room came to life and began playing on a loop<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your safe here.

A few minuts later, Conan woke up, yawning and stretching his now fat body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess it's time to wake up.\" Conan mumbled to himself, getting up, looking over his seat soaked clothing. Shaking his head and glancing at the closet, he sighted and took off the clothes and opened the closet. \"I can't belive I'm gonna wear this.\" After a few minutes the blubbery boy looked at himself in a nearby mirror. The chubby seven year old had to admit to his shame, he actually felt pretty good dressed like this, wearing nothing but a white T-shirt and boxers. No socks, shoes pants or anything except his glasses. The boy's stomach growling loudly and, unlike last night no tray of food at the door. At first he tried to resist the urge, but eventually the hunger won out. Steeling himself, he opend the door and quickly slipped into the hallway. Now that is was daytime, he could see more details of it. The walls were painted a bright orange with large paintings  of old, very fat aristocrats, from the 17th century if Conan had to guess, he shook his head and ran ahead through the door and down the stairs behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConan walked on, seeing large amounts of doors. Before he could open one, a delisous smell entered his nose, making him smile and follow it, reachinhg a pair of large oak doors, and he could hear huge amounts of noise behind it. He reached out for the door, but hesitated right before turning the nob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing? This place is danger-\" he stopped talking and shook his head, a sense safety coming over him. Shruggin he opened the door and gasped at the sight before him. There was enormous oak table, filled with so mauch food and drink he could hear the legs creak under the weight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look, he's here!\" someone yelled, snapping him out of his trance, he saw five other kids around him. All of them fat, some more than others, from the age of 5 to 11. All of them wearing an ideantical outfit to his, nothing but a T-shirt and boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your up!\" the youngest boy squealed \"Awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Tub\" the one next to him said, who looked around 8 \"You don't wanna overwhelm him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Por's right\" a boy who looked around 10 said \"Let's welcome him back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome me back?\" Conan asked, interruping me \"Who am I back? I've never seen this place, nor have I met you before\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, sorry. He mentioned something like this might happen\" the oldest boy, a very fat 11 year old \"I'm Bulk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Plum\" the 10 year old said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Por\" the 8 year old said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Pud\" the 6 year old said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Tub\" the 5 year old said \"And we're your new brothers!\"</span></div></div>",

He wasn't looking at her due to personal interest, but about something he had discovered last weekend, at the end of another case<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \"And that is how you committed the murder Mr. Richards\" Conan spoke into his voice changer, his voice coming out as that of his honorary uncle, Kogoro Moure \"And Detective Takagi has already been given the evidece, so don't bother trying to argue your way out.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Damn it no!\" the blonde british man screamed as two officers placed handcuffs on him \"You son of a bitch!

Koga... why does that name sound familiar....\" his eyes snapped open as he remembered where he heard the name \"Ikumi! They want to kidnap her!\" quickly turning around, he called the inspector over and gave him the note.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunate, that's where his luck in this case ended. The inspector said that it was worth looking into and told him he would get back to Moure if he found something. For the next three days, Conan stayed up till the middle of the night, listening in on Moure's phone conversations and hadn't heard anything from the inspector. After that, he tried explaining it to Kogoro, only for the man to pick him up by the back of his shirt and toss him onto the couch, screaming at him to stay out of police business. With that as a dead end, he tried to go to Agasa and Ai, only to find them out of town for a conference out of town, with Ai leaving strick instructions not to enter her lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left him pretty much alone, since he felt that he couldn't share this with the other Detective Boys.

Follow him as he looks for a cure to get bigger and finds something totally different instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n-Weight gain equals main plot<br>\r\n-Plot+Details=Good Chapter<br>\r\n-Adult stuff allowed to a minimum <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Edit*<br>\r\n-Everything must be explained (i.e. if you're going to use magic or something, explain it's origin...akako would be a good explaination for this...). This would mean no gaining 30 lbs. just by eating for an entire day, no Conan suddenly getting the urge to gain weight, etc.<br>\r\n</td>",
