As she performs backstrokes from one end to the other, you can see her dripping-wet orange hair, her bright cerulean eyes, and glimpses of her white-and-blue swimsuit. She traverses around the pool with the sort of agility and grace that tells you that she knows exactly what she's doing. Given that the rest of the pool - and the whole building, for that matter - seems to be empty, you assume that she must be the owner. Does that mean she knows what happened to you...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou call out from the edge of the pool for her attention, but to no avail, as your small voice can't carry over that distance (and even if it could, the loud lapping of the water would surely drown it out.) She occasionally has to stop for a breather or for a stretch near the edge of the pool before she practices another swimming technique, so you could conceivably reach her if you waited for the right time and swam out to her, but given how deep the water is, it's far from a foolproof plan. Then again, you're not sure what else you could try to make her notice you...</span></div></div>",

You're a decent swimmer and can always float if it comes down to it, this may be your best bet of being spotted.  You wait with baited breath as her toned arms churn through the water like windmills, and sure enough they stop, but with a graceful movement she turns around and you see her legs pushing her away as she swims the opposite direction, causing you to step back as huge droplets of water rain down towards you with each of her kicks.  You wait for her as she reaches the other end of the pool, catching another glimpse of her determined face as she comes back around a second time...and then as she reaches your end she stops suddenly, stretching in the water, now's your chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leap off the edge of the pool and into the water, plunging into the drink.   Taking a gasp of air as you surface, you begin swimming towards the stationary giant, her orange hair like a beacon.

As a matter of fact, the feet occupying them are just as large, along with the legs they're attached to stretching up like literal moving towers. Your eyes continue to trail up as this giant approaches from afar, in a fashionable blue swimsuit and with orange hair that's glistening wet from her most recent adventure in the pool. Those cerulean eyes of her are focused on the phone in her hand, and not on the ground, where you are unfortunately placed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each booming step she takes towards, you debate what to do - at her size, she could very easily be dangerous, especially if she thought you were a bug or something. Then again, you don't much enjoy the idea of just scrounging around the pool alone like some wild animal. You are safely away from the path of her footfalls, but if you were going to stay with her and hope to grab her attention, you'd have to hop onto one of her feet as she passed.

Recklessly rushing into the woman's path as the slaps of her sandals begin to grow deafening.  You break out into a cold sweat as the giant's feet are nearly upon you!  As her right foot touches down a bit in front of you, you bolt towards it as fast as you can manage, leaping towards the relative salvation of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately you grip onto the white strap just above her toes, your legs scrambling to find safe footing, successfully pulling them between her index and middle toes.  Your clothes are instantly soaked by her wet skin, and you find yourself hurled face first against the top of her foot.  The huge slapping sound is now all you can hear, and as you look up to try and figure out if she's noticed you, you're disappointed to find that she's still absorbed in her phone, the world whizzing by at a ridiculous speed overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms begin to ache as they desperately hang onto the strap above your head, and you feel your heart skip a beat as with another mighty step the giant foot slams onto the ground, bumping you badly enough that you slip, quickly grabbing onto the gap between her big and index toes, now lying somewhat awkwardly wrapped like a discount toering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relatively huge woman unconciously clenches her toes in response, causing you to struggle helplessly.

There are certainly flowers, but these flowers are <i>huge.</i> There are tulips and roses and marigolds and daffodils and so many other vibrant flowers, ranging from white to red to gold to blue and so many other vibrant shades, but <i>man</i> are they huge. You aren't even as high as the stems, and you are lost in a field of these giant flowers. This is very unusual and frightening, and you can't imagine it getting any more unusual and frightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, are the flowers big or are you...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground trembles and the flowers shakes a little from the vibrations. You nearly lose your footing and trip as the tremors increase, growing closer in a steady rythym. They're almost like... footsteps? Terrified at the idea that you might be right, you hide amongst the thickest patch of flowers you can find and peek out through the petals. The footsteps grow and grow before they stop and a shadow blots out the giant's garden. The giant in question towers above you with her titanic size. She is garbed in a long yellow kimono with a maple leaf pattern around the hem, which ends just above her socked feet in traditional geta footwear. Looking higher and higher, you can make out her face, with her short black hair, her red headband and her calm brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kneels down, humming to herself and presumably unaware of your presence. She appears to be tending to her garden happily. You're not sure what to do in the presence of the giant. She seems gentle and kind, but you have no idea how she might react if she sees you or if she'll be kinder to her plants than you. As you try and decide on what to do, the heavy pollen of the vast array of flowers gets to you and you let out a loud sneeze.

She begins to heat water and set up tea-drinking equipment immediately - she seems to take this seriously. She begins to recite several orders to you, pointing to different teacups in the process, which you now notice are all named - she seems to take this <i>very</i> seriously.

There is the typical furniture, like a dresser and a wardrobe, and when you open them you find clothes (albeit they look and feel very amateur.) Deciding to look for more clues, you head out into the landing. It is a very narrow corridor, but it leads to another bedroom. It is practically identical to the last one you woke up in, but this one contains a large wooden sculpture of a man, standing in the corner with a blank eerie stare. It freaks you out a little and you leave, going downstairs. There is a living room, complete with more tacky fragile-looking furniture like a sofa and a table, and another large wooden mannequin - this one being a young boy. You check the other room and find that it's a kitchen. When you examine the cooker and the fridge more closely, you find that they are fake and there are no leads or lights on them. In fact, the food inside the fridge is also fake. The model of the woman also sits in the corner, staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's almost like this whole place is a dollhouse or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well,\" a powerful booming voice echos not just through the house, but through your own head, like it's coming through your mind. \"Look who's awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dart around, trying to find the source of the voice, and you find it. The window is now occupied with an enormous red eyeball, which blinks and squints at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt goes without saying that you are just about ready to freak out and faint on the spot, because you are now in a dollhouse and someone is outside looking in - and they do <i>not</i> look happy. You are just about to go through with the 'freak out and faint' plan when you feel the house itself shake and quake, making you lose your footing and trip. What on Earth can you do?! The rational part of you is saying that there's no point and you might as well be obedient to this giant woman - she might be easy on you if you're no trouble - but the more frightened part of you is saying that you should run and hide somewhere, or maybe you could even take a chance and run over and punch her in that huge blinking eye of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel the house shake more and more as she fiddles with the locks.

Your body was sore all over, and breathing the stale air underneath Sabrina's rump was not getting any easier. You knew if this kept up much longer, you rant he risk of suffocating to death.

You sank deeper and deeper into the cushion beneath you and the flesh of the behind above you, You heard Sabrina's voice again, but this time the words seemed to directly enter your mind not through your ears. She was contacting you telepathically this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I own you now.\"</i> Was all she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer point made clear, you rapidly felt the massive weight upon you dissipate, as Sabrina stood back up to her full height.

Sabrina telekinetically lifted you off the seat of her throne and carried you back down to the floor, placing you between her feet. The massive pink monoliths on both sides of you moved with grace unthinkable for something so big. Try as you might to run, you were too awe stricken by Sabrina's movements to do so much as budge an inch. Sabrina sat back down in her throne, and one at a time, removed her pink shoes and socks to reveal her gigantic feet. With a big toe, Sabrina pinned you to the floor, eliminating what little chance of escape you may have had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Your goddess demands tribute, plaything.\"</b> Sabrina decreed.

Confused you turn around to look at Sabrina. God she was huge. The playset was at her waist level yet her face still seemed looked miles away. You thought she was large before but geez, both of her eyes are big enough to literally get lost in, her nose a large hill with two monstrous caverns, her lips as long as highways...wait a minute. Why is she smiling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BOOM!</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour entire world shakes and you land on your face.

You lay your palms on the ground and push yourself up to a sitting position. You look around more and realize that the \"pink ceiling\" is really more of an arch. You get to your feet and turn around. You find yourself staring a huge pink column. Suddenly the entire arch starts to lift off, once it's lifted off the ground it starts to move backward. Eventually light comes flooding in and you find yourself staring up at the ceiling of Sabrina's room. So you weren't teleported or anything like that. You look forward and are finally given your answer. You watch as the previously inanimate doll sets her foot down right next to her other one. \"<b>You're a little too small for me to play with you personally, so I used my little friend here to fix that problem.

A sign that Sabrina's working her magic on it. The doll's lifeless eyes stare at you as it takes a small step forward. You take a small step back. You look around for any good places to run and hide. You see that the dollhouse you had woken up in earlier was still open from when Sabrina grabbed you. At your new size that could host a whole lot of hiding spaces. You look around some more and see Sabrina sitting there. If you could just get to her then you could probably jump onto her body, forcing her to stop the game.

You don't let your perverted thoughts slow you down though and double down on your sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a good distance away from the doll when a shockwave rumbles through the ground.

A small imperfection to anyone bigger but at your size it could be a hiding spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumblings get closer and you realize you only have seconds to hide. So you dash towards the whole in the tree and slide into it. Even at your size the hole is small enough that you have to crouch in order to fit.

You can imagine the doll moving it's plastic head around, looking in every direction for you. Eventually the doll leaves your sight and the rumblings get further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's your chance to get away.

As you continue to work as hard as you can to knead the giant's soles, your senses begin to adjust to the humid, lotion-filled air and you can just barely detect the underlying scent of the two bus-sized peds.  But your work abruptly comes to an end when a voice once again thunders through your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze immediately and look up at your master's red eyes.

All you need is to find a way out, you kept climbing until you were out of the show and jumped down landing on your butt. \"Oww\" You say as you stand up holding it, you closed your mouth worried if Sabrina heard you, you then hear light feminine snoring much to your luck. You sigh relieved and run for the opened door, you look back trying to see Sabrina was going to wake up, you can't see her on the bed but you do hear snoring so she must still be asleep, you turn around to see a plight of stairs, you sigh as you carefully climb down each one, you decided to be quick so your 'master' doesn't wake up should she be an early riser. You finally made it to the bottom of the stairs and releasing a huge sigh of relief that you are now only another doorway to freedom, hopefully you'll be able to sneak under the door and leave to find help. You then walk down the hallway on your way to freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the corner at the end of the hall, and hit something moist, smoothed and smelled of lotion. You look to see a very familiar set of feet, frightened you began to look up a towering set of legs, higher a slim waist, higher a modest bust until you see the red eyes of Sabrina actually glaring down at you. You give a frightened expression unsure of what to say, you try to turn around however a blue energy surrounds you keeping you in place, and your voice was still keeping you from trying to beg her not to hurt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina hid her anger well enough however inside she was furious, she thought she had found someone who'd make a wonderful pet, but instead like all the rest tried to run away. Furious she sends a telepathic message through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had hoped you already learned that you're mine, glad I teleported here.\" She boomed with a hint of anger withn you're mind, you wanted to hold your ears, but you couldn't move. It wouldn't do anything as you hear it from you're mind anyway, before her voice sounded like a god, now it sounded like an angry god. \"I knew you're obedience was too good to be true, so I devised this test to see your'e loyalty.\" You were shocked when you heard the word test, she knew you'd escape? \"That's right, I've read your mind, if you had stayed within your shoe you would have passed and I would reward you in the morning, however you being here means you failed this test and you will be judged.\" She told you within your mind, you started to regret running away if it meant she was going to give you special treatment but now instead. You see Sabrina lift her foot high above you, you wanted to move but couldn't as Sabrina's power still held you in place, you watch helplessly as Sabrina's foot comes down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*STOMP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were crushed flat, but weren't killed, and yet you feel a tremendous wait on you. And you were still conscious, how is that possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina heard this thought and sent a mental message. \"Don't be so surprised, I have made you indestructible when I shrunk you, however while indestructible, you will an impossible amount of pain no human can ever experience alive.\" The woman then lifts her foot up, with her telepathic abilities she presses you against her sole making it look like you were stuck to it, she then stomped the first stair causing you more tremendous pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to cry as she stomped her way up the stairs with you stuck on her sole, your face between your Master's biggest and second toes. When finally it stopped she lied down and then cloth surrounded you and her foot. It was a sock! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't escape this time Plaything, you're real punishment starts tomorrow, I can make it lighter than you deserve if you kissed my foot as I slumber.\" Sabrina's voice boomed in your mind. \"Good night Toy.\" She then cut off the telepathic link and went to sleep as she slumbered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided that you would not think about escaping as Sabrina stomped you up the stairs, you don't know what her real punishment will be, however you don't want to find out, you then puckered your lips and kissed her foot as the night went by, hoping that her punishment will not be so severe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she wakes up what will your punishment be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The giantess looks over the seemingly empty house, apparently unsure where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, you went to hide? Fine.\" She smiles, standing up. All you can see of her now is her legs - the dollhouse barely reaches her hips - and one of them bends up to hover out of view.

Things are still pitch black and the back of your head hurts, but you're relieved that you're alive. It seems like the chest you hid was very well made. Taking a moment to recover and a deep breath, you nudge the lid open and look outside. The chest is lying upside down, having fallen just outside the dollhouse. The two main sides of the house have two gaping holes through them, along with most of the walls missing. The giant certainly has a powerful stomp, as most of the furniture in the rooms were reduced to splinters and remains. Even the model people were caught in the demolision, limbs and fragments tossed around randomly in the chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl out and find that...</span></div></div>",

Unable to speak, unable to move, you could do nothing but float there helpless before the face of this psychic giantess as she began to contemplate your fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes you were made to wait as Sabrina thought of many possible punishments. With how small you were she could easily kill you, but that would be far to harsh a penalty for what was ultimately a harmless action. Perhaps she could place you inside her boot and force you to endure the rest of the day under her foot? No, there was simply too great a chance of her accidentally crushing you for that to be a viable option. After some time, she finally decided on a simple but effective punishment. One that would be relatively harmless but would still serve to get across the point that she was the one in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I've made my decision. You will be my slave for the rest of the day. I will have you do whatever menial tasks I can think of for me, and you will do them without question. If you complete your tasks well, you will earn my favor. However, for each task that you fail to complete, an additional day will be added to your punishment. If you do a good job, this can be over easily and painlessly. Oh, and one more thing.<i> DO NOT</i> attempt to escape. I'll tell you right now, you aren't getting away from me unless I decide to let you go. The only thing running will do is dig yourself into an even deeper hole. Do you understand me?\" Sabrina said, releasing the psychic seal on your mouth and allowing you to speak once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, I understand.\" You reply quickly, not wanting to anger this giant psychic any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. And that will be 'yes mistress' for the duration of your punishment, slave.\" Sabrina said with a satisfied grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes mistress, of course mistress.\" You reply, still incredibly nervous. If Sabrina's psychic powers weren't keeping your body locked in place, your would definitely be shaking like a leaf right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. It's time for your first task.

You look around and see you are in some sort of enormous cage or hatch - you're surrounded by hatched wire walls and there's certainly a large door that's locked by a catch on the outside. You're obviously wondering why you are in some sort of enormous cage or hatch when you turn around and nearly die of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a <i>huge</i> bird. It's easily the biggest animal you've ever seen and while it was sleeping, it has now awoken and its head has now tilted in your direction. You freeze on the spot, hoping that those hungry eyes will ignore you if you stay still, but slowly the enormous creature shuffles over. It caws at you, and it's pretty much confirmed that the 'stay still' strategy isn't working. You run to the wired walls and try to claw your way through, but you can't fit through the holes and the wire is too tough to get rid of. The bird shuffles closer, looming over you, and its beak opens and shuts, its tongue writhing in anticipation. You close your eyes and wait for the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pidgey? Is something wrong?\" A voice calls out. The bird pauses, looking in the direction of its master. You open your eyes and join in the looking. A young man has walked over and is now looking through your prison. He has dark blue hair, his fringe flicked over his right eye, while his left eye scans around in its deep blue. He is wearing a light blue vest over a blue shirt, and you can see the name 'Falkner' written on one of his armbands, but you can't see anything else from your viewpoint. He has blotted out the light and the giant has cast a shadow over you, making you even more frightened than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?

You peek around the edge just as a huge pair of black and purple shoes slam down ahead of you, nearly knocking you off balance with their huge tremors. The man himself is dressed in white trousers and a black coat, along with a long purple scarf and a purple headband. It is wrapped around his soft blonde hair and above his dim violet eyes. He looks around the charred remains, before bowing and apparently meditating. As the giant shuts his eyes and hangs in the silence, you wonder what to do...</span></div></div>",

Standing by his feet, you look up and you are even more intimidated than before - it's like the Statue of Liberty, except moving and possibly violent.

You immediately jump off the key once you realize what it is, not wanting to create any sound that the titan would notice, and actually land at the bottom this time.

Your heart pounds against your chest as you rethink your decision to scale this behemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light is blocked by the pocket briefly closing, and for a moment, you feel safe. Maybe he didn't see you, or mistook you for something else. But no, this wasn't the case; as soon as you feel safe, the feeling is ruined by a hand reaching in, and it was coming fast. You back up, but that's cut short too, this time by a feeling of warmth at your back. Turning your head, you realize that this warm feeling is coming from one of Morty's fingers -- no, one of his fingertips. And once again, your thoughts are cut off by that same warmth pressing against your front, this time from his thumb. As you're being held, you think of how small you must be to be dwarfed by a fingertip and shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel another sudden movement, and this time it's you being pulled out of your hiding spot. You can't really see much of anything, other than the skin of the thumb that's pressing upon your entire body, until you're eventually dropped. You scream, thinking this is going to kill you, but you land safely with a slight bounce. The sudden light change forces you to blink rapidly, until you get used to the light after a couple seconds. In these short moments, you realize that you're now sitting in the titan's open hand, being looked down at by said titan, and he was curious. You weren't sure whether that was good or bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing,\" was the first thing he said about you. Though it was a whisper, the calm and eerie tone was unsettling, causing another instinctive tremble as you shut your eyes. Maybe if you two were about the same size, you wouldn't be quite as scared of this man, but that wasn't the case, now, was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be so afraid, you know. I'm not going to hurt you.\" You open your eyes once more, and you see a calm, gentle smile on his face. To tell the truth, you honestly didn't expect this, someone that seems to care about an infinitesimal being. You do fear this is a ruse, of course, considering that anyone powerful who wanted to gain trust would say that. Also, the way his voice is just gives off the feeling of someone who can't be trusted, giant or otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scramble back, but you hit a wall created by his fingers -- he'd cupped his hand to make sure you didn't fall. And speaking of hands, what you failed to notice until just now was his other one, right next to you, with only the index finger extended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your fear, but really, you have nothing to worry about. Reassurance aside, I believe we should introduce ourselves before anything. My name's Morty. And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou might have to trust Morty, although you were trying to avoid confrontation until you knew it was safe. Still, you don't feel at ease with this man whatsoever -- you just might start crying in fear soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you put your fears aside, at least for now?</span></div></div>",

Among the furniture is a bed, with a very stern and powerful looking metal frame yet a very soft and fluffy mattress, and other standards like a wardrobe and bedside table. On the table is a large metal display case, which looks like it was forged over a thousand years and completely unbreakable, yet has several valuable looking jewels and decorations inside, all of them sparkling and happy. Through the window you can see a large lighthouse in the distance. You yourself are in the middle of the room, trapped in a field of grey carpet. As most people would, you freak out over the situation for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour freak out is put on hold, however, as you hear footsteps coming from the mountainous door. Someone's coming!

Otherwise... who knows how many other fellow victims wound up shrunken down and lost in this adventure?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagnemite gave an expression that seemed like a tired sigh.<br>\r\n\"M-maybe I'm just a little sick!\" she assured herself, \"y-yeah that's... that's it! Sp...sparkle's sick! M-m-maybe I just caught her cold, that's all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaggg....\" Magnemite rolled it's eye and floated off, probably giving Jazz her 'personal space'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not crazy!\" Jasmine kept telling herself as she sweated, \"I'm not going mad!

She was shaking so much you were worried you were gonna fall out of her hand and then all that stuff in the first paragraph would come to fruition!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of words to say at the moment, she just bit her lip and set you carefully down on a nearby desk. You thanked your creator over and over for such mercy as Jasmine started pacing back and forth across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis has got to be a dream,\u201d she tells herself, \u201cthis has to be a dream! There's no other logical explanation for this!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Jasmine, I-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I'm just dreaming!\u201d she interrupts you and tells herself, \u201cI'm fast asleep.

What were you thinking?\u201d she keeps ignoring you, \u201cyou actually thought there were little people in your room? Ha ha! Dont be silly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldnt frown any harder than you were already doing at the moment. Youre in bigger trouble than you thought. Not only does it seem your new colossal friend isnt gonna help you, SHE seems beyond help! Now you cant help but question if she mentally snapped! Heck,  you even wonder if she snapped so bad that she mightve actually IMAGINED the other little people! If not, you feel incredibly bad for your fellow liliputians that had the displeasure of meeting her and didnt live to tell the tale!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello little guy! What's your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you noticed Jasmine is smiling down at the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you, Nathan! I'm Jasmine! I'm Olivine City's gym leader in the real world!\u201d she had a sudden change in her mood now that she believes herself to be in a dream. You raised your eyebrow. Was she talking to another shrunken person like yourself?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right, Nathan! I'm the Steel-type pokemon gym leader of the Johto League!\u201d she nonchalantly introduced herself, \u201c...sorry, but I think youre a little small to be pokemon battling with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJasmine? Who are you talking to?\u201d she peaked your attention so much, you couldnt help but wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it's another tiny person like you!\u201d Jasmine happily answered, \u201chang on a second. Nathan, hop in my hand, I'd like you to meet [Hunter]. Dont worry, it wont hurt.\u201d She carefully scooped something off the ground and carefully cupped it in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNathan, meet [Hunter]. [Hunter], this is Nathan!\u201d she opened her palm and presented to you...</span></div></div>",

She had taken to give a pathetic mewling whimper from time to time, her previous panic settling down into a no less miserable to her, but far less dangerous state of mind for you and Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine just lay there in a heap, refusing to get up as she seemed to accept the fact she was (actually wasn't) crazy.

Sadly, it was because she was spending too much time burying her face in the carpet while crying her eyes out in mumbled sobs. Granted, you felt really really bad for her and you couldnt quite possibly imagine what she's going through right now. Then again, could SHE possibly imagine what YOURE going through?! ...and what youre about to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ear lobe was soft and squishy, but made for easy gripping as you climbed up it and made your way into the dark damp cavern that led to the ear canal. It felt awfully invigorating and uplifting just making that brave, courageous climb into that colossal mentally broken crybaby's ear. But then as soon as you took one step into the cave, your courageous demeanor vanished without a trace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nerves shot look after taking too much of a big glance of this hellish abyss you willingly climbed in. It was much less a dark damp cave and much more like the belly of a wormlike alien! The soft slimy hairy organic walls pulsated rhythmically as yellowish puss squirted out of each crevice. Some of that yellow puss had already hardened and caked the soft filthy floor youre walking on. You could hear a faint whistling noise coming from the distance that leads to the ear drum, but you dare not go any further in out of some fear the walls would close behind you and you'd be stuck inside Jasmine's ear forever!<br>\r\n...Then you thought that if the inside of her ear was scary, imagine being inside her mouth! Let alone being trapped inside her gigantic stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow hard and remember that youre not alone. Nathan's here with you and he aint nearly as panicky as you are. If he can keep a strong spine in the face of danger, so can you. You remember the plan and to stick by it. It seemed like a rather dumb plan after thinking twice about it, but HE's got confidence, so why question it, eh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Follow his lead,' you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear child\u2026 please dont cry...\u201d Nathan's soft sympathetic and faux-prominent whisper echoed even in the chamber you were in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine flinched lightly, but to you it was a big enough earthquake to cause you to lose your balance. She lifted her face from the carpet and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW...who said that?\u201d Jasmine timidly questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did, dear child,\u201d Nathan whispered, \u201cwipe away those tears. You are not crazy.\u201d Sure enough, this jump starts this stressed out gym leader. She gets up and looks around for the source of the voice.<br>\r\n\u201cW-W-who are you?\u201d she called out, \u201cand where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am everywhere, dear child,\u201d Nathan answered, \u201cfor I am\u2026 thine overseer. Thine maker and thine molder. Thine Almighty.\u201d ...The hell?! He's pretending to be the voice of God?! He never said anything about doing that!<br>\r\nBut sure enough, Jasmine gasped, Y\u2026.you mean\u2026. youre Arceus?!\u201d<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes for a moment and youre pretty sure Nathan did too before he answered, \u201c...Sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-wait!\u201d she got skeptic, \u201cp-prove it!\u201d<br>\r\nAnd Nathan did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarukh attah Adonai eloheinu melekh ha'olam, yotzeir 'or uvorei choshek 'oseh shalom uvorei et hakol.\u201d he answered with a Hebrew prayer as proof that he was God. Damned if anyone knew how exactly that counts as concrete proof!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*GASP!*\u201d but apparently it was concrete proof enough for Jasmine! \u201cForgive me my Lord!\u201d You flew and hit the waxy ceiling cuz she quickly bowed!  \u201cI meant you no disrespect when I doubted you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease lift your head my child,\u201d Nathan spoke softly.<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d and again you hit the ceiling when she quickly stood back up! Youre gonna need to bathe in Purell to get all this gunk off you.<br>\r\n\u201cDo not fret an inkling, my child,\u201d it was amazing how Nathan kept his cool on his side while on YOURS, it's\u2026 yuck! \u201cye need maintain thine sharpest composure for the pressing matter I present to thou.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could imagine beaming up hearing that. \u201cA\u2026 pressing matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe tiny ones you have encountered,\u201d Nathan continued, \u201cthey were of no mere illusion. They are indeed real. And they are in dire need of your help. You, oh brave fierce courageous Steel gym leader of Olivine, have been chosen worthy of such a task!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW...wow...\u201d she sounded a bit pressured, \u201cI\u2026 I never thought the great Arceus thought so highly of me.\u201d It was incredible how Jasmine was hanging on to every word that was coming out of the mouth of that tiny little speck in her other ear! She'd probably believe him if he told her she could fly if she simply climbed to the roof of her Gym and leaped off! Either she's that mentally vulnerable at the moment or Nathan is just THAT good a salesman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock knock knock* But just as opportunity came knocking, so did the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJasmine?\u201d said the voice from the other side of the door, \u201cyou have a challenger for a badge.\u201d Oh right. She has a day job after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell them to cancel,\u201d Nathan whispered.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? B-But I cant cancel a Gym battle. It's against the Regional Code of Conduct!\u201d Jasmine, despite being shellshocked from the voice of God in her ear was still a Gym Leader through and through.<br>\r\n\u201cThy task thou has been given is of much greater importance.\u201d Nathan attempted to persuade her.<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 the last time I took time off for my Sparkle to recover, I was almost fired,\u201d she whispered back.<br>\r\n\u201cDoes thou defy my order?\u201d Nate turned up the heat.<br>\r\n\u201cN...No\u2026 b-but...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen do as thou art instructed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, if you were Jasmine, even just as shaken up, you'd probably think something fishy was going on by now. Thinking that, you have a feeling Nathan's getting close to screwing up.<br>\r\nNah, maybe youre just overthinking it. Of course, he's got this in the bag! Why would you doubt this guy after coming so far this whole... minute and a half?</span></div></div>",

You were extremely high off the ground and not held very tightly in her palm. If you so much as struggled,you'd plunge to your death!<br>\r\nEven worse, you almost lost your balance when she opened her palm and brought you up close to her face! Her huge, wide eerily smiling, eye-lid enlarged face! You ran out of willpower now! You want your mommy!<br>\r\nRoy <br>\r\n\"Sorry, [Hunter],\" she apologized, \"but this is MY dream! And you, Nathan, Alex, Samantha, Roy, Roy II, and Wanda have special arrangements in my dream.\"<br>\r\n\"Sp-special...\" you shivered, trying hard to look down, \"...a..arrangements?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Jasmine nodded, \"you and your friends have just been invited to Jasmine's special hotel and beach resort! Where only the VIP are allowed to stay at completely free of charge.\" Nonsense and more nonsense! When will this end?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOH, BUT IT GETS BETTER. MUCH BETTER. Obviously not for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You first, Nathan,\" Jasmine plucks the imaginary little person off her palm... and tosses him in her mouth.

That's how it's so secret!\" She honestly said that. She's gonna eat you simply because she thinks her dream is THAT bizarre!<br>\r\nAs she swallowed Wanda, you froze up with fear. Your only way to escape was to jump off her palm but it was a long way down and your fear of heights wasnt helping in this situation. Shame your instincts didnt register that you were about to experience a worse fate than the risk of falling to your death!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, that just leaves you [Hunter],\" she picks your tiny little body from your palm and raises it toward her mouth, \"I'll be sure to tell the staff to leave a mint on your pillow!\"<br>\r\n\"No no no no NONONONONO!!!!!!\"</span></div></div>",

The water leaps up at the rocks you are on but thankfully they don't reach you. You look out at the 'lake' and the steam seems to clear, showing you what caused the enormous waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a woman - a giant woman, impossibly large in comparison to you. She has long fiery red hair, let down and now wet in the steaming water. She is garbed in a black bikini, with a flame symbol printed on her bra. Her skin is a dark warm tan and as she sighs, sinking into the warm water, her eyes open and you can see that they are just as bold and red as her hair. You figure that this is merely a steam bath for this giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge woman sighs again, relaxing and sinking a little further in the water. She apparently doesn't know of your presence as she kicks her legs out and rests her feet on the edge of the bath, nearly slamming them on you. You flinch and fall backwards, now aware of how easy it would be for this woman to end your life - whether she's trying to or not. You spend a moment trying to calm yourself down and figure out what to do. You could try and contact her, either by making your way across her body or maybe taking advantage of the feet she has now planted next to you.

You instinctively struggle, hoping that she isn't planning to snuff out your life so easily, but luckily she seems to keep away from too much pressure - just enough to make sure you stay where she can find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand rocks in senseless directions as your captor presumably leaves the hot bath and gets herself dressed (doing so without unclenching her fist - she must be quite dexterous) and after some more worrying vibrations that you soon realize to be the giant merely walking, the hand opens up once more and you're flooded with light and the visage of the red-haired giantess, looking down at you with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you can give me a hand?\" The giant suggests. \"If you do, I'll tell you what's going on. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel that you should give this girl a piece of your mind - that you'd rather have those answers now, instead of later - but as you consider it, her smile widens to a grin and she displays her pearly white teeth for you. Whether she meant to or not, she reminded you of just how small you are - you are quite literally bite-sized right now, and you would not want to anger the red-eyed giant, just in case she is feeling particularly hungry right now. Swallowing your dignity in the hopes that she won't swallow you, you agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Now, there's something wedged around here...\" She opens her mouth and points inside, giving you a full view of her colossal maw. Hot breath swamps over you as she splays out her large tongue, in some attempt to help you see what she's pointing at. However, to you, it's just murky darkness with an unpleasant surprise at the end. She closes her mouth. \"It's, like, something sharp at my back tooth, and I can't reach it! Can you get it out for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you really do want to openly object, perhaps to suggest a better plan or a safer alternative. However, this giant teenager doesn't even wait for a response before widening her jaw once more and unceremoniously dumping you inside her mouth. You land with a splat on her tongue, which quivers and flexes at your touch. You begin to panic, looking back towards your exit, but the giant has blocked it off with her hand, leaving only just enough room between her fingers to give you some light. You stand unevenly on the pulsating muscle that is her tongue, being careful not to fall and trip into a face full of saliva, as an abundance of it pools around your feet and drips from the 'ceiling.' Like the girl and her surroundings, it makes you hot under the collar, as her breath circulates around her mouth, overflowing with humidity, like a desert wind. You can even detect a hint of something spicy, which makes you wrinkle your nose as it hits you hard with every breath, but it's hardly the most important thing on your mind right now. Tentatively, you step across her large tongue towards the back of her mouth. She was truthful enough about it being time to wash her mouth - you can see bits of peppers and chilli still caught amongst her molars, but none of them seem sharp or painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just hope that it was an honest request, and not some ruse to get you into the ideal position for a bathtime snack...</span></div></div>",

Her tongue quivers up and down rhythmically as she chuckles at your naivety. In a panic, you start to run back towards her shut lips, in hopes that you could maybe squeeze your way out somehow, but her slobbery tongue proves to be difficult terrain and you slip on its saliva-coated surface. Flannery silently chuckles again, her tongue seizing up and down more viciously now as she can feel your pitiful attempts to flee. The tongue sloshes from side to side, coating you all over as Flannery seems to taste you, and after a few terrifying moments of being probed by the enormous muscle, she seems to deem you worthy of being her snack. The whole cavern that is her mouth tilts diagonally, and while you grasp for something to hold onto, only the blubbery tongue can be reached - and its wet softness proves too awkward for you to cling to. You slide straight down into her throat, and you feel a rush of humid air and choking heat as you tumble downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlannery swallows her unsuspecting snack, a little upset at the lack of spice but otherwise pleased with the unique taste.

It's quite a way but you're convinced you can make it to the ground. As you survey your path down, you finally notice where you are. The ground below is made of wooden planks and the walls - far away on the horizon - look like those paper-like walls you see in Japanese films. It's some sort of spa house.

You would guess several minutes at least, but without a watch or a sky, you can't really tell the time. You can't tell if you were knocked out for a minute or two, or a couple of hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally managing to get to your feet, you look around. Without the sounds of bubbling water and giggle above the rock formation looming over you, you can guess the steam bath spa is empty and the giantess has left. Around you is an enormous plain of wooden planks, along with a gigantic screen door in the distance. The architecture looks like a simple home from a Japanese film or game or something. With nowhere else to go, you head forwards in hopes of finding some help or shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you are halfway across the wooden plain, you hear something thunderous approaching, and the ground seems to creak and ground. A tremendously tall shadow appears in the screen door, and it opens to reveal the bathing giant from earlier, now clad in a bathrobe. You're not sure why she came here - perhaps she forgot something? - but as she focuses on straightening out her still-wet hair, she begins walking across the room, shaking the ground with each booming step.

You feel a tremendous weight slam on you with a thud, and for a moment, you close your eyes and grit your teeth as you imagine the awful death you've just had and start wondering if there's an afterlife (and if so, if everything will be giant there too.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, this is a question for another day, as you draw a breath and realize you're still alive. Unluckily for you, that breath draws in a distinct musk, mixed with smushed dirt and wet grass. You feel something very smooth and warm weighing down on the top of your body, and something similarly smooth but much cooler beneath you, as you are compressed between the two. You open your eyes to see nothing but brown, two shades distinct - an earthly dark brown and a gentler caramel shade. You spot an enormous grassblades pressing against your face, and you vaguely notice a few large wrinkles in the parts with the lighter shades. You finally realize what exactly is on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the undignified position you find yourself in, you're at least glad that you survived. Perhaps the softness of the giant's sole and the wet moldable muddy ground cushioned the impact and saved you. Or maybe you're invincible or something (which would also explain why the impact didn't even knock you out or hurt all that much.) Either way, you intend to squirm or dig free in some way, when the foot weighing down on you twists side to side, causing some serious discomfort and plastering you even more against the sole as Phoebe grinds you, in some attempt to finish off the bug she thought she had already got. You're so thick in dirt now that you can't even move. How could things get any worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that very cue, Phoebe decides she got the little pest and begins walking again. To your surprise and severe worry, you feel air rush against your back for a brief moment, and you realize that you're being carried along for the ride. The no-doubt rather-arduous and terribly-painful ride. The movement halts for a fraction of a second, and you grit your teeth again as the foot slams back down into the soggy ground. You survive again, but <i>damn</i> that knocks the wind out of you. It's beginning to hurt, too. It seems you just lucked out on the first stomp, and now you're about to be stomped over and over again for what could be hours on end. In some attempt at escape during her next step, you try to wriggle free, but all the dancing has caked the dirt clinging to her sole - you might as well be trying to free yourself from clay (which might seem easy, except that you're also being trampled by a woman the size of the Statue of Liberty, which makes it a little harder than it sounds.) Her foot slams into the earth again and your head rolls around in dizziness and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also remember you're on a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attempt to curse aloud is cut short as Phoebe takes another step, silencing you as you are sandwiched between her foot and the mud once more. This is going to be a <i>long</i> ride.</span></div></div>",

Confused, you stand up and realise where you are. Books the size of cars are scattered around on a wooden field that appears to be a gigantic desk. A lamp hangs overhead, towering above and glaring down at you like a spotlight on the tiny creature it has found. Empty glasses and writing pens lay scattered around your new world, but they are hidden amongst the piles and piles of books. The room beyond this desk is hard to see from your perspective, though you can tell the walls are lined with a purple wallpaper with a fancy decorative pattern - most of it, however, is hidden as most of the walls are covered in bookshelves. All of the bookshelves look fit to burst with the massive amount of books they are burdened with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door, seemingly miles away, clicks. Someone is coming! You quickly throw yourself behind a pile of books before the door swings open. You peek around just the slightest bit to see the giant owner of the giant desk. It is a tall man, fairly young and rather tall and skinny. His skin is a bit pale, suggesting that he doesn't see much daylight. He has purple hair that waves as he walks and his purple eyes are shaded behind his rounded glasses. He is wearing a very fancy and spotless crimson suit and equally clean black shoes. He seems to scan the room for a second and you hide behind the pile of books again. Satisfied that he is alone, he walks over and sits down at the desk, nearly making you leap back in fright as he reaches for the pile of books... and picks the one on the top, opening it and humming as he buries himself into the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're unsure what to do. You could reveal yourself but you have no idea how this man could react - he could be freaked out or hostile. You could stake it out and wait until he leaves or does something else, but you don't know how long he'll be reading (though judging by the surroundings, it might be a very long time.) Lastly, you could try and sneak away before he can find you, but it will be difficult to escape without being seen from his prowling eyes above you.</span></div></div>",

Confused and lost, you decide to venture out and see where you are. After a moment of travelling towards a large opening of light, you make it out from under the wooden 'ceiling' and see where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a room. An <i>enormous</i> room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls and ceiling are infinitely far away, making you feel like an insect in the giant room. At any rate it seems to be the only room in the house as indicated by the single door and windows, suggesting that it's a villa or a bungalow of some kind. You were under a large bed the whole time. Out on the horizon, you can see the other towering furniture, including a writing desk, a bookshelf, a fridge, a television, and other various items that don't seem important but remind you of your tiny size. You are deathly afraid of your situation, but even more so of meeting the gigantic owner of this villa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on cue, you hear something clicking at the monumental door. It's someone unlocking the door. You retreat straight back to beneath the bed where you can't be seen in the shadows. The door clicks some more and opens. You hold your breath in suspense and wonder if it is just your overly wild imagination, but just as you start to relax, a series of tremors run across the floor - footsteps - and an enormous black boot slams down ahead of you by the bed. You can't help but shriek in panic from the giant's step, along with the second boot slamming down next to the other, sending another shockwave through the wooden floor. The giant pauses for a moment and you are afraid that she might have heard you.</span></div></div>",

You leap into the darkness, holding your breath in suspense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's head blots out most of the light but you can still make out her features.

(The giant spike in its chest is also a dead giveaway.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario doesn't seem to be interested in you, darting its eyes around the vacant room and sniffing ever-so-slightly, presumably to pick up some trace of where its Trainer has gone.

You figure that it's going to leave you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as that thought crosses your mind, its eyes lock onto you. Its eyes seem vacant for a moment, and you remember that Lucarios can sense the auras of other beings, typically to tell if another creature is friendly or hostile.

The end spreads outwards and comes down on you again, catching your face in a net of sweaty nylon while you feel soft but implacable toes clenched down on either side of your body; they squeeze you mercilessly, causing a scream to become lost in your throat as the salty taste of her pantyhose assaults your mouth.  This is the worst!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the best!  Cynthia had been worried that something hard had gotten into her boots, but whatever it was was soft but firm, and actually felt great against her toes.  She decided it wasn't a big deal that it was in there, on the contrary it was kind of fun.  Giving a satisfied giggle she headed out for her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar above you hear a faint giggle, almost immediately followed by chaos.  Your entire world rushes up and back, then shifts down again, landing with a shrill booming noise, The ball of her foot leans in against you as her toes forcefully press you down into the soft ground, and then the process repeats.  You realize that the giant is walking now.  It abruptly stops, and you hear the jingle of keys above you.  Before you can take in some deep breaths her toes scrunch up, pressing your face forcefully into the ball of her foot, eliciting another contented sigh as the titan enjoys the comfortable sensation of some insignificant object forced against her foot.  As you hear the creaking of an opening door the rhythmic swinging of her walk continues, your hair becoming damp from the sweat that is begininning to leak through her pantyhose, coughing as the intense scent of her foot increases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou startle awake as the toes begin to retreat away from you.  How long had you been out?  How long had you been conscious through that miserable event?  As the black nyloned toes retreat from view, they give one last wiggle, as if wishing you farewell.  For a moment you breathe deeply, trying not to think of how sore you are, and how sore you'll be tomorrow.  You feel the room lurch upwards, and gravity shifts as you roughly slide down the fluffy boot leg, some slight carpet burn added to your list of injuries.  You fall onto an even softer surface, a pale white, and your nose greedily takes in the fresh air.  You nervously look up as you realize you are in the giant's palm, the awesome being looking down at you with an unreadable expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tiny person!\"  She booms, her voice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It still manages to reach your ears and coax you into consciousness, and you open your eyes. You're not in your room anymore. It takes a bit of time to get up, but soon you are on your feet and it's only when you are standing and fully awake that you realise where you are. It's shocking to you but soon enough you can't deny the truth before your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a dressing room. A <i>big</i> dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room has black wallpaper with bright yellow rims around the ceiling and the door, which has a single star and the word <i>'Elesa'</i> printed proudly in the center. The carpet seems to be very rich and possibly velvet, yet it is a bright electrifying yellow. All around the room there are huge posters of several fashion models, but most of them focus on a blonde woman with blue eyes. The furniture in the dressing room is typically all about the costumes and makeup. You yourself have somehow wound up on the makeup table, with an enormous mirror towering behind you, reflecting the mess of lipstick, brushes and other tools of the trade scattered around you, seemingly massive to your size (which you measure to be about two inches, give or take.) There are cupboards and dressers and coathangers also around the room. There are several pairs of thick techno-esque headphones, yellow high heels and other items.The whole room represents its owner; a bright woman who loves the spotlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a while to grasp the situation and get over the shock, but eventually the droning noise from far away dies out and you realize what it was; an audience.The audience has stopped and that means the show is over, and that means the show's star is coming back! What should you do? You can hang about on the dressing table and get her attention, but you have no idea how she will react - she might freak out, or maybe she'll be violent! You could perhaps find somewhere in the room to hide and see what's she like before you try getting her attention. Then again, you could always just run away - surely someone else must be around to tell you what the hell is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear footsteps from afar. She's coming back. You'll have to decide quickly!</span></div></div>",

She hums the music from her performance and sits down at her dressing table, reapplying the makeup that got ruined by that awful glaring spotlight, taking off some of the less successful accessories from the modelling, and nodding to the tiny person on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElesa stops. The two of you just stare at each other, shocked at the impossible situation you are both locked in.

A darkness was covering you; had you been out you long that it was apparently nighttime?  Then again, even nighttime wasn't pitch-black, you couldn't even see ten feet (by your standards) in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began walking, your feet rustling through some thin, brush-like material.  Grass?  No, it wasn't grass.  It actually felt a lot more like... felt?

From the limited light, you could tell that it was silver, and quite a bit bigger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked around the side of the wall, running a hand along the cold siver.

Had that woman put you inside her make-up kit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed and ran away, not caring what you tripped over.  Looking up at the sky, you could see that you were trapped, and when you hit up against the side, your felt prison would not give way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out!  Let me out, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collapsed against the wall, pondering what to do next.</span></div></div>",

You remember your name, you know you were a Pokemon Trainer out to join the Unova League, and you had a dream of battling one of the Elite Four, possibly even having a chance encounter with the Champion, too. Then one day, while on Route 9, you encountered a Gothitelle while she tried to cross the road. You were ready to catch it with your faithful Pokemon companion while the Astral Body Pokemon was channeling her Psychic abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then... nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, for Arceus knows when, you woke up with the most powerful headache in your life since that tetanus shot's aftereffects eight years ago. With your vision trying to focus into a dim darkness, you've felt something underneath your hands. It was cool, soft, silky. It felt like a blanket. Had someone found you lying in Route 9 and brought you here to rest? You couldn't tell. Although, there was some breathing somewhere in this room. It sounded so feminine. Maybe she was the one who picked you up and brought her here. The only question was, who was it, and where are you now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you blink your eyes a few times and look around the room, you notice that it was different somehow. Like everything was bigger then you normally hoped. Were you sleeping on a queen-sized mattress? Is this place a warehouse storage facility? What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look around, you turn your head, and suddenly your heart leaps to your throat. Lying down behind you was the figure of a colossal human, bigger than the smallest Wailord, lying on her side facing you, and snuggled up to her pillow. You jump back, skitter to the edge of the now-gigantic mattress and tried to scream, but no voice came out. You were in complete shock. Was this giant girl, born a giant, took you to a top secret base underneath Unova!? Or maybe that Gothitelle shrunk you to the size of a Joltik!? Either way, this was wrong on so many levels! There was no way that he was shrunken down to size and somehow teleported onto that giantess's bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat strangely familiar giantess's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've seen this girl before. When your eyes fully adjusted to the dark, you could make out the dim outlines of the girl's figure. She had light brown skin with that oversized dark violet hair. Her dress, cream colored with that enormous pink skirt tied off at the waist in a bow. And those white, open-toed sandals, flickering with every unconscious wiggling of her toes. You knew this girl from somewhere. You try and think, what was the name of the Champion, again? The Champion was a young girl, she beat the previous Champion, and she was a former Gym Leader of the Opelucid City Gym. Her name was named after a flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it Daisy? No, that wasn't it. Rose? Uh-uh. She didn't look like a rose. It certainly isn't Daffodil, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris? Yes! Yes, that was it! Iris, the Dragon Pokemon Trainer and current Champion of the Unova League! She's the most famous Trainer in the League! You've always wanted to battle the Champion ever since you've set off on your journey, and what an amazing coincidence that he was appearing as an insignificant bug before a dark-skinned goddess like her! You just needed to get her attention, first. If this was really a dream, or if you've actually been shrunken down, then you needed to somehow wake Iris up. You knew deep down that the Champion would help any Trainer in need. Now you had a choice to make: Should you touch her feet (the closest body part next to you), or do you climb over her body and yell in her ear?</span></div></div>",

You soaked in the colors of Iris's light ebony skin, her tan toenails to contrast the color of her skin, the white sandals to hold them together. As Iris took a deep, nasally breath, her toes scrunched up a little, making a shuffling, rubbing noise in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea why you didn't move, but any psychological test would indicate that he was being aroused by the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Iris's left foot uncrossed from on top of the right foot and gently set itself down behind her right foot, snapping you out of her thoughts. You suddenly remember; this was no time to experience puberty for the first time, this was the time to get yourself unshrunken, dream or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further delay, you walk up to Iris's right foot. A pleasant scent wafted into your nostrils, like an herbal foot cream mixed with moisturizing lotion. You didn't know what the actual smell of irises were, but if you did, this would be the only scent of Iris that you didn't want to forget. You reached out to touch the soft, delicate foot skin and rubbed it ever so gently. With the gentlest touch, Iris's foot suddenly wriggled, making it's giant owner moan a little in her sleep. You touched the surface of the skin, and the foot began to move back as the littlest sensation of your fingers made Iris...</span></div></div>",

You're grabbing onto her large tongue, almost pressing yourself against the soft wet muscle so that you won't fall down. It seems to quiver at your touch, as Caitlin subconsciously tastes you on her palette. Rows of pearly white teeth line around above you, and the outside world taunts you through the mouth-shaped hole above you.

At your size it'd be extremely difficult (not to mention dangerous) just to get to the floor- then, you have no idea where you are. She could live by herself and you'd have to trek possibly miles before you could find another person. And then you wouldn't probably have another chance at one that's calmly sleeping and easy to approach. That's not even getting onto how to get people to notice you from the ground. No, there were just too many things that could go wrong. This was your best chance at being noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few deep breaths and begin to mentally prepare yourself for what you're about to do. You want to do this right; with just a flick of her foot the wrong way she could squish your frail little body like a bug under her pretty sole without even waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gulp</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did bugs live like this again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning over a few choices in her head, you decide it'd be safest to get attention from your current location- it'd be easier for her to notice you near her face, but it'd take too long to trek, and there's no body part more sensitive to irritation than the bottom of feet. So you could tickle her foot, hope she wakes up and doesn't just rearrange herself- possibly rolling her feet on top of you and squish you. Or think you're a bug in her drowsy state of mind and do flick you off her bed, possibly breaking all of the bones in your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when she wakes up, jump, scream, do whatever you can to help her identify you as a tiny person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another few deep breaths, you look her up and down again. From your current location, positioned a few feet (from your perspective) away from her feet (which were conveniently just barely sticking out of her sheets) and between them, you could just barely see the rises of her body under her bed spread in the distance. She was unimaginably huge compared to you, her big toes almost as big as your entire body. You can just the slightest glimpses of her face, uncovered by her blanket and propped up into vision by several frilly, large pink pillows. You couldn't see much, but you could tell she was as pretty as she was big- flawless features and soft, smooth, feminine skin. For a moment your heart skips a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. Pretty girls are already intimidating enough when you're the same size, now you're dealing with one that's a hundred times your size. Sigh. For a moment you appreciate every average, approachable girl you've ever met in your entire life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one last deep breath and one last run over of your plan in your head, you approach her delicate, and proportionality dainty but, from your perspective, massive foot and place your hands on her soft soles. Closing your eyes in concentration and nervousness you push in further against her plush skin and begin rubbing, hoping to stir sleeping beauty.</span></div></div>",

Although you still can't see this, she naturally shifts her body slightly, which to you is basically a small earthquake, causing you to lose your balance and slip closer towards her. At first you begin crawling away, but thankfully your brain shifts out of pure survival mode momentarily and you realize you need to keep contact with her to make sure she can feel and, hopefully, notice you. Sliding back towards her foot you grab at it and once again start to tickle her. Although the fact that you fell over means you can only reach her heel, your plan seems to work; after just a moment she bends upward at her waist, her legs still sticking out straight. She begins to move her huge hand in your direction, presumably to scratch her foot. Her, eyes only half open and clearly not aware, look right at you and she just kind of casually gazes for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the hand stops. Her eyes widen, and her jaw literally drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYES. SHE SEES YOU. Success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment of your heart practically jumping out of your body, your stomach begins to sink again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already pretty intimidating with just her foot leaned over your tiny body, but now her entire being, which was immeasurably huge from your perspective, now menacingly loomed over you, the light in the room unfortunately being cast in the most intimidating way, from behind her, casting a huge shadow over (from your perspective) at least ten times your size in any particular direction. Your mind tries to comprehend that this is still a person, that she's most likely a sweet girl, and lord knows she's incredibly beautiful, but the primal part of your brain is screaming out, mentally beating you up for just standing there, especially with her hand frozen mid air, poised towards right where you were standing. The instinctual part of your brain eventually takes over and it screams just one action to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Run.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fast as you can, you pull yourself up, both physically from being ass down on the bed and mentally out of your trance, turn around, and sprint harder than you ever have before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that there's anywhere to go... not that you're thinking about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, it's only a few seconds of intense sprinting before you fall flat on your face, your foot getting caught on a fold in the sheet, which is ankle high to you, even though it normally wouldn't even register at your full size. Just another cruel reminder of your diminutive stature. You push yourself up onto your hands and knees, crawling, trying to build up enough speed to get back into a sprint. Before you can get hardly any further, though, you feel a tight clamp just underneath your arms, and then a strong feeling of vertigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic mode sets back in. Without even realizing that you're being picked up by the titaness, two of her fingers yanking you up by your armpits as if you were a toddler, you begin to wildly thrash, but she has a firm hold of your torso, leaving you just swinging your head, arms and legs wildly in the air without any real aim. Eventually the feeling of vertigo stops, and you begin to slightly calm down, enough to regain control of your limbs. Breathing heavily and heart racing, you look up to see your face to face (or, well, face to body...) to the girl, who's look of shock has subdued to a mixture of interest and curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first there's only a dead silence throughout the room. Then, you feel a profound sadness. Dangling in the middle of the air, your literal entire, now horrifically delicate life now between a young girl's fingers, the stress of the whole situation finally hits. You ran out of adrenalin, and now only have your fear and instinct left. First, you just break eye contact, looking towards the ground. Then the soft whimpering comes, with no words at first. Then you begin to mutter quietly, slowing building up until you're outright sobbing, \"please don't hurt me\", \"please put me down\", among lots of stress filled gibberish and unfinished sentences.</span></div></div>",

You've never felt more scared in your life. The slightest, even accidental movement from her, could snuff you out in a hundred thousand different ways, each one flashing vividly in your mind as you hang limp and can do nothing but sob harder when the thoughts are too hard for you to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, suddenly, your body shifts. You feel yourself settle into a laying position, though not by your own movement. Clarity coming back, you see the girl shifted your body into a laying position on her palm. Then, her thumb gently wraps itself around you, softly pressing you into her palm, almost like a hug. You couldn't tell if this was intentional or not, but at the very least, she's given you a sign of friendliness, or at least concern for your well being. A few sniffles and you regain the courage to look up to her face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still had a curious look, but her gaze was less piercing and demanding, and perhaps now even vaguely concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter opening her mouth to speak a few times but not seeming to be sure what to say, she finally starts. \"Hey... I'm not gonna hurt you, or anything, but...\" Her talking was sheepish and awkward, but she had a very pretty voice, which in itself kind of calmed you a little bit. \"...I'd kind of like an explanation, if you can handle it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp a bit, trying to work up the confidence to speak. You start to speak, but the words get caught in your throat. You try again, starting from a different angle, but a sob makes you cough suddenly. Thankfully, the pretty giant seemed understanding and patiently allowed you to collect yourself. After about a minute of failing to speak, she sets a finger to your mouth mid speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still want an explanation of why there was a little inch tall person crawling around... inside my bad... while I was asleep...\" You were worried she'd think of it like that. \"...But you seem pretty upset, so for now I'll trust you didn't have bad intentions. You need some water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. Weren't you lucky. You ended up with someone far more understanding than anyone has any business being considering the situation. You nod and utter a weak \"please\". Setting you on the nightstand next to her bed, the girl gets up and walks out the room, leaving you alone, presumably to get the water she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave you a chance to finally take in your surroundings. It was clearly a bedroom; a large, queen sized bed, many girly Pokemon plushies (which now towered over you, another upsetting reminder), a vanity mirror with some make up, a closet filled with night gowns and dresses, which seemed to be her clothing of choice... Altogether she was clearly a high class lady, despite how young she looked. Your thoughts began to retreat back inward, worrying about how you might be able to get her to believe your absurd story and not just squish you thinking you're some weirdo scientist pervert who shrunk themself intentionally to get into bed with her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough both sounded weird as hell, the latter was the more likely to be believed. Maybe you could lie and make something up that's believable? You felt nervous and began running a bunch of scenarios that would be more believable in your head, before your thought process was interrupted by both the fact that you couldn't deal with the pressure well enough to think and the fact that Caitlin had now returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now had your chance to really appreciate her. She had clearly taken the chance of getting you some water to freshen up a little bit- you were kind of surprised by this, but given that it looked that she was fairly high class and had just woken up, I guess it wasn't too hard to believe. It broke your trance as she set down a bottle cap filled with water at your feet and knelt in front of the night stand to remain face to face, possibly to be less intimidating for your sake, not that it actually helped much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously I don't have any cups your size, but hopefully you'll be able to get a drink out of this.\" She stood back up, then sat back down onto her bed, pulling her legs up to sit indian style. You gulped, as she towered back over you now, but tried not to look at her and paid more attention to getting a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, even the generous gift of water was a bit of a reminder how small you were- the tall brimmed bottle cap now stuck up just below your knees and was as wide as a small drinking fountain. Still, you graciously knelt down and cupped your hands together, dipped your hands in and drank. Once you had your first drink you realized just how dry your throat was, and worry that your little tantrum that happened as a result of her picking you up didn't go on too long. How embarrassing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush graced your cheeks and you mentally slap yourself. Now wasn't the time to worry about first impressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few last drunks and pushing the thought that you might have heard the titaness to your right quietly giggle at your attempts to drink, you look back up at her sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... I think I can handle giving you an explanation now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you decide to tell her your story for how it actually happened- not that you had the energy to make up a lie right now, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she react?</span></div></div>",

To the average person her gaze probably wouldn't be very intimidating,  in fact most probably would describe it as \"soft\", but to you it felt like you had been impaled. All you could do was avoid meeting her gaze directly, sheepishly staring to the ground, biting your lower lip tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... that story is really unbelievable..\" Uh oh. \"But even if you were a weirdo, I don't think you'd do something as dangerous as this. This is too much. And the way you broke down before...\" Pause. \"...I believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge weight was lifted off your shoulders and it took all of your strength not to just pass out upright from the sudden release of tension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not sure what I'm going to do now. I have enough room to house you here with me until we figure something out but I don't really feel comfortable just bringing some random person into my life, even if they're tiny...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit, you didn't think of that. You could only think far enough of getting noticed so you'd be safe in the short term, what now? Your brain was too stressed out and trying to think of a solution hurt your head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's start with introductions. What's your name? Where were you from before this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood, you found someone who was smarter than you. Still, it was intimidating talking to her, so you keep your gaze down. \"Um... my name is (insert yours here). I'm from Cinnabar.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Cinnabar? The Island? In Kanto?\" Although you're still avoiding eye contact, you can see her eyes widen out of the corner of yours and her lips curl down a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach sinks. \"Y-yes in Kanto. Isn't that where we are? Why would you ask?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just a stupid little slip of the tongue. It was an accident. She didn't mean to ask. The stress of the situation clouded her head for a second, everything is fi- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're in Unova right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnova?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck. Shit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach drops through the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnova and Kanto are on separate <i>continents. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally can't handle any more of this. You feel another sinking feeling then collapse and pass out on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you find when you wake up?</span></div></div>",

You're welcome to stay in my home until you figure out how you want to approach finding help. We're currently in a rather extravagant villa that I own so it's no trouble letting you stay here. I went out and bought some doll clothes for you to use while you stay here while you were asleep, so don't worry about that.\" She idly talked to you while making her bed and setting a few things aside, surprisingly casually all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, t-thanks. It means a lot.\" You stammer, still a bit uncomfortable with talking to someone so much bigger than you that you don't even know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no big deal. I get a bit lonely here anyway.\" She stops her busywork, and looks down a little and blushes. \"Besides, you're kinda cute, all little like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush a bit yourself. \"Anyway,\" Caitlin quickly moves on before the subject can be talked about any more, \"you're probably hungry, right?\" Your stomach growls in affirmation, prompting a bashful smile from you and a amused smile from her. \"Come here, I'll take you to my kitchen.\" She lowered her hand for you, which you cautiously stepped onto, still a bit wary despite her kindness. She brought her hand close to her, leaning it against her stomach to help keep it steady for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she reached the kitchen, she set you on the table and opened her fridge, pulling out a plate of assorted fruit, some in normal sized pieces and others cut into very small pieces, the latter presumably for you. \"I didn't know what you'd like to eat, but I figured fruit is a safe bet. Would you like some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and she set the plate next to you, sitting by the table to eat her pieces too. You climbed onto the plate and began eating. After a few bites you looked up at Caitlin, who was munching on a piece of her fruit with a small smile on her face as she watched you. You blushed a little. \"Um, what's that look about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny watching you get all messy trying to eat like that.\" It's true, fruit juice had pretty much completely stained your clothes, which you hadn't noticed in your hunger. \"Don't worry, I gotta run some errands after this, you can take the time to wash up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word, when you both finished eating you she brought you into her bathroom, where she gave you a small sliver of soap, a shallow bowl of warm water, a towel, and a clean set of the doll clothes she gave you. \"Feel free to take your time, it'll be awhile before I get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she gets back, what's the next thing you both do?</span></div></div>",

Even as she sits up, she seems to sway a little, as if \"being awake\" is a strange and unusual sensation for her. You were hoping this lady would be a bit more alert and attentive when she woke up, but as she continues to rub her eyes and moan, you realise that if you don't make an effort to get noticed now, she might pull herself out of bed and leave you alone here (or, perhaps more likely, she will just collapse back to sleep and you'll be back at square one again).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other plan of action, you take a deep breath and shout at the top of your lungs, while jumping up and down like a maniac.

Her face still looked rather indifferent, but you could definitely notice a hint of annoyance. As you pick yourself up and began to move, she once again moved her foot in your direction, her toes shoving you in the stomach as you are pushed off of the bed. Due to how tired she still looked in comparison to how she could be, you realized how lightly she must have actually kicked you. You truly were small, weren't you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was not a time to suddenly be insightful, you were now falling off of the bed. When you looked what was waiting below you, you saw it was her pink bedroom shoes, which one might expect to be there. At this point, you had two options. Either fall into her shoes, and wait  try to get her attention again from there.

He continues his walk, his monolithic legs striding across the enormous room in record time, each step shaking you to your bones. Thump, <i>thump</i>, <b>thump</b>. You get brief glances of the rubber soles of his green sneakers, practically immaculate, with only one or two strands of the carpet fibers buried amongst the treads... and you swiftly figure that you should get out of the way before you join them. You dive to the side as his foot slams down near where you once stood - <b>THUMP</b> - and the force alone knocks you off your feet and onto your behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a brief moment where the giant towers over you, his figure so colossal that it sends shivers down your spine, before he finishes his walk, standing by the bed. Taking a moment to stretch, he kicks away his sneakers to the side of the bed, revealing his soft white socks, which he then sits on the edge of the bed to take off. You continue calling for his aid, but the giant seems to be dismissing the 'noise' he heard entirely now... or perhaps he is too tired to hear? A yawn confirms your suspicions, and he swiftly removes the rest of his clothing (save for his underwear, of course) and places them beside the bed near the sneakers, before curling up under the sheets and trying to fall to sleep. You give one more shout, just to be certain, but he doesn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the room is closed, so you aren't leaving any time soon, which means you have little choice but to climb up the bed and get the giant's attention - hopefully before he is fast asleep. Using the long-hanging sheets of the bed and several tools and bits from toys around the room, you enact a makeshift plan of clambering up the bed. It takes a while, but eventually, through some ingenuity, you make your way up the soft cliff of the bedside and shuffle your way up onto the bed's surface. Now on top of the massive mesa that is the giant's bed, you notice that you climbed up near...</span></div></div>",

Not that you would touch someone's stuff without asking, but still. It was the elevation of them that mattered.

Her cold, uncaring gaze sent shivers down your spine so bad, you were slightly glad when her foot moved over, and blotted out her face behind its milky white sole. Only slightly, though, as now you had another terrifying view to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot came down slowly, agonizingly so. You wondered what the reasoning behind that could be, because it's not like you had anything better to do in your current state. It couldn't have been just from her trying to be thorough with her work. You wondered if perhaps Gardevoir was just trying to entertain herself as much as she possibly could with an action as boring and mundane as squashing a bug. Because you had to remember, that's what you were to her. Whether she recognized you as a human or not, it didn't matter to her in the slightest. You were nothing but a minuscule miscreant, violating her master's room with your mere presence. Such offense demanded a punishment, and Gardevoir was ready to provide it in the form of her life-crushing foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her sole came to rest directly above you, her heel coming down beside your legs. The ball of her foot hanged above your head, sprinkled with dust stuck to the sweaty flesh of her sole. The chase had a small toll on her as well, it seemed, thought you were now paying for it more than her, as the potent scent coming off her feet assaulted your senses.<br>\r\nBy craning your neck, you were able to take a look at her pudgy toes. You expected them to hang dormant, stiff as the rest of her sole, but instead they were wide awake, so to speak. Gardevoir was clenching them, unclenching them, wiggling them all over the place, a clear sigh that she found this situation highly stimulating. Not really all that surprising, come to think of it. Gardevoir or not, she was the local champion's ace. Fighting and dominating the opposition was in her blood. To have her foe reduced to such a sorry state, hopelessly waiting for her foot to come down and snuff it out of existence... Such rush of power no other battle could provide. She'll miss this feeling greatly, but there was a task to carry out, and she will not fail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour end came swiftly. With a mighty stomp, her foot came down like a hammer, instantly recuding your diminutive body into a sad, red puddle. Oh, what a lovely feeling it was for Gardevoir, your little body popping immediately into mush under the awesome power that was her sole. Blinded by the adrenaline, Diantha's ace Pokemon rose her heels off the ground, at least doubling the pressure exterted on what was left of your body. She began grinding her foot left and right, somehow making your already two-dimensional form even flatter. She was literally squeezing as much enjoyment out of you as she possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 2 minutes of this, Gardevoir finally came to her senses, and stopped. She moved her foot out of the way, cringing a little at the sorry state she left you in. WIth her psychic powers, she drew a few tissues, and cleaned your remains off the floor, as well as what got stuck to sole. Without even looking at the trash bin, she threw you out with perfect accuracy, and made her way out of the room, ready to continue her daily routine.</span></div></div>",

You move as fast as you can through the carpet fibers, all while the Gardevoir continues its search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are nearing the dresser, the Gardevoir turns and wanders near you, her feet stomping dangerously close to you.

Unfortunately, I've had to sort of squeeze them at the end, due to how options become more limited as chapters progress, so you might have to dive through some chapters to get to the late-game characters.

The item should be as open as possible. Be sensible (i.e. some nudity or some blood is fine, rape or dismemberment is not).<br>\r\n<b>2b)</b> If the character is possibly underage, <b>no sexual content whatsoever.</b> To my knowledge, this includes: Bugsy, Tate, Liza, Maylene, Iris and Clemont. If there is confirmed sources stating a character here is of consenting age, please message me and I'll correct this.<br>\r\n<b>3)</b> No scatological material, and no sexual content involving Pokemon (non-sexual interaction is fine, though.) Descriptions of scents should be kept at a minimum.<br>\r\n<b>4)</b> Whether or not the reader character has knowledge of the character or <i>Pokemon</i> in general is up to you.<br>\r\n<b>5)</b> New chapters should be at least a paragraph or so, though that's not a set rule.<br>\r\n<b>6)</b> The death of the reader is allowed, <i>as long as it is avoidable</i> (i.e. do not create a one-option-only path that leads to death.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, have fun.</td>",
