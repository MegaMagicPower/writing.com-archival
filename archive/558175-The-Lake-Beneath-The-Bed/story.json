Was the unicorn mad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it...is it quite safe?\" I managed to stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air filled with a tinkling sound. The unicorn was laughing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be safe, my dear,\" Rena assured, bending down to receive me on her back. I cautiously stepped forward and scrambled on in the most undignified manner. The horse snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena stood, she introduced her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snorting <i>cheval</i> there is Morris, a far descendent of the last surviving of the Moose race. This is Mabel, a giraffe from the Far East, and this Visinya elephant is Sarpophaus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe animals bowed their heads towards me. I sat stiffly, bewildered. Had I lost my mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA throaty voice filled my ears. \"And your name, little one? I dare say you look nothing like I have ever seen before. So small and spindly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI straightened my back. I was old enough, anyhow, and no one should ever call me 'spindly'! Though the owner of the voice, the giraffe, meant it kindly. At least, my common sense told me it was so. But I could not help feeling a tad bit offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a human being, I'll have you know,\" I retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena intercepted the conversation. \"The child is exhausted, Mabel. I am taking him to the Sea Kingdom, but I shall return presently. Ready, young one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. What else could I say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warned, the unicorn leapt up into the air and dipped gracefully down into the water. In mid-air, panic overtook me as I struggled to remain on Rena's back. I very nearly lost my grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on tight!\" Rena admonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not reply. For then we plunged into the deep dark of the lake, into the frigid waters of the unknown. Then I quite lost myself and grasped senselessly at whatever I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was a bunch of seaweed in one hand and Rena's mane in another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was thrown sideways with the force of the water. Rena's speed was magnificent, for being under water. I was in such a state that I nearly forgot that I could not breathe under water. You can clearly imagine my panic then!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently I saw a glow coming from the depths of the sea. I was very afraid. I could not breathe, yet I felt nothing wrong. I wondered whether I had died, for who ever heard of a human breathing under water? I began to fear the brilliance of the deep sea, dreading to look upon the luminance of persons long dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI squeezed my eyes shut and wrapped my arms around Rena's strong neck. I could feel the ripple of her muscles, and the movement running through her body. Suddenly, it all stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard whispering, and some swishing sounds. I realized that I was breathing, breathing air. Something poked me, and I fell from Rena's back with a sickening thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was loathe to open my eyes. Was it a dream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sights in front of me came into focus, I registed blurry shapes and flashing lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where in heaven's name am I?\"</span></div></div>",

There must have been several hundred guardians circling the entrance platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir voices startled me from my reverie. While they were conversing, I had looked about. I was filled with awe as I took in the surroundings--polished, glistening mother-of-pearl shells decorated the scrolled archways and pillars, the beautiful armory of the guardians, the golden spears and helms...'twas a sight! and I did not wish to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is the blindfold truly necessary? The child is no threat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know our laws Rena. Until the king so deems, the creature is to know no more of our kingdom than can be helped.\" At that I felt myself being pushed forward. \"Do not fear child. Merpeople are quite civilized and humane, and their king is just and kind.\" I was being lead blindly through a city until two minutes I never knew existed. After walking through what I believed to be a pair of double doors (based upon the sound I heard as we passed through them) the most enchanting music I have ever heard graced my ears. We could have been walking for days to my death and I never would have noticed; the music was so entrancing, I never felt more at peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena must have seen me smiling. \"Beautiful isn't it? The merpeople create the most incredible music below the surface of the water. They hate to admit it, but their music doesn't always sound so enticing above the surface.\" Quickly her voice hushed as we passed through yet another pair of double doors I believe they were. But there was something different about passing through this doorway. The music stopped and the whole atmosphere suffocated me with fear, respect, solemnity, and a mixture of many other intense feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the blindfold was removed and I found myself in a rather large and lavish throne room. As I looked around I saw that all the guardians were kneeling, even Rena's head was slightly bowed. When I looked up to the throne a wizened, majestic merman was taking his seat upon the throne. Without knowing anything about this world or these people, I felt compelled to bow whether out of fear or reverence I still do not know.</span></div></div>",

Ever since we had moved into this house I felt there was something odd about it.  I had been waiting for something weird to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Here it was.  I was looking for my lucky socks.  One of them, anyway.  I knew I had taken them off just last night, sitting right here on the bed.  I found the right one in the bathroom.  I couldn't find the left one anywhere. (maybe your socks don't have lefts and rights, but MY lucky socks do!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So I went looking.  I looked everywhere.  Finally I decided to check under the bed, just in case, I mean, who knew?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0First I knelt down and peeked under the edge of the bed.  No socks.  So I stretched out my stomach so I could see further back.  See, my bed is right up against the wall in a corner of my room.  It is accessible really only from one side.  It was dark and really hard to see all the way back to the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, taking a deep breath against the dust underneath I gave a good hard push with my feet and scooted fast along the hard wood floor, helped along by dust and floor polish.  Before I could think straight I was...  Well, I was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wasn't sure where I was.  I lay still for a moment looking around, trying to figure things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Long thing branches of something hung over me, partially obscuring my view.  When I twisted my head around I could see my feet disappearing into a long, dark,low roofed cave, barely a foot high. Above the cave opening for as far as I could see, which was only a few feet because of the tree or bush or whatever it was, was a striated stone cliff.  It reached to the left and right as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reaching out I pushed the thin hanging branches in front of my face apart.  I was, to say the least, a little startled, but, as I said, not really surprised.  I was, however, really curious. After all, how often do you climb under your bed looking for your luck sock and end up under a bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, I pushed those branches apart, and there it was.  A lake.  The lake.  I was torn.  The lake and what ever lay around it called to me.  On the other hand, I really, really needed to find my lucky sock before the dance tonight.  Besides, Fawn, Bardo, Max and the others needed to know about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I figured they deserved to do this thing with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Closing my eyes I crossed my fingers and wiggled backward.

I knew where they would be.  Bardo's dad was like this zillionaire.  Bardo had this whole cool set up that was practically all his own.  It was like a movie theater/party room with every top line electronic gadget, including computers.  I figured he must have every movie and every video game system ever made. Bardo even had a housekeeper/cook who would keep us supplied with snacks until we barfed!  It was kind of like our club house.  I knew that is where they would be if anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bardo and Max were there.  And Seth.  Fawn and Celene were both home getting ready for the dance that evening.  I wasn't sure what to do.  I didn't want to go without the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carefully I told them what had happened.  At first they looked at me like I was crazy but it didn't take long for me to convince them to at least come and look.  After all, everyone knew about the old Warwick place.  That was the house I had moved into and one of the reasons I had made friends so quickly.  Anyone who lived in the old Warwick place had to have something going for them, right?  That place was too weird!  That is sort of what Max said to me one day not very long after I had moved here and started school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now Max suggested I call the girls and tell them to come over.  After all, Celene was going to the dance with Bardo and Fawn was going with Seth.  If all of us went adventuring instead of dancing the girls would be left without anyone to go to the dance with anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Max and I were dateless, Max by choice because he had just broken up with someone and me, well, because I was new, I guess.  I wasn't brave enough to ask anyone yet.  The girls weren't happy.  They had been looking forward to this dance and basically thought I was insane.  Idiot boys!, they said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He's a teacher, and I really should be thinking about guys my own age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I won't always be 14 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I'm 18 and he's 30, we might become a couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, I want him to know that I exist and am good company--and what better way than a nice conversation while sharing a slow dance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Marlowe--or Jason, as I really think of him in my heart, but we're not supposed to be on a first-name basis with teachers in high school any more than we're supposed to date them--is a very special guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was widowed when his wife died of cancer two years ago, just a little over a year after their daughter, Jenna Nicole, was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason--oops!  I mean Mr. Marlowe. . .Oh!  What the heck!  I can call him Jason in my own mind as long as I don't slip up and do it at school--hasn't dated anyone in all of this time and has concentrated on teaching school and taking care of Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't think he's really ready to think about dating just yet.  Instead, he simply needs friends--and I want to be the very best friend I can be to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody knows how I feel about him, because I've kept it to myself, but I've been in love with him from almost the moment I met him--which was when he came to see my folks about funeral arrangements for Melissa (his wife).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, that's right!  My folks are funeral directors, and we live in a funeral home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had worked for other people for years, but this is the first time we've had our very own funeral home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a very old house that's probably been around forever--and, as I've said, it seems like a very strange house in a lot of ways, as if it has lots of secrets, ghosts, secret passageways, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, when I saw this handsome guy talking to my folks and holding his little girl on his lap, I just had the feeling that I wanted to love him and take care of him and Jenna when I grew up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time, I thought I might have just been feeling sorry for him, because he was crying so hard--but it was more than that.  This was just something I knew from the very first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, I felt sorry for him, but I was also drawn to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I was to find out that he was a math teacher where I would be going to high school--and have now been in high school since this past September.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he taught classes in advanced math that weren't available to students until at least their sophomore year, I would have another year to wait before I would have the chance to take a class from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut we often talked in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I heard that he had volunteered to be one of the chaperones at this dance, so I wanted to look really nice for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was going alone--why go with anyone else when I already knew whom I wanted to spend the rest of my life with--and had plans to ask HIM to dance, if he didn't ask me first.  But I mustn't be too bold about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would wait until the band played a \"Ladies' Choice\" number, and I would be as close to him as I could be so I would be ready to choose him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I was about to leave the lake for future exploring, once I had both of my lucky socks back, I heard Jason calling to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was down there by the lake!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow lucky could I be--not lucky at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, I was lucky, because BOTH of my lucky socks were right where I had left them--hanging over a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I was in bed waking up from an interesting dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I didn't hurry, I was going to be late for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to put on my lucky socks and wear them all day--then, all I would have to do would be to change into the cute outfit I'd chosen for the dance later that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my lucky socks on, I might even have good luck with Jason BEFORE the dance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of good luck?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, a nice, long conversation instead of those chats of a few minutes we had in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis business about the lake had all been a dream, hadn't it!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that were so__________.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alice in Wonderland eat your heart out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  A knock sounded on my door then; it was my mother, calling me - and OPENING MY DOOR. Without thinking (hey, it happens)i had dived underneath my bed and right through the trap door, missing the shiny golden ladder put there for me to climb down on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Oops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But instead of falling hundreds of feet and landing flat on my face and killing myself, I floated slowly to the ground, skimmed across the surface of the lake and landed on the river-bank. I stood up and dusted myself off, then looked around. Tall gren trees surrounded me, and I was close to thinking the place was completely deserted when  heard small voices calling to me from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  I turned to see three small fairies hovering in front of me.   </span></div></div>",
