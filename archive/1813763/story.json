Plus your just so cute at your new size *giggles*. But we need to figure out a way to turn you back to your normal size. I mean at your current size there's no way you could be my big strong husband *giggles*\". You were sort of sick of the jokes and just came out to say \"Okay I get Love, now let's stop joking around and figure out a way to grow me back\". Your wife who was sort of serious in a way with her last comment, stops her giggling and say's \"Yea yea your right babe, so let's see if the internet has anything on this. *you watch your wife get out of the bed and search for her laptop for a few mins* Aw shoot I think I left my laptop in our car. Oh well, I'll go get it and you just stay here okay love\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a bit worried about staying alone in your shrunken state you say \"I don't know babe if that's such a good idea. Maybe I should come with you\". Putting on her black old flat's she turn's to you to say \"Oh don't be silly dear you will be much safer staying in this empty hotel bedroom. While I go grab my laptop. Plus it will be a lot faster if I just go alone so don't miss me to much *giggles* and just stay there on the bed\" and with that said you watch your now giant wife walk out the hotel door. Leaving you alone on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you guys were on the 7th floor of the hotel and the parking garage was only obtained by getting to the hotel's lobby and then taking a series of hallway's and elevator's to get to it. You knew that your wife was going to be gone for at the very least 20 min's. So you sat there on your bed for about 3 mins and instantly felt the boredom flow through you. Knowing that you had to obey your wife order's and stay on the bed. You still stayed in your sitting position but you wished that you weren't so bored. And you should be careful what you wish for as you hear *KNOCK KNOCK* \"House keeping, please tell me if your inside cause I only wait a minute before entering...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panicked, and then started yelling at the top of your little lungs \"PLEASE DON'T COME IN, THERE IS SOMEONE IN HERE\". But it was no use, you were to small to hear, especially through a thick hotel room door. So, you then hear the sound of her unlocking the door and watch as the giant hotel door is opened. You see the maid come in who is a cute giant young woman (to you, I mean in reality she was like 5'6\") who looked to be in her early/mid 20's. With brown hair that goes down to her shoulder's and she was pushing in her cleaning cart. You know that her job involves doing it as quickly as possible. So you had little time to figure out what you needed to do next. But you figured that it was probably best to not be seen. So, you ran to underneath a pillow. And you watch as the maid began her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with picking up trash around the room and then quickly moved on to the bed where she began stripping thing's off the bed. Tearing off the blanket and before she even removed the pillows she went in the remove the hugging sheet that was under you. And with nothing you can do about it. You are flown backward as the sheet below you is stripped away and you are able to skid the side of the bed all the way to underneath it. Landing in some dust speck's. Being glad that your still alive and figure that you can just re-climb the bed after the maid leave's. You look in front of you and see the dirty or dusty tan van's of that the maid is wearing on her feet. You see that she is moving very quickly with remaking the bed. And are sort of impressed when she is done so fast. And she move's on to her next duty which was vacuuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back into a state of fear as you see the shoe's of the walk back to her and see the a huge vacuum bottom hit the floor. And then you hear the loud roar of the vacuum. You really don't know what to do and really hope that she doesn't clean under the bed. Looking around you see dust bunny's, a couple of bug corpses that included the one who stung you in which you think that might be useful later, and you also see a mattress string that led up to a certain point behind the bed. You think that safely grabbing that bug that stung you might be a good idea but get really scared when you hear the sound of a *click* and watch as the stick holding the base of the vacuum drops to the ground. Which is followed by you seeing the knee's of the maid, which could only mean that she was getting ready to get down and vacuum the underneath of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing there is little time you jump and grab onto the mattress string. Looking back behind you see the giant face of the cute maid scanning underneath the bed while swiping her hand vacuum underneath. You watch as she notices every bug corpse, which included the shrinking bug's corpse and she went into vacuum them all up. And while still doing your climb up the string the maid's eye's finally fall on you. She isn't sure what you are, but also really doesn't care. So you start to feel the powerful sucking wind as the maid starts to aim her vacuum in your direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tightly clench the mattress string, watching dust particles fly by you as they enter the basically black hole of a vacuum that is behind you. You tried to scream for her to stop but your sound's were deafen by the loud vacuum that is trying to suck you up. You begin to feel your grip loosen and are not sure about how much longer you can hold on. As the maid is starting to get frustrated with the inability of the vacuum to be able to suck you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with the powerful suction of the vacuum behind you and your grip becoming ever more loose.

And so the cute maid decided that if you want a job done right, you have to do it yourself. So, you watch as the now off vacuum leave's your sight and see the giant cute face of the maid who was just starring you down at this point. Looking at you she was curious to what you are. When seeing you move at first she assumed you were a bug, but while starring you down, she realized that you don't look like any bug that she has seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just grip the mattress string all while this is going and then try to climb your way up it. When the maid notice's this she act's fast and a giant hand appear's behind you. Noticing the shadow of her hand, you grip the string tightly. But it's no use as her strength is much greater then your's. You plucked off the mattress string and in a tight soft grip of the maid's hand's. All your able to do is struggle which was pointless and watch as your taken out from under the bed and brought up to be face to face with the cute giantess face of the maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the maid's hand you felt so strange to her. Looking at you, she noticed that you look like a tiny man doll, but with flipping your tiny naked body around in her hand using only her finger. You were powerless to stop her from observing you. And she see's you do a bit of fighting back and she also notice's your attempt's to communicate with her. Right away she concludes that your a real tiny man. She is shocked and curious about you, but instead of saying anything to you. She gave you a smile, *giggle*, and a pat on the head before putting you into her back pocket with only your head sticking out. So, she can finish up her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grabbed all of her supplies and left your hotel room. While she she walked you were unable to move with the swaying motion of her butt. The maid got onto the elevator  and headed for the next floor (5th floor) that had the room that she was suppose to clean. While she stood still you were able to get some movement. And you started wiggling your way out of her back pocket. But when you got close to getting out, you looked up to see a giant thumb that belong to the maid that forcefully pushed you back in the pocket. She didn't even brother saying anything to you, as the elevator dinged and your back in motion. And throughout the cleaning, each time her walking would stop and you were able to start wiggling. You were greeted with the same response each time, her giant thumb ruining all your progress. It got to a point where you just stop trying. And you sat in the pocket and wonder how worried your wife must be right now.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Meanwhile going to your wife's position at the moment:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife Lucy actually hasn't discovered that your even gone yet. You see when she left you and headed into the lobby, she got distracted by cloth's in the gift shop and after about 20 minutes of trying cloths on. She knew she ha to make her way to the car for your sake. And while walking in the direction of the hallway to the elevator to the parking garage. Lucy over a buff man in the gym talking about free gym membership for the week, but you must sign up today. So of course Lucy had to once again ignore the big priority and sign her and her husband up for the gym which toke about 30 mins.  Afterwards she made it to the parking garage but ended up getting a bit lost which also made her a bit more late. Eventually after about 2 or 3 hour's she finally make's it back to the elevator and just hope's that your not to upset with her. As she enters the elevator and see's that it's going to make a stop at 5 before hitting her floor at 7...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Back to the you:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">The maid was finally done with cleaning all the rooms, announced to the world that her shift was done and then returned the cleaning cart on the 5th floor. She then made her way to the elevator and once it dinged arrived. She entered and leaned against the wall. And to your amazement you look up and see your wife Lucy. Seeing your giant beauty of a goddess wife filled you with happiness and even when you noticed all the shopping that clearly resembled why she was late to your guy's room. You would normally be in a ball of rage about something like that but at this moment you were just glad to see her. And it is unfortunate though that you have to see her from a stranger's back pocket. With being only inches away from her giant hand, You knew that you had to get her attention but with little ability to move, you would have to wiggle yourself up a bit, which you were able to and release your tiny arms and then you started yelling your tiny head off while still wiggling your out and towards your wife's giant hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife for a brief moment actually started to hear a familiar voice and at the exact time she looked down towards the maid's butt. You were covered by a giant thumb, in which your wife just brushed off whatever she heard and the elevator opened for the 7th floor. You got to watch your goddess of a wife walk out of the elevator and to your disgust a guy saw all her bags and offered to help carry them to her room. And her not wanting to carry the stuff let him. Giving you a full view of your gorgeous wife walk away with another man, while you at this point are nothing more then pocket lint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the maid made her way to her car and before she sat down, you were placed into a small purse and zipped up. She then made her way to her decent sized apartment. And when she was all showered up, she let you out onto her coffee table and you were finally given the opportunity to talk to your captor. Who you didn't want to come off to harsh to so you subsided your anger. And of course being in a different country and only knowing English. You just hoped that she spoke it as well as and you also didn't really know what to say so you just went with say \"Hey, can you help me?\"..</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Does she speak English and/or is she willing to help you?) <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

About a minute of silence passes by before you find out how much your statement didn't really help your situation,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The woman was taking the minute to think about what just happened. In a way she found herself a bit jealous about how loyal you were to your wife. But she was also a bit angry about your tone and is even more irritated with you not just submitting to being her boyfriend. And so she then decided how she would handle this. As she stood up to her full height and looked down at you as if you were a child that did something wrong and she said \"That is a very rude tone that you just used. All I want to do is play with you and take care of you. I think you need to apologize\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you saw the woman stand up to her full height and began to think about your current size. You realized that this woman could easily hurt you if she wanted to. And you knew you couldn't possibly escape if you tried. I mean you were all of one inch tall and if you tried to run or get her more angry you might never get out of this situation alive. So, you could only think of one thing to do and that was to give in for now.

Once she had you in her hand, you started to get really afraid for your life. You looked directly down and saw how high up you were. And you thought about how she was more then capable of dropping you if she wanted to, but she was still laughing and giggling while holding you. The whole situation was quite scary, and you were wondering where she was even taking you. As you looked up at her and saw her giant smile that was pretty much the opposite of how you were feeling right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe toke a look down at you in her hand at the exact time you showed a bit of fear of falling. And she found it cute that you looked that way and felt the need to say \"Don't worry, I'm not going to drop you\". The woman said this while continuing to walk around the room with you in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen hearing that, it didn't make you feel any better.

David is a successful young male model, while Amber is a very successful young female model, and they both come from extremely rich families. David met Amber when he was the captain of his High School swim team, and Amber was the captain of the girl\u2019s High School gymnastics team. They both got married at such a young age, three years later, because they love each other very much, even thou their parents advised against it. However, both of their parents eventually gave into their kids demands. David Wilson stands 6 feet tall, has short lit-brown hair, blue eyes, lightly tanned skin, and he has a lean, well-defined, muscular, nearly hairless body. He has a great ass, and he is well hung. Amber Wilson stands 5\u201910, with medium length, curly, strawberry blond hair, greenish, cat like eyes, and she has smooth, fair skin. She has large, firm C almost D size breasts, and a slender, athletic, well-defined body, with curvy hips, and a great ass.

Only a small patch of sunlight sheds on the darkened jungle cliff that was to the tiny two, her groin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid panics. The nose of the plain aims smack dab towards that hair-tangled cliff. He makes a last-minute adjustment so it doesn't crash. But as a consequence, he flies far too low against it. Now the jungle of hairs has its way. The tangled masses bash into the wings, slowing down its doomed flight. Despite David's frustrated piloting, gravity takes over and the plane falls. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the plane gets tangled in the pubic forest as it falls. Suspended by a net of hairs, it is the only thing separating the aircraft from being a metal-and-blood mess on the sand far below it. To the far right through the forest, the native's fleshy canyon stands like a geographic feature rather than an anatomical one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid lets go of the controls. The plane is safe enough for the time being, but it won't last. He yells towards his wife. \"Dear, we gotta go!\" Amber didn't get a good view of the groin forest, so she remains oblivious to what unfolded. All she knew was that David made a crash landing - both are thankful to be alive. But the tone of hid voice makes his wife timid and uneasy. David feels the same way. After all, how does he explain what happened and where they are now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile outside, the giant native has no clue that a tiny plane just crash-landed and is now tangled up on her crotch.
