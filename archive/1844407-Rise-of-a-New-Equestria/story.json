A gentle breeze was present, carrying with it the delicious smells that could only be produced by the many bakeries present in the city. Most of the ponies went about their daily business, while others enjoyed what felt like possibly the most perfect of days. Unbeknownst to some, the fair city will be visited this day. Visited by a couple of cloaked individuals who will change not just the city of Maretro, but all of Equestria.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The visitors are noticed relatively quickly, as the local news stations are reporting about having sighted the strangers coming toward the city almost as soon as they appear. Being the most newsworthy thing in the past while, everypony in the vicinity of a radio or television tuned to the right station is immediately entranced, and everyone else is told about the strangers by those with a radio. The reporters seem skeptical about why the cloaked couple would arrive, coming to the conclusion that they could only be up to no good, and everypony should avoid coming into contact with the couple just to be safe. Patrons of a small bar, a group of about four older colts, somewhere near the outskirts of the city listened to the news broadcast over the radio as they enjoyed their usual weekly drinks.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI bet they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming to steal our souls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one of the patrons, belching afterwards.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNah, nopony can steal yer soul,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said another. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey might be some o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 them cannibal folk, though. Eatin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 who they ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t s\u00e2\u0080\u0099posed ta.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo way, cannibals are a myth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a third.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, like zebras NOT being evil?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the fourth patron piped in, chuckling while the others glared at him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey now, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not get racist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the bartender said while cleaning a mug. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy cousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter is part zebra, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a kind hearted individual living near\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Uh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Ponyville, I think it was.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlright, I take it back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still curious WHY they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the third one said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099tcha go ask \u00e2\u0080\u0098em, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the second pony suggested.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo way, are you crazy?! They might actually BE cannibals!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you said cannibals were a myth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d an unfamiliar male voice added, the bar door closing as two newcomers entered, black cloaks covering their bodies.<br>\r\nEverypony in the bar stared at the new couple with their mouths agape. The bartender forgot about the mug he was cleaning and let it drop to the floor. At least, it would have dropped had the slightly taller newcomer not been there. Without so much as a twitch, the taller newcomer used their Unicorn powers to take hold of the mug and prevent it from shattering against the ground, placing it upon the countertop with those same powers. Aside from the static coming from the radio and the hoof steps, all was quiet as the two newcomers approached the counter. Moments passed as the patrons and bartender stared at the newcomers before the couple decided to take off their hoods. The others flinched back, not sure what to expect under the hoods of the strangers. However, under beneath the cloaks were two (seemingly) average ponies. To be specific, a Unicorn stallion and a Pegasus mare, although the mare couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t obviously be pinned as a Pegasus due to her wings still being covered by the cloak. The stallion was very dark blue in color with a black and blue mane and tail (if anypony was trying to see under his cloak to see his tail). He was missing a small bit of his left ear and his horn was long and pointed, which brought the question of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did he hide that in his hood?\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the minds of everypony other than the Pegasus he traveled with. The mare was almost an exact opposite of the stallion. She was very bright white in color and had a flowing golden mane and tail (again, if anypony was trying to see under her cloak). She was beautiful, and complimented the handsome stallion she travelled with.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the mysterious stallion said, gazing over the group of colts gathered at the bar with a slight hint of disgust in his eyes. The colt on the far left gulped while the other colts glanced at each other before the bartender chose to spoke.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre or are not these cannibals mythical?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the stallion raised one of his eyebrows as he said this.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre either of you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 cannibals?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mare smiled and let out a silent chuckle at this, while the stallion laughed. Not just a complete laugh like one would expect to hear after telling a rather funny joke, though. He started with a chuckle, like one would expect if somepony just said a decent joke, switching to hysterical laughter as if he were a mass murderer ready to claim his next victims while staring each one of the colts in the eyes. He stopped as soon as he heard one of them begin to nervously laugh along, and faster than any one of them could blink he was in the middle of the group, slamming his hoof onto the counter, dead serious expression practically plastered on his face. The group of colts began scrambling away from the stallion until the stranger looked at each of them. As they met his gaze they froze in place, almost like they had been turned into statues. All except the bartender, who had picked up the mug that almost broke had the Unicorn not moved it to the countertop with his magic, and began cleaning it some in an attempt to keep calm.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Unicorn said after a moment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are not cannibals. We are here on business, if you are so concerned as to why we are here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what kinda business would that be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the bartender.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here to determine exactly how many ponies are living here. You might say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important business for the Princess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\nEverypony in the bar let out a breath of relief when the Unicorn said this. The regulars got into more relaxed positions, and the bartender filled the mug he was just cleaning with cider. It seemed like the mere mention of the Princess could calm anypony.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave some cider,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the bartender said as he offered the mug to the stallion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the house for you official folk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The stallion looked at the mug, then back at the bartender as he raised an eyebrow. The other patrons watched to see what would happen. After a moment the stallion pushed the mug away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo thanks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said as he turned to walk away. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drink.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Again without a twitch, the Unicorn used his magical powers, this time to open the bar door and raise his and his travelling companion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hoods. As they left he looked over his shoulders at the patrons and bartender. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave a pleasant day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. When the door closed behind him, every glass item in the bar exploded as if a bomb went off in the room. Not another sound was heard from within the bar.</span></div></div>",

This wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the result of the denizens of Maretro choosing to look the couple over for no reason in particular, but instead because the Unicorn stallion used a spell to mask their presence. Until the stallion chooses to drop the spell, not a single pony in all of Equestria would be able to see or hear them, not even one of the Princesses. For all intents and purposes, the couple seemingly no longer existed. But that is beside the point. What is important is that the couple is completely invisible, and not even the most successful detective could find them or listen in on what they said to each other. The mare looked up to view the beautiful colors that came with every setting sun.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhat day is today?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Unicorn asked the Pegasus, breaking the momentary silence.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dTuesday, master\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Pegasus replied.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dGood. That leaves two and a half days to get everything ready before the big day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mare, not being told the complete plan, decided now was as good a time as any to learn what was going on through her master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind my asking, what does happen this Friday?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my birthday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Unicorn said to the Pegasus.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more to it than that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Pegasus said with a slight smile.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dYes. The asteroid known as Fillypenko comes near our planet every century, and this Friday will be the final time it just passes by. My birth was marked by the last coming of this particular asteroid. It is dark magic that keeps me alive to this day and looking like I do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Unicorn added before the Pegasus could ask.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhy choose this town to celebrate your birthday, as well as the coming of Fillypenko? This doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem like the city one would wish to visit to view the asteroid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn order to take brief control of the asteroid Fillypenko, a massive amount of magic will be required. Much more than even I would be able to muster on my own. If the population sign was indeed correct, then there should be enough ponies in this town to give me the power needed to get the asteroid to destroy Canterlot, as well as the Princesses Celestia and Luna.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dFrom what happened at the bar, it would seem the citizens of this town would be reluctant to help in taking out the Princesses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dOh, they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just help. They will be sacrifices. A mass sacrifice equivalent to the entire population of a city this size should provide the sufficient boost in magic I will need to take complete control of this asteroid and prevent it from having control taken away from me, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure the princesses would try. An alternative would be sacrificing the Princesses, but that would be nigh impossible, not to mention it would defeat the entire purpose of calling Fillypenko to destroy them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Unicorn stopped in a quiet, empty park for a moment so he could summon five glass rods, each resembling an orb balanced on a stick. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall have you place these rods made from the glass in that bar around the perimeter of this city. All five must be placed in the ground around the city for my plans to work, they must be buried up to the orb, and must be as evenly spaced as you can get them. I shall wait here, and when you return we will find a hotel to stay until we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re finished.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs you wish, master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Pegasus removed her cloak, revealing her beautiful white fur and cutie mark, a red heart with silver wings. Stretching her wings out as far as they could, she carefully collected the glass rods in her front legs, taking off shortly after at a speed that rivals a bolt of lightning. The resulting sonic boom caused the surrounding buildings\u00e2\u0080\u0099 windows to shatter. Many confused and startled ponies peered out of these destroyed windows, conversing with each other about what might have caused it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Unicorn was certain the rods he had his companion carry were still intact. He infused them with enough magic to prevent any kind of cracking or shattering that might occur from the sonic boom he expected. Even if they shattered like everything else just now, he could summon them again with the freshly shattered glass. Seeing as his companion hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t returned yet, he assumed the glass rods were still perfectly intact and decided to use this time to form the recently shattered windows into two pendant necklaces. The first resembled a three-dimensional version of the Pegasus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cutie mark, with a few more edges due to the material being worked with. The second resembled a three-dimensional teardrop, or perhaps a clear drop of blood, also with a few extra edges from the glass. Satisfied with his handiwork, the Unicorn tucked both of the pendant necklaces into an inside pocket of his cloak.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Moments later the Pegasus returned, seeming more or less exhausted from the ordeal. She donned her cloak as the Unicorn removed the pendant necklaces from his, holding them in the air with his magic.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dMay I ask what these are for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Pegasus asked, looking at the pendant necklaces.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dThis one is for you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Unicorn said, giving his companion the pendant necklace that took on the form of her cutie mark. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will protect you when I cast the spell to sacrifice every pony in this city. Whereas this one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said as he placed the pendant necklace with the drop of blood around his neck, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill protect me and act as a sort of catalyst in directing the energy of the sacrificed ponies for the spell to control the asteroid. But enough of that, I promised to procure a hotel room when you return, and that is what I shall do. Come close.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As the Pegasus came closer, the Unicorn draped a hoof over her, and mere seconds later in a flash of light the two were in the lobby of the local hotel, simply called \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaretro Hotel\u00e2\u0080\u009d.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The teleportation spell countered the previous spell that kept the two completely invisible, and when the two looked up they noticed the clerk at the counter was staring directly at the two. Evidently it was part of the job description to constantly smile and appear friendly, because whatever news station was on the television on the counter was talking about the two ponies standing in this lobby at this moment.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dWelcome to the Maretro Hotel, how may I help you today?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the clerk said, doing a very good job at keeping her friendly appearance.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dWe would like a room with two beds. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have an available one, then two adjacent rooms will suffice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Unicorn said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The clerk looked through the binder in front of her before looking back up to the travelling couple. \u00e2\u0080\u009dAlright, it looks like we have one room left with two beds. Room number\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 One twenty-six. Just let me get the key for you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d The clerk turned to the key rack behind her and grabbed the key for room one twenty-six in her mouth before placing it on the counter. The Unicorn picked it up with his magic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how long do you plan on staying?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dWe will be leaving Friday afternoon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dAlright, that will be about\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Sixty bits, or eighty bits with meals included.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Unicorn placed a bag full of coins on the counter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eighty bits. Thank you for the room.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dHave a pleasant evening!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the clerk behind the counter waved as the couple left.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ever the chivalrous one, the Unicorn held the door for the Pegasus to enter before he himself entered. Absolutely exhausted from the long day and placing of the rods, the Pegasus crawled into the first bed and immediately fell asleep. The Unicorn removed the Pegasus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cloak and placed it on the hook hanging from the door before doing the same with his, revealing his dark fur and cutie mark, or lack thereof. Earlier in life he decided it would be best to remove his cutie mark because he felt it put a constraint on his abilities. For lack of a better phrase, he is now a \u00e2\u0080\u009cblank flank\u00e2\u0080\u009d. But that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter to him. He crawled into the other bed, pulled the blanket over his sleeping companion with his magic, and slowly drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

They took turns washing up, leaving whoever wasn\u2019t washing to make their bed. When they were ready they got dressed in their cloaks and went to the lobby for breakfast. Upon arriving at the lobby, the two ponies were greeted by a different smiling pony at the front desk. This one was a Unicorn and seemed just as cheerful as the pony behind the counter the night before.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dHello, welcome to the Maretro Hotel! How may I help you this morning?\u201d the Unicorn behind the desk said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dGood morning,\u201d the Pegasus began, \u201cwe\u2019re from room one twenty-six, and we\u2019re looking for the caf\u00c3\u00a9 for breakfast. Could you point us in the right direction?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dCertainly, ma\u2019am. It\u2019s just at the end of the hall to the left. The coffee should be ready very soon.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Pegasus thanked the clerk as she and the Unicorn walked to the caf\u00c3\u00a9. They could faintly smell the breakfast selection from the desk, and as they got closer they could tell everything must have been made that day. Muffins of many different flavors from the nearby bakery, fresh orange and apple juices, waffles... and that\u2019s not counting the uncooked foods. There were also many different fruits, packaged bread slices for toasting, a selection of jams and butter for spreading, and hardboiled eggs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dThat\u2019s quite the selection,\u201d the cloaked Unicorn said upon seeing everything available. Using his magic, the Unicorn levitated two plates and began loading them up with food for him and his companion. As he began putting bread into the toaster an Earth pony came in with a pot of coffee. The Earth pony flinched momentarily when she saw the cloaked ponies, but quickly regained her composure and placed the coffee pot on the table near the orange juice. She bowed to the couple before leaving out the same way she came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Satisfied with breakfast, the travelling ponies left the hotel and made their way to the northern edge of the city, the Unicorn using a teleportation spell while the Pegasus flew. Only part of the work was completed with the placing of the crystal rods around the city. Now they had to be connected in some way, the most effective for something this large was digging lines through the dirt. Utilizing a nearby tree, the Unicorn used his magic to break off a large branch. He cut it down to a smaller size and sharpened a point so it would be effective for cutting lines in the dirt.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Pegasus, meanwhile, had landed slightly away from the Unicorn. She looked around for a few moments until she heard something that sounded like a branch breaking from the nearby tree. Investigating it, she noticed the Unicorn working away at the branch that was broken. She cantered over to the Unicorn and waited to hear what the Unicorn had in mind for her today.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dThere you are,\u201d the Unicorn said when he saw the Pegasus. \u201cJust to double check, I will need you to fly over the city and make absolutely sure everything is evenly placed. To help, I will use a spell that will make each rod painfully obvious to you\u2026 and most of everypony with line of sight to the rod.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nodding slightly, the Pegasus flew into the sky above the city. The Unicorn closed his eyes and focused on the crystal rods, channeling a spell into each one to produce a very bright red light. A few moments later, the Pegasus landed next to the crystal rod nearest the Unicorn and removed it from the ground, placing it a few feet closer to the Unicorn. She left again and returned much faster than before, nodding to let the Unicorn know everything was good.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dGood,\u201d the Unicorn began, walking towards the crystal rod closest to him with the sharpened branch following. \u201cNow we can start work on the outer pentagon. It will likely take all day to go around the city completely, so if you get hungry go ahead and get something to eat. I don\u2019t have anything planned for you for the rest of today, but it would be helpful if you removed and replaced the rods so the lines can get finished faster.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Pegasus lifted the first rod out of the ground as the Unicorn brought the branch over the small hole in the ground. He noticed the sharpened part of the branch was too thick and would leave the rods loose in the ground, so he shaved off enough from each side to get the desired size and keep it even. When he was satisfied he stuck it in the ground where the rod was and used his magic to push it in the direction of the next rod, using the edge of the city to help guide them in the right direction.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Right after the third rod the Pegasus left to get some food for her and to bring some for the Unicorn. Wanting to get it done quickly, the Pegasus flew as fast as she could as soon as she cleared the tops of the buildings. She was heading for the caf\u00c3\u00a9 in the hotel they were staying at, but from what she could see there was only a staff entrance that lead to a kitchen right beside the caf\u00c3\u00a9, so she had to go through the front doors and walk through the halls to get to the caf\u00c3\u00a9. She felt terrible leaving her master alone like that, even though he gave her the go ahead to get food when she gets hungry. If not for him, it\u2019s very unlikely she would be around to this day. She\u2019s still not entirely sure if what the Unicorn did to those two Pegasus colts was an excessive punishment, or even why the Unicorn was there when he was, but she is eternally grateful he was there and it is not exaggerating to say she owed him her life.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After eating enough to satisfy her, the Pegasus grabbed a plate full of food for the Unicorn. She wrapped a couple napkins around in an attempt to keep it safe and less likely to spill everywhere when she left. At first she expected someone to stop her from leaving with a plate, but that wasn\u2019t the case. The pony at the counter, the Earth pony from the night before, waved at her and told her to be careful out there. Either she didn\u2019t notice the plate, or she didn\u2019t care. That didn\u2019t matter to the Pegasus. What did matter was her master was probably hungry by now, and she would feel absolutely horrible if she didn\u2019t bring her master something to eat after getting herself something to eat. Using one of her front legs to hold the plate close to her from beneath and the other on top of the plate to keep it balanced, she flew towards the fourth rod, assuming the Unicorn must have made it there with how long she\u2019s been gone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Unicorn was about a couple yards away from the fourth rod. He placed the sharpened branch on the ground to his side and was about to use his magic to remove this rod from the ground when the Pegasus landed in front of him. She placed the covered plate on the ground and removed the rod from the ground, placing it to her side.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dYou should take a rest and eat something,\u201d the Pegasus said, pointing a hoof at the plate on the ground. \u201cI can take care of this while you rest.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dWhile I appreciate the gesture,\u201d the Unicorn began, \u201cthat branch is heavier than it might seem. Don\u2019t hurt yourself trying to help me.\u201d As the Unicorn finished speaking and started eating, the Pegasus lifted the branch with both of her front legs and started cutting where the Unicorn left off. She certainly was struggling, mostly because the awkward way she had to hold it caused her to nearly trip over herself, but also because she had no idea if she was still on the path unless she angled her head uncomfortably so she could see behind her. She eventually made it to the hole in the ground where the rod was placed, and when she was about to put the branch down she felt it slip out of her grasp and saw it just about fall on the rod, if not for the Unicorn taking hold of it with his magic. He placed it back in the ground and started cutting away from them and towards the fifth rod while the Pegasus placed this rod back in its place.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d the Pegasus said, unable to look her master in his eyes. \u201cI should have listened to you, I wasn\u2019t able to-\u201c<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d the Unicorn said as he placed a hoof around his companion\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou did a good job. Obviously it would have been easier if you could look forward as you worked, but I had prepared this stick thinking you wouldn\u2019t want to help. If you still want to help, I can prepare one for you for tomorrow. I will likely need an extra hoof, there will be plenty of going back and forth throughout this city.\u201d The Unicorn continued cutting through the ground as the Pegasus followed, removing the next two rods when it came time to do so.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the lines cut into the ground and the last rod placed back into its spot, the two ponies made their ways back to the hotel. The sun had set when the last line was half finished, making it slightly harder to see as they finished. But now it was done, and the two could relax for the evening. The Pegasus had made sure to grab the plate on her way back, which was rather difficult because she couldn\u2019t see it very well in the amount of light she had. Finally done with the day, the two ponies retired to their beds, hoping tomorrow would go by faster than anticipated.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This morning was very much like the previous one for the two ponies, with only a couple changes. They woke up as the sun rose, washed up, made their beds, got dressed in their cloaks and walked to the caf\u00c3\u00a9 for breakfast. Already knowing how to get there, they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say much to the Unicorn behind the counter. The Pegasus gave a polite wave to the Unicorn clerk while her master just kept walking. While eating they saw the same Earth pony that brought in coffee yesterday, this time bringing in a pitcher of milk. Both of the cloaked ponies wondered in silence about how understaffed the hotel must be if they only saw three ponies working during their stay. Surely there must have been more than just those three ponies working here and the cloaked couple were only around when those three ponies were, but it was quite the coincidence and very unlikely. No matter though, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll all be gone soon enough.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finished with their breakfast, the two ponies once again made their way to the rod at the northern edge of the city. The Unicorn searched around for the branch he used the day before to cut lines in the ground when the Pegasus landed, drawing the Unicorn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention in her direction and that of the branch she was standing next to. He lifted it with his magic and brought it closer while the Pegasus trotted right behind the floating piece of tree.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dDo you remember what you said yesterday?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Pegasus asked, causing the Unicorn to raise an eyebrow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would like to help you with this process.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dVery well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Unicorn said, breaking off another couple of branches from the nearby tree. He sharpened one end of the first branch while smoothing out the rest of that branch. With that branch done, he focused all of his energy in smoothing it out and bending the other one so that it could rest on the Pegasus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back. It was a rather time consuming process, but if the Unicorn rushed the process, the branch would have snapped and he would have had to start it over again. With the two branches ready, the Unicorn placed the bent branch on the Pegasus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back and used a spell to bind the dull end of the sharpened branch to the bent branch.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat should do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Unicorn as he looked at the Pegasus. He had positioned the sharpened branch in a way that caused the Pegasus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hind legs to come up from the ground a few inches. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou probably feel ridiculous, but I was never really good with carpentry. When you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready, lift your backside into the air and slam back down so you can get the branch into the ground. At least then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have all four legs on the ground again instead of just the front two. When you get to a rod, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to remove it and bring the branch through. You will probably be better off if you bring yourself off the ground when you turn and slam the branch into the ground when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready again. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about replacing the rods you remove, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go back and stick them into the ground again. Oh, before I forget\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Unicorn closed his eyes and placed his horn on the Pegasus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forehead, focusing for a few moments. Getting a strange feeling in her mind, the Pegasus closed her eyes as well. She saw a sort of map in her mind, most likely of the city, but with very prominent red lines going through the streets and forming a five pointed star. When she opened her eyes she could see a couple red lines coming from the rod nearby and going into the city.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need you to cut along the lines,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Unicorn said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPretty self explanatory, and as long as everything goes well we should get done with this much faster than yesterday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Unicorn removed the first rod from the ground when he realized something. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think of this before, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad I did now. If you get a building in your way, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to bring the branch out of the ground and resume when the building is no longer in the way. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to go back and find a way to continue the line through the building, without destroying it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Pegasus moved over to where the rod was, chose a line to follow, and slammed the sharpened end of the branch into the ground. As she followed her line the Unicorn used his magic to place his sharpened branch in the ground and began dragging it along the other line, stopping for a moment to place the rod back into the ground. They both went their ways following the lines they chose, only briefly stopping when buildings or other ponies got in their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just a few hours later the two ponies met along the final line roughly halfway through it. Unfortunately, there was a fountain in their way, which would cause more trouble cutting through than through a building. The Unicorn COULD cut through it, but the water that would obviously spill will most likely ruin the lines, which would ruin the spell when he needs to cast it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dHumph,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Unicorn grunted, rather annoyed with the fountain being in the way. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGuess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to move this fountain. What a waste of energy. Oh well, I might be able to use it to my advantage later.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He rested his sharpened branch on the ground to his side and focused on the fountain. It took quite a bit of effort to move it, mostly because he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want the water inside to spill into the line, but also because there were a few pipes beneath it to help circulate the water and prevent algae from forming. It worked, and it certainly looked pretty, but it was in the way and would have more use elsewhere. The Unicorn made sure it was far enough out of the way and brought it towards a seemingly soft patch of ground. He brought it forcefully down on this section of dirt, but the pipes chose not to cooperate. Instead of going into the ground, they managed to force their ways into the main body of the fountain. Deciding this would also work, the Unicorn brought the rest of the fountain down to the ground. The pipes made it the rest of the way through the fountain, and the fountain managed to embed itself in the ground a little. Some water splashed out of the fountain, but nowhere near enough to bother the lines. With the fountain now out of the way, the Unicorn flattened the ground where it was originally standing and filled in the holes where the pipes were pulled from while the Pegasus finished the line.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhat do you know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Unicorn said as he brought the branch thing off the back of his Pegasus companion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was much faster than yesterday. What should we do for the rest of the day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dThese lines stick out quite a bit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Pegasus began. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey also don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t form the\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u0098friendliest\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shape. How are we to be certain somepony won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to disturb the lines?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For the first time in a very long time, the Unicorn had not planned ahead for something. He completely overlooked the fact that some ponies were scared of change, and they might try reverting the ground back to its previously unaltered state. If such an event occurred the spell would most definitely not work, or in the worst possible case, might lash back at the caster of the spell. Shock would probably best describe the look on the Unicorn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. He wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily fond of the idea of death; he was fine with others dying, but he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite ready for the eternal slumber. So much still awaited him in the land of the living, such as taking over the country when he takes out the Princesses tomorrow afternoon. After a moment of staying like this, he spoke.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dI\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Hm. I think I have an idea\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Unicorn faced the line in the ground, closed his eyes, and brought his horn down, sticking it into the line. When he brought his horn up and out, something that resembled a current of electricity flowed inside the line. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, that should take care of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Unicorn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat current of magical electricity goes through each line we dug up, including the ones from yesterday. Anypony that steps on a line will get a nasty shock, and any dirt that falls in should get shot out as well. Just make sure you watch your step. Now go ahead and get to the hotel. I still need to put the rods back into the ground and make some holes in a few buildings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Pegasus listened and flew to the hotel while the Unicorn teleported to the rod on the eastern side of the city. Deciding to save some time the Unicorn put his horn at the hole in the ground and did his normal spellcasting routine to summon two magical buzz saw-like circles to follow the two lines in order to cut the lines for the spell where the two ponies couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. When they run into each other with their fronts, they would dissipate. Now having one less problem to worry about the Unicorn set forth with replacing the rods, teleporting from point to point before getting to the hotel to enjoy some food at the caf\u00c3\u00a9. The next day will certainly take a toll on him, but it will certainly be worth it when he makes the Princesses disappear.</span></div></div>",

Today was their final day in the city of Maretro, as well as the final day for everypony living in this city. The Unicorn turned one hundred today, the asteroid Fillypenko will obliterate most of Canterlot, and a new Equestria will rise from the ashes of Princess Celestia, as well as Luna if she is so unlucky as to be with her sister this day. Both of the travelling ponies performed their morning ritual in silence with smiles on their faces. The Unicorn was smiling because of what he would bring about later in the day, while the Pegasus smiled because her master seemed happy.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The travelling ponies walked to the caf\u00c3\u00a9, stopping momentarily to return the key and to tell the Unicorn at the desk they will be leaving after breakfast today. Fillypenko will be coming around in a matter of hours and the two ponies had everything they brought as well as the pendant necklaces on them, so they had no further use for the room. They did desire one last breakfast here, however, so they continued to the small hotel caf\u00c3\u00a9 and enjoyed their last meal here. They noticed the pony that normally brought in beverages didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring anything in today while they were enjoying their breakfast, but paid no heed to her lack of presence. Everything was full, except of course for what they grabbed to eat and drink, and the couple assumed the pony had already performed her duties for the day. Nothing like getting an early start to a day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finished with breakfast, the two ponies left for the center of town, making sure not to step on the lines they had created the day before. The electric-like energy the Unicorn used to ensure the safety of the lines was slowly fading, but from watching other ponies poke at the lines the spell was still potent enough to knock somepony away. A lesson involving pain is rarely forgotten, but this one will soon be by all but two ponies.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dA pity, really,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Unicorn said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhat is, master?\u00e2\u0080\u009d questioned the Pegasus.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dThese ponies are trying to learn a lesson that will be pointless in the coming hour. They are causing themselves unnecessary torment right before their demise. Which reminds me...\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Unicorn stopped, causing the Pegasus to stop as well. He brought his horn to the Pegasus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pendant, causing a faint glow to resonate from it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere. Now you will be safe while everypony around us perishes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Pegasus thanked the Unicorn, and they continued walking. They soon saw the water fountain from yesterday, a couple ponies around it scratching their heads in confusion about how and why the fountain was moved. Sounds of metal bending and concrete breaking caused most of those curious ponies to run away in fear. The braver ones gave a shot at \u00e2\u0080\u009cbringing justice\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cne\u00e2\u0080\u0099er-do-wells\u00e2\u0080\u009d visiting their city, until a sizeable chunk of concrete that slammed the ground in front of them, as well as a few smaller sized pieces pelted at their heads, sent them joining the other ponies that had fled. Now with nopony to try and interrupt him, the cloaked Unicorn used his magic to bend and warp the fountain into a decorative platform for him and his companion to stand on while the Asteroid did its work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Right on schedule, the asteroid Fillypenko could be barely seen in the sky coming from the west, the orange glow surrounding a large, moving piece of the sky giving it away. A wide smile spread across the Unicorn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face; he had been waiting for this moment since he first learned about blood magic. Plenty of killing, tons of blood, ushering in the beginning of a better Equestria\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and all of it in one day. Not wanting to waste any more time, the Unicorn closed his eyes and began to focus. First he activated his pendant so the blood had somewhere to go besides into the ground, then he began work on activating the circle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The five crystal rods glowed brightly as beams of white light shot from each one into the air, joining at a point above the two ponies. A clear bubble of red energy followed the beams, completely encasing the city and leaving a faint smell of iron in the air. Red light emanated from the lines carved into the ground, also bringing forth the faint smell of iron. The Unicorn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horn began glowing brighter and brighter with each passing moment. Now it was time to sacrifice the ponies.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Slowly at first but steadily speeding up, ponies began to fall over seemingly for no reason. Those ponies were covered in many tiny scratch marks from which their blood was drawn. Pony after pony fell, covered in scratch marks and leaking blood to be harvested magically by the Unicorn. Every last drop flowed to the Unicorn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pendant, giving it a wicked red glow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the blood still flowing to him, the Unicorn switched his main focus to the asteroid. It took a moment, but he managed to grab a hold of it with his magic. At first he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control its trajectory, but with the help of a few more drained ponies he started moving it slightly. His eyes opened, briefly showing his normal eye color before they produced a red light. His consciousness was transferred to the asteroid; it was as if he became the asteroid, flying through the morning sky. He piloted himself closer to the planet and his target came into view: Canterlot. It was still probably a few miles away, but that distance would be closed in a matter of minutes. He brought the asteroid closer and closer to the ground. He knew his plan to obliterate the Princess was fail proof; the Princess would not dare to leave her subjects in the path of danger. The Princess would stay in her castle, utilizing all of her magic in an attempt to steer the asteroid away but to no avail. The Unicorn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grasp on the asteroid was strong already and growing stronger; there were many ponies in the city of Maretro, and their blood was still fueling his magic. He could feel something was trying to move the asteroid away, but his hold on it was too strong for whoever was trying to move it. The asteroid kept going while whoever was trying to stop it kept struggling against it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Canterlot was now in reach of the asteroid. Everypony that couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fly ran around panicking, while most of the Pegasi flew as far as they could. The rest of the Pegasi effectively committed suicide by flying at the asteroid. It was a cute attempt, but they merely burnt to a fine ashy powder as they made contact with it. Even the Wonderbolts were of no use against it, each member joining the ashes floating to the ground. Celestia feebly attempted to push the asteroid away one final time with her magic, but it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough. Her sister Luna would have better luck moving it out of the way, but she was away on official royal business for the next week. Princess Celestia thought about trying to contact her sister when it happened: the asteroid struck Canterlot.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the horrendous sound of hundreds of ponies simultaneously being crushed and burned, the asteroid tore through Canterlot. It was more than large enough to obliterate the previously majestic city as well as half the mountain, but the Unicorn controlling this large rock had other plans for the mountain. He was not entirely used to the size of the asteroid, however, and ended up destroying some of the mountain along with Canterlot, but that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter to him. He still had plenty of mountain to work with, and most importantly he succeeded in destroying the Princess! In his excitement, the Unicorn had let go of the asteroid before setting it on its way back into space, but he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t paying it any attention. Somehow he had been floating while controlling the asteroid, and when he let go he fell right on his back. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Pegasus was still there and helped the Unicorn back onto his hooves. She had many questions for him: What was it like using blood to help with magic? How did he feel now that the Princess was destroyed?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhy does it look like the asteroid is coming right for us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Unicorn gave his companion a quizzical look before turning his attention to the sky. He swore under his breath as he tried to focus on the asteroid, but the pressure was too much for him; he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t focus enough to take hold of it. He kept trying to grasp it with his magic, but it just wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work. The pressure of saving his life as well as the heat emanating from the asteroid was too much for him to handle. He just couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it again, and the blood from the sacrificed ponies had disappeared. He turned to look at his Pegasus companion, but she was nowhere to be seen. She flew away while the Unicorn was trying again to move the asteroid.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Extremely aggravated, the Unicorn tried to teleport away. Unfortunately, he had waited too long and now the asteroid had made its way through the bubble surrounding the city. All the Unicorn could do now was stare at the asteroid in a moment of disbelief. After that moment, it was all over.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The asteroid crushed the city of Maretro beneath it, including the Unicorn. There was now a large crater where there once was a city, and situated in the middle of it rested the asteroid Fillypenko. Far above the city in the sky, the sun had changed color to a blood red. The Princess of the sun was now dead, burnt to nothing when she was struck by the asteroid. Now it was up to Princess Luna to lead Equestria when she gets back to Canterlot, or where Canterlot used to be.</span></div></div>",

I wouldn't really consider this to be a fanfiction because nearly every character (besides the Princesses and maybe another couple ponies) were created by me, and if you wish to post your own addition with your own characters, then those are yours, too. In a way, I consider this to be like those Star Wars books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those of you that really really really want to add on, I highly recommend you use Word or a similar product. No, Notepad and Wordpad do NOT count because they lack the spellcheck function. Please keep all posts at LEAST two paragraphs. Cussing will be allowed (I'll probably use it myself at some point), but remember: This is rated 13+. You should know what that means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would also like to point out that the only MLP: FIM stories I read are My Little Dashie and Cupcakes. Any similarities to other stories are COMPLETELY coincidental because I haven't read them yet. Also, if you have a thing against My Little Pony, then why did you choose to read this? Don't be hatin'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, enough of that. Enjoy the story!</td>",
