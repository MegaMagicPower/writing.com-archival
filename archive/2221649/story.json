You feel the hot air brush against your skin as you pedal across the road and hop up on the roasting sidewalk. You didn't usually mind the warm weather, but you did admit to yourself that today was really hot, good thing you packed some sunscreen before you left. <br>\r\nAs you zoom across the hot surface of the sidewalk you clear an empty road and make a small hop to continue cycling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked forward to today, the Robinson family had been desperate for a babysitter for a while and by a stroke of luck they knew your parents and before you knew it you found yourself to be babysitting for the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the terrain change from asphalt to dirt and then grass as you take a shortcut though what would technically be someones back garden, but you didn't care much knowing that you cycle faster than they run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see their house in the distance as their car pull out from the driveway and head off. They already told you that the door would be unlocked with a pair of keys hidden on a shelf in the kitchen, together with a note on when to make dinner, go to bed and where the snacks were hidden, as well as the password for the TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou park your bike in front of their house, grab your water bottle and open the door.</span></div></div>",
