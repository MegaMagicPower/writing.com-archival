The world was shaken by his birth and despite scientific curiosity, it was deemed best to allow him to grow up as normal as possible. So for much of his life Jim was homeschooled.

He asked not to be put in a carrying case, and he didn't want to attract attention to himself. That and he wanted to avoid the seat after remembering the incident where his father nearly sat on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane was taking them to Moscow, Russia now. But the official would only be there to drop Jim off,while he would be here for the next few years. After searching, the alextroka family was deemed a good host family choice, as the father ivan was a former general and took pride in protecting the \"Rare Human\". After landing they made their way to the house. Walking up to the door the official knocked on the door. The door soon opened, revealing a buff man dressed in a tank top despite the cold. He had white and blond hair, showing his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Ivan Alextroka?\", The official asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes are you the one bringing me the small boy?\", Ivan spoke in a heavy accent. The official nodded, gently picking Jim from his pocket as well as his tiny luggage. He placed both in Ivan's outstretched palm. With a simple glance to Jim the official left to the car and drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door and entering the house they soon arrived in what appeared the living room.\" Viktor our guest is here!\", Ivan yelled into the house. Soon another male entered the room, however this male only had a towel wrapped artound his waist, putting his firm eight pack and pecs on display. His hair was full blonde and closed to shaved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is the small boy\", said Viktor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now take him to your room, I have buisness.\", Ivan explained handing Jim over to Viktor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Viktor walked to his room, he held Jim at chest level. Jim had a close up of Viktor's firm pecs. He could feel the heat emitting from his smooth skin. Soon they arrived in Viktor's room, it was simple, with a queen size bed and nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing Jim on the bed, Viktor stood over him to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, since you will be staying here I'll need to explain some things. When me and my father train he will try to get you involved, make sure to say no. Next, try not to walk alone on the floor. Me and father tend to crush any bug we see, so ask us to carry you somewhere if you need. Understood?\", Viktor explained to which Jim shyly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now then I need to change.\" Viktor then turned around and opened a closet before dropping his towel. Jim found he couldn't look away. Viktor's pale ass looked soft and capable of squishing anything in between them. Slipping on a black tank top and a pair of cargo pants, Viktor was ready.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now you lived alone and worked at a corner store, with little interaction with other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on a simple sweatshirt and sweatpants you sat on the couch, and began to look over the furry artwork you drew on your laptop. You enjoyed drawing anthomorphic animals as you liked giving them different looks. You wished you could live in a world with them, not having to worry about work and not have to be alone anymore. After closing your laptop you began to doze off not noticing the faint glow from your computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up, the air felt different in a way.

You notice a beach umbrella set up, reaching into the sky like a skyscraper. There's wasn't anyone under it though. You began to hear noise coming from the distance. Walking over to a sand hill, you began to scale it. However, upon reaching the top you we're shocked at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant anthromorphic animals were hanging around the beach! You saw bear cubs building a sandcastle, a tiger sitting at a lifeguard tower, and an assortment of different animals swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey we're all acting like humans, so maybe they could help you. Still there was a possibility they weren't friendly. If they see you, they may just stomp you without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon decided to........</span></div></div>",

So if you just asked them, maybe they'd take to whoever had brought them here so that you could try to get some help. And so with keeping this in mind you made your way towards the two bear cubs that were both busy building a sand castle together. Although it did take you a while to get to the two bear cubs location. But once you did you saw both were male, along with this you noticed that one looked taller then the other which meant that he must have been twelve while the smaller one must have been ten years old. This made you a little more relaxed as being that age they would surely be more understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you walked up pass their huge sand castle and called to them with, \"Excuse me, you two. But you wouldn't happen to know where an adult is would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after you had said this though you saw both of the brown furred cubs stop what they were doing and look at you with shocked eyes. And as they continued to look at you the oldest one replied back with, \"Did you just talk to me and my brother? And....what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did. And I'm what's known as a human.\" You answered back, before you a huge shadow engulfed you and the two cubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this happened you felt the oldest cub reach out and then hold in one of his hands of his hands when a deep voice asked, \"Hey, boys. I saw that you had stopped making your sandcastle. Did you find something interesting or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing this you were turned around with the brown furred young anthro child to face who had just talked. Once that had been done you found your eyes widen and your heat up with a light blush when you saw an adult anthro grizzly bear who was wearing a tight red speedo. Not only that, but he didn't have amount of fat on him at all as he had large six pack abs and two large pectorals. Your attention was quickly broken away form staring at him when the youngest cub said with joy in his voice, \"Yeah! We found something called a human. Isn't that cool..</span></div></div>",

Mostly because it didn't appear like he was with anyone else other then the two bear cubs. And just by the way his brown eyes were looking at you, you wondered if perhpas he was attracted to men instead of women. This thought was kept in your mind especially when you saw him squat down until his face was right in front of you. Once that happened you saw one of huge hands move towards the oldest cub while he asked, \"Well, if boys don't mind, why don't you hand the little human over to me. I mean you boys wouldn't want him to get lost or hurt while you're playing would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, you're right, Uncle Bill. That'd probably pretty scary for him at his size.\" The cub let out, before you were handed off to the huge anthro bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done the cubs Uncle stood up to his full height and began to walk away as he replied, \"That's what I like to hear. Yeah youa nd your brother keep having fun playing in the sand while I take our little friend here back to where our stuff is.\" However, while he was walking away form his nephews the heavily muscled anthro bear decided to....</span></div></div>",

But as you made your way towards him you couldn't help but over him when he commented in a deep voice, \"Phew, another great workout today. Too bad none of the younger guys seemed to be that impressed or interested in me while I was working out.\" You then felt yourself feeling a bit bad for the pure white furred anthro as he put the towel over his shoulders followed by letting a heavy sigh and then added, \"Although I guess I shouldn't be that surprised since I bet quite a few of these guys are already in a relationship, or they just don't want one right now. It's too bad really, I guess this forty five year old fox struck out again today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Woah wait a minute he just said his forty five years old. Although I guess these giant anthros age differently then humans do.\"</i> You thought to yourself, while you continued to make your way towards him. Once you had done this though you went on with, \"<i>\"Although if I remember right when animals get older it normally shows in their faces. So he most likely just has a few wrinkles, or his fur is starting to gray out or something....\"</i> Once you were standing in front of him though you found yourself blushing when you saw his large muscled legs followed by his covered bulge and then six pack abs and large muscled chest that blocked out his a tiny bit. You then found yourself letting out a whistle from being impressed while you continued, \"But I have to admit he looks pretty good for an anthro who is that old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly covered your mouth when you saw the fox's left ear twitch before he started to look form left to right as he asked, \"Huh? Who just said did that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so seeing your chance you jumped and down with your arm waving in the air once you had shouted, \"Down here! Look down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing so however, you felt the blush form earlier quickly returning once you saw him look down at you with his light blue colored eyes. You then saw him squat down in front of you as he whispered, \"Hey, was that you I just heard whistling at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head up while you saw his right hand come down before you found yourself being engulfed inside of it. After this happened you saw nothing but darkness as the arctic fox got back onto his feet and you then felt him walk somewhere. This did not last for long though as you quickly found yourself inside of a large locker with the arctic fox standing in front of it with his hands on his hips and with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw him lean a bit closer to you while he commented, \"Hmm, you know now that I get a better look at you from here. I've got to say that even though you're small you're pretty cute, son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon saying this you saw the fox wink at you which caused your heart to skip a beat while you let out, \"T-Thank you, sir. A-And can I just tell  you that you look amazing for your age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had uttered these words you saw the giant anthro give you a big smile before he replied, \"Well that's awfully kind of you to say, young man. But there's no need to be nervous. And there's definitely no need to say sir when you're talking to me. Just call me, Fredrick.\" He then winked at you for a second time when he added, \"Or you can also call me Daddy if you'd like as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay, I'll keep that in mind....\" You stuttered out, as you still couldn't believe that your fantasy might be becoming real. You then smiled up at him though while you added, \"By the way my name's Jacob. And it's very nice to meet you, Fredrick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you, cutie.\" The giant fox responded back with, before you felt your face turn a dark shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis happened because right after he had said this the well muscled anthro had moved away from the locker and had two of fingers on the inside of his workout shorts.

Short brown hair, brown coat, and black trousers. However, in person his oddities shined thourgh. Most noticeably that he was only an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for some background. Ivan was once a 5\u20197 guy living by himself with no family. The one person he had in his life was his best friend Winston. The 6\u20195 man was always available for help and moral support, and became like a brother to Ivan. Unfortunately, this brotherhood came to an end when Winston was killed by a mugger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan became like a zombie, feeling despaired at the loss of his friend. He wanted to bring his friend back, and he believed he found a way. Ivan\u2019s father had studied alchemy in the past and after he passed away, Ivan was left with all his notes. One picture caught his eye along with it\u2019s description, claiming that he could bring somebody back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving believed he found a way to see his friend again, he followed the instructions to perform the human transmutation. As the circle glowed, Ivan grew hopeful he would see his friend again. However that wasn\u2019t the case as the energy grew out of control and Ivan found himself blacking out. Waking up, he saw a large door behind him and a hunched over luminous figure. The figure looked up at Ivan with what he could only describe as the biggest grin ever. Ivan began to feel lightheaded and before he blacked out again,he could of sworn the smile began to fill his sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up, Ivan immediately noticed the problem, he was one inch tall naked in his former clothes. Over the next couple of days he was able to get by, as he discovered he could now perform alchemy freely without a circle. This allowed him to make new clothes and get around his gigantic apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week passed, his life faced another change. While sitting on his floor he heard his door open. He remembered he hadn\u2019t locked the door as few people bothered him. He soon felt booming footsteps make way to the room he was in and was greeted by a military giant. The giant had black hair and a pair of gloves with alchemy symbols. As the giant continued his advance, Ivan faced a problem. He was in the giant\u2019s path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis started a two minute challenge of Ivan trying to get the giant\u2019s attention, all the while having to dive out the way of his boot. The giant didn\u2019t take notice and simply investigated the apartment, unaware of the man he almost kept crushing. Eventually Ivan got the idea in the form of a dust ball. Approaching the dust, he clapped his hands creating a familiar glow. This caught the eye of the giant who came towards the light squinting and widening his eyes at the sight of the tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan watched in anticipation as the giant got on his knees and leaned forward towards him,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, hello I am Colonel Mustang, and I\u2019ve come here for Evan Kirkland.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell uhhh, I\u2019m Ivan Kirkland. And I\u2019m sorry to say but Evan Kirkland isn\u2019t here anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that awkward introduction, Ivan was thrown into his new life. Albeit hesitantly, Colonel Mustang carried him back to his office. After he was looked at, it was decided he would be a ward of the military and under it\u2019s \u201cprotection\u201d. Well more like under the Colonel\u2019s protection. The man who Ivan now called Roy often had him sit on his desk, though he was kind his flirtatious attitude did get old sometimes. Luckily Lieutenant Hawkeye limited his behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome other people Ivan came to known were the Elric brothers. Both having gone through a similar experience, were sympathetic and became friends. Though both were different. Edward seem to display childish glee that there was someone not only older but smaller then him. Alphonse was very kind and often apologized for his brother\u201ds outbursts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajor Armstrong was another person he became associated with. The already giant sparklingly man was very kind to Ivan. Almost to a fault however, as his hugs were both comforting and made him feel like he was about to pop being squeezed between his pecs. It didn\u2019t help that he often wanted Ivan to join him for workouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Ivan sat on Roy\u2019s desk as he grumbled over his paper work, he simply read a page of the book Edward lend. After an hour he had only read five pages due to his size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill this day would have more for Ivan as........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was remembered as the kind small friend that could put a smile on their faces. However as they won more and increased their skill, the team grew further apart in their friendship. Eventually at the end of junior high, he was asked which high school he was attending by the team. All he could do was shake his head as tears fell from his eyes and run from the voices of his former friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he attended Seirin High, while the team went to different schools. Although he thought he could feel a familar presence when he walked by the gym, he avoided going in.

The species however had one distinct feature, they only grew to a inch and a half tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new species appeared around the end of the 20th century. At the time only a few have been discovered, however after being shown to be intelligent creatures more appeared and came to a population of 500,000. With this new species joining humanity, changes were made so they could exist peacefully. There were very few cases of crime targeting the species which were called \u201cTines\u201d. Still for most schools and clubs, humans and tines had to be in separate groups to ensure safety.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00e2 \u20ac\u201d\u2014\u2014<br>\r\nA tiny twelve year old boy sat on one of the window ledges surrounding the big body of water in front of him. The boy and his father had come to the Iwatobi Swimming club, hoping to join a swim team. He was devastated when he learned there wasn\u2019t a tiny team. The blond couch attempted to cheer him up, saying he could start up a tiny team next year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy in question was named Tai Yamazaki. Despite being a tiny, he lived with a family of humans. It didn\u2019t matter as both his parents loved him, and his brother would help him swim in the sink and bath. His brother was however slightly overprotective. He had felt drawn to the water since he took his first bath and wanted to be able to join a team that shared his passion. But it seems he would have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai\u2019s father had gotten a call and decided to let his son explore the pool area as he went outside to talk. Right away Tai noticed the lack of tiny aid tools, and his experience didn\u2019t get better when the blond couch walked in and nearly squished Tai under his foot. Noticing the tiny, the couch apologized profusely and set him on a windowsill to watch his team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, are you new here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai was brought out of his thoughts by an unfamiliar voice. Looking up he saw a boy looming over him, with brown hair, green eyes, and looked to be the same age as him. Tai was always shy around unfamiliar people, so his response was a little awkward. \u201cI-um, came t..to join the swim twin. But there..wasn\u2019t a tiny team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green eyed boy frowned before glancing away and looking back with a smile. \u201cWe just finished up practice, do you want to take a dip in the pool?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai looked surprised at the offer. \u201cB-but I might get in the way of someone. Also I haven\u2019t swam in water that deep\u201d, the boy rambled while the giant just shook his head and placed his palm in front of Tai. \u201cIt\u2019s ok, I can help you out. Everyone should be able to swim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a breath, Tai nodded before walking onto the bus sized palm. Sitting down he felt the soft ground and looked up as the giant lifted his hand up. \u201cI\u2019m...uh Tai Yamazaki\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you Yamazaki-Kun. My name is Tachibana Makoto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice t-to meet you Tachibana-Kun\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto gently dipped Tai into the water, making sure to check that he wasn\u2019t sinking at any point. Tai had the time of his life, feeling like he was in a ocean. After a few minutes, Makoto picked Tai up in his cupped palms and smiled at the happy look on the Tiny\u2019s face. Tai soon got to meet Makoto\u2019s teammates, this time he was less awkward. The boy called Nagisa excitingly greeted him, saying how adorable he looked. Haruka gave a mere nod in greeting, which was better then nothing. And then there was the maroon haired Rin, he seem really friendly but his sharp smile sent chills down Tai\u2019s spine. Lastly, the tiny formally met the couch Goro. Who apologized again for nearly smushing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite saying goodbye, it wasn\u2019t the last Tai saw of the boys. He made sure to show up for the races and always congratulate them. Despite not swimming, Tai and the team grew close and had fun together. From building Tai a sandcastle to Rin acting as his own personal cruise ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the good times soon came to end. Tai himself didn\u2019t know the full details, but as they entered junior high the group separated. Tai stayed in touched with Makoto and Haru and still hung out. Still, Tai hoped one day they could rekindle.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai woke up rubbing his eyes. He got up from his bed that sat on his brother\u2019s nightstand, he frowned looking at the empty giant bed. While Tai decided to attend Iwatobi high school, his brother was off to Samezuka academy. He looked at a large photo next to him, it was Tai sitting on his brother\u2019s head smiling while the giant looked up annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed, Tai made his way to the front porch and waited...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai began to feel tremors from the ground, but he remained unfazed. He still didn\u2019t react even when two giant orange shoes began coming towards him, carrying a true titan with them. Tai remained calm despite the ground shaking and watching one of the shoes crush a weed growing from the sidewalk. Finally the two feet stopped in front of Tai, and looking up he didn\u2019t see the sole of the shoe but rather a familiar smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Tai-Kun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood morning Makoto!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto bend over, before scooping up Tai into his palm and lifting him up to his shoulder. Sitting on the giant\u2019s shoulder, Tai felt like he had a bird\u2019s eye view from his seat as makoto continued his tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking their way to Haruka\u2019s, the two boy chatted up talking about the school year. Tai wasn\u2019t sure how but he ended up nuzzling into Makoto\u2019s warm neck. The giant twitched in surprise but attempted not to move to disrupt his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at Haru\u2019s, he wouldn\u2019t open the door. So Makoto and Tai made their way inside and sure enough there Haru layed in his bathtub. \u201cHaru, come on we have to go to school,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Haru stood up before his attention fell on Tai. \u201cHmm. Tai-Kun do you want to join me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmhhu....maybe later!\u201d, Tai stammered trying to hide his blush.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they arrived at school, Tai had to be dropped off at his tiny classroom. He was placed on the ground, watching as his friends loomed over him and said goodbye the boys walked away, their booming footsteps decreasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat in class, Tai couldn\u2019t help but think of his friends. Makoto was like a Titan who could crush you in one step. And Haru looked like he would have no problem squishing someone. He could imagine both raising their soles over him and engulfing him in foot flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClasses soon ended for the day. Just as Tai began to leave.......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tai's brother was named Sousuke Yamazaki, and he wasn't just a big brother because of his age. He had been Tai's best supporter when it came to swimming, though he had been reluctant when they were younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the hall, Tai took notice of the booming footsteps of the humans walking by and decided to make his way outside using the tiny walkway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving outside, Tai began a long conversation with Sousuke. Telling him about his first day, asking him about Samezuka, and gushing over the pool in a picture his brother sent him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sign ups for clubs are tommarow, I was wondering if you wanted to hang out tonight?\", Sousuke asked over the phone. \"Huh? Are you sure that's ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I have enough time before curfew, I'll be waiting at the gate to pick you up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so when they ended their phone call, Tai texted Makoto to tell him to go home without him. Although confused, Makoto eventually agreed telling him to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out to the almost empty front gate, Tai saw a tall brown haired human standing in a Samezuka uniform. As the giant spotted the tiny, he smiled before crouching down and placing his palm on the ground in front of Tai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai wasted no time in running onto the soft surface and embracing the thumb. Sousuke smiled down at his brother, rubbing the top of his head with a finger. Standing up he began to walk away from the school, holding Tai close to his strong chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...where are we going?\", Tai asked his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSousuke grinned as he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured we go......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These differences included the birthmark on his shoulder, his part European ethnicity, and the fact that he was only an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan\u2019s life was one shrouded in mystery, the source of his small stature couldn\u2019t be determined as both his parents were average in height and had no recall of any strange happenings before his birth. The stress of taking care of a child is one thing, but Ryan had to be constantly watched to prevent him from getting into danger. Eventually the stress drove both of his parents apart, and Ryan\u2019s father was left to take care of him alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking for a change to better their life\u2019s, Ryan\u2019s father Akio moved them back to his home in Miyagi when Ryan was six years old. Coming back to his homeland, Akio reconnected with his old friend Hinata Hikari. Meeting for the first time in a while they brought their kids with them. However, Ryan was extremely shy as he had not interacted with any kids his age before. Despite this, meeting and befriending Hinata Sh\u014dy\u014d was one of the best things in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young ball of sunshine looked in awe at the tiny boy his age, sitting in his father\u2019s cupped palms. Assuring Akio he would take care of his son, Hinata held his hands out still as if made of stone, when Akio placed Ryan into the smaller palms. While the parents talked, Hinata tried to talk to Ryan. Keyword \u201ctried\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo What you like to do!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c......\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this your first time in japan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c......\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRyan. That name sounds so cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c......\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan brought his gaze up from the peach colored hand holding him to the concerned face of Hinata. \u201cAren\u2019t you.....weirded out by my size?\u201d, he timidity asked. Hinata\u2019s face morphed into confusion and Ryan brought his head down preparing for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up in surprise, Ryan found Hinata brightly smiling down at him. \u201cI think it\u2019s cool! I\u2019ve never met someone like you, I think your size makes you unique!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan for the first time in a while, smiled in happiness.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nThe friendship between Ryan and Sh\u014dy\u014d stuck all the way to high school. There wasn\u2019t a day when Sh\u014dy\u014d\u2019s happiness wasn\u2019t contagious. Despite his high energy, Sh\u014dy\u014d was always careful and gentle whenever he carried or hung around Ryan. Sh\u014dy\u014d expressed his interest in volleyball and desire to join a team and while Ryan couldn\u2019t help Sh\u014dy\u014d prepare properly, he could help him in his own way. This included making a net from sticks and a leave, and Ryan passing a ball of string for Sh\u014dy\u014d\u2019s finger to serve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had fun doing this sort of game, even if Sh\u014dy\u014d kept accidentally smashing the net.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nLow and behold, Sh\u014dy\u014d made the volleyball team and Ryan was happy for his friend. However, with this achievement came a problem. Sh\u014dy\u014d had always brought Ryan home, and had he not been an inch tall he may have been able to go alone. It didn\u2019t help that Akio\u2019s job went a few hours over the school schedule, and Ryan had to wait in the office the whole time intill his father arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Ryan, Sh\u014dy\u014d had stressed the issue to his captain asking if he could help in any way. Eventually a solution was reached and Ryan was surprised when Shoyo told him he could stay with him at practice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Ryan sat in Sh\u014dy\u014d\u2019s palm as he entered the gym, though he covered the tiny with his other hand as he was nervous of how his team would react. He didn\u2019t exactly explain the full details of Ryan\u2019s situation, most notably that he was so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Hinata you\u2019re here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Yeah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA teen with a large built approached Sh\u014dy\u014d, and Ryan could feel the hand holding him begin to tremble nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when is your friend going to arrive?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe...is already...here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen looked confused at Sh\u014dy\u014d\u2019s answer. Before he could question him further, Sh\u014dy\u014d uncovered his hand and held up Ryan for his captain to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan blinked, adjusting to the change in lighting. Looking up he saw the shocked face of Sh\u014dy\u014d\u2019s captain staring down at him. Attempting to ease the tension, Ryan stood up and bowed. \u201cHello my name is Ry-Saito Ryan\u201d, he internally cured at his improper introduction. \u201cThank you for allowing me to stay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, no problem\u201d, the captain began to bring his hand down for Ryan to shake but quickly pointed his finger instead. \u201cI\u2019m the team captain Sawamura Daichi and no problem, Hinata talks about you a lot\u201d, Ryan shook Daichi\u2019s finger and the both of them soon smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their meeting, Daichi called over the team to introduce Ryan. Upon meeting them, he received mixed reactions. One bald guy and black and blond guy dramatically yelled, a grey haired boy looked in curiosity, and a blond boy with glasses stared uninterested. <br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nThe practice went on without any incidents, minus a stray ball hitting the bleachers near Ryan and Sh\u014dy\u014d full of panic yelling if he was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan continued staying after school and enjoyed watching the team practice and do matches. Over time he got to know the other boys, and developed certain relationships with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaichi - The captain always ensured Ryan was safe whenever they practiced and like Sh\u014dy\u014d seem to fret even if the smallest thing happened. If he was every teased by other students Daichi would appear behind Ryan like a wrathful titan to terrify the bullies. He also got a text from Ryan one night showing him sitting on a volleyball, saying \u201cDon\u2019t worry Sh\u014dy\u014d\u2019s with me.\u201d. It left a sweet feeling in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom-I mean K\u014dshi - The boy seem to have the essence of a caring mother embedded in him. He always helped Ryan and even brought him treats at times. He always encouraged the tiny whenever he felt down. Ryan felt like he can see holy light whenever K\u014dshi gives him a gentle hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobio - Despite the heated arguments he got into with Sh\u014dy\u014d, Ryan and him got along quite well. He would carry Ryan around if he needed something, it also helped that Ryan didn\u2019t know of his \u201cking\u201d title. Though Ryan did note Tobio acted a little tsundere-ish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRy\u016bnosuke - The bald hothead after getting over the shock of seeing Ryan, became friendly with him. Though this friendship led to what can only be described as manly bonding. Ry\u016bnosuke often spent his time placing Ryan in between his muscles, telling him to \u201cadmire your senior!\u201d It didn\u2019t help when he was called senpai, and happily squeezed Ryan between his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKei - The blond beanstalk didn\u2019t spare Ryan from his teasing, one of the first things he said being \u201ccongratulations Hinata, you\u2019re not the tiniest anymore.\u201d. Most his teasing involved him hovering his foot over Ryan and stomping down, missing him by a few inches. Although he claimed he didn\u2019t see him, Ryan couldn\u2019t believe him when he said it with a smirk.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday Ryan waited in the living room with his father. The team had an event today and he was invited as well. Soon they both heard the bell and Akio got up to answer the door. Soon Sh\u014dy\u014d walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased on his clothing, the event was confirmed as a......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If anything, he disliked when bullies stopped hovering their feet over him or grabbing him in tight fists. This was both a reveal to Naru and his bullies, that he might be a masochist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was also very expressive in his flirting with other boys. While others freaked out at seeing a tiny guy their age sitting on their foot while they shower, Naru saw it as simple manly bonding. It was good he took track as he would always outrun the pissed off guys who tried to crush him for peeping on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the shower in the locker room was a great place to hang out, Naru\u2019s favorite place to hang out was the gym. Preferably after school when the volleyball club practiced. Reason why, those uniforms showed all the muscles the boy\u2019s possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team didn\u2019t seem to mind Naru hanging around, heck when he arrived he always got a cheerful welcome from the captain Bokuto. The owlish captain always helped him around, and in fact seem to enjoy manly bonding as well, not minding the boy climbing his muscles at all. Though when Naru suggested Bokuto use him as a seat cushion, he laughed it off thinking it was a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn\u2019t stop Naru from trying. He would wait Intill Bokuto would take a break and just as he began to sit, Naru rushed in and lied down. It was amazing to watch the perfect rump lower onto him. However, just as he got heated up and the muscles applied pressure, it stopped. Bokuto stood up and looked down in shock before giving numerous apologies, and Naru smiled despite internally screaming as he watch the captain jog away instead of sitting on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiji the vice-captain took notice of all of Naru\u2019s attempts to get close to the captain. He thankfully was rather calm about the boy\u2019s desires and even offered to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while Bokuto was off chatting with the other members, Keiji slipped Naru into Bokuto\u2019s gym bag. If caught, he told Naru to say he simply slipped in before zipping the bag up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile of staying in the slightly musky bag, Naru felt the bag begin to shift and swing. He could hear voices speaking outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Where\u2019d Naru go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe probably went home early.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, you think he\u2019s mad that I almost squashed him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, if anything I think he would enjoy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the voices said goodbye, and the bag continued to swing. Looking at the clothes, Naru decided to find a piece of clothing for when Bokuto got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided on...........</span></div></div>",

Starting high school, if someone approached Mukuro they would finding Ushijima looming over him with a aura of intimidation. All with a stoic face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went through high school, Ushijima became...more forceful. He would grab Mukuro without asking, take him into the shower with him, and even place him on his nude body. All with the same stoic look on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went to they extreme when one day Mukuro stayed after with his friend for volleyball practice. He originally was going stay in the locker due to his uniforms lack of pockets. However, Ushijima said he had a place to put him. This led to him pulling the front of his tight gym shorts, he then placed Mukuro beneath his penis and on top of his balls. The tiny boy looked up in shock as his stoic friend let go of the band sealing him in the hot and musky darkness <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMukuro sat against the large smooth balls, getting coating in sweat and olive pubic hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ushijima it stinks in here. I'm gonna smell for days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant simply grasped his crotch and gave a good squeeze. \"Good, everyone will know you belong to me.\", the giant let out a sigh as he felt his friend thrash around in his manhood. Ushijima then went to practice, though it was difficult with the pleasure he felt in his tight shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the two became more close. A lot of practices for Mukuro were stays in Ushijima's pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was another practice, and it started out with....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Practice was over but these two stayed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUshijima was sitting down, leaning against the wall. His arms behind his head making his purple and white uniform squeeze his muscles. He had his eyes closed and was sighing with a faint blush. Down lower, his manhood was out as he lacked his gym shorts. Mukuro was wrapped around his friend\u2019s large member, his arms barely reached all the way around the veiny muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMukuro was humping his friends penis in hopes of getting him hard. Ushijima said he could simply jack off a little to get his member to grow, but the tiny wanted to do it himself. It seem to be working as the muscle became less limp and Mukuro felt precum dripping from the tip. Grinning at his success, he looked up at Ushijima panting harder and beginning to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan...I..start now?\u201d, the giant panted out with a almost pleading gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMukuro nodded. \u201cYeah just lift up your balls for me!\u201d, the tiny yelled as he climbed down between Ushijima\u2019s mountainous thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUshijima brought his large hand and grasped his testicles, lifting them enough for Mukuro to climb under. Once under, Mukuro felt the heavily and warm flesh settle on him. The weight, smell, and noise from above made Mukuro hard as well, and he began to touch himself as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, up above. Ushijima began stroking his foreskin, the movement beneath his balls helped stimulate him further. This was one of the greatest pleasures he could experience, and it all belong to him. He was the only one who got to enjoy Mukuro\u2019s heavenly touching. The tiny boy was his and his alone. Finally with a loud grunt, Ushijima released his load. The white substance spread over his thighs and between his legs. As he panted he looked down to Mukuro crawling out from underneath his balls, covered in semen as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScooping his friend up to his face, Ushijima licked all over Mukuro\u2019s body. Tasting the sour and oddly sweet taste, Mukuro was lathered in his giant\u2019s saliva. After his licking was done, Ushijima pressed his lips against the tiny\u2019s body. Mukuro gave a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah...so..what do you..wanna do now?\u201d, Mukuro tiredly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUshijima decided to......</span></div></div>",

As he woke up he began to hear voices, one of which sounded very familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAr...yo...re..abo...is..ro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou..eaking..out too much he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices soon became clear to Rin, however as he opened his eyes, his jaw dropped. A pair of tired pink eyes were staring down at him. The thing that surprised him was that this face was giant and filled his sky. \u201cOh, you\u2019re awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHH!\u201d, in the shock of the moment Rin scooted away from the blue haired giant as fast as he could. Doing so however, he felt himself fall of a ledge. He screamed as he fell, when suddenly a familiar voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRin-Kun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy\u2019s fall was cushioned by a soft surface. Rin heard a large sigh of relief from above and felt his ground shift. Looking around he saw he had fallen onto the peach colored hand of another giant, looking up the towering orange sleeve Rin saw the giant\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa...Mahiru?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru gave a nervous smile before bringing his hand up to his face. \u201cHello..Rin-Kun, I\u2019m sorry you had to wake up like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin still looked bewildered. \u201cMahiru what\u2019s going on? Where\u2019s that other giant? In fact, how are you a giant!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru chuckled a little. \u201cWell I guess now\u2019s a good time. Rin-Kun I would like for you to meet Kuro.\u201d Bringing his palm forward, Rin saw the tired looking giant across from them at what appeared to be a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuro simply waved his hand. \u201cYo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking a few times, Rin cleared his throat. \u201cAlright, now can you tell me why I\u2019m so small.\u201d<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m a vampire now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m now you\u2019re....subclass?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh Huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t know why I shrunk!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you angry Rin?\u201d, Kuro quirked an eyebrow at the mad look of the tiny. Rin facepalmed, not only did he have a vampire master. But he was a lazy, neet, vampire master!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRin-Kun it\u2019s ok, how about I go get some of your things and you get to know Kuro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin wanted to protest, but he had nothing to lose. Luckily his bag didn\u2019t shrink with him, so Mahiru was able to use his key. Soon the brunette left, and the master and subclass were alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...do you give me commands or something?\u201d, Rin asked looking up at a Kuro from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master shrugged. \u201cI dunno, you can do whatever ya want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what do you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuro tilted his head slightly. He then brought his hand down in front of Rin, causing him to back away and make Kuro sighed annoyed. \u201cCalm down I\u2019m not gonna hurt ya. Now climb on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObeying the orders, Rin crawled onto the large pale palm. He fit easily in the middle like a pea. Standing up, Kuro walked over to a TV, and picked up a game controller with his other hand. After sitting down crisscrossed, Kuro placed Rin on his large white-clad thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuro began playing a fighting game, all while Rin gazed up at his master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want, you can move around. Just don\u2019t go too far I don\u2019t want to have to look for ya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin looked around, from his perch on the thigh he could see Kuro\u2019s large plump feet, bare and soft looking. There was also the waist band that could lead to the package in front or back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin did feel a little excited.being small meant always looking up at others. Now, it was on a larger scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin decided to go..</span></div></div>",

Now then \"Master\", how did I get this small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLawless placed a finger under his chin. \"Hmm, I'm not sure Rin-tan. I was only expecting a pair of fangs but this is much more drastic. On the plus side you do look rather cute!\", Lawless grinned flashing a thumbs up. Rin only frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi Hyde who are you talking to?\". Rin heard a voice call, entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking past his master's fingers, the new vampire saw a tallish boy walking in with a black hoodie, black and white hair, white pants, and a pair of black boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah~ Licht-tan, come meet my new subclass!\", Lawless excitingly ran up to the boy. Rin could've sworn he'd seen the teen somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicht looked down at the boy in his servamp's palm with his annoyed gaze. He had a strong urge to deliver a kick, but didn't want to risk the subclass's safety. \"What did you do to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What nothing, this was just a strange side effect or something! Oh that reminds me I need to check something, you can get to know Rin-tan!\", Lawless quickly said as he (roughly) shoved Rin into Licht's hand before running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicht looked annoyed at the tiny boy in his Hand. \"Honestly, why does he have to bring such trouble home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tick mark appeared on Rin's head.

Kurapika loomed over you, worried. As great as you felt beneath his feet, you were his best lead on the Phantom Troupe's location. He started fussing over your broken body when suddenly his face relaxed, and he broke out into laughter:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I forget about my Holy Chain! I can't believe I was so worried.\" he quickly conjured the cross-shaped chain on his thumb and wrapped it around you. At your size it didn't take much nen to heal you, and soon your chest had reformed. Even your legs had healed completely, leaving no sign that they had been pulverized under Kurapika's shoe only minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmiring his handiwork, Kurapika grinned darkly as he realized that thanks to his nen he could be as rough as he wanted with his new toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you were still recovering both mentally and physically from your ordeal. As you lifted your shirt to check for scars, for any sign of what had just happened to you, the air suddenly became a lot thicker. Looking up you saw that Kurapika had surrounded you with his feet, once again forcing you to breathe the foul air around his soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that your legs are better, how about that massage?\" the smug grin was back in full force with the confidence that he could do anything he wanted to you if you refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait a second.\" you panted, still shaken by your brush with death. Each gasp filled your lungs with Kurapika's foot musk, \"Give me a minute to catch my breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurapika frowned at that, and grabbed you by the chest with his toes before you could react. You struggled as hard as you could to get out, the smell between his toes was the most potent yet. But as hard as you struggled you couldn't so much as budge the toes that were lifting you into the air. The situation almost made you want to laugh. You, an experienced nen user who had worked for some of the most dangerous groups in the world, had been bruised, battered, and broken by the bare feet of a novice Hunter. You couldn't even get out from between his toes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were pulled out of your self pity by a sharp pain at your sides. Kurapika was squeezing you with his toes, and squeezing hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You clearly don't understand your situation.\" the pressure increased even more. You weren't sure how much more your ribs could take, and sure enough the first once gave out with a-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CRACK</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I tell you to give me a foot rub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CRACK</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CRACK</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his foot again, leaning forward to watch you writhe in agony for a moment before conjuring his healing chain and mending your ribs for the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurapika looked down at you, pinned between his toes, and said darkly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now....\"</span></div></div>",

They'd never gotten along even at school..but the confusion brought on by them all being in this strange land had everyone on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was unsure where they were and their compasses and any form of survival skills didn't seem to be doing much good. \"Gee, some good camp has done us...\" Tai grumbled as he stomped along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Matt and Tai had gotten into an argument which led to a bit of a fight. They were separated by the others and Tai stormed off on his own...despite the pleas from the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai was still seething, and he needed something to take his anger out on...that was when he felt a crunch under his large shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down to see what he'd stepped on, his eyes narrowed in slight confusion as he squatted down to see what appeared to be a tiny hut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to his shoe, a tiny...human-looking creature was squeaking up profanities at him and gesturing to the hut he'd just crushed into nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow, Tai reached down two enormous fingers and plucked the squirming being up to inspect. Holding it before his gargantuan eye, he was able to see it was indeed at least human in appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the being produced a spear and poked him in the eye! \"Yeowch!\" Releasing the tiny to clutch the affected area, Tai cared not as the tiny fell to its death miles down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what the heck is everyone's problem today?!\" Tai roared and stomped a foot down on the corpse of the fallen bugman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA multitude of squeaks were heard and Tai put his hands on his hips and gave a mischievous grin, \"I think I just found a way to take the edge off...\"</span></div></div>",

You see, Medusa had formed a plan to get rid of a particularly powerful student here at DWMA. One who could be a nuisance to her ambitions. Of course she persuaded you to do the dirty deed yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used a shrinking spell to make you a mere 1 inch in size. She deposited you outside of Black*Star's home, and gave you a potion to grow back to normal size once you were inside and ready to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, the potion was mere club soda. Medusa had grown tired of you and this was her way of getting rid of you AND taking the heat off of her being a suspect of the 'spy' inside DWMA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there you were, waiting on the infamously obnoxious Black*Star to make his appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been only five minutes, when a thunderous voice declared \"YAHOO!\" from the other side of the front door, and it was kicked open forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere in the doorway, wearing his usual outfit of a black vest, white baggy pants and big shoes...was your target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was ENORMOUS!

Thier angsty, eternal teens that are misunderstood. However, they are far different and don't appreciate the stereotype.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVampires in the modern age struggled. With all the updated technology, it was becoming difficult to feed without being caught on camera. A solution soon graced the blood-suckers however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new drug capable of shrinking humans down to a inch was made possible, a side effect was that the human was made immortal so blood could continually be drawn. Although expensive, buying a tiny human was easy for many vampires as most were wealthy having built up social power over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been a victim to this drug. While out partying, your friends convinced you to join them in a round. It was soon revealed that the party was a ploy to gather humans to shrink and sell to vampires, and you and your friends were taken to be sent to a vampire family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow which family are you sent to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Akusumi family resided in Japan. They had a half eurpeon ethnicity, which is were thier vampire gene came from. This family consist of three brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyouta <br>\r\n- A physically seventeen year old, with a lean body that had a eight pack and toned biceps and stood at 6'3. He had shaggy yellowish gold hair and red eyes as well as black nails and pierced ears. While not cruel, he would like having a tiny human admire him. Instead of master, he'd rather be called a god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByakuka <br>\r\n- The oldest brother that looked to be in his tweaties at 6'7. He always presents himself in a formal manner, wearing expensive suits over his large built. He wears small glasses over his red eyes and has long dark blue hair tied in a low ponytail. While seemingly charming to guests, he has a no nonsense attitude and will give punishment to the tiny human if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatoru <br>\r\n- This white haired vampire looked to be slightly older then Ryouta and standing at 6'5. This very buff vampire with a sanpaku stare seems intimidating, but is actually just quiet. Satoru is ashamed of being a vampire, not wanting to drink from any human. He would try to avoid the tiny human, but also couldn't help but get close as he found him cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow is this the family you are sent to? Or is it another family?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was being carried by a vampire with a hooded cloak, as he was merely delivering and didn\u2019t have enough money for a anti-sun ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this, not only are we tiny but we\u2019re being sold to a vampire!\u201d, your friend yelled panicking. You stayed silent, still in shock about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened so suddenly. One moment your partying, and the next your an inch tall. Everyone in the club dwindled down to the floor, all confused on the new ordeal. Suddenly, hooded figures like the one carry you began to scoop up all the shrunken humans into cases. When one nearly escaped out the door, one of the captors simply stepped on it. All that got was a complain from another, telling him not to waste the humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the sound of a door knock and opening altered you and your friend. The top of the case opened and you closed your eyes as light poured in and the back of your shirt was lifted. Being set down, you opened your eyes and saw three new figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne had on a suit, which look to be hiding a large built. The brunette had a stoic gaze as he looked at the table you sat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle, was a thin and lean boy wearing a black gakuran and trousers. He had dirty blond hair and wore glasses. He also had on a evil smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the last one was lean though you could see muscle from beneath his silk shirt. The blond and big eyebrowed man had on brown trousers and lace up boots, as well as a purple cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh~ thank you so much for the delivery.\u201d, the dirty blond said in a cheerful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a grunt, as the hooded captor exited. You watched as the figure closed the door, leaving you and your friends with the vampires. Looking forward again, you gasped as the vampire with glasses was now inches away. His smirking face stared at you with childish glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow~ papa was right you are small. I wonder how long it would take to smoosh you.\u201d, the vampire tapped his finger to your chest, knocking you onto your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack off you git! I\u2019m the one who gets the humans first.\u201d, the eyebrowed vampire came forward and pulled the glasses vampire back by his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dirty blond pouted. \u201cAh, no fair Arthur. I even bought new shoes to have fun\u201d. The vampire brought up a long and large foot dressed in a brown leather shoe. Just what fun is he talking about?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care! I go first, then you can crush them as much as you want\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before things got out of hand, the supposed eldest brother came forward and pushed them apart. \u201cEnough! You can have your fun in due time, but first introductions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three brothers brought their gaze to the two of you. Three pairs of red eyes stared at you and your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, humans my name is Winston Soleonos. These are my two brothers Harold and Arthur.

Anything from the middle ages peaked his interest and made him crave researching it. This tour was on his bucket list as he always wanted to visit the mysterious castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's said that this castle appeared out of nowhere, as all ancient accounts back then said it mysterious showed up here. Further more inside lay numerous paintings and even bones that show animal like figures inhabitanting the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob took as many pictures as he could. Unlike others who spend thier time chatting or texting, the man wanted to explore the mysterious ruins to the fullest. As they walked through, Jacob stopped and trailed behind. Out in a courtyard of sorts, sat a large podium. Walking up to the architecture, he noticed the similar drawings from inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLions, dogs, and other anthromorphic creatures were clad in armor while other animals wore clothes. Jacob soon took notice of a blue sphere in the middle of the podium, and felt compelled to touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing so caused a strange reaction. The sphere began to glow and winds picked up around Jacob. He could only close his eyes in shock as the blue light shined brightly.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nOpening his eyes, Jacob had to blink the blurriness away. Oddly, there seemed to be voices around him and the ground was shaking slightly. As his vision cleared, he felt his jaw drop as the podium was now stretching into the sky like a skyscraper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away, he was in shock again as he saw giant anthromorphic animals walking around the once ruined courtyard. Jacob was about to walk, but stopped realizing he needed to think about his pan of action. This turned out to be a good choice, had he stepped forward he would've found himself flattened under a passing Doberman's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob looked around the courtyard, if these anthros were talking and walking then they would be able to help him. Around the courtyard, three individuals sparked his interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of a entryway into the courtyard was a fennec fox. He had on brown trousers and a sleeveless black hooded tunic, showing his toned furry biceps and large orange ears poking through holes on top. In one hand was a sword and the other a sheath, he most likely was a blacksmith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver by a wall, a large lion was talking to a smaller one. After nodding, the smaller lion bowed and left. The anthro lion was dressed in a suit of armor, with his burgundy mane in a low ponytail. The armor was large and showed his wide broad shoulders. Based on how it was shaped, Jacop assumed the lion must have quite the amount of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, under a tree was a hyena who was scanning the ground. The anthro seem to be of noble status as he had a silk shirt and wrinkle free trousers, unlike the other two he was wearing a pair of blue slippers. The silk shirt seem to be painted on as you could see all his muscles pressing against the confinement of the shirt. The hyena adjusted his spectacles as he seem to be looking for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon decided to get the help of.......</span></div></div>",

His old room was showing it's age with it's dust and fading colors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just graduated high school, age 18 when he got the call. His family's old cabin was sold and he was tasked by his parents to check it out before the buyers arrived. Upon arriving, he immediately had a nostalgia shock as he saw his old room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll his toys, cards, and.....book?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking between his bed and the wall was a stapled together mesh of papers. Gently pulling it out, Isaac's eyes widened. It was his old story he wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book told the story of a far off land where mythical creatures lived. However, they all walked around like people and talked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some notable ones. Like the knight unicorns in shining armor covering a hulking bod. Muscled gyrphons with laid back attitudes causally flying around. Also the buff Cerberus would guard the gate even with his three heads bickering sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of the drawings put emphasis on the muscles, which Isaac couldn't deny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the book seem to....glow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac closed his eyes as the book flashed and sent him into as slumber. After the light cleared, all that was left was the book.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nAs Isaac came to, he immediately noticed a difference in the air. Opening his eyes they widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was huge! Or did he shrink?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to get his bearings, Isaac felt the ground begin to shake in a series of rhythmic steps. A shadow soon loomed over him and Isaac gulped before taking one glance at the scenery before he would turn towards the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was......</span></div></div>",

And while they stared at one another the human let out, \u201c Um hello....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, did you that you guys? The little guy can talk!\u201d The left head excitingly remarked, to which Isaac could hear their tag wag a little.

Besides just because it\u2019s small doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t communicate!\u201d Once this has been shouted though the middle head\u2019s eyebrows narrows as he told the other heads, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough you two!

Never heard of your kind before.\u201d The right head commuted, before the left head let out a scoff. Upon doing this it then shot back, \u201cAnd so what\u2019s your point? All that matters to me is that the little human really cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis comment caused the young man to blush as he let out, \u201cThanks. I think you guys are pretty cool looking by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy thank you, Isaac\u201d The middle head replied, with a big smile on his face. This quickly went away though when he kept going with, \u201cBut I mud tell you our name. We are called Brutus. And since we found you, you will be under our protection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s nice of you. But I don\u2019t want to be a bother.\u201d Isaac confessed, with a frown on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis quickly vanished though when the young man saw the Cerberus\u2019s free hand wave in the air as the right head reassured him, \u201cThis is no problem as it is our duty to keep people stay whether they live here in the village or are traveling through it.\u201d Right this was said though Brutus\u2019s  middle head added on with, \u201cYes, you will most certainly be safe with us, Isaac.\u201d However we don\u2019t have any pockets or pouch to put you in while we\u2019re on guard duty...\u201d Then to the human\u2019s surprise the left head told the other two, \u201cDon\u2019t worry guys, because I know the prefect place to hide our new cute little friend here.\u201d Once he had this Isaac felt the hand he was move downward while that same head continued, \u201cWe\u2019ll just hide him inside our.....</span></div></div>",
