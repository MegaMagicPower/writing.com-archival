They were about to enter their sixth year at Hogwarts, and were waiting for the Hogwarts Express to pick them up.  Meanwhile, in Knockturn Alley, a middle-aged witch was desperately trying to conceive.  She walked into a potion shop, in hopes of finding a solution.  As she walked in, she was greeted by an old, balding wizard, who owned the shop.  \"What do you want?'' he said angrily.  The witch glanced around nervously.  \"Uh... well, my husband and I are trying to have a baby, and I was wondering if you had anything to fix our problem?\"  The wizard answered almost immediately.  \"I have just the thing!\"  He returned with a bottle of soda pop.  \"Is that the potion?\"she asked.  \"Yes, just wanted to conceal its identity-be warned, only drink a fifth of the bottle, I overfilled it accidentally.\"  The witch understood.  She exited the shop and quickly made her way to The Leaky Cauldron.  Inside, she took a seat next to Harry, Hermione, and Ron.  \"Well, it's almost time to go to King's Cross,\"Harry said.  Hermione returned to their table with a soda bottle in her hand.  The witch got up, unaware of Hermione standing there.  Hermione and the witch both dropped their bottles.  In a mad dash, Hermione grabbed the wrong bottle, and left with the two boys. \"I'm so sorry,\" Hermione said as she left the pub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermoine realized how thirsty she was, and began to chug the bottle.  \"Blimey!\" Ron said, \"Are you thirsty?\"  Hermione gave no answer, and gave a glaring look at Ron.  Ron understood this, and became silent.  Hermione finished the bottle just as the Hogwarts Express arrived at Platform 9 &amp; 3/4.  The three loaded up their luggage and found a seat.  Not far into their journey, a woman driving a trolley filled with candy stopped by their door.  \"Anything off the trolley, dears?\"</span></div></div>",

Harry bought one Cauldron Cake, and the woman left them to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, when Hermione finished her binge, she let out a big moan.  \"Ugh, that was a lot of food,\" she said tiredly.  She decided to take a nap before the Express arrived at Hogwarts, which would be a few hours.  She laid back and entered a deep sleep.  When Hermione woke up, it was time to put on her school robes on, so she grabbed the clothes and went to the restroom.  When she got in the restroom, a wave of nausea went threw her, and she threw up in the toilet.  \"I must have ate too much.\"  She began to strip down to her bra and panties, and noticed that her bra was tighter,  \"Must have accidentally put on one that was too small..\"  She looked at her reflection in the mirror, and noticed that her belly was slightly puffy.  \"Well, that's what you get for eating too much...\"  She poked her belly, and noticed that it had little give.  She gave it a small rub, which felt oddly good.  Hermione put on her uniform, and noticed that it completely hid the mysterious bulge.  She thought no more of it and returned to her compartment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Hogwarts became in sight, and took the attention of all on the train.  They soon arrived at the castle, made their way to the Great Hall, heard Dumbledore's annual speech, and saw food magically appear on their plates.  Hermione's belly rumbled ominously.</span></div></div>",

Half an hour later, she had finished, and was very stuffed and tired.  She could tell that her belly had grown a bit more, and could make it out through her shirt.  Hermione gave a big yawn and said,\"Well, I'm tired, I will see you all in the morning.\"  And with that, she slowly walked out of the Great Hall.  As she was walking up the stairs, she noticed that it was harder to go up the stairs than usual.  She made her way to the Gryffindor common room, and walked into her dorm.  She began to undress in order to put her pajamas on, and noticed that her breasts and belly were both larger.  If anyone had seen her belly, they would have thought that she had a large meal, which she did.  Hermione put on her pajamas on, and could easily see her belly from the t-shirt.  She climbed into bed and quickly went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was morning, by the time Hermione woke up, and she felt very hungry.  She sat up and began to get dressed.  Her belly had grown a minuscule amount since last night.  Hermione went to the Great Hall to eat breakfast.  She had a large meal, which made her belly puff out more.  After breakfast, she had to go to their first class, which was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA.  Potions<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB.  Defense Against the Dark Arts</span></div></div>",

As she strained up how ever she had caught sight of herself in the mirror, for the side her belly did look rather bloated.<br>\r\nIt was true that she had been eatting alot more recently, she assumed her hunger was caused by the fact she coudn't anything down for long. But looking at herself in the mirror she could really see a difference in her. Her breast and backside also seemed bigger, it could of been normal at her age, but her belly seemed much bigger though. It is true that her pants and skirt were more slightly harder to do up these days but she figured that was just ordinary bloating, which is why she hadn't got any larger clothing.<br>\r\nBut at the moment whilst still small her belly was straining the buttons on her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling fearful she made her way to the library and started searching for books on pregnancy, it took her a while, the books she originally found were mostly about magical effects on pregnancy or what goes wrong if you took certain types of potion when pregnant, the pictures were not pretty, she wonder why she even wanted to have a baby in the first place.<br>\r\nShe found a book in the muggle studies section as a selection of example texts, which discribed the symptoms of pregnancy and horror started to fill her as she found out about morning sickness and other symptoms which she had been feeling over the last few weeks. She looked down at her bulging belly, 'but why was she this big?' according to this book she shouldn't look like this for another eight weeks and the other book didn't mention anything about accelirated time, just the lack of sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was suddenly hit by another wave of tiredness she decide she needed to sort this out but now she need sleep other wise she would make another hasty and unwise decision. She hired the book out from the library and like a month before went to the dormitry changed into her pyjamas, (the nightie was large enough to cover the bulge) and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up in the morning she was determined to sort out this mess but as soon as she got up she felt...</span></div></div>",

Finally though another wave of nausea hit her and she bolt up to the out of order girls bath room, where she vomit yet again after a few minutes of this she got up. Her robe flopped open and Luna saw that two buttons had popped off her shirt, supprisingly it was the middle ones. She turned to face herself in the mirror and saw her belly bulging out of her shirt, it didn't seem to much bigger then yesterday, just enought to pop the buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe obviously was having the baby she 'wanted' and she obviously needed some new clothes.

It was magically, on the outside it looked no bigger then an ordinary change room but on the inside it was a rather spacious room with several wall sized mirrors. Some how there made her feel rather self concious especially when she let her robe fall open, her belly had noticably grown in the last few days causing another couple of her shirt buttons of her shirt to pop off.<br>\r\nShe got changed trying not to look at herself in the mirror until she was fully dress, The new clothes didn't hide her bugle but at least they could do up and didn't strain which would of emphised the size.

Her new shirt was straining to cover her belly, whilst she could no longer properly do up her pants, her robe could barely concel the bump anymore and she was only going to get bigger.
