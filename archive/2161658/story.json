        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">I've read a lot of the stories in Choices and I couldn't help but think that there were quite a few instances where shrinking would definitely be interesting. So now I'm adding an interactive where people can come in and put their own views into this. But first a few grounds rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. NO one sentence chapters. I've noticed that they really don't do much and I will delete them as soon as I find out about them.<br>\r\n2. No scat, toilet, waterworks, farting, and hard vore. I don't personally don't like it, but you can allude to it. Just know describing what happens.<br>\r\n3. Keep the male giants on the down low. By this, I mean that they can be nearby and can talk to the shrunken character(s), but they can't do <u><b>anything</b></u> to them.<br>\r\n4. Please use good grammar and try to make the sentences well written. If you need to I recommend getting Grammarly, the free version works just fine, and you don't have to pay for it.<br>\r\nLastly, if you mess up on a chapter and think you can improve on it, let me know and send me the chapter name. I won't delete things unless they break the rules, or they are incredibly badly written. I hope you guys will add to this interactive.</td>",
