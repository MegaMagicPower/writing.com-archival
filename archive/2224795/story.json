For a good twenty minutes she remained like this, before she calmed down enough to think clearly on what to do next. Since the beginning of the school year, she had harbored a crush on Brad, the most handsome, most popular guy in school. This was nothing special, as most every girl in her school wanted him. But when she finally built up the courage to ask him to go to prom with her at lunch, not only did he reject her, but he burst out laughing, saying how he'd already asked out Jessica, and even if he hadnt, there was no way he'd go out with a freak and loser like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the whole cafeteria began to laugh with Brad, and Morgan couldn't stop the hot tears from flowing down her face as she was further teased and mocked by her classmates for the rest of the day. Her thoughts turned to Jessica, the blonde cheerleader captain who was Brad's prom date. Hatred began to ignite inside Morgan's heart as she thought of Jessica with her shining golden hair, and a body so curvy she looked like an overinflated love doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Morgan's thought turned to one thing... Revenge. Reaching under her bed, she pulled out a book bound in black leather. Her cousin Beth was a Wiccan, and had given her this book of spells when teaching her about magic. The flipped to the section, Curses for Your Enemies, and skimmed down the list, looking for the perfect spell for her situation. An evil grin spread across her face as she found just the one, and began the incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...............<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on a hilltop on the edge of town, Brad and Jessica were passionately making love beneath the full moon in the backseat of Brad's convertible, their moans and grunts almost echoing through the warm night air. Unbeknownst to both of them, things were about to take a very strange, and disastrous turn. Just who is it that shall be cursed?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jessica lovingly kissed and pressed herself against Brad's hot body, she felt a small chill run past her spine. At first, she thought nothing of it, until that chill suddenly turned into a groaning and sickening feeling. Her stomach lurched as she pulled herself away from Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is everything okay?\" Brad asked as he saw Jessica's face become a pale green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no I'm fine, I just... hmph!\" Jessica slapped her hand to her face as she felt like she was gonna throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Brad was beginning to worry, \"Babe, you don't look so good. We should call your parents and tell them we're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No...\" Jessica interuppted, determined not to ruin the nice night, \"I-I just need to get some fresh air. I'll be back in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica tripped slightly as she sloppily lugged herself out of the car. Once she was out, she walked out a few yards into the woods, where the car was still in view, but far enough so that Brad couldn't see her in this moment of weakness. After finding a big and sturdy tree to lean on to, she lurched forward to try and puke whatever was giving her trouble. But she couldn't do it, no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't make it exit her system. To make matters worse, her stomach only began to feel fuller and fuller, adding on to her already bad queasiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, come one!\" Jessica stressed, trying hard to get herself back to normal, \"Just go away! Go... away... now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bwump!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica suddenly stopped screaming as her pants suddenly felt really tight on her butt and thighs. Slowly removing one hand from her mouth, she felt herself around her rump. As she sqeezed, she noticed it was no longer firm or round like usual. Now it was jiggly, squishy, juicy, and soft. No, it couldn't be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bwump! Rrrrriiiip!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Jessica yelped as her panties and the back of her jeans tore open to reveal her two bulbous spheres of fat. There was no denying it, her butt was getting bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that possible?!\" Jessica wondered aloud, \"I've been working double shifts on my butt workouts, why is it now so fat? Oh, oh god, that's too tight, too tight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bwump!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's thighs began to fill out, matching her bulbous rump, her pants were threatening to burst open. And that's exactly what they did, in only seconds her jeans and underwear tore themselves from her legs, making her completely naked from foot to waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, not wanting Brad to see her like this, waddled farther into the woods, until the car was completely out of view. Just in the nick of time too, as the next part of her weight gain began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bwump!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's shirt rolled itself up as her belly began to bulge outwards. All her core workout had gone to waste as she lost her hourglass figure. Her midriff lurched out until her entire midsection was round and plump. As the final touch to her ever expanding stomach, her belly button popped out of it's socket, making her belly completely smooth and soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what's happening to me?\" Jessica mouthed, losing breath to actually speak. But she couldn't stop running, she couldn't let Brad see her like this. But in her haste, she accidently tripped over a branch and on to her face. Thankfully, her wrecking ball sized gut broke her fall, but it also kept her from getting up. It was all she could do to sit herself upright against a tall thick tree, her two exercise balls of ass acting as a cushion against the rough ground she was sitting on. Under a break in the tree line, the full moon cast all its light upon her, revealing to her how fat and bloated she had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Jessica whispered begging to whatever was up there, \"Please make it stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her body wasn't done yet, there were still a few more things to fatten up. Jessica felt the weird feeling spread to her breasts, \"No please, anything but those. Please don't ruin my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bwump! Rrrriiip!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shirt completely tore itself off of her beachball size tits, now leaving her completely nude under the moonlight. In a desperate attempt to cover herself, she used to arms to try and shield her boobs and her vagina from view. But those skinny arms of hers couldn't possibly cover all that flab and juicy flesh. It couldn't get any worse, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bwump! Bwump!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers started to become thick and sausage like, to the point where it was a struggle to make a fist. She lost her grip on her privates as her arms began to lose shape, becoming bulging cylinders of juicy fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bwump!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one final insult to injury, her face and neck began to lose shape. Her neck became essentially nonexistent, and her cheeks made her look like she was a squirrel whose mouth was packed to the brim with nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was freaking out, and losing breath fast, \"I'm sorry. Whatever it was I did to deserve this, I'm so sorry. I'll never do it again, I promise. I pro- wait, what's happening now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bwwuuuuuuuummmp!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was growing in height, with each second that past she was gaining in height and mass. When it was finally done, Jessica was about as tall as the halfway point of the tree. If she managed to stand up, her head would break through the treetops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica waited, waited for something else in her body to fatten up and swell to extraordinary proportions. She waited for five minutes before coming to the conclusion that the transformation was over. She was now a nude fat giant lady resting under the moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad,\" Jessica whispered, unable to shout or scream anymore, \"Brad, help me. I'm scared. Please help me, Brad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then it began to dawn on her, she was no where near the car anymore. She had ran so deep into the forest, that she didn't know where she was anymore, she couldn't even see her tracks. There was no way for her to return to Brad, no way for him to find her. She was lost in the forest, lost and all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow,\" came a voice nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was now terrified, \"What? Whose there? Don't come any closer, I'm hideous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, I'll say. Look at what my spell did to you,\" the voice agreed as it got closer to her. Over her gigantic jelly body, Jessica could see the shadow of a girl, who carried a big book with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan?\" Jessica asked, trying to shift her weight so she could see better, \"Is that you? You did this to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan laughed, \"Heck yeah, I did. And I must say, that giant transformation spell was really powerful. Had I known what it would do, I would've cast it in school. Ah well, the affects will be the same. Either Brad will think you died and hightail it outta here, or he'll see you like this and dump you. Then that piece of hunky muscle will be all mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're crazy!\" Jessica wheezed, \"You're a monster, a psychopath, a complete bitch! You're a-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan suddenly jumped on her belly and pushed her finger to her swollen lips, \"Shhhh, no need to fret, Jessica dear. We're still not done yet. I still have so many games I want to play with you. By the time we're done, you'll be my mindless little pet, now won't you. Yes you will, oh yes you will. Now, what game shall we play first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gulped in anticipation of what Morgan had in store for her.</span></div></div>",
