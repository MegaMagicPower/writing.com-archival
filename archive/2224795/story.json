For a good twenty minutes she remained like this, before she calmed down enough to think clearly on what to do next. Since the beginning of the school year, she had harbored a crush on Brad, the most handsome, most popular guy in school. This was nothing special, as most every girl in her school wanted him. But when she finally built up the courage to ask him to go to prom with her at lunch, not only did he reject her, but he burst out laughing, saying how he'd already asked out Jessica, and even if he hadnt, there was no way he'd go out with a freak and loser like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the whole cafeteria began to laugh with Brad, and Morgan couldn't stop the hot tears from flowing down her face as she was further teased and mocked by her classmates for the rest of the day. Her thoughts turned to Jessica, the blonde cheerleader captain who was Brad's prom date. Hatred began to ignite inside Morgan's heart as she thought of Jessica with her shining golden hair, and a body so curvy she looked like an overinflated love doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Morgan's thought turned to one thing... Revenge. Reaching under her bed, she pulled out a book bound in black leather. Her cousin Beth was a Wiccan, and had given her this book of spells when teaching her about magic. The flipped to the section, Curses for Your Enemies, and skimmed down the list, looking for the perfect spell for her situation. An evil grin spread across her face as she found just the one, and began the incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...............<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on a hilltop on the edge of town, Brad and Jessica were passionately making love beneath the full moon in the backseat of Brad's convertible, their moans and grunts almost echoing through the warm night air. Unbeknownst to both of them, things were about to take a very strange, and disastrous turn. Just who is it that shall be cursed?</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, all that popularity tends to go to one's head, and you've gotten quite an attitude as a result. You sometimes push the underclassmen around, just for fun and pretty much ignore other students who are out of your league. Then, one day, about a week before prom you\\your boyfriend publicly rejects and humiliates the school shy girl when she asked you\\him to be her prom date. Under any other circumstances, this would be pretty normal and nothing severe would come of it. But, this girl who was turned down happens to be a witch, and a rather spiteful one at that. Seeking to make you\\your boyfriend pay, she casts a spell on one of you, with interesting results to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No gross stuff like farting or anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. If you're going to end the story, get it to a decent length first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.
