As he made it in front of his house, he also so a familar face jogging towards him: His neighbor Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Tiffany asked as they glared at eachother. The two of them didn't get along, and she really didn't feel like dealing with him this early. She had been out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I live here.\" Kyle said gesturing to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a smartass.\" Tiffany said.  This was the last thing she wanted after coming back from a morning jog of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore their \"friendly conversation\" could continue, something suddenly fell from the sky between them, more than surprising the two. Once they regained their composure, they looked down to see there was a round, bright blue stone on the ground that looked like some kind of crystal. It sat there, no mark on the ground despite the speed it fell at. And the stone looked to be in perfect condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" they both let out in surprise. There was quickly a brief flash of light, and they covered their eyes, missing both their images briefly appearing on the surface of the stone before fading away. Without paying attention to the other, they both reach down to grab it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

First off was that you and her had switched positions, with her standing. The next thing he noticed was that she was wearing his jogging clothes and that her once long red hair was now shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kyle noticed all of this, Tiffany noted the changes in Kyle. He was wearing her jogging clothes, while his black hair had grown in length to look like hers. Shortly after examing each other, they noticed their own changes and took them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then this stone is for real?\" Kyle said as he held it up to look at, recalling the information that had appeared in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so...\" Tiffany responds, unsure of what else to say. Before you two can think about what to do, your mother calls out to you, or rather to Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany! Hurry up and come in and get dressed or you'll be late for school!\" your mother called out from the window before heading back to get ready herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom just called out to me.\" she pointed out, understanding the meaning, but still confused by the whole situation.</span></div></div>",

I don't want to walk around all day as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, what I did?\" Kyle said.  \"I didn't do anything.  I don't know any more about how this happened than you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Tiffany said, waving the stone, which was in her hand now.  \"You were holding this thing when we switched.  You must have done something to activate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, I don't know how it happened,\" Kyle said.  \"I just picked it up, and there was that flash, and then we were like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany scowled at Kyle, then at the stone.  She turned it over in her hand for a minute, looking at it from every angle.  Then she walked over to Kyle's sister's car, which was parked in the driveway.  Leaning down, she looked at her reflection in the side mirror.  \"Ugh, this is so gross,\" she said, running a hand through her very short, very boyish hair and looking down at her--or, rather, Kyle's--t-shirt and shorts, which were damp and a little smelly from his sweat.  \"I look so butch,\" she said.  And then she turned too Kyle and looked him up and down, a grin crossing her face.  \"And you look absolutely ridiculous,\" she said, snickering.  \"Oh man, at least something good is going to come at this.  I'm going to cherish this image of you forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle simmered.  He looked down at his body, which was dressed in Tiffany's purple sports bra and tiny black running shorts, both of which were form-fitting and uncomfortably tight.  His shorts in particular left very litle to the imagination.  They were stretched taut across his hips, and there was a very noticeable bulge in front.  His dark hair, now long, was tied into a ponytail, and he wore white sneakers on his feet.  The skimpy outfit revealed a very large swath of skin, showing off his belly and his legs in all their lanky, hairy, adolescent glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany continued to laugh breathlessly, until, abruptly, her laughter died off and her eyes narrowed.  \"Waaaaiiiiit a minute,\" she said.  \"You didn't do this on purpose, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Kyle said, crossing his arms over his spandex-clad chest.  \"Why on earth would I do this on purpose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think maybe you wanted to be a girl,\" Tiffany said.  She began counting on her fingers.  \"You've never been good at sports, you've never had a serious girlfriend, you watch all that freaky anime, you spend hours locked up in your room... when we were kids, you always wanted to play house... you're some kind of tranny crossdresser, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ridiculous!\" Kyle snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Tiffany poked him in the ribs.  \"Then why did you let your sister dress you up as Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz that one time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was five!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likely excuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was fuming now.  \"Shut up, you spoiled, shallow bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany's eyes flew wide open.  \"What did you call me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bitch.  B-I-T-C-H.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany's mouth hung open, as though she were searching for words.  At last closed her eyes and shook her head.  \"Forget it.  I can't deal with this right now.  I just can't.\"  She turned on her heel and began walking down the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany,\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she snapped, turning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're supposed to be me,\" Kyle said.  \"My house is that way.\"  He poined back over his shoulder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany glared at him, then began walking back up the driveway.  He stood stiffly as she passed him, and a moment later he heard the door open and slam shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stood still for a moment, then he looked down at his clothes again.  He felt practically naked in these clothes, and absolutely humiliated.  And when he looked up and saw Mr. Reynolds, the creepy single guy across the street, leering through the window at him, he felt even more uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it... he had to in and talk to Tiffany.  They had to put aside their differences and work together to figure out how the stone worked so they could return to their own lives.  He didn't want to spend any more time as Tiffany than he had to.  He'd been a girl for five minutes and he already knew he wanted no part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, he knew better than to talk to Tiffany when she was mad.  Maybe it was better to give her some distance for now.  Maybe he should go to Tiffany's house, get ready for school, and spend the rest of the day as her.  They could talk tomorrow, when they'd both had some time to cool off.  One day as a girl wouldn't be so bad, would it?</span></div></div>",

Sure, she did believe it was an accident at this point, though she wouldn't admit that to him. But it was just easier to blame him for everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stormed down the hall towards Kyle's room, passing by the bathroom, which Kyle's sister Stephanie poked her head out of. \"Argument with Kyle again? I saw you two outside. Looked like it got pretty fierce this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in the mood right now.\" Tiffany replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Stephanie said. \"And to think, you two used to be the best of friends growing up.\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up.\" she said a she slammed to the door to his room. She looked around. On the wall were a few football posters, and there was a pretty nice looking TV in a corner with a PS3 hooked up to it, and a shelf full of video games for the PS2 and PS3 was next to it. Along the wall was a bookshelf half of the shelves were filled with manga, while the other half was full of DVDs. \"Geez, I bet hes so spoiled he just has to ask for whatever he wants and he gets it.\" she said, figuring a lot of this stuff had to have been expensive, unaware that he had bought everything but the TV and a few games with his own money he had saved up. Looking at the DVDs on the shelves, she stopped on one. \"Hey, I didn't know he liked this one.\" she said picking it up. \"Of course it would be the collectors edition. Bet he just whined to mommy to get the money for this.\" she said, annoyed she could never get it since it was too expensive for her. \"Good thing I always hide my stuff. Don't want him calling me a hypocrite for all the time I've made fun of him for liking this stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, guess I better get ready for school.

The little brat had waited for him to open the front door and threw a water balloon in his face. He had wanted to do something, but the kid immediately ran and hid behind his mother from his 'mean older sister.' He then got a lecture about how the boy was half his age, and that he needed to 'control her temper.' \"Geez, Tiffany, you always find some way to make things harder for me\" he said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, better get dressed.\" he said as he stripped out of his current attire. Uncomfortable about using them, he resigned himself as he pulled out a pair of panties and a bra. He then but on a sleevless blue shirt, and then a pair of jeans. He may have to use her undergarments, but he drew the line at skirts. He didn't like doing this, but he had to go to school like this. He had to both make sure Tiffany didn't ruin his life, and show her that he would ruin her life to better convince her to help him fix things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the stone in his hand. He had no idea how to make it work again, but he knew he couldn't leave it here. In his own home, he could trust his sisters not to mess with his stuff. Samantha was respectful, and Sarah was too nice to do anything bad. But here, he already knew he couldn't trust that little hellspawn Johnny not to take it if it was unattended. Sticking it in Tiffany's purse, he grabbed it and her backpack and headed out the door to the bus stop.</span></div></div>",

He really hoped that this wouldn't last too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, he saw Tiffany already waiting at the bus stop, wearing a plain red t shirt an a pair of jeans. \"Uh, hey Tiffany.\" Kyle attempted to greet her, but she just looked away. 'Great, shes ignoring me. Must still be pissed...' he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany briefly glances over and appraised Kyle while he wasn't paying attention. 'Well, hes not wearing anything that would embarrass me. He looks completely and utterly rediculous to me, but I'm the only one who can tell that hes not me, so I think hes done a decent job to pass for now. Could have used some makeup, but I guess that would be expecting too much, so I can't blame him for that, though Emily will probably do it for him.' she thought. 'His hair looks a bit wet, so I'm guessing Johnny must have done the waterballoon thing this morning. You know, from the other side, that is kinda funny.

His eyes then travelled down to examine the rest of him. He was wearing a yellow tanktop and a denim miniskirt, ones that he recognized as his sister.

That was probably because mom straightened it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle remembered having fights with mother about his room. She wanted him to straighten it up, but he never did it.  Every time Kyle's mother cleaned his room, Kyle would yell at her. After his room was ordered by his mom, Kyle invariably couldn't find the things he was looking for. One way or another, Kyle and his mom argued about his room's cleanliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle liked what he saw in Sarah's room. He thought it was very colorful and very pretty.  Not like his own, which he never thought was plain. The comforter on the bed had a Disney princess on it. The walls had many pretty posters and on the shelves were all sorts of toys and games. Kyle thought that he can feel at home in this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wanted to enter. But Kyle didn't want to be bad.

The thumb of his left hand never left his mouth. He was still a little scared of being found in Sarah's room, but while sucking his thumb and hugging the elephant he had the courage to continue his exploration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe look through Sarah's toys and games and found he liked most of them. Those that he didn't like too much happened to be in the back or on the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe when Sarah comes back, we can play this?\"  Kyle thought as he was looking at Hungry Hungry Hippos.   He would be sure to ask her when he saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking inside Sarah's closets for more toys, Kyle saw several dresses and other apparel in Sarah's wardrobe.  Kyle decided he liked 'dress up.'  Kyle wished he could put them on but he knew it was impossible. All the clothes were too small to fit.  This made Kyle a bit sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Maybe the stone could help,\"   Kyle said to himself. Kyle hadn't realized but the stone had already worked.

Her boyfriend Paul, and apparently Tiffany. For some weird reason he was apparently dating Tiffany now. Then he thought back to the information about the stone and realized it was because he and Tiffany got Samantha\u2019s and Paul\u2019s relationships, which also explains why Angela was apparently his best friend now. He got Samantha\u2019s relationship with Paul, but Tiffany got Paul\u2019s relationship with Samantha, which meant Kyle and Tiffany got half of the same relationship, putting the two of them in a relationship with a each other. He was a little disgusted at the thought at first, but after looking through some texts between him and Tiffany that weren\u2019t there before the flash of light from the stone, he started to get the urge to send a sexy pic to Tiffany, since Samantha always sent sexy pics to Paul. Without thinking, Kyle took a selfie with his shirt off to Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tiffany was surprised to receive a pic of Kyle with his shirt off from him. At first she was excited about the pic, due to her slight crush on him, but was then disgusted with herself due to refusing to believe she has feelings for him.

She wiped a bit of the foggy mist off the bathroom mirror and saw her own normal body, but dressed like a man just getting out of the shower. Also, her fiery red hair was now trimmed in a very short, unattractive buzz cut. And was that a five o'clock shadow of facial hair stubble across her face? Impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a strange blond woman entered the bathroom without knocking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done with your shower already Tiffany?\" she said, wrapping her arms around Tiffany and giving her a kiss on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany was dumbfounded and speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't shaved yet!\" said the woman, in a gesture of mock pouting. \"You know I hate kissing my man when his face gets all weedy and scratchy like that.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Another swapping story of mine, but with with the intent of more of a focus on the characters, or the main two characters in particuarly. The story will be in third person, and can switch back and forth between the two main characters as you please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle Henderson: 16 years old, black hair. Pretty avergae guy, with a laid back attitude usually. Enjoys some sports even though he isn't very good at any, video games and anime. Is in decent shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany Gates: 16 years old, red hair. Is usually nice, but with a temper as fiery as her hair. Has a mild interest in fashion and clothes, and secretly is into video games and anime<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nBackground on the two: Kyle and Tiffany are neighbors and have been their whole life. When they were younger, they had been close friends, but drifted apart over time for reasons they don't even remember. Nowadays they don't get along much, and are competitive with each other, contstantly trying to out do the other. Secretly though, Tiffany harbors a bit of a crush on Kyle, though with how much they just don't get along, she'd never admit it to anyone, let alone herself, since she doesn't even realize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's family:<br>\r\nSarah Henderson- Kyle's 8 year old sister. Sweet and girly.<br>\r\nSamantha Henderson- Kyle's 18 year old sister. Stereotypical teenage girl. Is a cheerleader, and has a part-time job at a department store in the mall.<br>\r\nRachel Henderson- Kyle's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany's family:<br>\r\nJohnny Gates- Tiffany's 8 year old brother. Energetic, and doesn't get along with his older sister.<br>\r\nPeter Gates - Tiffany's 18 year old brother.<br>\r\nRobert Gates- Tiffany's dad.<br>\r\nMary Gates - Tiffany's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers:<br>\r\nDan Johnson- 16 years old. Kyle's best friend.<br>\r\nEmily Wallace- 16 years old. Tiffany's best friend.<br>\r\nSally Benson - 9 years old. Sarah's best friend.<br>\r\nZack Jones - 9 years old. Johnny's best friend.<br>\r\nAngela Jones - 18 years old. Samantha's best friend, and Zack' older sister.<br>\r\nPaul Davidson - 18 years old. Samantha's boyfriend.<br>\r\nHarry Miller - 18 years old. Peter's best friend.<br>\r\nJenny Benson - 18 years old. Peter's girlfriend, and Sally's older sister.<br>\r\nHeather Anderson - 18 years old, and cheerleader. Stuck up, and doesn't like either Kyle or Tiffany.<br>\r\nKevin Bradley - 18 years old, and a footbal player, and Heather's boyfriend. Typical jock.<br>\r\nSteven Edwards - Kyle's mother Rachel's boyfriend. Have been going out for more than a year.<br>\r\nElizabeth Harris - Kyle's mother's best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're encouraged to add other characters if you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone that the two find is special, and can perform swaps between them and another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypes of switches:<br>\r\nLife - They switch lives with someone else. First name will stay unchanged. They will be treated as if they were that person, and those other than Kyle and Tiffany will act as if they had always been that person. Will gain the skills and abilities of the one they switch with. Can switch with anyone in town.<br>\r\nPersonality - They gain the personality of another, while those whose personality they gain will also gain theirs. For Kyle and Tiffany, their own personality will always remain and be unchanged, but the new personality will have an equal presence. The person whose personality they gain, if not eachother, will only have the persoality of them, or whoever they also had the personality of instead if they don't only have their own. Limited range, though only for the one using it.<br>\r\nWardrobe - They switch clothes with someone else, which are readjusted to fit the new person comfortably. Gains all clothes, as well as make up, jewelery, and head hair length and style, though color stays the same. When switching clothes with the opposite gender, they will then be expected to dress like that gender.<br>\r\nRelationship - Will gain the relationships of the person they switch with, such as friends. Life will be the same, and will keep their own family. Limited range, though only for the one who used it.<br>\r\nSchool &amp; Job - They switch school and/or jobs with the other. If they switch with someone that goes to the same school as them, they will switch classes and and other activities related to school like sports with that person. If the job or other activities require any skills, they will gain them. Limited range, though only for the one using it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone will only work for Kyle and Tiffany, and only when one of them is holding it. They do not need to be together to use it. Upon its first use, they will know what its powers are, though they won't necessarily always know what kind of switch happened right away. The stone can't be destroyed, but can be lost or stolen.<br>\r\nWhenever the stone affects one, it will affect the other in an opposing but equal way. When one of them has switched with someone, they other will have the same kind of switch performed on them. Ex: If one of them switches lives with someone, the other will be switched with the girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband of the person.<br>\r\nWhile they choose to activate it, Kyle and Tiffany have no control over which switch shall happen, nor who they will switch with. For the switches with limited range, the limit is roughly the size of their two houses, and they do not have to be in the same room as the person they could switch with.<br>\r\nWhen a switch is done, reality is altered so that any changes seem perfectly normal, and only Kyle and Tiffany will notices any changes.<br>\r\nPhysical appearance does not change, and switches can only happen between humans, so no animal switches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther rules:<br>\r\nNo sex<br>\r\nNo killing off characters<br>\r\nNo ending the story<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!</td>",
