You also don\u2019t want to bring it up right away either since she\u2019ll think somethings up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex: Hey mom<br>\r\nMom: Yes, honey?<br>\r\nAlex: What are we having for dinner?<br>\r\nMom: I was gunna make pork chops and broccoli but if you want something else you can take it out of the freezer!<br>\r\nAlex: Thanks, I\u2019m cool with that though. Where\u2019s Amanda?<br>\r\nMom: She\u2019s over at Julie\u2019s, she got mad at me because she left her headphones in her pocket and I washed them.<br>\r\nAlex: How is that your fault?<br>\r\nMom: That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say! And if you don\u2019t like it do your own laundry, simple as that!.... Alex thank you for being the good kid haha.<br>\r\nAlex: Haha, it\u2019s not that, she\u2019s just crazy. She still acts like this when all you do is give<br>\r\nMom: She can be, but at least she\u2019s doing good in school. And don\u2019t think I\u2019m picking favorites, I love all three of you the same.<br>\r\nAlex: That reminds me, do you want to pose for a picture for my Instagram. It\u2019s healthcare appreciation day and I want to post how great of a mom you are!<br>\r\nMom: Sure! Just make sucking up to me for $20 less obvious next time haha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush at the fact you have completely unrelated motivations than that, and start to feel guilty. But realize there\u2019s almost no chance it works anyway so you put your worries aside. Your mom poses and you take the picture. What personality did you type?</span></div></div>",

She picks out a Slipknot, My Chemical Romance, and a pentagram shirt first; then goes over to the pants and gets black jeans and leggings. After that gets new makeup, including black lipstick and eyeliner. She gets some other accessories like bracelets and hats and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext stop is the piercing store, but your mom insists that you stay because she wants it to be a surprise. You figure this is a good time to try out that app again on a random person. You walk up to an old white lady with her husband and ask if they want a picture for $1, the lady says sure. You type in ghetto on the app and take the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex: How do you like it?<br>\r\nOld Lady: Is cool blood<br>\r\nOld Man: What was that?<br>\r\nOld Lady: I said is cool nah les get to dat Joanne Fabrics sale yerd<br>\r\nAlex: Alright have a nice day!<br>\r\nOld lady: ard<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to feel bad that old man\u2019s wife will act differently forever and he has no idea why, but it was also the funniest thing you've ever heard of so you go on with your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after though, your mom comes back and you could barely recognize her. She got snake bites on each side, a septum piercing, one through the bridge of her nose with spikes on the ends, two cheek piercings and some 30 mm gages. You realized this may have gone too far, there\u2019s no way she could ever have her ears recover from that. You also realize your mom talks in a much more somber, depressed voice now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom: Do you like them?<br>\r\nAlex: They look great, and as long as you like them!<br>\r\nMom: So you hate them. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m looking how I want from now on and nobody can stop me.<br>\r\nAlex: \u201cWell I\u2019m glad your more independent at least.\u201d ( under breath)<br>\r\nMom: Also I have a tattoo appointment at 4 so I\u2019ll drop you off at home first, I might be there a while.<br>\r\nAlex: You've never even got a tattoo before, do you know how bad that hurts?<br>\r\nMom: I just got my ears stretched out the size of a baseball, I hope it hurts more than that. Maybe I\u2019ll feel something for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get dropped off at home waiting for your mom to get back so you can see the damage. You thought if you switched your mom back now, she\u2019ll freak out at what she\u2019s done and actually kill herself rather than just talk about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets home, quietly walking through the door without saying a thing. You walk over to greet her and stand there in shock to what you see. You look from up down, on her cheek were two pentagrams around the piercings, a giant rose on her neck, a raven on her chest with blood on it. She takes her clothes off to show you the rest, starting with a tattoo of the devil nailed to a cross on her stomach which says \u201csavior\u201d above it, blood tattoos coming out of the bottom of her underwear, two skulls on her knees, and a huge spider on the back of one of her calves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom: How do they look?<br>\r\nAlex: (stares)<br>\r\nMom: Whatever<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she\u2019s walking away you see a huge tattoo on her back of a creepy baby playing with a doll attached to the baby\u2019s finger ligaments, with blood, skulls, and bats everywhere. You knew at this point you went too far, but it was too late to do anything. Your mom was going to be emo forever and there was nothing you could do. Instead of live with the guilt, you think of using the app on your self to give yourself a careless personality, so you could change anyone without feeling remorse.</span></div></div>",

What made her do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to think Amanda might start looking into what happened, you decide you have to change her personality fast to get her mind off it and onto One specific thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex: Maybe if I send her s picture of us we can remind her of what else she has in life.<br>\r\nAmanda: That\u2019s kinda retarded, but worth a try<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point the camera at both of you and close your eyes right before the flash.

You then take another picture of her with the \u201cgenius\u201d setting on and see what she knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex: Recite the Gettysburg Adress.<br>\r\nLily: Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that...<br>\r\nAlex: Okay, okay I heard enough.. Who won the super bowl this year?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she couldn\u2019t know this one since our family never watches football and when I asked her yesterday she said she didn\u2019t know any teams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily: Based on telling statistics such as QBI, yards per carry, red-zone percentage plays and previous accolades, I predict the Kansas City Chiefs won... Barring Patrick Mahomes doesn\u2019t came back 100% and Bill O\u2019Brian is a competent coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour taken back a step, she even understands football jokes and can remember speeches she\u2019s never read before. This app didn\u2019t make her seem smarter, it turned her into maybe one of the smartest people on the planet. And right as you think that, you start to get another evil idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex: Do you think you\u2019d be able to rob a bank?<br>\r\nLily: One around here, I could be back home with the money before dinner. Something like JP Morgan Chase would probably take me a couple days to plan and execute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour not sure what that is, but after looking it up you realize it\u2019s the biggest bank in America. Do you want to go for the big score, or just keep doing what you\u2019ve been doing?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You then actually take a shower so it doesn\u2019t seem suspicious. You go downstairs to empty food containers everywhere. Three bags of lays chips, 2 boxes of cereal, 2 gallons of milk, 2 trays of Oreos, a recently opened 36 pack of granola bars, and some other boxes. You go outside to your dad grilling and eating a burger at the same time, while your family is feasting with at least 3 dogs or burgers on each plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom: Sorry you almost missed out Alex, if you don\u2019t want one of your burgers I\u2019ll eat it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a huge 5 pound container of potato salad, this has always been one of your favorite foods since you were little.

You walk to the vegetable section in the freezer isle but pass the iced cream on the way there. You try not to look but you see the cookie dough iced cream and grab a couple boxes out of impulse. You keep strolling and get to the vegetables, and grab broccoli, peas, carrots, cauliflower and some others. You try to go straight to the register but bass the candy and see the sour patch kids, you grab 3 2 pound bags. Leaving the isle you see Recce\u2019s Cups and grab 2 24 boxes. Leaving the isle you see your mom eating all the free samples of jalape\u00f1o bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssociate: Ma\u2019am, your only supposed to have one..<br>\r\nMom: I\u2019m buying 6 boxes I can have as many as I want..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get curious and wonder what would happen if you hit this associate with the apps powers. Since your family lost interest quick after you got them, maybe this lady won\u2019t care after. You walk up to her and say \u201cexcuse me\u201c then take the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssociate: What the hel.. actually, so can I. I sit here drooling over them all day and never eat one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady takes out another try and starts eating it, with your mom picking at it any opportunity she could. The associate then puts more in the microwave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex: Mom are you ready, I\u2019m getting too tempted by some of this stuff.<br>\r\nMom: I know, it\u2019s great having a career and being able to afford it. Maybe that will get you to get better grades haha.<br>\r\nDad: Hey buddy, since your only getting one cart of food for your car can you stop at lows and grab those mini fridges, the basement one should already be delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to check out and see the Doritos and Oatmeal cakes, you grab 5 bags and 10 boxes. You love oatmeal cakes so much in fact you devour a box then grab another to replace it real quick. Lastly you see chocolate milk and grab 3 gallons. You pay with your dads credit card since he gave it to you for the fridges. On your way to lows you see a Five Guys, which was your favorite fast food. You knew how unhealthy it was but couldn\u2019t resist and stop after you get the fridges. You get inside and the aroma hits you like a rock in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCashier: What would you like?<br>\r\nAlex: Can I get 3 double bacon burger meals with a large chocolate shake.<br>\r\nCashier: To go?<br>\r\nAlex: For here, now that I think of it though get me the same order in 15 minutes to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe assumes theres more people in your group coming, but you sit down and start devouring it. You go into almost a trance as you eat all 6 huge patties and drinking the milkshake straight out of the cup without a straw. You sit there after, leaning back in you chair with your pants cutting your sides. You look up to the register and see the girl that checked you out giving you a gross look. You go up and try to give her a new perspective. You hold the camera up and take a picture of her, along with half of the kitchen that was looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCashier: Hey... that was actually pretty hot. Are you like a professional eater?<br>\r\nAlex: No, just craving these insane burgers haha. <br>\r\nCashier: I\u2019m Jess by the way, you wanna hang out sometime?<br>\r\nAlex: For sure, what do you have in mind?<br>\r\nJess: There\u2019s this great Chinese buffet down the road, I wanna see how much you can really eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look confused but are weirdly aroused by it. You start to think the app changes your kinks too, your a stuffer on the inside but don\u2019t want to be. Since some of the cooks ate your meal before giving it to you... twice, you share a couple shakes and get to know Jess a little before you leave. You start eating the fries on the way home like usual, but can\u2019t resist and start eating the burgers you got for your sisters. In the middle of eating one as fast as possible before you see blue and red lights behind you. You pull over and the cop walks up to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCop: You know it\u2019s illegal to eat and drive right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panic and do the only thing you know how, take a picture of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCop: Say.. if you give me the rest of that food I\u2019ll let you be on your way. And one of those chocolate milks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give him the food and he leaves, wondering how big he would be when you see him at the parade next summer. You get home and set up the mini fridges, outing all your groceries in yours to keep safe. You see your parents pull in after an hour of being home. Your surprises to see your aunt pull in as well with a car full of groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom: Thank you so much Stacy for helping us get these here.<br>\r\nAunt: No problem, I just wish you would tell me what this is for. There\u2019s no way you guys are eating $2,000 worth of groceries in a week or two.<br>\r\nMom: Try me, why don\u2019t you stay for dinner and see?<br>\r\nAunt: You said you each ate like 5 burgers each earlier and your still hungry?<br>\r\nMom: I had 4 burgers and 6 hot dogs, get it right haha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour family all pitches in to make dinner but you, since your not trying to gain weight. You lock yourself in your room, still eating sour patches though. Your dad start cooking 2 more boxes of burgers with a steak for everyone. Your mom start cooking a pound of pasta, Amanda deep fried a couple bags of wings. Lily helps out by making a couple trays of brownies and cake. Your Aunt is surprised by the meal when it\u2019s finished. She sits down with a burger and a couple wings, while everyone having at least 3 full plates at a time. Hell, Lily had the least and still had 3 hot dogs, 2 burgers, 3 big scoops of pasta and a dozen wings. Stacy tried to start conversation but everyone is entranced in the food, not even realizing she\u2019s here until it\u2019s gone. She then starts talking for a minute about her work struggles, then the oven beeps. Everyone runs over to get a piece before it\u2019s gone, while your aunt just sits there staring, amazed. She leaves shortly after and everyone goes to their rooms for the night and snack until they pass out. You sit on your bed, bloated as hell, thinking if you should work out or not.</span></div></div>",

You haven\u2019t been eating as much as your family, but still definitely getting big fast. You weren\u2019t exactly skinny before, but now you have a gut that almost completely covers your dick when you look down, your boobs have also gotten a little bugger and wider. You look over and grab a 2 pound bag of sour patch kids and eat half before you put it down and think. You just really realize how much you\u2019ve let yourself go when you can sit up and put a water bottle straight up on your stomach. You go in the bathroom to check the scale, it says 267. Your in complete shock, and go back to your room quickly. You try to do a sit up, but you can\u2019t without swinging your arms because of how big your belly got. You try to do push ups, and only manage 5 half pushups. You look over at a mirror with a picture of you and your family next to it. Your face is twice as big as it was a few years ago, and your cheeks are starting to look like Santa Claus. Your door opens and Lily walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily: Can I get some more M&amp;Ms?<br>\r\nAlex: Here, take the rest.<br>\r\nLily: WOW thanks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks the most different out of anyone. A year ago she looked like a typical 10 year old, even on the skinny side. Now she\u2019s definitely the biggest kid in her class. She went from 80 pounds to 145 in a year. Her waist doubled do to her height with a belly like half a foot past her nose. Her face also looked like a cabbage patch kid, including a couple big rolls replacing her neck. The school kept calling, saying she was getting 3 or 4 lunches a day and hiding snacks in class, but my mom never thought it was weird. You go to the hallway and see your other sister coming out of the bathroom with a sports bra and leggings. She usually doesn\u2019t wear a shirt because she keeps outgrowing them. She went from 130 to 210 in the past year. A year ago she was very in shape and almost had a six pack, now her belly hangs an inch over her pants and her ass got huge. She went from a size 4 jeans to a size 16, and has more than 2 chins at most times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda: Your bellies lookin big, I wish that was mine instead of it going to my ass, even though I\u2019m not complaining about that haha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad then walks out of the room, weighing a little over 400, gaining over 130 pounds in the last year. His body didn\u2019t change much except for things getting bigger. His belly stuck out at least a foot past his belt, and his boobs obviously got huge. He also grunts way more than he used to when he moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad: Come on Amanda, your brother got a bigger gut than you and he\u2019s not even trying!<br>\r\nAmanda: I know I\u2019m pissed, at least I have the second biggest ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis makes you realize how big your mom got. She went from 127 to 250, the most out of anyone in the family. She\u2019s secretly been having an affair with your dad with a stuffer, she\u2019s been leaving at night when everyone\u2019s asleep and eats at his appointment until the sun rise, telling dad she leaves for work before he gets up. She went from an average skinny mom bod to full out BBW. Her jeans size went from a 5 to a 24, and bra went from B cup to a Q cup. Her stomach is also out to her boobs and hips over twice as wide as a year ago. You walk downstairs to see her make breakfast. She was making her favorite, a dozen scrambled eggs, a pack of bacon pieced up, a pack of sausage links, and a bag of shredded cheese in a big mixing bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom: Morning Alex, you want a pack of bacon?<br>\r\nAlex: Yes, but I can\u2019t, I\u2019m gunna try to loose weight.<br>\r\nMom: What?! Why? Your gut looks good on you, I thought you\u2019d hit 300 by the end of the year for sure!<br>\r\nAlex: As much as I kind of want too.. I never wanted to get this big. I want to be able to see my feet when I look down.<br>\r\nMom: I guess.. if your into that. Plus Jess loves your belly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve been dating that girl from Five Guys that you hit with the flash. She was a slightly chubby girl, about 150, but now she was 250 with a huge gut. Her boobs only got a little bigger, but her stomach and bottom half are enormous. She always tries to get you to feed her, but you feel conflicted and don\u2019t. Where does the rest of the day go?</span></div></div>",

You were doing pretty good until you got to college, then you made the freshman 15 look like a bitch, gaining 80 pounds your freshman year. Your friends tried to help you, but it got harder to control your appetite. You started hiding food and leaving to eat when nobody was there. You walk over to your closet and grab a shirt you bought a year ago. You put it on and it barely goes past your belly button, then rides up when you let go. It also doesn\u2019t help that your dad upgraded the mini fridges to normal sized ones in each room, plus an iced cream freezer in the closet. You walk to the bathroom with a slight waddle now, but run into Lily with your belly and knock her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily: Watch it!<br>\r\nAlex: Sorry, I didn\u2019t even see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily is 14 now, and started freshman year at 220 pounds. She\u2019s officially morbidly obese at 240 and waddles more than walks at this point. She got embarrassed earlier in the year for breaking a chair in class and also for passing out during the mile. Her body can\u2019t keep up with her weight, and she just keeps getting bigger every year regardless of getting taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily: Hey can you drive me to Dairy Queen to get an iced cream cake for breakfast?

Your moms not too far behind, weighing 320 and struggles to get through the door way for on how wide she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex: Do you guys want anything?<br>\r\nMom: Just take my card and get 10 different kinds of cakes and some dilly bars if you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to the car and fall in the seat. You realize your gut hits the steering wheel now, which is making it hard to drive. You think of maybe getting a bigger car. Your sister gets in and when she sits down, the button on her jeans flies off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily: Ehh, these pants were doomed from the beginning haha, let\u2019s stop at Walmart so I can get some new sweat pants. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re falling off anyway haha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to Dairy Queen and grab 10 cakes, but knowing your parents still make allot working from home, you just buy all the boxes of dilly bars. Your sister starts digging into a cake on the way to Walmart, and gets damn near done with it when you get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily: Do you think I can bring a box of dilly bars in?<br>\r\nAlex: They don\u2019t sell them here so it\u2019s not like they think your stealing them.... actually I might as well bring one too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get inside eating the bars and go to the clothes section. You look at the larges and think how it would fit like a tank top now, though you do pick up a 3XL shirt while your there. Lily grabs the biggest sweat pants there and you go to check out. You see a full display box of recces cups sitting there and grab the whole thing. On your way out you see Jess, the girl you met at Five Guys. She left you about a year ago for a stuffer, he was a skinny boy though. She\u2019s about 250 now with a huge gut and DD boobs as well, but was still trying to get bigger. Her parents sent her to fat camp after she started gaining rapidly over a year after you flashed her, but that\u2019s  basically just porn for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess: Hey Alex! What\u2019s up?<br>\r\nAlex: Nothing much, just brought my sister to get new pants, hbu?<br>\r\nJess: My parents are being dicks and won\u2019t let me eat what I want, so I'm going shopping for myself. Your belly\u2019s looking good though haha, what are you up to?<br>\r\nAlex: 350... I\u2019m actually trying to loose weight.<br>\r\nJess: What? No.. I mean.. that\u2019s cool. I think it looks good on you though haha. I\u2019m trying to get to 300 by the end of the year.<br>\r\nAlex: That would be hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blurt that out of nowhere, it just came out of you like you\u2019ve been wanting to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess: Really... maybe You can come over and you feed me a shake or two haha.<br>\r\nAlex: Uhhh.. It\u2019s a date.</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into her room and get grabbed from behind.
