Eight tons of sweating, blue furry flab, just about every part on Sonic's once slim and taut body was grossly exaggerated to a comical extent. Over a dozen times the size of his original size, his stomach sat out a good metre from himself, quivering and shaking like a bowel of jelly with even the slightest provocation. Resting either side on top and to his sides were his arms and legs, almost entirely submerged in a thick ring of blubber which stopped Sonic from doing much more than wiggle his largely obscured feet and sausage-like fingers. You could be excused for missing these features however, given how he now sported a chest which would put Rouge's to shame, each male boob the size of a deflated yoga-mall sagging to the sides of his stomach. The crowning part of this gargantuan hedgehog however were the two miniature mountains he now uncharacteristically called his butt cheeks, their size dwarfing the rest of his body as his bloated head leaned contently back into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, why would I want to get rid of all <i>this</i> doc?\" Sonic asked with a noticeably lower voice, seemingly unaware it was himself who'd waddled in a few hours earlier, barely mobile and desperately begging for medical attention. \"How'd I even get in here, I think it's been a few minutes since I ate something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlabbergasted at the once speedy character's sudden acceptance of his incredible bulk, the doctor found himself in a bind. On one hand, the subject was obviously delirious. On the other hand, he was rather bluntly denying his services, and holding the hedgeblob here against his will would be tough to justify if Sonic was far too immobile to prove he was a risk to himself or others. Not to mention all Mobian medical science would've told you what was sitting before him was physically impossible, and that the patient in front of him should've keeled over and died from that amount of blubber on that small a subject before he even reached the medical labs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing awkwardly, the doctor shrugged and found himself inable to administer the closest thing they had to an antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you have any family or friends who can ship you off- I mean, pick you up and take you home, Mr. The Hedgehog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking to himself for a moment (inbetween the near-constant euphoric thoughts of eating), Sonic answered...</span></div></div>",

I really gotta go to the bathroom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving in a blistering quick half-hour after Sonic first named her as his emergency contact, Amy jumped out of her tiny car and ran into the Mobius hospital's front desk, terrifying the receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TELL ME WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH MY BOYFRIEND!!!\" She screamed, the meek worker calming Amy down as she explained Sonic was in surprisingly good health for his condition, the rest of the medical spiel Amy quickly drowned out her medical mumbo-jumbo with musings about Sonic, even as she was being escorted to the lab they were holding him in by another nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Man, out of everyone he could've chosen, Sonic wanted ME to pick him up~! I have to hand it to myself, years of stalking, rooting through bins and breaking several restraining orders will always eventually get through to a guy! Heck, this sickness of his is probably made up just as an excuse to see lil' old me~!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Amy had bothered listening to what the original phone-call from the hospital had said beyond Sonic requesting she retrieve him, of course. So when the pair finally reached the door to Sonic's room, Amy was a bit confused as why the nurse rested a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Look, Miss Rose? I just want you to take a deep breath before you walk in; it must be a lot to take in everything that's happened to Sonic today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What with the who now? Doesn't he just have like, a cold or something-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" ... Miss Rose, haven't you been paying attention to anything I was just briefing you on? The extreme changes, the personality change, how he's essentially a different person now, not to mention the sme-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeey- Is that a certain lady I hear out there, or are my ears deceiving me~?\" A low voice rumbled from out the door, the nurse sighing as Amy promptly ignored the nurse once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me Sonic, Amy~! I've come here to pick you up~!\" Amy called through the door, the nurse making every effort to keep it shut as Amy tried to push past her. \"P-please Miss Rose, I t-t-t-think you should listen to me before going i-i-inside!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on in honey, lovebirds like us can't be kept apart for long~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Amy's heart soared a million miles, the girl almost instinctively throwing the nurse to the side as she ran in, the nurse calling after her. \"WAIT, YOU FORGOT YOUR... Awwww screw it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning into the middle of the lab with a skip, Amy opened her eyes and was met with one hell of a sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise! How do you like my new look, cutie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in front of her was several tons of pure hedgehog, Sonic's blue and vanilla fur raining down rivers of sweat  as mixture of waste, drool and slobber pooled around both his body and Amy's feet, Sonic's bearing a smug smile in his flabby, slightly sunken head on the top of his mountainous body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeechless, the nurse slowly tiptoed next to Amy, completely decked out in a hazardous material suit. \"Uh... Yeah, you're supposed to be wearing one of these to be in here. Plus, y'know, you boy friends an enormous blob who apparently gets his kicks taking a dump everywhere. Actually, you're the first person to walk into here since he started soiling himself constantly without wearing some form of protection, so... umm... Y'know...\"</span></div></div>",

It just felt right to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile rubbing the moob, her glove would pick up some of the sweat, darkening it a bit, but it also made Amy smile whenever it hit sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Sonic was asleep, he did feel Amy massaging his boob and began to moan in pleasure, resulting in drool flowing from his mouth like a waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes Sonic, that\u2019s so adorable.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s mind was beginning to change as a result of touching Sonic. It was beginning to accept the idea of being a slob, of being fat, of being lazy. She began to think that Sonic was hotter obese than skinny. Now he could not outrun her when she chases him. He is helpless, like a scared dog, and Amy loves that idea the longer she rubs Sonic\u2019s moob. She then began to fantasize Sonic being a bigger slob and herself at the same size, with Sonic treating her like a princess, stuffing her to near bursting and making love to her every night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so excited at that idea, she ripped a fart so powerful, her skirt was lifted up, revealing her butt crack. Before, she would be embarrassed after ripping a fart, but after her mind was changed, she no longer cared about society\u2019s rules regarding slobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn order for that dream to happen, I need to make it happen.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nonchalantly walked out of the room before being confronted by the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d asked the doctor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel fine Doctor. He didn\u2019t affect me at all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s odd, but okay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy left the hospital, her green eyes began to glow red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I should get something to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not that he seemed to care, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll have to do... Ugh, since when've these booths been so SMALL?\" Wedging himself out, his entire body quaking with every hevay footstep he took, Sonic gave his farewells to a bewildered Chuck and continued his way home, rubbing his jigglying gut contently as it only started to slowly dawn on him just how huge a change he'd taken.</span></div></div>",

The problem was though, a small part of him knew all this eating was a bad idea.

His dreadlocks were matted and dripping with sweat. His huge pair of moobs rested on top of an immense greasy, food smeared stomach. A thick stream of drool flowed down his doughy body, splashing against the floor. A small puddle of their sweat and drool was forming in between them as they stood. Even his face was looking fat! His cheeks were large and soft, his neck was thick and almost non-existent with a few double chins resting on his chest. His mittens were stained with what ever he had been shoveling food messily into his mouth, evidence of this food still covering his mouth and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed too good to be true for Sonic, his friend in the same state as him!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had not been an easy afternoon for Knuckles. The echidna had been running himself ragged. He had hoped to be left to his own devices following the collapse of the Machine Empire and the routing of Doctor Robotnik. He had been holding his breath for Victory Day, when the free peoples of Mobius would break out the champagne. Not a moment had passed following Robotnik's retreat before Knuckles found himself being called away from the battle. Something strange had befallen General Fairfax. The once energetic, dynamic commander of the Dalmont 23rd Infantry had swollen into a huge, indolent mass of flesh, all thoughts of battle plans and strategies lost in a never-ending hunger. Knuckles had nearly despaired, but had managed to rally the Staff Officers and the NCO's single-handedly, and had already issued instructions for Fairfax to be escorted where his new-found gluttony would not be detrimental, all the while making sure that the convoy carried enough fruits and vegetables to help him through the trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere moments later, he was summoned to the Principality of Soleanna to try and help Elise, who only a week ago, had worked herself to the bone to mobilise her army. He sighed at the sight; Elise was nigh-unrecognisable, a huge mountain of human fat billowing and bulging out in all directions. He could only repeat the instructions to her servants and ladies-in-waiting and hope that the Princess's hunger would only be temporary. Within an hour, he received a summons demanding his aid in assisting no fewer than seventeen individuals, all of them scattered about the continent, all of them prominent military or political figures, all of them fattened to an impossible degree, all of them losing their intellect in a vast, bottomless stupor. This had all the makings of a ploy from Robotnik. It made perfect sense:- infect every public figure, force them into indolence, resulting in a withdrawal or consolidation of resources and soldiers, allowing time for Robotnik to retreat, regroup, replan and rebuild. Now, all Knuckles had wanted was to find someone who had not been suddenly struck by this insane malaise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hopes were dashed at the sight of his old friend and comrade, Sonic. Once a lightning fast beacon of hope, now he had been swollen into a vast, rounded giant of a hedgehog. Knuckles could barely see Sonic's legs, wide as they were, behind that massive, pendulous gut. He saw huge, bloated arms hang loosely from the shoulders, the spherical upper arms almost obscured by the large, doughy man-breasts that sat on the hedgehog's stomach. His face had become almost spherical, multiple chins wobbling and jiggling with each breath. His eyes stared lazily in Knuckles's direction, all life in them gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Knuckles! Looking pretty good there...\" Sonic finally chuckled. Before long, a large belch echoed from the hedgehog's mouth as he rubbed at his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles could only sigh. \"You've been infected too? This thing is getting huge...\" Already, the weight of this news was bringing down further than the day's fatigue could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" Sonic nodded, \"You look good with a belly. I thought I'd be the only slob here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles looked up, ready to retort that his stomach was perfectly lean and not at all like the massive belly bouncing and shaking in front of him. No sooner had he opened his mouth - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to make four Triple Giga Deluxe orders. Should I order eight, now you're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles froze. What was going on? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Knuckles? You hungry? You're pretty quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles watched, puzzled. Did Sonic actually think <i>he</i> had become infected as well? Could he only see a huge, fat slob like himself standing before him? Would everyone in Mobius look like a slob in the lazy eyes that Sonic now had?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles had to reach a decision. Already, Sonic's brow became furrowed with suspicion.</span></div></div>",

If he could continue remaining under the radar, he would be able to find out more about this ailment, and perhaps even take a blood sample from Sonic. Yes! It could work! He would be able to take it to where it could be analysed. A cure could be reverse-engineered from the virus! The war could yet be won! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles shrugged. It was time to get into character. \"*Urrrrrrrp!* Though I guess it doesn't matter, I'm finding this sorta-\" the echidna said in-between some heavy breathing. He paused for a second, trying to find a way to further convince Sonic of his new-found state. Rolling his eyes, he slowly lifted his leg and pressed his signature knuckles against his mouth, making a noise like a wet, sputtering fart. \"*FRRRRRPPPPT~!*... nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning as he saw his once athletic friend already starting to live it up as fat and heavy as himself, Sonic waddled over and tried to reach a pudgy, grease-stained finger towards him, perhaps to pick some food he had imagined were on his person. Giving up, he let his arm flop back down to his side. Knuckles breathed a silent sigh of relief when Sonic failed to touch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too bad, Knuckles the Fatso... Though I'm surprised you're down here, leaving that Master Emerald all by itself on Angel Island...\" Giddy at hearing just how truly apathetic and lazy in regards to his responsibilities he'd gotten, Sonic waited for a response from his now blushing echidna friend. Knuckles had forgotten entirely about the Master Emerald! The war had pulled him away from his duty; could something have happened to it? He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne problem at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, eh... Well, it was really hard guarding that emerald all the time and... Oh damn it Sonic, I came down here to stuff my face with as much greasy junk food as I could! There, you happy?\" Knuckles spat out, trying not to rouse suspicion. He breathed freely again when his friend merely laughed. \"Pfffft, of course I am! Wouldn't want a fellow slob to put something like defending his ancestor's home ahead of stuffing himself, silly, now would I? Though if you if you think you can out eat this hedgehog- *PRrrrrrrffffftttt~!* You got another thing coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles smirked. Suddenly, his chances of acquiring that cure had been imbued. Well, he thought, now onto step two. \"*URP!* Oh, so you see this all as a game, huh?\" he boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would I ever see it as anything else? I'll choose the venue and we can pig out to our hearts content... Don't feel bad if you can't eat everything, I'll be perfectly fine just eating anything you can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Sonic waddled up towards Knuckles; it was all the echidna could do to stand on the spot and hope that his stomach did not get into contact with Sonic's massive belly apron. Backing away would look like a defensive act, and would probably set his super-sized friend on edge. Knuckles raised his voice, fear lending volume. \"Hey, I bet I could out eat you ten times over, skinny! I travelled several miles just to pig out after all!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, it's just a friendly competition; we can even convert a few friends to be like our slobby-selves on the way there! Might even take a liking to Amy if she'd stop obsessing over me and start obsessing over slobbing up herself... BUT anyway, what do you say two obese studs like us should binge on first, Knuckles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles shrugged. \"You're choosing the venue, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic paused.</span></div></div>",

Sonic waddled through the automated doors and turned around to look at his hesitating friend, asking \"What are you waiting for?\" Thinking quickly, Knuckles feigned exhaustion by panting heavily and leaning against a wall. \"Wait a minute.\" he wheezed \"We must have walked like two whole blocks to get here.\" The echidna tried his hardest to devise a plan to escape the situation before he was snapped out of his thoughts by Sonic belching loudly. He looked at the obese hedgehog, wondering how long he had been lost in thought. His friend's lazy stare didn't imply that he was getting suspicious, but you never knew...</span></div></div>",

He hasn't been overweight until recently, I mean, you should've seen us a both a few weeks back. We were all skin and bones, but look at us now! He's still growing, but you know... *URRRP* He just might become a regular if you let him check the place out.\" The robot excused itself for a second and left the room, leaving Knuckles to ponder what Sonic had just said. Was the hedgehog fooling him all along, was he aware about his facade and was just playing along? Sonic then nudged him with a sweaty, flabby arm and said \"Can't believe how picky this place is. You're probably only a few pounds lighter than me and they're still trying to keep you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot soon returned, apologizing for its earlier behaviour and informing the duo that they can both enter this time. Sonic and Knuckles were then escorted to a free booth, walking, or in Sonic's case waddling, by various slobby patrons, some of them even bigger than the obese hedgehog himself. The air in the restaurant was thick with farts and various other smells, making Knuckles wonder how anyone could eat in a place like that when the smell alone was making him feel dizzy and nauseous. As they reached their booth, the echidna sat in a massive chair, acting like he was having trouble squeezing into it in order to keep his charade up, and examined the table between them. It was basically a small buffet table stocked full of various unhealthy foods including a soda fountain in one end to help them wash all it down. By the time Knuckles had gotten over the shock of seeing so much greasy grub in one place Sonic had already filled his mouth with chili dogs and was about to reach for seconds.</span></div></div>",

It leaked thick, sludgy grease and smelled like lard, but there was something appetizing about it. He took a bite out of it and instantly a firecracker went off in his head. Every taste he had ever tasted rushed through his mind but none could compare to this burger, and he wolfed it down quickly. He immediately reached for another, not noticing a robot hand taking one out of the display and putting it in the Echidna\u2019s hand for him. Sonic was oblivious as well, simply seeing Knuckles acting as per usual, but in real life Knuckles was already sweating slightly more. As the hand made his movements closer and closer until the burgers were being deposited into his mouth, Knuckles began to forget whatever kept him from enjoying this amazing experience.</span></div></div>",

Were there a mirror, he would have seen how his face and chest were covered in grease and mayo, a testament to how sloppily he had been eating moments earlier. Seeing Sonic gorge on burgers on the other side of the table did however give him an idea of what he must look like, or would soon look like if he kept at it anyway.

I'm supposed to find out what's wrong with Sonic, not join him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unh?\" Sonic managed between bites, staring at Knuckles confusedly. \"Something wrong? You look like you bit into a veggie burger.\" Knuckles wiped his sweaty forehead and stared back at Sonic, trying to think of an excuse why he had stopped eating. His eyes wandered back to the burger he was still holding and he thought about resuming eating it, just to keep Sonic from suspecting anything. Besides, the burger was suddenly looking so appealing to him anyway, though Knuckles wouldn't yet admit it to himself. \"Yeah, that's the ticket. I'll just eat this burger and think of a plan while doing so...\" he thought as he brought it back to his mouth, unbeknownst that every bite was slowing his brain down.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sonic stared at Knuckles for a long time. Confusion and suspicion were starting to slowly rise beneath the dull haze his brain languished in. He looked at his friend. By all appearances, Knuckles was every bit as fat and doughy as he was. His belly was a massive globe of flesh puckered by a deep, dark navel, the dome smeared with all sorts of grease, sauces and discarded crumbs. His neck was hidden by huge, puffy cheeks that partially hid his eyes and chins that wobbled with each word spoken, and a drooping, bulging chest rested lazily on the red giant's gut. His arms, almost spherical with fat, slumped down the bulging, sloping sides of the echidna's ballooned waist. His nigh-conical legs held up that massive weight. In short, Knuckles looked no thinner than Sonic did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even so, there were questions that even Sonic could not put his finger on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, why did it sound like Knuckles was talking from his stomach? The echidna's lips were synchronised perfectly with what was being said, but the sound did not come from there. Whenever Sonic looked his friend in the face, he would always be drawn away from it and instead be pulled to face the source of his voice. Which was his stomach, apparently. Also, why did Knuckles sound like he did? He had always known his friend's deep baritone voice, but, for some reason, he continued to speak in the same voice he had always heard Knuckles use when the two were thin. How was it that Knuckles had been able to speak as clearly as ever? His own voice, thanks to his laboured breathing and puffy cheeks, was far raspier, thicker and deeper, to the point where even he could tell the difference! Knuckles's voice, on the other hand... A twinge of jealousy passed over Sonic's eyes. Why couldn't he be as well spoken as his friend was? What denied him, Sonic, that right? And why was Knuckles able to control <i>his</i> bodily functions so easily?! It was not as if Sonic felt the need to undertake the effort, but how was his friend able to master his new body better than he could?! The unfairness galled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also did not make sense how Sonic was unable to touch him. Just now, he tried to reach a pudgy, grease-stained finger towards his friend and just sample what he had been eating that had made him so big. He moved so close to Knuckles that it would only make sense for their massive bellies to collide with each other. They didn't. They never even touched. Sonic never felt any resistance upon his stomach. It was if Knuckles was a hologram, and he had passed right through him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why was Knuckles sounding so urgent? He was talking at a speed that completely contradicted his slobby status. All of those questions, and at such speed, made Sonic's head spin! Knuckles had sounded far too energetic, too animated, too... dynamic to be a slob, and he never seemed to need to breathe nearly as heavily for someone of his apparent size. And why was he whining about it all being part of a great, big conspiracy? What did Robotnik even do to him?! He would have known if the Doctor had done something. Couldn't Knuckles just take it down a notch?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic felt anger, humiliation and betrayal at the conclusion he finally reached. Knuckles had <i>never</i> converted to slobdom, and, in fact, had been lying to him the whole time! Was he mocking him the whole time?! Was he enjoying the thought of outwitting him? Was he going to run away on his little, nimble legs and gloat to his little, nimble friends about the day he played Sonic like a teddy bear?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic glared down at his friend. His tiny, minuscule, pompous, weak, fragile friend would be welcomed into the fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned a mirthless shark's grin.</span></div></div>",

Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could only see Knuckles's massive belly, but he could tell by its shuddering, jiggling motion that his ruse had ended. There was no escape for Knuckles the Echidna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic raised his right arm and prepared to grab him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lunged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only then remembered, as Knuckles easily stepped aside and his massive, heaving body sailed beyond all control through the air, that grabbing him in his current state would be like swatting a particularly agile and irritating fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed heavily on the floor, his huge apron of a gut cushioning his fall, and his momentum sent him skidding across the surface until his head collided with the wall. Stars danced about his vision, until he felt something move on his back, just behind his right shoulder. It was lighter than he would be, but it was certainly heavy enough to give him discomfort. He tried to look up, his weight and the many folds of flesh that enveloped his body restricting his movement and vision. He tried to reach up, his arms lazily swatting at the air, his fat legs kicking at the ground. He fidgeted and shuffled on his belly, trying to reach the annoyance, trying to roll over and crush him, trying to... trying... to... trying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slumped, his doughy arms and conical legs splayed out, and he lay still, his breath issuing from his mouth in deep, defeated sighs. He felt sweat trickle down his face in rivulets to the floor. The weight upon his back shifted and he winced as he felt and heard a hissing voice at his right ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry, Sonic,\" he heard Knuckles say, \"I am sorry that this has happened to you, and I am sorry I had to do this. You'll thank me later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a rustling behind him, as of someone searching through a backpack. He heard the snap of an opening case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a sharp sting on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was too tired to do more than moan softly as the syringe took his blood sample. His efforts to subdue Knuckles had winded him more than he anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the pressure on his right shoulder lift, and heard the slap of boots against the floor. He heard Knuckles call out as he opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sit tight, Sonic! I'll come back and fix this as soon as I can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed behind him, and the only sound left in the room was Sonic's breathing. When the big, blue hedgehog finally rolled onto his back, Knuckles had vanished.</span></div></div>",

With a growling stomach, the echidna pushed up against Sonic. Their fat pressing up against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds perfect! We need to go to one!\" Declared Knuckles, drool spraying from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and the only way to get into one is to be fat. So you might not be able to get into it chubby! Ah well, more for me!\" Grinned Sonic, his lazy mind still knowing how to push his rival's buttons \"It's only a few streets away from here, last I heard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the two once former lean heroes of the land began their new quest, gluttony. And towards their first destination, with the restaurant that only serves gluttons!  With thick tire-like legs, the slobs soon waddled their way through the town, belching and grinning to themselves as wandering people looked at them disgusted. A journey that would have normally taken them a few seconds soon took about twenty minutes, and Sonic found himself collapsing out of exhaustion and desperate hunger. Fortunately, his large bed of a belly allowed a soft landing. Knuckles himself wasn't fairing too well, he was leaning up against a wall in an alleyway a few feet away, panting and wheezing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't be walking....\"Groaned Knuckles, \"I should be eating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBZZZZST. PASSWORD ACCEPTED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic, confused, turned to face his friend only to see the echidna fall into the wall he was leaning against. The bricks had been moved away by a hidden mechanism and steps leading downwards was shown. \"Have we found it?!\" Questioned the hedgehog as he managed to lift himself up. He waddled over to the steps to find Knuckles at the bottom of them, sitting on what appeared to be a pressure pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBZZZST. WELCOME TO THE SECRET RESTAURANT OF GREAT GIRTHS. OUR READINGS INDICATE YOUR WEIGHT TO BE 200 POUNDS OVER THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT. AT YOUR SIZE, WE WILL ACTIVATE THE ESCORT CHAIR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Whaaat?\" Groaned Knuckles before he yelped. A large automated egg shaped chair soon appeared from the scales, scooping up the obese guardian and sending him through a set of doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic chuckled and gave his apron of a gut a small pat, making his way down the stairs \"Looks like we found it then! I can't wait to have more chillidogs...mmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBZZZST. WELCOME TO THE SECRET RESTAURANT OF GREAT GIRTHS.

Uuuuurp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic soon found himself whisked inside the secret building as the bricked formed behind him again, sealing the restaurant from sight. Inside, the light seemed rather dim and the room was the size of a small warehouse. There were many patrons inside, all in the egg shaped chairs and at various weights and sizes. As the hedgehogs chair zipped around the room, he noticed that many of the patrons had accepted the same slobby thought that he and Knuckles had developed. The room was filled with echoes of belches and farts and noisy eating fat slobs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic's chair had stopped at a table that already had a few people at the table, all of them were gorging themselves non-stop with food that came out of dispenser pipes placed above their heads. Knuckles was already at the table and gorging away as if he had been their for a long time, his body starting to bulge out with fat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't...wait...Food tastes soooo goood....\"Groaned Knuckles in between large fistfulls of pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic merely blinked and looked around the table, somewhere in his mind, he was a little suspicious at all the egg shaped chairs and machinery but then his giant girth rumbled loudly for his attention and he lost focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aaalright!

Well, I guess it's worth a try.\" He slowly mumbled as he started to clench his arms in anticipation for the mother of all farts.

By the time he was able to fully reclaim his senses, all he could see were piles of scrapped metal, blown to pieces by his own natural gasses and a slightly brown haze which was still drifting around the area. Not to mention the heavy stench of his butt which would probably be lingering around the street for years. Slowly heaving his body up, and noticing two large indents in the concrete where his butt cheeks had landed, Sonic slowly continued his way home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe cutting back is the last thing I should be thinking about...\" Sonic let out a few toots as he waddled along. \"Knothole could do with some...

Rubbing his flabby gut as a few small farts erupted from his butt, he opened his pantry to find his usual collection of canned chili.

LORD ROBOTNIK NEVER WENT OVER THIS SCENARIO IN THE TRAINING!*BZZZZZT*\" One asked as the other's tried desperately to remember <i>something</i> in their memory that would help them handle the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*BZZZT* MAYBE THIS IS A TRAP? I MEAN, HE'S KIND OF JUST LYING THERE. ISN'T THAT UNCOMMON FOR FLESHY BEINGS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY? *BZZZTTT*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Bzzzt* YES, BUT HE ALSO APPEARS TO BE ABOUT 300 POUNDS HEAVIER THAN WHAT OUR FILES INDICATE. PERHAPS HIS EXTRA GIRTH HAS RENDERED HIM ENABLE TO FIGHT? YES, LET'S GO WITH THAT. WE'VE WASTED TOO MUCH TIME HERE.*Bzzzt*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that Eggman's insistence of including artificial intelligence in his robots also meant he had to include artificial powers of deduction, Sonic developed a plan... Which didn't involve escape, as he was quickly starting to develop a distinct love for himself, and a total disregard for anyone who did <i>not</i> fall into that very select demographic. \"*Brrrrapt!* Hey, uh, robot dudes... I know what 'surrender means!\" Sonic said in his slow, heavy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Bzzzzt* SHOULD WE LISTEN TO HIM? *Bzzzzt*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Bzzzzt* WHY NOT. AT THIS POINT IN TIME HE IS THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL PROVIDING US WITH ADVICE. *Bzzzt*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, listen to me... Whatever, look- *Prrrrrrffffffffffft*... 'scuse the smell guys, anyway, what 'surrender' means is you stuff me with as much food as possible! You don't even *hic* take me to Eggman, he'll just *Urrrrrrrrp!* yell at you for mishandling a 'delicate' situation...\" Lazily fingering his bellybutton with his chubby, greasy fingers, the hedgehog smirked as the robots started to march off, a few picking him up (with some effort due to his added blubber) as they marched him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Bzzzzt* THERE IS A FACTORY NORTH FROM HERE WE WILL TAKE YOU TO. IT IS FILLED WITH SEVERAL YEARS WORTH OF LIQUIDS AND CONDIMENTS, MOST OF THEM HIGH IN CALORIES. IT IS THERE YOU WILL 'SURRENDER' AND WE WILL CLAIM VICTORY FOR THE EGGMAN EMPIRE. *Bzzzzt*\" One mech said in a monotone voice, Sonic simply drifting off to sleep as he started to dream of the waves of junk food he was about to be filled up with to his hearts content...</span></div></div>",

His amazing intellect slowly washed away as a warm feeling of euphoria seemed to envelop him entirely, only growing stronger the more he let go of his previous inhibitions.

Right! It was filled with all the Robians too.... But what could be going on there?\" Tails decided to change course and investigate. \"It may not be friendly, but they need help!\" He said, knowing that Sonic and the other Freedom Fighters wouldn't back down, so neither would he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails eventually managed to reach the dome covered city and observed it from the air. \"The glass is hard to see through... but it doesn't look bad...\" He started talking himself out of investigating. \"No! They sent that Distress Call for a reason. I need to go down and check.\" Tails piloted the plane closer to the ground and looked for an entrance to land by. However all of the normal entrances were completely sealed off, with no guards surrounding the outside. This did strike him as odd. Who was keeping them prisoners in the dome? If he couldn't investigate from above. He'd have to enter from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActivating some switches on the Tornado, Tails made it shift from its normal plane mode, to that of a drill. A very recent addition he might add... Having timed the morph perfectly, he collided with the ground and burrowed underneath several yards, then began making his way upward through the glass, until he broke through the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was hardly out of the plane before he was gagging. The smell that permeated the air smelled like rotten eggs and skunks. He got out and fumbled around trying to get away from the scent... wherever it was coming from, but there was no escaping it. The entire dome reaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could do anything, several of the inhabitants approached him. His entrance wasn't exactly quiet. \"What are... *Urp* You doing here?!\" One of the portly members stated. Tails could see that all of them were all a varying degree of overweight, and their clothes were stained with grunge. Not something the inhabitants used to be known for. \"I heard the Distress Call on the radio... *Cough* and I came to help.\" Tails answered them, trying to stay focused over the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest of the members, a bear started a combination of laughing and belching at the same time. \"You Stupid Runt! *Burp* That aint a Distress Call. It'sa bloody Quarantine Announcement! We's been locked in 'ere for the past few days, aint you get that part?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails froze. The Static in the Radio completely cut out the parts that could have mentioned the quarantine, and now he was smack dab in the middle of it.... Whatever it was. \"Uh... Hey... Let me.... see if there's anything I can do...\" Tails offered nervously, now fearing for his own safety here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuthin we, anyone else, or even ya can do 'bout it.\" Another member gawked. And it's too late fer ya to play doctah....... This Shits Airborne....... Welcome to the *URRP* Club.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails heart dropped, his legs wobbled, it took all he could to not fall over. \"C-Club.... What Club?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bear Spoke. \"I called it the Slob Virus. *Belches* back when I was still doctorin....\" Tails only looked at him with confusion. The bear looked, acted, smelled, and acted like someone he'd find in a Trailer Park. Not a Doctor by any chance. The Bear let off a large fart before continuing. Not even acknowledging it, \"Best get used to this Fox.\" He said patting his belly. \"First the weight starts... and it aint gonna stop.... Then the gas..... *Urp* Oh yeah... the gas... and then...\" He laughed and stopped. \"Why Spoil the fun. You'll see 'ventually...\" He motioned for the others to head out.

Only to see a tube open and a morbidly obese dog covered in yellow sludge exited triumphantly to the sounds of even more cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man Tails could only assume was running the thing was another fox like himself, only this one was one of the largest people he'd ever seen.

Tails however wanted no part in that and did his best to not attract any attention. However as fate would have it, the obese eagle next to Tails let one rip right in his face, causing Tails to enter a coughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!\" The Fatfox said pointing at Tails. \"Step Right Up And Step Into the Tube Of Doom! Tails attempted to protest, but several eager slobs pushed him into the tube and the door instantly closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS! LET ME OUT!\" Tails panicked and beat on the door, and despite it being clear, none of the slobs did anything but laugh. Tails looked around for an escape, and his eyes lit up when he saw a hole in the roof. He attempted to make a dash for it, but it was instantly covered up with a seal which read . <b>\"LARD\"</b> Tails could barely see the other side of the seal, but he managed to see an ungodly sized  canister above him. Before he could think of anything else. He heard the Crowd Chanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIVE! FOUR! THREE! ONE! GO!!!!\" They yelled as the substance Tails could only presume was Lard dropped from the hole at a consistent pace. \"LET ME OUT OF HERE!\" He said angirly trying to push his way out to no avail. The lard started building up at his feet. making it harder to move. He turned to the Fat Fox to try and let him out. \" GET ME OUT OF HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fat Fox Laughed. \"Best Get to Drinkin then....\" He burped. \"Or do ya wanna drown? This thin..*urp* Fills up nice and good.... Gotta eat your way out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was on the verge of tears. He needed to get out, but after what he was told to do.... He grabbed a handful of the lard and tasted it. Tails almost gagged at how it tasted. But ate it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next several minutes Tails did the best he could to scoop up and eat as much as he could, but just like the size of his growing belly, the lard inside the tube was increasing at a pace faster than he could eat. In between bites Tails managed to spot a timer with 14:23 on it and counting down. It had to be the timer. All he needed to do was outlast it. But looking at how high the lard was. There was no way he could last....</span></div></div>",

He couldn't see the damage that had been done to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like he was there for an eternity as the fat went into him and packed on his body while the onlooking slobs cheered him on, until eventually the doors opened and Tails fell out. But only part way he was stuck on the door frame. Tails examined himself. \"Oh My God....\" He muttered, looking over his lard covered body. He was at least 200 pounds heavier than he was when he started. He managed to wiggle himself free and roll into the crowd. He felt more like a water balloon than a fox right now.

Not so fortunate was the enormous layer of furry fat pinning the fox down, Tails soon enough recollecting his memory as he used a crate to heave himself up, which was easier said then done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap... *HUFF* That really... *Pant* did a number on me... *GASP*\" He wheezed inbetween attempts to prop himself up, using a lard-stained arm to wipe his brow as he looked to see he was still at the Tube of Doom stage, albeit abandoned with nary a person in sight. Before he could start to waddle off, Tails yelled in surprise as a thundering fart boomed behind him. Looking around he saw the enormous 'host' fox from earlier right up behind him as he casually licked his fingers clean of food, his sweat and slime-drenched gut rubbing right up against Tails' comparatively tiny belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh h-hi there, d-didn't see you t-t-there!\" The smaller fox let out with a nervous stutter, still intimidated by the host's tremendous girth... and his pungent stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

I... Uh... had f-f-fun playing?\" Tails started with his best attempt at being genuine, unsure of whether this slob had the mental capabilities to pick up on sarcasm. If he hadn't been so preoccupied with the world's most awkward conversation and trying not to gag at the gas assaulting his delicate nose, Tails might have noticed the sound of foot steps and soft breathing slowly beginning to build around the nearby ally ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you help me with something?\" The host responded, again without a single hint of expression as he slothfully scratched his enormous sagging butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a situation Tails could help out with rather than getting caught up in some bizarre distractions! \"Oh yes, I'm always here to help out with-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tails could even finish, he was caught off by waves of obese Dome City residents, even more than earlier rushing in (or as fast as an obese slob can rush) to gather around the pair, their cheers mixed in with a cacophony of farts and burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MR. GUY AFTER BEATING THE TUBE OF DOOM HAS AGREED TO 'HELP' US OUT BY BEING OUR FIRST EVER CONTEST OOOOOOOOoooooooooonnnnn-\" The enormous host suddenly started to yell, still struggling to sound too excited as Tails felt himself pulled back onto a large chair and strapped on by an unseen assistant behind him, a large belt tying deep into his big gut as a gas mask was lowered onto his head and tied on tight, with a smaller hose making its way down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MASK OF DOOM.\" He finished, Tails' muffled cries for help falling on deaf and apathetic ears as the host picked up two hoses, one connected to his gas mask and the other to the smaller hose in his throat. As Tails could already have guessed, another towering canister of lard was where the feeding hose connected. The other however, the host merely held up as the fat victim in the chair could only watch with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This particular game has two contestants, one... Luckier then the other.\" The host explained, the large trumpet of gas apparently the slob-equivalent to a wink. \"Who here feels they've got the biggest, ripest, stinkiest gas in Dome City and feels Mr. Whatever here should breathe 'em all up?\" He asked, the crowd exploding in members begging to be player number two before a baboon girl nearly the size of the host muscled her way into the center of the crowd, her bright red asscheeks easily her biggest feature. Gulping as she stomped her way to his chair, this girl seemed different to the host and other slobs Tails had encountered; while the other's seemed sluggish and lethargic, this slob if anything seemed inexplicably hyper, her manic grin and constant movement at odds with her enormous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, *BRAPT~!* What's yer name?\" \"Barbara~!\" The baboon yelled, doing a playful handstand with unbelievable finesse as she proudly erupted a fart into the air. \"And why do you think you should be player number 2?\" \"Why not let the audience see why?\" Barbara giggled, thrusting her bright red rear to the in awe audience. Larger than some of the members in the crowd, the cheeks were covered in a thick layer of slime and sweat that splashed over the audience, the smell so foul it could literally be seen permeating off each cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Infected on the first week, never washed, never prouder baby~! Now let's give cute little pipsqueak here a game to remember~...\" The baboon cooed as she snatched the hose off the host and promptly shoved it up her butt, snickering at Tails' terrified face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now remember, you gotta finish another one of those canisters of lard while monkey girl here keeps on farting; you understand all that?\" \"Mmmpth Mmpth!*\" \"Awww, stop delaying things buster, he's almost as excited as I am to start~!\"</span></div></div>",

The canine was preoccupied with eating a dish of food that he somehow had to answer him. Tails huffed and asked him. \"Hey! Um... isn't there something you can do about that odor?\" The wolf looked up at him, gave a dumb laugh and let out an audible fart, making the room smell even worse than it did. \"Urp.... Hows that?\" he then let out a belch right in Tails face, causing the fox to almost hurl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You uh.... are you like..... yeah you're new around here kid....\" The dog huffed, and struggling to make a sentence. Tails nodded and held his nose. \"You can tell?\" The dog stared blankly at him for a second before responding. \"Yeah.... I mean.... I used to look like you too... Put me with a big slob.....Sped up job...\" Tails thought about what he said for a second. \"Wait... you mean the virus?!\" He began thinking out loud to himself. \"So you mean to say that the closer someone is to an infected individual, the faster the process goes?\" As he finished asking, Tails realized that he was speaking about his own rapid descent into slobdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah....\" The dog replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been in here for?\" Tails asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog finished his meal and replied</span></div></div>",

Taking a few sniffs of the strange, medicine-like smell fuming off his piece, the fox takes the plunge and bites down into it. The 'food' was about as flavorless as any sort of material could get, but before Tails could dwell on just what he was chewing on, a sudden surge of gluttony washed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, he was furiously shoving large chunks of the stuff into his mouth, barely aware of what was even happening as a mixture of food and slobber splattered all over him. It didn't take long for Tails to cut out the extra waiting time between picking up the slop to his mouth and opted to just shove his head into his pile, slurping madly as he only ascended for the occasional gulp of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.... I was the same, all... Scared, n' stuff before the food does it stuff...\" The slobbish wolf said as he freely gassed up the room, Tails now far beyond minding his cellmate's lack of hygiene or manners as he finishes licking his bowel and, with a satisfied belch leaned over on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what just came over me...\" Was the most Tails could muster as he caught his breath, his stomach already developing into a soft potbelly from the single meal. \"... But I think I still want more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah hah... Yeeeeup, that was me too... A few days ago I mean...\" The wolf chuckled, slowly rising to his feet, his furry stomach brushing against the floor, starting to slowly waddle towards the woozy fox. \"I was a total wuss too... You seem... Braver... Maybe it'll mean you'll take this part... Better than I did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that last line, the enormous wolf slammed his bare ass down on top of Tails head, licking his lips as he felt the puny victim struggle underneath his damp, sweaty asscheeks. Starting to talk again, the wolf made sure to let out a long, warm fart between every pause. \"Yup, part of the process... Was getting me all... 'Close' like with my slob cellmate... Can't blame 'em though... This is fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour like this, the wolf eventually let up, rolling off a now sticky, browner-stained Tails with a labored grunt. \"Enjoy the show?\" He asked with a snicker, the fox boy shell-shocked from the foul-smelling, heavy torture he just had to endure. \"Ah... Don't worry... Few more days... You'll be BEGGING for more... But you might be a bit too... BIG... to sit on... Ah well... All that exercise is making me tired...\"</span></div></div>",

'A <i>couple days</i>'?\" Tails stammered, shocked at both the definite and short deadline his imprisonment held along with the wolf's total nonchalance over the fact. \"What, is this meant to some sort of relaxing retreat for us!?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for me it sorta is... Yeah! *Gasp* Though dang, you're being even whinier... *Huff* Than I was my first time through this program, sheesh! *URP~!*  At least they let us... 'graduates' get the chance to... 'mentor' the newbies like you! ... Now stop making me... *sigh* TALK so much, food's a'comin', runt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails even more confused by the wolf's slow, belabored attempt at an explanation, the fox tried to press further before once again the small door near Tails and his smelly associate opened. Almost instinctively, Tails attempted to make a break for it, despite his added girth still more than skinny enough to crawl on through out of his gassy roommate's clutches... But quickly found himself knocked out cold with a swift boot to the head, groggily waking up back in the room... With the wolf's bare ass facing his head again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FRPPPPPPTTTTTT~!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I'M AWAKE JEEZ!\" Twice in what he could only assume was the same morning Tails found himself knocking away a gassy rear, trying to rub his face clean from the lingering stench. \"I should've figured they're prepared for escape attempts... Hang on, do you smell something? Something that ISN'T your butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning behind himself, Tails jumped back in surprise into the wolf's soft, wet stomach, too taken aback at the sight to react to the disturbingly damp fur he was sinking into. Before himself sat two enormous tiled cakes, each barely avoiding scraping against the ceiling while they took up the width of the room. Each layer of cake itself took some mental processing for its bizarre decoration; the bottom and largest cake was seemingly constructed out of nothing but pizza, its steaming warm, gooey cheese pooling around the floor. The next, a cake made entirely of burgers, with the smallest amount of possible lettuce and tomato dwarfed by thick columns of greasy meat patties and large bundles of bacon swimming in melted cheese. Above that, a cake of fried chicken. It seemed like almost a food pyramid dedicated to junk food, with the top half starting off with the sole normal cake still smothered in a rainbow of icing and sprinkles before its higher levels turn into displays of sugary sweets, ice cream and other desserts, all topped up with a comically small dollop of cream with a cheery on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breath taken away at the display of pure edible junk in front of himself, Tails was suddenly pushed into the closer cake by his cellmate, who let out a hearty laugh as Tails found the front half of his body covered in pizza cheese. \"That sure seemed to shut ya up! Now c'mon... Despite all your (ungrateful I might add!) bellyachin'... *huff* the guys upstairs have decided to bestow upon us... *pant* this most holy banquet of food! I heard one guy... Managed to eat his blessing in one sitting! Now chow down, this is how you'll REALLY learn to love the new 'you'!\"</span></div></div>",

As this happened, despite the girl's desperate attempts to break free, they were quickly restrained down into three surprisingly comfortable, yet also incredibly large lounge chairs, their legs not even reaching the very edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be too long however before these girls practically dwarfed these new chairs; Amy was already finding her dress move up along her growing body, while Mina's belly started to hang over her shorts and Sally's vest started to feel tighter around her arms. Similarly, their attitudes towards their situation were starting to change; from intense panic and anger, to somewhat more mild frustration then to simple apathy. It seemed, just like what had happened with their fat friend down below, that not only was their situation hopeless, but they no longer even saw it as a situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too  long, the girls had completely reversed their stance on being turned into slobs. Letting out a few noxious farts as she shifted her now morbidly obese 750 pound frame, Amy brought her pudgy arms, wiggling with sagging arm fat to even more hanging hoses to stuff her mouth with, not caring one bit her dress at this rate barely contained her chest, or all that was left of her panties was wedged far up her sweaty backside. Mina similarly was eager to drink more of their capture's drink, her clothes holding up even less than Amy's as her furry body oozed over her chair, so over-ambitious in trying to fit more hoses in that large drool-filled bits were leaking down her front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as if the girls extra-terrestrial kidnappers had some sort of knowledge of Mobius'; there seemed to be a very intentional effort to fatten up Sally the most, who didn't so much overflow from her couch like her friends than outright envelop it in her bulk, likely wedged up her big furry butt. She was even being injected with even more supplemental slob-related drugs then the others, some making her practically spray out sweat while others made her pungent scent so strong you could practically see green fumes coming off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after a few hours of reprogramming the girls from athletic heroes to enormous slobs, their supply of mind-numbing food slowly stopped. Hoses retracting from their mouths, the girls started to look around (or as best as they could, with their heads so bloated their necks practically didn't exist anymore), confused and even a bit sad that it all seemed to of stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the now significantly dumber girls could contemplate too much on why they were no longer having their faces stuffed, the all too familar proclamations of their alien capture boomed over an unseen intercom. \"Excellent, you girls have made <i>very</i> good test subjects! Now now, we realize that you just LOVE your new bodies, and want our special formula to chow down on for the rest of your now enlightened lives... However, this isn't possible for us; at the moment. All you three have to do is help convince this sadly naive planet of the quite literally life-changing benefits of our treatment! Now, I do believe that the lovely brown lady over there is a <i>princess</i>, is she not? We have injected you with a rare... Eh, 'treatment', that will help spread your slothful demeanor to all that surround you, yes? Very effective for transforming one's country folk! And the yellow one, you are a rock star? Well, I bet all of your fans will be pleasantly surprised to see your new 'look' at your next concert, and we shall be waiting to selflessly teach them how they too can look like a goddess! And... Eh, pink girl over there also looks very cute! Yes... Um... Tell your friends about us or something! Well then, are we clear on what you three have to do before you can have your beloved gruel... I mean, 'food' again? Excellent! Bon voyage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the girls were, much like Knuckles were dropped back down in their respective places. Sally back in the middle of Knothole Village, Mina at a concert stage and Amy in the middle of a park.</span></div></div>",

Luckily the aliens had transported Sally to the center of Knothole village, her job had become a little easier. Now most of her subjects could see her new form she had learned to love, while her subjects were repulsed and shocked by it. They all stared at Sally, trying to comprehend how their princess could have possibly changed so much in so little time. Since Sally had become the center of attention, she thought that this would be the perfect opportunity to decree a new law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention, It is time for a change in our society. I, Princess Sally, declare that from this day forward, Knothole will no longer use traditional rules of etiquette. From now on, we will be lazy, fat, smelly,and as rude as possible. I will ban manners and healthy food in order to insure that our kingdom becomes a kingdom fit for slobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing this, the crowd immediately began to whisper and chant. They began saying thing like \"Has the princess gone mad?\" \"She's an impostor, our princess isn't some fat slob.\" \"Even if she's the princess I'm not going to follow those ridiculous laws.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally over heard most of their whispers and began to become irritated by what they were saying. \"How dare they question my judgment! They should know that I know what is best for the kingdom. Perhaps I need to remind them who is in charge.\" thought Sally. Soon the Princess inhaled deeply and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>UURRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPP!!! </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Sally unleashed the most unladylike burp she had ever let out in her life! The burp was so powerful that it had knocked over anyone that was in front of her when she unleashed that belch. Though Sally did not realize what other effects that belch had. The aliens had altered Sally's body so that any of her disgusting traits would affect anyone near her. Sally's putrid scent, her sweat, her drool, her smelly breath, her burps, and her farts now had a mind numbing effect as strong as the alien's food. The people that were directly in front of Sally when she belched began to feel the effects and started to change their minds. Instead of criticizing Sally like early, they began saying things like \"I'm hungry, I need some beans.\" \"You know, those laws aren't so bad.\" \"Yeah, now I can fart and burp whenever I want!\" \"Plus we don't have to diet and watch our weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Sally realized the power she had, she soon began to expel as much gas as possible on to the crowd surrounding her. Sally unleashed dozens of farts and belches that spread in every direction. Many of them tried to leave, but the gas and smells soon engulfed them and the began to see the positive aspects of becoming slobs. Soon everyone in the center of Knothole was embracing the laws Sally had decreed. Sally then began to waddle slowly towards her castle, letting out a barrage of burps and farts to convert anyone else she encounter into accepting her new laws. Along the way Sally hoped that Amy and Mina were also making progress in converting people into slobs for their Alien friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile... </span></div></div>",

His mind had long gone from his original state, his past life no longer existed to him, the master emerald was simply a green haze in his mind, he saw only food in his life now. Endless amounts of food for him to gobble messily down upon and grow larger and larger. He didn't even notice that he had left the ship and was in a sterile laboratory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a vile loud stinking belch, a thick torrent of drool gushed down his amorphous  giant chest, a small lazy grin appeared as he groaned out a simple command \"Mooooooore....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnannounced to him, was that the aliens had seen this coming,. A large TV screen produced itself from a drool-splattered wall and flickered to life.  On the screen appeared to be a live video feed of the monstrous blob of an red echidna growing by the second, constantly sweating  out a foul thick ooze-like sweat and slowly but surely, defecating into a trap door that opens up each time for him. The food supply suddenly halted, much to the dismay of the foul beast, his eyes lazily flickering around to try and find what had caused his precious food to stop, they CAN'T have run out! He wanted more of it! He soon found the television, \"TV...\" The TV began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Knuckles, we are you capto-er - saviours. We currently apologise for stoppping the porridg- eeer, food supply, but we happily see that you have fully embraced the need for slobdom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntranced by the talking screen, Knuckles nodded. Or at least nodded as much as he could, his giant cheeks and chins preventing much head movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Well we have more tests for you Knuckles the Slob. The first test is to leave this room. How I hear your enlightened mind think? By eating of course! We want you to get fatter, Knuckles. We want you to burst out of this room!\" The TV announced to drooling vacant echdina, who only heard the words EAT and GET FATTER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you have done that, we can then test to see if we can make a mountain out of you! That will be followed by either introducing you into our society or sending you back to Planet Mobius to convert your population to follow the bliss of slobdom! ohandtheremightbesomemoretestsbutwehaven'tquitethoughtaboutthatyet. That'll be all, we shall now start the food production line once more, and leave this screen on as an indicator to your process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint whirling sound started up and soon the hoses flopped down from the cieling again, shooting out more of the delicious food that had got him to this size already. They were firing more than usual, smothering the blob's face with food before it had even gotten into his mouth! With a blissful groan, the colossal echidna began to eat and grow once more. After every passing minute, a foots worth of fresh (well, for a slob) fat was put onto the echdina's body. With his new goal in mind, he became unaware that the walls had began to move backwards to make the room bigger, the aliens obviously wanted him to grow quite a bit before leaving....</span></div></div>",

Whether the echidna succeeded in converting his race or not, the planet would fall under His gaze again, for the first time in aeons. Her plans were rather like the master she served - slow and blunt, but inexorable and inevitable. She could still recall the news from her previous visits - Gharon, Novis, Froq-Tor - all either descended into religious schism, holy war or converted into the worship of - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain!

She was long since used to them by now. She hadn't told them the true nature of their mission; they still believed they were preparing the planets for invasion. That they didn't completely trust her was no longer relevant, so long as they followed her orders and she remained quiet on her goals. Nothing else mattered. Or was it because of her appearance? The medical officers were especially nervous around her whenever she saw them, in spite of her protestations of well-being. Ever since her revelation, her complexion had begun to lose its black lustre and take on a dull, murky green.  She smiled to herself as she left them. She never felt more alive in all the years she walked, and she only owed that euphoria to one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she thought as she reached the door, perhaps they were preparing to invade those planets.

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking up to the first day in what would hopefully be a successful break from chasing the man of her dreams, Amy went about her normal morning routine. Watering her household plants, having a shower, brushing her quills and changing into her favorite red dress and boots, and finally, a light breakfast of grapefruit and water and a slice of plain bread slightly toasted. Her favorite way to start the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least she'd been telling herself that for who knows how many years. Chasing Sonic was hard work; if no less then 3 different hedgehogs, an overweight scientist with his own empire, the same overweight scientist's from an alternate dimension, the G.U.N. and various god-like creatures couldn't keep up with him, what hope did she have? <i>A good diet</i>, that's what. With hardly any extra weight to hold back the hedgehog down she found herself running into him more often then not, and surely depriving herself of the majority food the world had on offer was worth the reward of getting to talk to Sonic for 2 minutes every couple months, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet whether she had contemplated this or not is irrelevant; as she in fact didn't have anything that morning; her fridge and pantry was completely empty, nary a crumb was left; mostly because she hardly stocked in anything in the first place. Not that much of a problem. Until she realized that she lived miles away from a supermarket, and skipping the day's most important meal on her first day of 'Sonic Rehab' would surely put her metabolism out of whack, not to mention her sense of relaxation. Panicking despite possibly exaggerating the situation, she quickly pulled out a dusty old phone book and frantically eyed through dozens of numbers, trying to make out if there was any delivery restaurant that specialized in grapefruit for people on strict diets. Coming to her wits end as her stomach started to gurgle, she phoned the first number that was associated with breakfast, quickly blurting everything out in one breath before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HII'MAMYROSEANDIREALLYNEEDAMEALCANYOUGIVEMEYOURMOSTHEALTHYBREAKFAST MEALANDQUICKLYI'MONADIETYOUSEEI'MATAPARTMENT16ROOM3ONGREENGROOVESTOKTHAN KSBYE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed in relief, turning on the television and plonking herself down on her couch as she wondered whether she'd be lucky enough to get two whole grapefruits from where she'd ordered her breakfast. She froze when she realized one small detail she hadn't bothered to check; the name of the restaurant she'd phoned. And then relaxed, figuring that in today's day and age, even the dodgiest of fast-food establishments had some sort of 'healthy' alternative. Not that she'd know, mind you, and when she finally opened the door to her delivery, she froze again, this time not unfreezing until the team of delivery men had finished unloading what looked like several towering piles of some of the most unbelievably greasy food Amy had ever seen. Everything was so deep-fried even the bowels seemed like an over-zealous and underpaid chef had assumed whoever was on the receiving end wouldn't tell the difference. That's not even starting on the water-tank sized bottle of cola, a tap on the side added for convenient access, or the dozens of onion rings, incidentally just as large as the one's Amy normally wound up collecting here and there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter clicking his fingers in front of her, the leader of the team got Amy's attention. Most of it anyway.\"Let'see her miss... 15 Skyscraper Burgers, smothered in a thick layer of fat with whipped cream on top, 25 bowels of Spinning Onion Rings, 3 Wedding Cakes with BBQ and Bacon filling, a Bubblegum and Peanut Butter Iceberg-sized Frosted Shake, 100L Cola from our own brewery... Yep, all of it seems in order! We'll check back in a week to see if you've met the requirements ma'am-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"WAIT- Wait, sorry. Eh, I think you have the wrong apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be a first miss; Bob here has mighty fine hearing when it comes to taking calls. This is Room 3, of Apartment 16, of Green Grove St, Central City, is it not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's heart nearly missed a beat as it started to dawn on her where this was heading. \"Eh... Yes, but-\" \"Well, we here at Scales Buster's Breakfast,\" Amy's hear DID miss a beat here once she finally heard the mystery joint's name. She was right about it having 'Breakfast' in it's name, yet that didn't change the fact that it was apparent that this 3rd-rate company's idea of what the 'healthiest meal on a menu' would clog an entire army's arteries in a hear beat. \"Have to go through a lot of effort preparing the meals for those who want to take the 'Un-healthiest Meal Challenge', and from I hear you were mighty eager over the phone to sign up into our little promotion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... 'Un-healthiest Meal Challenge'? You've got to be kidding... Ugh, look... Would it be a hassle to just... Take everything back? My entire apartment's filled with outrageously-themed junk food and it kind of mucks up the color-scheme I had laid out-\" \"Well... I guess we can! Though it's not like we'll find another participant right away... This contest has been a bit unpopular for us. Though I guess if you're not satisfied, we'll take everything back. That'll be 50.\" \"*Phew* No really, it's okay- ... 50? 50 what? 50 bucks?! I'm not getting refunded!?! But this isn't what I ordered! ... Okay, it was technically, but it's not what I meant when I ordered!\" The main delivery man chuckled. \"Oh my no, not 50 bucks; 50 grand! This stuff isn't cheap to make and to throw it out for nothing...\" Amy quickly went from freaking out to getting angry. \"So!? What do you expect me to do! Heck, I'm BROKE! Screw this bunch of crummy food-\" \"It's actually pretty tasty once you get past the first couple mouthfuls~\" a younger delivery boy piped in \"-Shut up, I don't care!\" Again the delivery man chuckled, though perhaps a bit more cautiously then before due to Amy's extreme temperament. And her Piko Piko hammer she was starting to hold. That too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look ma'am, we said at the begining this is a promotion; you don't pay for it if you keep it- assuming you eat it all within the week of course. You win our grand mystery prize, plus don't have to pay a cent for this excellent gourmet meal, <i>thank you very much</i>. If you lose, which means you didn't finish everything, you have to pay for what you didn't finish. But you get the benefit having eaten everything before it! Or you can just redo the competition, but that leaves you with more to eat... Personally you seem kinda shrimp-ish but with a loud mouth like that you could prove me wrong-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy dropped the hammer and started to sulk. \"Ugh... I'm really cornered in this stupid thing, aren't I? All these burgers, rings, the weird bacon cake thing... \" \"Oh, we forgot the Chili Dogs... Thought this seemed a bit too small. Bob! Bring in those crates!\" Within a few more moments, Amy's apartment was also filled with what seemed like several hundred foot long hot dogs smothered in chili, topped with cheese, smothered in more chili... Actually everyone it went just as high as it was long in toppings... \"Ugh... Just go... Man, I'm going to be a blimp by Wednesday.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they left Amy viewed the site around her, not knowing whether to cry or yell. There was absolutely nothing she could do about it; except eat. It wasn't until she heard a large gurgle emit from her flat stomach and, looking down at it, realized she was still hungry from not having breakfast. \"May as well try one of those onion rings...\" Grabbing a ring with her glove, already feeling the grease dampen her gloves as she clenched around the thick exterior, she took a bite. Savoring it in her mouth, she suddenly realized this was the first time she'd had any junk food in a long time. Maybe even the first time. By the time she'd thought of this she'd already finished the first ring and was chomping on another. By the time she realized she actually kind of dug the taste of the onion rings at least, she was head down devouring everything in a hunger-fueled eating rampage in the first of many, many bowels she was expected to chow down within a weeks time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this situation wasn't so bad after all. </span></div></div>",

With a polite nod the metal bell hop took off down the hall with Amy's luggage. Amy took a deep breath and looked around, she was standing in the main hall for a 4 star resort located on a private island only half a mile from the shore. It was very new, only 3 months old and constucted with lighting speed the small resort was not only mantained by almost an all robot staff it was even built on a man made island the resort had build soley for it's own use. It had 45 rooms, an indoor/outdoor pool (that connected to each other through a lavash underground grotto), a private fariy to bring guests to and from the island and a second fairy for taking guests on trips around the area for sight seeing, a full kitchen capable of serving all 45 rooms with a 6 course meal each at the same time with ease, and full spa that even made personal calls to guests in their rooms! Amy started to laugh uncontollably with giddy giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I did this!\" Amy said bouncing up and down \"This was so spontanious of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy practicaly skipped to her room on cloud 9 almost light headed over her last minute splurge failed to even notice the hotel's odd emblem made in expencive marble on the floor of the lobby.... a round face with dark glasses and bushy orange mustache...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy came to her room on the 3rd floor, the hotel was 5 stories tall and had 9 rooms per floor, Amy was shocked at the size, bigger than most single story homes the room looked more like an apartment for 4 or 5 people! Amy stood in awe of her room as the robot bell hop placed the last of her belongings in the drawers and cabinets for her conviniance and brought her a milkshake, with a tip of his smal hat the small droid took it's leave and gave Amy some privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is unbelivable\" Amy said stunned \"How can they maintain all this when I only paid 200 dollars for this room for a week?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy hopped over to her drawer and pulled a skimpy two peice bikini out and squeled, \"Mabye I should buy sonic a room here anonomously so he can see me sunbathing in this\" Amy grinned but slowly shook her head forgeting that thought \"No, I am taking a vacation from that insensitive jerk... this is me time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked out the window down on the pool below, empty, Amy got curious why she had yet to see anyone else here who wasn't made of metal and worked for the motel... Amy didn't know was there were other guests, they were all just staying in their rooms...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy plopped her rear on the wide soft couch and flipped on the TV. \"Maybe I can find the hotel channel for activities\" she mubbled to herself. Amy flipped through the channels till she came to channel 01. Amy sat up a little surprised to see anything on this channel, she thought it was a myth! The semi ditzy girl watched in eager anticipation at the Tv curious what secrets it held. Slowly a spiral began to fade in Amy's eyes locked on it and slowly slid to the center as it drew her in. A faint slipping sound began to repeat growling louder little by little: \"sssssslp.... sssslep..... ssssleep.... ssleepy..... sleepy....\". Amys eye lids began to sag and slid down leaving her gaze half covered as she grew more and more tired. With a yawn Amy looked to the TV with a glassy eye'd stare as her head began to wave back and forth in an attempt to keep it from falling backward as she grew more and more unable to keep herself aware and consious. The spiral grew to full veiw and pulled Amy further in as she almost leaned out of her seat being drawn into it. A beat bgan to thump with the spiral becoming louder each time and cleared to Amy's suggestive state: \"oooomp... ooooompy..... ooooby..... oooobay...... oobey...... obey....\" Amy's jaw slacked and hung down as drool began to pool in her mouth, \"oooooo.....beeeeeey\" Amy said in a long drawn out detached voice . As the thumpping continued a new instument began to chime in getting lounder and louder like the ones before it, but this one was chaninging, almost like a song... \"Yooooou arre tired..... you want only to relax...... you will spend all your time in that seat.... use the picture in picture function to keep this spiral on the TV at all times as you watch TV, you love the spiral, you need the spiral...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy began to slump back in her seat sinking into the soft cousions as her stare grew more empty. \"Loooove the spiral.... I need the spiral.... The spiral is my world.... I obey the spiral....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV continued to thump with it's obey and more music played singing more commands for Amy to sing along with: \"Watch anything you want, trashy TV, Mindless soap operas, trashy talkshows, rot your mind, lose yourself to the mindnumbing garbage....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's arm limply rose with the remote in hand and flipped the picture in picture function on as the Spiral shrunk to the corner of the screen and changed the larger image to a talkshow with 2 trailor park trash girls fighting over a dirty guy in need of a shave as the crowd chanted the talk host show's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the talkshow played the lovely music of the spiral still came over the speakers in the background fillign Amy's head: \"The remote has a room service button, call for service, order food.... you are hungry, very hungry.... you're always hungry..... why do you let yourself waste away when you're always so hungry...? eat.... eat all day.... just lay about watchign TV and enjoying roomservice...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy began to hum the strange melody the spiral played for her and tapped the room service button on the remote, a trail or drool fell from her mouth as she remained unable to resist the sprial's song and it's lovely place in the corner of her new favorite show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight continued on the TV as the spiral's song droned on: \"Eating is messy, don't bother trying to stop it.... just eat.... just eat.... just eat.... relaaaaaax.... eaaaaat..... relaaaaax..... eaaaaat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy hummed the tune louder begining to love how it sounded, Amy almost wished it had lyrics so she could sing it out loud, why if the song was a lifestyle, she'd love to live it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA droid came into the room and wheeled itself to Amy's side \"How my I server you miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Amy said snapping out of her trance \"Ummm... what...?\"  Amy said blinking trying to remeber what she was doing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your order miss?\" the droid again asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Amy said her head feeling fuzzy \"Uh, well I am really hungry... could you maybe...  bring me something to eat? I'm really hungry... starving in fact... just, get me something to each, chocolate, and... keep it coming, I think I'd like to try everything on the menu!\" Amy said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish\" The robot bowed and took off<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked back to the TV and burst into laughter as one of the girls pulled the other from her seat by her hair, still the spiral sat in the corner, it's rythmic thump still playing in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe droid returned with the first of Amy's dishes, a plate of fudge with chocolate syurp. \"The food you requested will be arriving in 5 minute intervals\" The robot stated before leaving again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy just placed the plate on the couch next to her and picked up a peice and brought it to her motuh leaving a trail of chocolate drops, dangling it over her mouth Amy tillted her head back so she could drop it in smearing the syrup all over her mouth and hand. Amy wipped a smear of chocolate off her hand onto her dress and reached for another.</span></div></div>",

Now her gut seemed intent on reaching what was at first a pristine carpet, now decked in splattered remains of her frenzied eating. This was a feat in itself as Amy was right up at the other end of the king-sized bed, disturbingly complacent at the dramatic changes that had befallen her. At the moment, Amy was enjoying one of her rare breaks where, rather than eat her weight in junk food in a single meal, she simply sat back with a dazed sleepy look at the television in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComfort wasn't an issue; outside of the comfy bed she was sitting on (yet ever since sitting on had never had the time to, and now didn't have the strength to get into) her stained and strained panties had bundled up to allow most of her own waste to pile up against her back, giving her one of the most bizarre and nauseating (and incidentally only) relaxation treatments I've ever written up. Her breaks weren't exactly in her jurisdiction: her arms and feet were in-cased in such a thick layer of quivering pink flab that they were near-immovable. Whenever it was time for her gluttonous gut to do some much needed digestion, the bots would simply extend a platter of chocolate fudge marinated in thick bars of butter with a side of cookie dough and lard milkshakes, letting her quadrupled-chinned mouth happily oblige and do the rest of the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, whatever the point behind Amy's hypo-induced gain was wasn't clear to her. Not that she exactly cared at this point, but surely anybody else would've questioned the presence of other beds and tv's lined across the huge (hedge)hog, and would've warned, or at least vaguely mentioned in passing Amy's predicament to the new arrival waiting impatiently downstairs.</span></div></div>",

Cream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our efforts thus far have been unsuccessful\" The robot stated plainly \"Her mother has intercepted a number of our invitation and grown suspicious, however a new plan had been drafted to target the mother, once she is under our sway she'll bring Cream to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, Once we have their love interests: Amy, and Sally as well as Cream, Robotnic says he can handle Sonic and his friends without resorting to this place, I'll take care of the rest on that end, so you just keep up the good work here... uh whatever you're doing...\" Rouge said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here\" The robot stopped her \"I can show you, this is Princess Sally's room...\" The two halted in front of a typical door, Just like all the others in the hotel, however as Rouge looked at it closer she could see the carpet was moist at the bottom, and some kind of fungus was creeping it's way around the seams of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the...\" Rouge trailed off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had to seal the door approximately 19 days after her arrival, The smell was becoming a problem as new residents might have noticed it, as well, the contamination in the room was becoming a difficulty to clean as it spilled into the hall way. It has now become standard protocol to seal the rooms of our tenants after they settle in, The robots now access their rooms by a door in the ceiling of each room. The Robot explained as it produced an arms with a stiff bar on the end, the bar was angled like a crowbar. The robot placed it at the top of the door and slid it downwards. A loud crackling noise was made as rubber meant to seal the door broke and splintered out as if it had long since been glued to the framework by whatever moister was in the room. As the rubber came off the hall started to fill with a ghastly odor. Rouge put her hand to her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! What is that-\" Rouge tried to reach but the robot continued undaunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot jammed the bar back into the center of the door and twisted quickly making the door burst open in one loud bang as the juices in the room that had glued it shut long ago let it go. The smell in the hallway grew one hundred times worse. Rouge felt her lunch lurch forward into the back of the throat and her eyes filled with water. Inside the room a dark smile covered the floor and crept up the walls. The fungus that was present around the edges of the doorway didn't even dare to grow within the environment of the room itself but some pockets of fungus could be seen in the far corners of the room far from the source of this mess tucked away on shelves and on counter tops safe from the nearly toxic ooze on the floor. Some of the mess spilled out into the hall onto Rouge's boots. She leapt in disgust, even trough the boots she could feel the gunk was warm. The robot placed the arm it used to open the door and pushed her inside. Rouge tried to fight it but when she saw was what was in there her arms went limp ins shock. There on what used to be the 3X king sized bed sat a blob of moist sticky fur. The slime that covered the floor was a mixture of the various fluids that seemed to seep from every inch of this vile creature. What was mostly a far more advanced form of drool and sweat the fluids had long ago shed their typical attributes and become thick and sticky filled to the brim with bacteria that produces a BO unlike any Rouge had ever smelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blob known as Sally Acorn was massive. She long passed the point of typical weight measurement and become a lump of fat in her own right. Her Belly swelled out taking up mush of the space that used to be the bed. While her backside had pushed back and grew to match her belly's girth. Slime poured our from between each roll of fat and every crevice of her massive body. Her arms and legs long ago became to large to lift now just extra real estate for blubber now hung out at an angle on her sides mashed between the swelling mass of her belly and butt pushed together. Sally's face was buried in fat, her cheeks and chin had become so over inflated by fat that it tilted her head back slightly and rose up holding her head firmly in place. The drool that poured endlessly from her mouth washed down her chin and pooled at the bottom of her multiple chins between them and her cleavage, if not for her excessive neck fat Sally might have drowned in her own saliva. Food stains and heavy globs of thickened sweat covered her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally stared blankly at the monitors that were placed on the ceiling pointed down towards her as robots came and went feeding her. They placed large glass cylinders with metal nozzles in her mouth and held them up as Sally sucked the liquefied contents into her hungry maw. The containers held several gallons of fluid but Sally had no trouble consuming them at a break neck pace. Some of the containers were chocolate or cream, but others were nothing more than butter or lard mixed with sugar. Sally guzzled them all down with hungry abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(((    <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/1365/slobsally.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/1365/...</a>    )))<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge stood in awe at the sight as the robot moved in behind her and sent a signal to the TV's around Sally. The hypnotic wave faded onto the screen and asked Sally a question \"Sally, what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally swallowed hard and cleared her throat. \"I am a slob. I exist to eat, I am always hungry. Food is my life, I must eat, I must grow. My only purpose in life is to be a slob. Slob-dom is perfection and I live to achieve it. I serve only my master, and my master orders me to eat.\" Sally finished and quickly slurped down the next container of slop brought to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... But....\" Rouge stammered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is completely brainwashed, she isn't even aware of where she is or who she was. She doesn't even understand she now serves the great Dr. Robotnik, she knows him only as master.\" The robot brought up surveillance of the other girls on it's screen. Blaze and Mina were just as brainwashed as Sally and almost as big. Other people were seen at various sizes and states of the brainwashing process. Some were rather large and becoming obedient slaves. Others were still semi mobile and still wandering around their rooms learning to be addicted to food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you should see the newest subject before you make your report to Dr. Robotnik\" The robot beckoned her down the hall<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue pulled away from the ghastly sight of Sally and chased the robot. \"What's going on here?! What are you doing to them?\" Rouge demanded still in disbelief \"I have no desire to see anymore of this insanity! I have no plans of helping that fat lunatic with this horrible place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot turned and entered a room without listening to her, Rouge rushed in to tell the hunk of metal off but the door shut behind her. \"Welcome to the room of our newest captive miss Rogue... yours\" The robot coldly said as it moved to block the door. The screen on the robot switched to a live feed of the Eggman himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well Rogue, I hope you found your tour enlightening...\" He sneered \"You didn't think I'd fall for your tricks again did you? I know you only agreed to help me to further your own goals...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You traitorous jacka-ahhhh!\" Rouge screamed. A smaller service bot had snuck in from the ceiling access and injected Rouge with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"enjoy your stay...\" Eggman chuckled and cut the feed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back here you...ohhhh. I feel strange....\"  Rouge moaned. Rouge began to feel tried, her head spun and she started to stagger. Rouge felt light headed and couldn't fight the service bot as it took her hand and guided her to the couch. The TV came to life and Rouge stared helplessly at the TV before her, Rouge began to drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-Rouge woke up about an hour later and was in a room where the only objects she could see were a bed and a large screen TV. An image came on the TV, but it was blurry to Rouge at first. She was still drowsy from whatever was injected into her, but soon the image on the TV began to clear as she remembered what has been happening. She realized that the image on the TV was Robotnik himself staring at her with a sinister smirk. \"Why hello Rouge, did you enjoy your nap?\" taunted Robotnik. \"Whats going on here Robotnik? We had a deal, I help with running the hotel and you give me those jewels you promised.\" Rouge yelled at the giant TV screen. \"We did, until I found out what you were really up to! Of course I figured you were here for jewels, until this was discovered!\" Robotnik said as he pulled out a small device that looked similar to a walkie talkie, but was more advanced. \"A communication device from G.U.N., do you take me for a fool? You're on a mission to sabotage my latest scheme, so don't try to pretend you're my ally.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobotnik was right, Rouge was on a mission to infiltrate and stop him, but she had no idea what was happening to the girls she helped capture. Each day she made sure all the robots were functioning properly and she sent invitations to the victims of this hotel. Originally she was planning to help all of the prisoners escape and defeat Robotnik, but there\u2019s no way Sally or any of these slobs could fight or escape. Worst of all she was now stuck in the middle of his demented scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time to be more like your friends. Enjoy your stay at Robotnik's hotel for slobs!\" said Robotnik as his image faded away from the TV screen and was almost instantly replaced by one of the hypnotic images that had reduced Sally into an obese whale, and Amy into a disgusting pig. Rouge knew this was how he got to the other so she shut her eyes as tight as she could. There was no way she was going to let that screen take over her mind. Rouge did manage to keep her eyes off the screen but she did not pay attention to the service droids. The droid moved in front of the hypno screen and hit Rouge on the head. \u201cWhy you little tin can, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d said Rouge before she realized that she opened her eye and was now looking at both the robot and the hypnotic monitor. She was now directly looking at the monitor and\u2026 felt nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was not like any of the others who had visited the hotel earlier. Every victim was expecting a relaxing vacation at any ordinary hotel. Plus the robots had pampered them and helped them relax even further. They all had let down their guard and were easily caught off guard by these hypnotic televisions. Rouge on the other hand now knew what really went on in this so called \u201chotel\u201d. She was always strong of will and stubborn as a bull, so that also help made her resilient to the hypnotic patterns. With her knowledge of the hotel and her will power, she could withstand the hypnosis. Once she realized this, she picked up the small service droid that had hit her and smashed the droid into the screen. Both were disassembled into tiny pieces on the ground in front of Rouge, who stood triumphant and proud of her self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may not have been so confident if see had noticed a small security camera near the ceiling. The camera delivered live video feed to Robotnik along with his assistant Snively. Robotnik was not pleased with what he saw. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it! How could she resist? She\u2019s just an ordinary mobian. Oh well, that\u2019s why I have a back up plan.\u201d said Robotnik, with his assistant slightly baffled. \u201cBack up plan? What are you talking about sir? If she can\u2019t be hypnotized then how are you going to get her to be like the others?\u201d said Snively. \u201cWell I realized something special about one of our guests. When we captured Bunnie Rabot I had problems with her. When she was inadequately robotized parts of her central nervous system became cybernetic which allowed her to control her robotic limbs. The cybernetics in her body made her immune to the mind control, but I found away around it. I replaced her robotic limbs with pieces of my robots that the hedgehog broke fused with pieces of the mainframe of our hotel. Now Bunnie is directly linked to my programs to turn others into slobs and he hypnosis program. With her linked to both of my programs, she is now a mindless slob who will obey me. Plus her new robotic limbs have upgrades that allow her support her increased weight, move around more easily, and help me feed others. Now I\u2019ll send her to deal with Rouge, while we deal with another important matter.\u201d said Robotnik as he left the room followed by Snively. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door suddenly opened up to the room Rouge was in. She was expecting another robot was coming in to try and force feed her, but she was wrong. It wasn\u2019t exactly a robot; it was Bunnie Rabot, the half rabbit half robot, but she was different from how Rouge remembered her. Rouge had encountered Bunnie a couple of time while dealing with the freedom fighter and was shocked by what Robotnik had done to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith labored breath the morbidly obese rabbit waddled into the room. Supported by reinforced steel legs the once shapely yet svelte southern belle's hourglass shape had exploded into a mountain of blubber. The flab that would have once gone to further her wide set hips had been funneled into the thick slab of fat that hung down from her abdomen overlapping the robotic point of attachment for her legs. Her once ample chest had swelled into a more than generous bosom, the two fleshy orbs overflowing the top of her overtaxed leotard which barely contained her ever growing bulk. Small tears had formed along the sides as the frayed fabric lost the battle of her bulge. The sides of her belly formed into large rolls far beyond the point of just mere love handles as they jutted out defying gravity supported by the tiny leotard that bounced up and down wildly with each step that sent ripples through her fat. Her legs had been upgraded with stronger hydraulic assisted supports and inverted knees as earlier models had been over stressed by repeated contact with the wall of flab hanging down from her gut. However even now her billowing backside had begun to pour out the back of her too tight outfit giving her something of a near constant wedgie she needed to readjust from time to time. Now that her butt was overflowing the cusp of her metallic legs pressed down by the slabs of back fat above it her legs were encounding a similar problem with her ass. Her Legs also featured a pair of wheels and a set of treads that could provide her speedy movement if her legs needed rest or she needed a boost of speed. Her new arm was twice the size of her stubby arm, covered with flab. Though the arm was new, it did not have the appearance of being spick-and-span due to small spots of rust and fungus spread out over the arm (created from left over pieces of food and drool that often falls all over her upper body). Despite the aged appearance of Bunnie\u2019s arm, all the equipment was designed to deal with repulsive material from the slobs and still function. The arm had multiple joints designed to stretch to help Bunnie pick up food or anything else she needs. Her laser cannon had been replaced with a dart launcher and a hose. Atop this flabby cyborg behind her swollen food stained cherubic cheeks Bunnie's eyes were dull and looked at the helpless Rouge with indifference. She was simply lost in her own world of slobby bliss as she lifted her one organic fat laden arm with a deep sigh and stuffed a cheesy slice of pizza into her mouth. With a noisy smacking of lips as she chewed with her mouth open, drool and grease dribbling out and into her cleavage there stood Bunnie Rabot, proud to be a slob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img801.imageshack.us/img801/9691/bunnieslob.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img801.imageshack.us/img801/9691/...</a> (picture and description of Bunnie provided by MageB a.k.a. kmizan)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlory to slobs \u2013hic- Glory to my master!\u201d said Bunnie in monotone voice. \u201cBunnie? Why are you here?\u201d asked Rouge. \u201cYou are rejecting URRPPP the wonders of being a slob.\u201d Yelled Bunnie pointing her finger at Rouge with a stare mixed with anger, yet some how still witless stare.\u201d Of course I am! There\u2019s no way I\u2019m giving up my good looks and turning into a beached whale!\u201d yelled Rouge, not realizing how his would make the brainwashed Bunnie feel. \u201cHow dare you! You have been offered free food and a life without hard work.-hic- Everyone here has seen the wonders of being a slob. Since you are being so stubborn I will have to force you to see how glorious it is to be one of us.\u201d Said Bunnie as she fired some darts form her robotic arm. One dart hit Rouge in the leg and was full of the same substance she was injected with earlier to render her unconscious. Soon Rouge returned to her unconscious state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater she began to stir but felt something in her mouth. Soon she realized there was a hose in her mouth. The hose was spraying the same fluid Sally was drinking earlier. \u201cWhere did this come from?\u201d said Rouge as she tried to spit it out but to no avail. Around her neck was a collar that prevented her from spiting out the hose and slightly expanded her neck allowing her to devour even more of this vile substance. Then she saw where the source was from. All liquid was being pumped into her from Bunnie\u2019s robot arm. Her arm has been equipped with a storage device for fattening liquids for her to consume and a hose to feed her self later. Rouge was still too weak from the dart that it her earlier so all she could do now was wait until her strength returned. Something else was wrong with her; she was consuming it at incredible speed. For some reason she was rather hungry even though she knew the food would make her obese. The reason why was because the darts also mixed with a chemical that heightens her appetite. She knew she would regain her strength soon, but the liquefied food was fattening her fast. Normally everyone who entered the hotel was forced to become a slob slowly under the influence of the hypnotic television. Rouge on the other hand was able to resist the television\u2019s hypnotic messages, so more drastic measures were required. Now Rouge was gaining a pound of fat each minute thanks to gadgets within Bunnie\u2019s new mechanical arm. The substance in Bunnie\u2019s arm was limited, but there was enough in there to feed her and Rouge for hours. By the time Rouge could regain her strength, it could be too late for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Robotnik had been monitoring the situation with Snively. They were at an island that Robotnik had recently discovered. Thanks to a wireless connection to his hotel Robotnik was able to watch all victims pig out. He was staying on this island to observe the slobs, without getting to close their fowl stench. Right now Robotnik was interested in Sally\u2019s PDA, Nicole. Right now Nicole was stuck in her hand held computer form, but had wires inserted in her. Robotnik\u2019s was looking for information on Sonic or his friends. However he did not expect Nicole\u2019s security programs to be so strong and advanced. Every attempt to hack her was blocked in only a few seconds. \u201cI\u2019ll never understand how such a small hand held device is capable of so many things. Perhaps I\u2019ll hack Nicole later. I\u2019m behind in making more battle robots to destroy that blasted hedgehog. Snively! You stay here while I create some more robots. Let me now if my computers are able to hack into Nicole.\u201d said Robotnik as he left the room. As soon as the door shut Snively said to himself \u201cThank god! He\u2019s gone. This whole scheme is a waste of time!\u201d Soon Snively sat down on a chair and began to drift to sleep. He thought this scheme was ridiculous and not to mention disgusting and would rather watch paint dry. Of course since he was ignoring his duty, he paid little to no attention to Nicole. If he was following his orders he would have noticed Nicole had actually managed to deactivate the computers trying to hack her. Now Nicole was safe from being hacked, but she still had no way out of her hand held form. She couldn\u2019t hack into Robotnik\u2019s computers yet. Just as she kept Robotnik from hacking her, his programs were keeping her from hacking him. All Nicole needed was for some of the computers to shut down and she could hack into the system and find out what happened to Sally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, all Rouge and Nicole could do was wait\u2026      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He told me he knew about the mission and now I was a PERMANENT guest at Robotnik's hotel for slobs! Then a swirly thingy came on and I closed my eyes, knowing he was hypnotizing me when a robot hit me and I was forced to open my eyes. But somehow, I wasn't affected!\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe since you knew what he was up to, it couldn't affect you.\" Misty said, over-coming her speechlessness.<br>\r\n\"Maybe\" Rouge said. \"Anyways, moments later I was greeted by Bunnie only she was totally different!

She injected me with something, and I woke up being fed fattening substances through a hose connected to Bunnie's arm. Luckily I had the strength to pull out the hose, stick it in Bunnie's mouth and fly outta there to tell you guys!\" She ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow got upset over this. \"Now what?\" he asked coldly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once again Amy heard the hypnotic television beckon her with hypnotic images and sounds. She abondoned her feast of high calorie foods and desserts to devote her attention towards the source of her brainwashing. She turned around to give the television her undivided attention with glassy eyes and a bit of drool emerging from her mouth. As she stared into the screen, she listened to the latest message and the entrancing beat that came with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have done well...Now it is time to enjoy more of the hotel...you must discover what else exists within this hotel...but you are still hungry and tired...do not waste too much effort while you wander around the hotel...only do things that are relaxing...and there will be many more televisions through out the hotel...whenever you see another television, watch it and obey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy listened only to the soothing yet demanding voice and not her free will and independence. The voice, the images, and the sounds were so relaxing. Plus after she followed the earlier message from the TV, she felt so happy. She was able to relax and gorge on food like never before. She no longer had to obey the rules of etiquette that restricted such behavior. While part of her noticed that she had grown rather chubby recently, the hypnotic television managed to sedate this part of her. She didn't even question why the television ordered her to do nothing but eat, then suddenly tell her to look around the hotel. The mind numbing messages mixed with these feeling of personal freedom made Amy a happy gluttonous slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy quickly followed the orders she received and left her room. Though once she left the room she panted and breathed heavily after a couple of steps. Being in her rooms for a few days with nothing but eating made had an big effect on her. She was now now rather chubby, and her muscles were much weaker due to lack of exercise or walking. Amy wondered how she was going to walk around this hotel while she was in such bad shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her question was answered as she noticed that outside her room was a special conveyor belt. Amy guessed that it was a newly added feature for guests like herself. She quickly hoped on top of the moving walkway, making a loud thud that echoed throughout the hallway. She enjoyed the moving walkway as she was able to relax her muscles again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw a fork in the tram. There were two different directions she could take. One of the pathes that divided the walk way had a sign indicating that it led to the hotel's spa and sauna. The other was unmarked so there was no way to tell where it led to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy did really care which path she took, as long as she followed the orders of the screen. So she randomly chose a path and ended up on...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A metal sign on the white door marked it as 'Spa' and the wooden door was carved with the words 'Sauna'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy could already feel the warmth of the sauna seeping out through the door.

Robots kept coming into her room and brought her food for her to eat. SHe loved the chocolatey taste and didn't think about the effects it would have on her body. Her dress was getting drool spots on it along with bits of chocolate as she watched more TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat and watch..... eat and watch....relax.....\" the TV sang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every meal arriving, Amy was having trouble concentrating on her eating. She had forgotten how to use silverware and was just scooping up whatever chocolate delicacy she was given. However she spent so much time enjoying the food that she took too long to swallow and some brown drool rolled down her face and onto her clothes which were getting tighter and tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....yummy.\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy continued to stuff herself and was entranced by the TV. She was starting to develop a beer gut when she didn't even use real sentences any more. Whenever she saw something on TV, she just yelled it out as best as she could and the robots brough it to her. She didn't care what they brought, she just ate whatever tasted good. Sometimes she ended up spilling the food onto the floor or onto the bed, covering herself in it like a pig in mud. By night time, Amy didn't even know what she was watching or eating. She could have been eating the TV remote while watching static and she wouldn't mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty....colors.\" she moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning....</span></div></div>",

And with the possible exception of getting him to inflict bodily harm on himself, she was guaranteed to have her every whim answered to by the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as she waited for a what seemed like hours (but was at most 10 minutes), she grabbed a carton of ice cream and plonked herself down onto a nice, soft leather couch stationed directly in front of what was the largest television in the electronics market at the time. Actually, it was <i>always</i> the largest; Cream would normally give her single mother a 'friendly' reminder whenever anything big and flashy was fresh on the market. It was due partially to this dedication to the economical theory of obsolescence (but more just manipulative behavior)  which had led to several wide-screen tvs and a deluxe sound system litered around her huge bedroom, another smaller screen parked in her private bathroom and a vintage Rolls-Royce locked away in the garage until she looked old enough to drive it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while her gluttony for material possessions was indeed near-unsatisfiable, her general hunger in general was an even more ferocious beast. Between the time Cream's mother had driven off and Tails had arrived and let himself into the mansion, Cream had wolfed her way down over ten gallons worth of ice cream with nary a brain-freeze or stomach ache. The same couldn't be said for smudges or stains; she was pratically drenched in a mixture of melted creamy flavors and her own saliva. By the time Tails found her he had to register just how much she'd eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, hi Cream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a second for her mind to whir back into gear from her eating spree, Cream lifted her small stuffed belly off of the now sticky couch and gave the fox a hug. \"Awww, hi Tails! I was just having a snack before you came in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked at the slight blush across Tails' face. \"I've just been <i>famished</i> all day with hardly anything to eat. You wouldn't mind getting something nice for me for lunch, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails hesitated a moment. \"Well, your mom said she left you some preset meals-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well are you sure-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Well that's that then! I guess if you haven't eaten for so long-\" (he made a mental note to stop staring at the large pile of devoured cartons of ice cream a mere few feet behind Cream) \"I'll get you something nice and tasty, though your mother was pretty clear about your diet... Just lemme unpack my stuff for the month in your guest room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream started to grin deviously as she readied the final punch. \"Oooh, you can stay in my bedroom Tails! It'll be like a sleepover! Just with, *giggle*, the two of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was silent for a moment. But only for a short one. \"Well, what your mother doesn't know won't kill her.

Just try and cut back on how much you eat, right? Like, restrain yourself a little!\" Tails warned as the two headed out the door, Cream still decked in sticky grime. \"'Restrain' myself? (<i>That's something I can interpret pretty liberally</i>') Sure Tails!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments after arriving and sitting down at the buffet, Tails was already starting to eye Cream suspiciously. Or what she'd brought over anyway; he could tell Cream was going to be pushing him these next few weeks once she bought over half a dozen slices of pie, a couple jugs of cola, a pot of melted chocolate sauce which she'd probably stolen from the actual serving table and enough ice cream to feed an army. \"Cream, there's NO way we're going to be eating all this.\" Cream looked down and frowned a bit, and to Tails' relief nodded in agreement. \"You're probably right Tails... Well, it's called All-You-Can-Eat for a reason! I can go back for seconds and thirds afterward.\" She pointed at his comparatively microscopic portion of pasta. \"You sure you don't have an eating disorder?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails eyed her now with annoyance, curious as to just how much pent up... <i>Bitchiness</i> she had stored up, and whether she seemed strangely more attractive to him for being so. He couldn't contemplate this for long tho, as she'd already started scooping handfuls into her ravenous maw, pausing only to let out a small burp or to wash down a scoop of ice cream lodged in her throat with several liters of cola. Halfway through the girls immense binge she'd already stained her dress wet with food debris and, as Tails noticed looking in awe, a trail of saliva trickling down the side of her mouth. If her dress could even be called that now; her stomach was so extended it was practically resting on the table, forcing her dress up for the time being over her dress. By the time she was finished, despite the huge amount of food Tails had seen half an hour earlier, he still by his scientifically-gifted background had a hard time explaining how Cream had gained what looked around 100 pounds from a single meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUURRRRPPPP!* \"That was a great starter! Well Tails, I'm gonna get some more... That pot of melted butter looked yummy!\" As she slowly waddled back up to the food aisles Tails had to force himself to look away from Cream's backside, where her panties had now bunched up and cut in deep between the girl's butt cheeks, exposing her fat furry rear to anybody who cared to look. </span></div></div>",

You know what you just did!\u201d Now turning to a look of mean malicious, Cream merely snickered. \u201cAaaaaand? I couldn\u2019t bare to part with all this delicious food just to make a silly bathroom break! Besides, looks like someone\u2019s starting to get a bit worked up\u2026\u201d She eyed either side and leaned in closer to the fox, her bloated belly drooping onto the table and her panties starting to sag down to where the was sitting and whispered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t want to have anybody think you\u2019d TOUCHED me inappropriately, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat back down with a slight splat and picked up another dish of tacos, now practically swallowing them whole as she put her feet up on the booth\u2019s table and smirked at Tails\u2019 now genuinely nervous disposition. \u201cPfffft, I\u2019d call you lame, but I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re paying for all of this\u2026 Wait just a sec-\u201c Biting her upper-lip with bean covered teeth, she grunted. A moment passed where nothing seemed to of happened, before a simply gargantuan rip of flatulence and wet noises could be heard below her, a moment passing before Tails could hear a very loud SPLAT as part of Cream\u2019s\u2026. Extra baggage hit the restaurant\u2019s ground. \"Besides, don't we make a cute couple?\" She added, her wink complemented with a particularly long drawn out fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mr. Fox?\u201d Cream asked, beaming at Tails.

Cream went out of her way to embarrass the poor Fox, letting out farts as people approached and even convincing him to feed her one to get her to stop and clean up a little in the bathroom. \"Alright, we should really get you cleaned up anyways...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving overstayed their welcome at the restaurant, the two decided to head home. Slinking down the back in his mortified stateopening the door, the bloated rabbit proudly squeezed past him and waddled swiftly to the Tornado 2, in it's Car mode, that she had been oddly insistent on coming in. Had she planned this? The thought crossed Tail's mind. He gave a nervous smile to the people at the counter and slunk out into the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two eventually arrived home. Tails obediently opened the door for Cream, who gave him a cunning glance as she waddled herself and her taught belly inside. \"Thank you, Mr Tails. I can tell this is going to be a fun time.\" Tails gave her a nervous smile in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed the rabbit in after some cursory washing of Cream's seat. \"Now Honey,\" he said as he entered, spying her plopped down in front of the TV in her still-messy clothes, drinking from a bottle of soda. \"I understand that you want to enjoy this whole situation, and having more freedom, but I... Ah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was struggling to find the words<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream let out a belch, the contents of her belly dutifully fermenting. \"What is it Mr. Fox? Do you think I get too caught up in eating? I thought you liked to see me happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well isn't it you're job to take care of my needs?

She had trapped him; by all accounts if Vanilla caught wind of this he would be the one in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Tails said nervously, \"I suppose no one has to know, right? And I do like seeing you enjoy yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mr.Fox.\" Cream smiled earnestly for once. It seems things were going her way, and she was quite pleased with herself. Soon she'd be able to eat as much as she wanted and spend her days waited on hand and foot. \"Now Mr Fox, I think it's time we had dessert, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but you have to take a bath after!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dessert first, than a bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails signed. At least now they were in the comfort of home and there was a lot less public embarrassment for him. One day of gross overindulgence wouldn't hurt, and the worst was probably over. He went to the deep freeze and got a variety of frozen treats and desserts for Cream to enjoy - Cakes, the remaining ice cream, frozen pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mr Tails\" she said, as she began to stuff her face with much fervor.

In normal circumstances, Cream and Tails would've found its entertainment value lacking, but now they were simply too lazy to care.

Unlike the blissfully unaware Cream, Tails could still understand that his genius IQ was rapidly dwindling.

He started looking around, trying to find the remote, but didn't see it anywhere. He could always get up and walk to the TV to switch it off, but that would require... What's it called?

Was her best friend Amy, who like Cream had no intention even reading the list of requirements Vanilla had given to her weeks earlier and stressed the importance of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy finally drove up to Cream's mansion, nudging open the door with a free leg as she heaved a towering pile of groceries and luggage into the house Cream waltzed up to Amy, warmly greeting her. \"Hello Amy~!\" As Amy started dumping all of her junk in the hallway, she sat down on the nearest chair and wiped her brow, giggling. \"Your mom's already gone, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sure is Amy! Did she give you the list of my bed times, what I can and can't eat, what rooms we're banned from and all the emergency money in case anything happens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy with a fake aura of posh sophistication replied. \"Why yes Cream, she gave me very strict instructions and even a timetable for the following few months! Looks like your mother expects us to have a very prim and proper time for the next few months!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask Amy if you actually intend on following any of my dear mother's 'very strict instructions'?\" Cream asked, in a similar tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfffft, nope!\" Amy broke out laughing, picking up a bag and grabbing Cream's arm. \"Now c'mon, we gotta eat this before it melts... Unless you're not hungry, which knowing you is a rare occurrence indeed.\" Cream's eyes lit up as they quickly ran into her huge kitchen, which was so large it dwarfed Amy's entire apartment. Plonking the bag on the closest bench, Amy produced two large ice cream scoops and revealed one of Cream's personal favorites; Triple Rocky-road fudge delight. \"And just in case that's too plain for you I bought some toppings...\" Reaching into another bag she produced an equally large bottle of sauce and a can of whipped cream, sampling a bit of both before throwing all three treats into a huge bowel, Cream's eyes widening in excitement as her best friend prepared the enormous treat. Both of them climbing on top of the smooth cold surface of the bench, both ready their spoons in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last one to the bottom's a lightweight!\" Cream cried out, both girls digging their scoops deep into the soft gooey treat which stood nearly as tall as them, barely pausing during their mid-afternoon snack besides the occasional burp or brain-freeze. Within 10 minutes all that remained was the bowel, licked clean and a chocolate covered rabbit and hedgehog lying on the ground letting out proud burps, rubbing their swollen cuts as they licked their clothes clean for any missed bits of chocolaty goodness. \"*UUURRRRPPPP!* Maaaan that was good eating. Bet your mom doesn't let you eat half-as much as that, eh Cream?\" Amy asked, rubbing and massaging her belly as several pounds worth of frozen confectionery digested inside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not unless I throw a temper tantrum anyway. And that takes <i>wooooork</i>. You know how annoying that is, having to get up and let the waterworks go off for a minute or so just to get candy for dinner or a 3rd indoor swimming pool?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy grimaced a bit; she was going to relish the chance to go live up to the 'hog' in her for the next few months on Vanilla's seemingly endless supply of money with Cream, but even she had to admit the girl was disturbingly spoilt if having to whine to her ultra-rich mommy for material goods she'd have to save years up for was somehow anything other then easy street. But this concern soon ebbed away as she remembered the obscene amounts of money and resources at her disposal thanks to Cream and she started focusing on how they were going to have a fun time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... Yeah, had  that same problem with my parents or something. SO, what do you wanna do after that 'little' snack? I'm assuming Cheese can manage to bring all that luggage of mine to my room.\" Sucking the remaining contents of the whipped cream can, Cream swallowed and started to ponder what was next on the agenda for the two of them. Meanwhile, Cheese was still struggling on pulling one of dozens of Amy's bags all the way up the first of several flights of stairs to Amy's bedroom for the next few months, hoping that this would be the last of his troubles with their new guest.</span></div></div>",

Most people would have been reviled by her appearance let alone her odor. Her smell was so bad you could literally see green fumes coming off her body.

The hedgehog had gained about 30 pounds and it showed. The donuts gave Shadow a cute doughy pot belly and his once tight butt had inflated and softened too. Shadow was oblivious to the gain. Shadow felt his stomach digesting the donuts and felt it\u2019s byproducts at work in his stomach. Shadow relieved the pressure by letting out a loud gassy belch. \u201cMmm\u2026 That hit the spot. Off to get Rouge\u2019s jello,\u201d Shadow said as he dashed off with surprising speed considering the weight he\u2019s gain, his belly bouncing and jiggling with each stride. Shadow grabbed all the jello he could and scurried through the door. The manager and employee were stunned at the strange hedgehog\u2019s crime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm\u2026 Wasn\u2019t he um\u2026 thinner when he got in?\u201d said the stunned employee to his boss.<br>\r\n***************************************************<br>\r\nShadow ran back to the trolleys to load his loot on the pile of food. On the journey home Shadow couldn\u2019t help but think of all the glorious food he was going to feed his darling Rouge, and speaking of food Shadow felt hungry again. \u201cThat strange I just had a couple of donuts 5 minutes ago\u2026,\u201d Shadow thought to himself, \u201cWell that\u2019s what I get for skipping breakfast.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow reached out for a bag of Cheetos and a two liter bottle of coke as he dragged his trolleys back to Rouge\u2019s place. Luckly for him her house was only a few more minutes away but with his newly fattened form it felt like it was two hours away. Shadow started to sweat as he hauled the convoy of trolleys. The soda and cheesy poofs started to have an effect on his bowels as he let out a burp and farted with every step, Shadow was a little embarrassed by this but some how turned on\u2026 After all he found Rouge to be attractive despite being a gassy half ton slob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternating drinking his soda with one hand and stuffing his face Cheetos all while pulling the trolleys home. Orange Cheeto dust was all over his hands and face. Shadow finished off his two liter bottle with a hearty belch that would have made Rouge proud (that is, in her slobbified state). Shadow could feel the soda working its gassy magic on his bowels as he let out a hot gassy fart loud and proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FFFRRRRPPPPRRRTTT* Shadow\u2019s fat butt made the fart louder as the air made his jiggly cheeks flap. Shadow blushed at this emission but laughed a little, \u201cThis is what I get for hanging out with Rouge.\u201d Shadow had finally made it back to Rouge\u2019s hide out to fatten his slob princess more. He grabbed him self a pack of Oreos as buzzed the Food-mo-tron to collect the food. \u201cHey *munch* Mo-tron got us some *crunch* food for ya\u2019 to bring up,\u201d he said as he scratched his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good sir. I\u2019ll be right down.\u201d Shadow could hear Rouge munching and laughing stupidly in the background. Shadow laughed a little at Rouge\u2019s sexy slobbyness, were he farted again. \u201cShit,\u201d he thought, \u201cI\u2019m really gassy today. But I wasn\u2019t gassy this morning not until\u2026\u201d Shadow took the elevator back up stairs as he farted inside the cramped cubicle, when he reached Rouge\u2019s floor a stinky green gas out of the elevator. Shadow coughed a little when he saw himself in the mirror. Shadow then realized the extent of the damage his gorging had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow had change drastically, he now was 200 pounds with a gigantic gut hanging over his tree trunk like thighs. His arms were now thick and flabby that jiggled when ever he moved them. His moobs had blossomed well and there size would have made the old Rouge jealous. His face was now bloated and stained with cheesy crumbs on his cheeks and developing double chin. \u201cOh, God\u2026 I-I can\u2019t be a *URP* slob I gave it all to rouge I didn\u2019t have any!\u201d he said panicked. Shadow scrambled to find the missing bottled in Rouge\u2019s living room. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had grown curious as to why she hadn\u2019t made any attempts to steal the Master Emerald over the past little while but as soon as he entered he wished he hadn\u2019t.<br>\r\nHe stood in shock as he saw the massive Shadow and even bigger Rouge belching and farting while the comparatively smaller Tails was being force-fed a liquid by some strange robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnuckles! You BBUUURRRPPP! need to get out of here!\u201d Tails called as his body began to grow larger and wider with sagging quivering fat that piled on at a remarkable speed. His fifth chin enveloped what remained of his neck as his boy boobs expanded and now sagged to where his belly button used to be. His massive gut spread out over the floor, covering his nine-foot wide thighs along with his knees. His butt grew so massive it actually began to lift him higher into the air. As his body grew it also began to constantly perspire, making his fur matted and sticky. He also began to belch constantly and drool flowed from his mouth like a river, hindering his speech. When it was all over Tails weighed nearly fifteen hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d Knuckles gasped in disbelief as a fart from Tails\u2019 enormous rear blasted him in the face.<br>\r\n\u201cKnUUUUURRRRPPPPckles! Get out here!\u201d Tails called with his deeper voice. He could feel that intelligence was rapidly decreasing and if it was the last thing he did he needed to warn Knuckles about the potential slob epidemic. \u201cYou \u2026 need \u2026 run! Get \u2026 help! Don\u2019t \u2026 let \u2026 me \u2026 fart! You \u2026 bad \u2026 on \u2026 you \u2026 fart!\u201d Tails was trying to tell Knuckles to not inhale any of the belch or fart fumes but was struggling due to his simplifying mind. \u201cFart! Burp! UUURRRPPP! You \u2026 FFFFRRRRRTTTT!\u201d Tails tried to say more but suddenly unleashed a torrent of shit from his behind, aggravating him and causing him to sob like a baby. Unlike Rouge and Shadow who still had some limited thought capacity the potion had annihilated almost all of Tails\u2019 brain cells. Within seconds his mind was a blank slate and the once brilliant boy genius was a moaning, drooling, shitting, brain-dead slob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified by what he had just witnessed Knuckles ran out of Rouge\u2019s home, unknowingly carrying the slob infection from Tails\u2019 earlier fart. He was less than a mile away from Rouge\u2019s home when he began to go through some changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt gassier than usual and decided a fart would be the best way to relieve the building pressure. His muscular body was also beginning to soften as his metabolism was starting to shrink. <br>\r\nHe initially left heading Tails advice to warn the population, but instead those thoughts were replaced by the recollection of a chilidog-eating contest being held today at Uncle Chuck\u2019s dinner. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Where once would've been her slim and able-bodied mother working away instead sat an enormous cream-blob of a rabbit, casually scooping out of cartons of soft ice-cream as her browned panties oozed out with smelly dung behind her. Laying in a large pool of her own urine, Vanilla with all her might slowly got up to her wobbly tree-stumps for legs, beaming a warm smile to her shocked daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's was weird, sweetiepie? Ooooh, a nasty somebody tell you what <i>dieting</i> was!?\" She hissed, waddling over to her comparitvely rail-thin daughter. \"I bet it was that blabbermouth tart Amy, wasn't it? Oh my sweet girl, you really do have some shitty friends...\" Vanilla trailed off, pulling a gagging Cream deep into her furry apron of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i-i-it was nothing m-mom!\" Cream nervously responded, trying to push herself away from the river of sweat and drench that was coating her mother's stomach before slipping on a newly formed puddle of urine and onto her chubby butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? You're looking awfully thin! Oh that nosy bitch, I bet Amy got you exercising while you were out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying her best not to call out in disgust at being covered in her mom's messy droppings, Cream couldn't help but notice her mother's more... colorful dialect. \"Mom? You're using some of our no-no words...\" Cream started, her mother pausing before rolling her eyes and shrugging, raising a flabby leg to let out a putrid fart. \"Pfffft, that was the <i>OLD</i> me honey! The new me isn't stuck-up and realizes anything that takes effort simply isn't worth it; like manners!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile unbelievably lazy, Cream's mother wasn't stupid; she could read her daughter's look of suspicion like an open book. \"Why don't I show you somebody who'll change your mind?

Items such as used tissues, chicken bones, cotton swabs, toenail clippings and rotting fruit peels were some if the best things Cream had ever eaten. And with each handful of trash she shoveled into her mouth the slobbier she became. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every bite gas built up in her stomach until she could no longer contain it. After the first bag was consumed Cream was constantly farting, each one smellier than the last. Her tiny burps became all-out belches that made it difficult for her to speak. Her BO and breath had become just as vile as her farting ad only grew worse with each passing minute. Pretty soon Cream's funk had transformed Vanilla's once beautiful backyard garden into a valley of dead grass and rotting vegetables ... Not that anyone minded of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream's decent into slobdom did not stop with foul gas expulsion. Her teeth yellowed and were now rotting inside her mouth.

She was slowly but surely becoming a loud, obnoxious, bitch of a slob who despised everyone - especially her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more garbage? Aww, no fair!\" Cream moaned then belched and farted in unison. Looking around she then noticed one of the remaining carrots on the garden that had mot been obliterated by her stench.

Every step she took left her winded and sweaty while and her unexpected detour into a pizza parlor left her tipping the scales at 300 pounds. Her boobs were much larger than before and bulged against the tight fabric of her tightening dress. Her stomach was becoming a quivering eyesore that bounced up and down with every labored breath and the bottom of her buttcheeks were now yo-yoing in and out of her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was very nervous of the changes she was going though, worried that she would end up like any one of her friends she had encountered today and simply become a mindless blob. But the most troublesome thought was that Sonic would not love her if she looked like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs another wet fart escaped from her rear Amy dug at her panties that were painfully climbing up her cheeks.

Now clad in the remains of her tattered clothes the 1,200 pound Vanilla\u2019s fur was matted down by her constant sweat and with the help of the spices found in her meal her body odor was so intense the restaurant\u2019s wallpaper was actually beginning to peel off of the walls.

Let a real lady get her grub on~!\" The older woman barked in-between mouthfuls of mouldy trash, Amy trying her best not to audibly gag at the display... Or worse, start showing a twinge of <i>jealousy</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally managing to sneak through to the back alley of the restaurant, Amy rubbed her hands in anticipation as she eyed her prize. <i>'There's got to be enough to keep me satisfied in this bin until I can work out a way to reverse this mess!'</i> She thought to herself eagerly, taking a bit of effort to climb to the top before she surveyed its contents. <i>'Huh, weird... It's mostly just mushy bean-mix. Why would a Mexican restaurant in a world of gluttons throw all this out?' </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging to no one in particular, Amy leaned down and started to messily slurp away at the mixture, immediately lifting herself up again as she wiped away a moustache from her chubby upper lip. <i>'Weird... This doesn't taste particularly bean-y... Maybe that's why they threw it out? Still, gotta eat <i>something</i> to keep this virus from completely consuming me!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back down again, Amy yelped as the weight of her stomach caused her to flip over into the dumpster and its 'mystery' sauce, the hedgegirl slowly bobbing to the surface before taking a few mouthfuls. After a few minutes of playful paddling around in the dumpster-pool and having her fill, she suddenly heard the backdoor she'd used slam open, with the sound of heavy footsteps, strained breathing and a dragging bundle of something before the noise stopped at the very edge of the dumpster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh, here I go again~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Amy screamed in surprise as she saw Vanilla's looming, cellulite-ridden asscheeks looming over the top of her dumpster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VANILLA!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around with a look of mild-confusion, the obese rabbit stared at Amy with a flabby eyebrow raised. \"... What're you doing in this dumpster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another gulp of the mixture incase Vanilla chose to contaminate it, Amy grossed her filthy arms and hissed back \"What, do ya own it or something? I'm having a quick snack before I can turn all you filthy slobs back to normal!\" Vanilla's raised eyebrow's slowly lowered as her mouth grew to a mischevious grin. \"'Having a quick snack'~? Oh my, and you think <i>I'm</i> the filthy slob here~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer defiance quickly turning to anxiety, Amy's eyes narrowed. \"Uh, yeah... You are? I was here ages before you were!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting out laughing, Vanilla continued her line of questioning. \"Strange, I do believe I've been... 'using' this dumpster for several hours before you came along; can't keep myself weighed down after all... And you think all this... Uh, 'leftovers' is delicious, do you~?\" \"Well yeah, way better than that trash you were eating inside! Look, what're you getting aaaaat-EEEEWWWWW!!!\" Screaming out in disgust, Amy watched in horror as Vanilla with a playful grunt started to unload into the shallow dumpster, her waste looking identical to the mystery food Amy had been wolfing down moments earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Oh god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting into a hearty laugh that shook her entire body jiggling, Vanilla gave the traumatised girl a proposition. \"Well Amy?

She desperately wanted to scream in terror and run away but her 500 pound body refused to move, all it did was allow several hot tears to stream down her chubby cheeks while she unconsciously scooped up another handful of Vanilla's tasty waste with her flabby hand and greedily pour it down her throat. She couldn't help it, she was addicted to this delicious slop but her mind was still intact enough to know how disgusting a situation she was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the beginning of the day she was her regular athletic, spunky self. Now she had ballooned up to 500 pounds, was sweating and farting non stop, and to top it all off, she was addicted to Vanilla Rabbit's crap.<br>\r\n\"So what do you say slobby? I ain't got all day.\" Vanilla barked then squeezed out a smelly wet fart, indicating she was ready to release another fresh torrent from her massive ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy Rose couldn't muster any more resistance, what little remaining willpower she had snapped like a matchstick.  She burst into tears as she accepted the fact she would never return to normal and neither would her friends. She had failed miserably and was doomed to sucking half digested bean mix from an older woman's ever-growing ass until the end of her days. <br>\r\nSnot poured from her nose as she continued to wail and slowly began to stick her multi-chinned face in between Vanilla's hot, smelly, sticky ass cheeks. <br>\r\n\"Thata girl.\" Vanilla teased as she bit her lower lip and unleashed the full force of her bowels upon the sobbing girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's mouth was wide opened but could barely contain all of Vanilla's hot waste that came at her with the force of a firehose. She had to squeeze Vanilla's dimpled ass with the sausage-like fingers with all of her weakening might just to keep herself from being blasted off. <br>\r\nWhen the initial pressure eased Amy greedily drank all that she could, gulping down as much of her sweet meal as she could while the overflow poured out of her mouth and into her cleavage. <br>\r\nVanilla laughed wickedly and pushed as hard as she could to make sure Amy got every last drop. When she finished the ton of a Rabbit turned her bulk around and stared at the still sobbing hedgehog, now covered in snot, tears, waste and was closing in on 650 pounds. <br>\r\n\"Vanilla, please (sob) help me. I PFFFRRTTT! don't want to (hic) do this anymore. I URRRP! don't wanna be your toilet.\" She begged as she licked her lips and began to eat from the dumpster once again. <br>\r\nVanilla was not pleased with Amy's attitude. After bestowing her with such a generous serving of crap she should literally be begging for more. \"Oh you're going to be my toilet whether you want to or not you little tart.\" Vanilla sneered. \"Now get your fat ass into the restaurant! With you as my toilet I can focus on eating myself into immobility.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy watched as Vanilla very slowly trudged towards the restaurant, sweating burping and swearing up a storm as she only began her second step. Amy continued to look on as Vanilla took each pathetic step and was all but hypnotized by her jiggling ass, each cheek able to fill an entire love seat on its own and more importantly the container of the only food source she would ever know ever again. After another handful of said food from the dumpster Amy slowly pulled herself out and waddled after Vanilla, crushed by the fact she would never be able to get Sonic to love her now. The sudden warmness she felt between her legs and underneath her stomach as she freely wet herself only confirmed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile  ...</span></div></div>",

He had travelled back in time to investigate a disturbance in the past that was all but erasing the future. The bleak world he once knew was becoming even bleaker thanks to its inhabitants blowing up into slobby blobs seemingly overnight. <br>\r\nHe was barely able to pinpoint the point of the disturbance and travel back to it before he became affected, although not greatly so. He developed potbelly and a small pair of moobs but other than that he was still the same Hedgehog he always was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing his trek Silver came across a restaurant in the distance. \"Hmm,\" he thought. \"If everyone in the future are becoming butterballs, then a restaurants tainted food could be the likely culprit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRacing towards the building as fast as he could Silver kicked open the door and nearly vomited at the smell that hit him like a brick wall. He regained his senses and peered inside the abandoned buffet, horrified by what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere in the middle of the floor was a two-ton Vanilla Rabbit laying on her gigantic ass, eating out of the last of the garbage bins. Behind her was the 900 pound Amy Rose who was lying on her stomach and had her head firmly planted in between each of Vanilla's cheeks and eating whatever it produced. <br>\r\n\"Wha - What's going on here?\" Silver gasped in shock. His words were loud enough to cause Amy to stir and pull her head out of Vanilla's cheeks. <br>\r\n\"Silver ... please ... help ... me.\" She desperately panted from her stained mouth. <br>\r\nVanilla took no notice to Silver but did feel Amy stop working, even though she was still pooping! This would never do. \"Toilet! Why are you slacking off?!\" She thundered. \"Do you want me to go back to using the dumpster because I will you ungrateful brat!\" <br>\r\n\"N-N-N-N-No ma'am. S-Sorry ma'am.\" Amy cowered and returned to her duties. She did not want her only source of the wonderful food she could no longer live without to leave her ... Even though it was now impossible for Vanilla to move her massively immobile legs anymore, let alone walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His did you two get like this?\" Silver asked curiously and plugged his nose for good measure. <br>\r\n\"SHUT UP! YOUR DISTURBING MY LUNCH YOU MORON!\" Vanilla screamed at the top of her lungs, spraying Silver with a barrage of half eaten food and soiled napkins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off the disgusting chunks of garbage Silver knew he had to do something. He had been training with his master before his departure and had been learning several ixis spells, one of them being altering matter as he saw fit. <br>\r\n\"I hope this works.\" Silver thought and began to concentrate. Closing his eyes he pondered what alterations he should make first. \"Okay, I need to make you two smaller ... smaller ... smaller. You're much too big and fat.

Amy remained blissfully unaware as she was now trying her hardest just to keep her head inside Vanilla's now humongous cheeks but was still managing to continue with her feasting/toiletry duties. Vanilla's intelligence had been fading lately so she didn't catch on either, all that she saw now was a landfill of gigantic yummy garbage for her to eat which she thought was \"Totally awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was not the only change the girls experienced.

He did not want to try to cast another spell and risk it backfiring again but was reluctant to leave them like this. \"Okay girls, it looks like you have enough food to last you for a while.

After another step his stomach began to growl, demanding it be filled.

And if Cream hasn't been infected yet she might be able to tell me how this whole mess started.\" Happy with his plan Silver farted and headed for the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Is anyone home?\" Silver called as he entered the disaster of a house. The paint on the walls were chipping and every plant had been reduced to a pile of dead leaves. The kitchen was an absolute nightmare too and there was a certain familiar scent wafting throughout the house, no-doubt the cause of the decay. <br>\r\n\"I don't like this.\" Silver moaned before the whole house was rocked by a powerful tremor, so powerful if knocked Silver off his feet. <br>\r\n\"PPFFFRRRTTT! What the heck was that?\" Silver asked as he headed for the backyard where the tremor originated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ... Noooooo ...\" Silver moaned in defeat when his eye locked onto Tails and Cream. Their blobish forms had only grown larger and were jiggling with every labored breath. Drool sweat and urine freely poured from their bodies and created a shallow lake in the backyard. The pair freely munched on fresh garbage that had been mysteriously been provided to them and placed inside plastic kiddie pools that acted like doggie dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" Silver gasped as he waded towards Tails, trying no to think of what kinds of disgusting bodily fluids coated him from the knees down. He looked over the massive wet fox who oozed his head up from his meal to look at the visitor. <br>\r\n\"Tails, what happened to you? How did you and Cream get like this?\"<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmuuuuurrrrrrhhhhhhhh!\" Tails moaned. \"Uuuuhhhhhh! BBLLLUUUURRRRAAAAPPP!!! Mmuuuuhhhh!\"<br>\r\nSilver was nearly blown off of his feet by the sheer force and stink of Tails' belch. Shaking his head in disgust Silver looked at Tails' vacant face. His eyes were glazed and his tongue lazily rolled out of his mouth. It became clear to Silver that the Tails he once knew was no more and wound never again be anything but this vile enormity of mindless filth. <br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll have more luck with Cream.\" Silver sighed and began to hike to Cream's massive face still buried in the mountain of trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cream? What's going on?\" Silver asked. Cream could barely lift her head up from her dish and lazily turned to Silver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuggghhhhhh!!!\" Cream moaned like Tails. Thanks to her fat body her voice was much deeper now and her eyes were also glazed over. With a grunt a she emptied her bowels then returned to her food. Silver could not believe it, both of them were completely mindless, unable to even talk or even think of anything other than eating garbage and defecting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver realized how hopeless his mission was becoming as his stomach growled once again, reminding him he was starving.

To think that these six vegetables would bring about the downhill slide of civilisation, it was all he could do not to lose control and give his position away. These were not natural. Someone had created these with a purpose in mind, but who would gain anything from turning Mobius into a dreary gas giant populated by slobs? None of history's dictators seemed to match the motive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter. It had to end, and it would end here, and now, by his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand that he raised to atomise the vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hold.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused. Did one of those things... talk to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We mean you no harm, Mobian. We mean no-one any harm. We only wish to bring you to Grandfather's embrace.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked, gaping at the vegetables until he finally found his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?! What do you want?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We are Grandfather's heralds. We are His eyes and ears and hands. We enact His will. Our wish is His wish, and it is His wish that Mobius return to the fold.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver panicked. \"Return to the fold?! What are you talking about?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> This world was one of a million that lived under Grandfather's benevolence. He protected those worlds from pain, from suffering, from doubt. When the Cataclysm struck, Grandfather was swept away in a tide of fire. All the worlds that He loved, that He cared for, fell from His gaze. History eroded all evidence of His existence, save for a temple or a chapel on half a dozen planets. The young races built their cities over the ancient sites, and they forgot. Do you not understand, Silver of Mobius? They... you... lost your way. But Grandfather is forgiving. He is reaching out to us again. The worlds will be His to love and nurture again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Silver screamed, \"Why does your Grandfather care about all of that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> He loves us, Silver, and He loves you. You could bring about His return. You could be Grandfather's voice, for the rest of Mobius. Join us, and we can restore utopia. We can- </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it!\" Silver spat at the vegetables, \"'We can create Eden'? Is that what you were going to say? End wars, perhaps? End hunger? Innocent happy stupor, is that what you were going to call it?! Well, I got news for you and your grandpa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his hands and pushed them forward in the direction of the tubers, the palms glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard it before, and I am not buying it. Not after what you did to Blaze!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe focussed all of his energy into obliterating the vegetables. His eyes were scrunched up so tight, he could not see what was happening. But he could feel their resistance, their determination to hold their structure together even as he tried to pull them apart into atoms. Every fibre of his being shook. His teeth clenched tightly together. His fingers were quivering beyond all control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere! He felt it. They began to give way. He could feel their structure fall apart. Each tuber was slowly torn to pieces by his psychic might. First, they became wedges, then shreds, then dust, then atoms, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver fell to his knees. He could no longer hear that voice as it pleaded with him, begging him to stop. He could no longer see them, or feel their presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad he done it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter, he thought, as he fell onto his face and into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not know how long he was asleep before he felt something nudge his ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up and at 'em, Silver!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to roll onto his back, but a firm hand caught his upper arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you want to fall off my house, I'd be very careful, if I were you,\" Vanilla chuckled. With that, she gently helped the psyker onto his feet, where, shaking his head and rubbing his brow, he finally opened his eyes to see the familiar slender figure of Vanilla the Rabbit. Behind her was Rouge, her wings keeping her aloft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanilla!\" Silver blurted out, \"Are you OK?\" The rabbit's eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am <i>I</i> OK? I assure you, I wasn't the one who collapsed on my roof,\" she smiled before rolling her eyes. \"Yes. Yes, I am fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was going on, Silver?\" Rouge spoke up. \"I was about to investigate a temple, when I detected a powerful telekinetic burst. What were you doing up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver gaped. A temple?!</span></div></div>",

All around, he could see the broken stumps of pillars and columns, the faded remains of a stone floor, and idols worn away by time. He looked at the statues as he passed them, each of them depicting an immensely bloated figure squatting on the pedestal. Some brandished what he guessed to be swords, some clutched their bellies, some held their stone arms out, as if to embrace him. All of them seemed to leer at him, each statue with a grotesque smile carved onto its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver shuddered. it reminded him too much of the future, of the friends he saw succumb to that... degeneration. He approached one of the statues and gazed into its round, grinning, antlered head. Was this Grandfather?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunching on a peach, Silver stepped forward until he beheld the entrance to the temple's inner sanctums. The door was long since worn away, and the doorway was a huge, squat mouth. Wide enough for even the most immobile slobs to be carried inside, Silver thought bitterly. He peered inside, unable to see far into the darkness. He could smell the mustiness of an ancient tomb, but beneath was another aroma, a more worryingly familiar one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver looked around again. Did the Mobians build this thing? Did they really worship this Grandfather? He didn't want to believe it, and he could not recall any records of an ancient cult dedicated to slobdom. All of this made him ponder - who else lived on Mobius? Who dedicated their lives to this entity? Were they actively seeking slobdom? Did they want the mindless, happy stupor the tubers were promising?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Silver began making a tentative foot forward. He felt it land on a stone surface with a gentle tap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes darted from left to right. His breath was held. The only sound he could hear was the wind.

With another thought, his new conveyance carried him deeper into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver turned from left to right, always keeping his eyes peeled for traps or guards. The silence unnerved him; he did not dare to even breath any louder than he needed. All around him, he could see those same rotund, gigantic statues flank him, their massive, leering faces seemingly mocking him. Every movement Silver made as he ventured further became more and more deliberate, more calculated. He hoped that by finishing the journey in flight would prevent him from falling prey to whatever defences the temple had in store for him. But the deeper he travelled, the more the fanged mouths of the statues seemed to threaten him. It seemed more and more likely that something - a dart? a spell? a prehensile tongue? - would erupt from their maws and strike him. Snarling, Silver reached out and summoned two more tiles, bringing them up on either side of his transport to act as a shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe odour within the temple grew as he ventured further, becoming more and more pronounced the deeper he went. The temple began to smell worse than Vanilla's house. A sickness began to grow in his stomach and the stench threatened to make his head swim. He wanted to be sick. His arms and legs shook. He struggled to keep his head upright. His control began to waver. The tiles were slipping from his telekinetic grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver blinked as he saw his path split into two.

He then pulled out two vials. One Big, and One Small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those... What are those?\" Silver struggled to say clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to play a little game with you...\" He lifted up the small vial. \"Take this, and it shall cure you of the ailments that have befallen you...

He watched as his belly rolled outward and forward, his thoughts about his own figure long gone. He smiled sadly as his ballooning legs gave out beneath him; he saved the past. He ensured the future was secured and protected, just as he had set out to do. He chuckled to himself; he hadn't imagined it would end any way like this, growing and fattening into immobility, his silver and white fur becoming a murky green. After what he had seen Blaze succumb to, nothing had fazed him anymore. Mere months ago, he would have been alarmed to the point of paralysis at the thought of gaining such weight. Now, he barely raised an eyebrow. He barely paid mention to the loss of any mobility in his legs. It scarcely bothered him when his arms became vast, fleshy cones tipped with inflated palms and fingers. He didn't even notice the dark green pyramid of three circles that had begun to emerge along his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver's smile dropped as he thought of the others. It was better that they never see him. It would be too much to hope for that the old man's word could be taken at face value. It seemed too convenient that he would leave Mobius alone if Silver had chosen as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere was how he saved the world from Grandfather. There was no death-defying ploy, no glorious, climactic battle between gods and mortals. There was only Silver, sitting alone in a dimly-lit chamber in a forgotten ruin. There was only Silver, growing larger and fatter than he imagined was ever possible. There was only Silver, who watched lazily as his arms and legs lost all mobility. It had become an effort in and of itself to turn his head, his swelling and multiplying chins lifting his growing, spherical face until his gaze rested on the ceiling. He looked up, his eyes barely squinting up behind his puffy, inflated cheeks at the patterns above him. He did not know what psychic power he had left to him. He could lift himself up from the ground, but where would he go? He could shift the blocks, but what would he gain from it? It would only expose him, show himself to the others, such as he was. It would upset them, and only make things worse. It could even infect them as it had infected him. He could not bear to risk causing the same disaster he sought to avert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought of the others, of Sonic racing over the hills and plains, or fighting Robotnik, or something like that. He thought of Tails, flying around in that aeroplane - did he still have that aeroplane? He thought of... of... it was becoming so difficult to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver's eyes lazed from side to side, his mouth slack. He tried find someone, anyone, to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked. There. There she was, in his mind. He thought of Blaze, exploring the world above this ruin. He thought of Blaze, living her life in a world free from primordial gods and worlds in ruin. Would she be looking for him? Would she be searching for him, still? He hoped not. He doubted it. He told no-one where he was headed. They would never know where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver sighed in relief. In that, perhaps, he had saved the world. He would sit here in anonymity, and, whichever god willing, he would die and take the virus into the afterlife with him. They would never find him. They would never catch it from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief turned to sadness as he thought of Blaze.

He had no means of telling what time it was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one thing struck him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was no longer in the confines of the temple. He was not in the ruins. He was not sure where he was. All about him, he could see a never-ending forest dotted by patches of wilting, yellow grass and covered in a thick blanket of yellow smog. The garden about him was overgrown with gnarled, wormy, drooping trees, their greying, oozing trunks bent double. Murky vines dripping strange, translucent fluids dangled from the branches. Strange mushrooms grew from the recesses of these trees, and he saw the familiar tubers that changed many of his friends. Apparently, they did grow like weeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver lazily gazed above the wilting tree-line to discover a house, a towering mansion that seemed to crack and decay in front of his eyes. Thick, murky smoke billowed out from dozens of chimneys. Thick, green sludge issued from the hundreds of pipes along its walls. Its entire exterior seemed to rot before his eyes - plaster yellowed and fell away. Brickwork crumbled and cracked. Wooden beams decayed and putrefied. In spite of such metamorphoses, the mansion held up as strong as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver stared, lazily blinking at the manor - was he going to live there now? A persistent poke turned his gaze away. Looking down, he saw a curious creature. It was green, mottled and rotund, its legs hidden behind its spherical gut. Its tiny paws pressed against his hip and its yellow eyes stared up at him. Its little mouth screeched and hooted, communicating some alien language beyond Silver's faintest hopes of comprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in answer, many more creatures of its ilk emerged from the shadows of the dying foliage; within seconds, the grass was carpeted by a numberless mass of little green men, all surrounding Silver's immobile bulk. As one, they all scampered towards him, crawling, squirming and rolling beneath his legs and belly. As one, they began to lift him, their combined efforts hoisting him into the air in spite of his massive weight. As one, they bore him along the grassy path, towards the rotting mansion. Silver could only watch in amusement as these creatures carried him. They seemed to like him to go to this much trouble for him, and they seemed friendly enough. It sure beat having to try and walk, he mused with a smile as he watched the forest pass him by. He saw more of the tubers and realised how hungry he was. No sooner had he done so than a small creature waddled up to his chest, bearing one. Grinning lazily, Silver opened his mouth, graciously receiving this offering. Chewing and swallowing the gift, Silver felt his corpulent form swell even further, all semblance of arms and legs now all but lost. If his bearers were affected by his weight gain, they gave no sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the forest melted away and Silver stared up at the towering maw that framed the entrance to what would become his new home. His little green bearers wasted no time in conveying him through the portal into a room that defied all dimensions. Silver blinked. He could see the walls, nor even the roof. All around him were ornate furniture pieces that were in a constant state of decay, mushrooms that burst out of the necrotic floorboards, and lights borne by clouds of flies. His eyes were drawn to the centre, even even these diseased flora gave way to brown, arid ground and blackened stumps. Silver beheld a personage hunched over, an entity that seemed terrifying and strange and yet, familiar and welcoming at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure was hunched over a massive cauldron, His arm slowly stirring the contents with a gargantuan bone. As if aware of Silver's presence, the figure paused in this action and turned to face him, rearing up to its full height, forcing Silver to stare vertically upwards. The lord of the manor, for who else could it be, was like a towering, mountainous sphere of flesh, gigantic and bloated with corruption, with foul-coloured, leathery and necrotic skin. His impossibly wide mouth split into a gigantic, triangular grin that seemed to reach downwards past His multiple chins, between His vast, lumpy pectorals and down to His planetoid belly. Reaching down with his massive clawed arms, the host delicately lifted Silver from the carpet of critters that had borne him, and brought him level with his massive, jowly, antlered head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, my child,\" He spoke, His deep, croaking voice reverberating throughout the chamber. \"You must be exhausted, after all you have been through.\" Cradling Silver in His left arm, the corpulent titan lifted the giant ladle from the cauldron, the bowl lowered to Silver's waiting lips. \"Drink, little Silver,\" His soft voice compelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver began lapping up the concoction, eagerly accepting the bounty given to him by his new carer, his new... Grandfather. Out of the corner of his eye, Silver thought he had seen another figure walking about the chamber. It was a brief glance, but even he could recall a curious supernatural grace, a figure not unlike a lithe human and a face that seemed to look back at him in sorrow. Silver shrugged and continued feeding, relaxing as he felt Grandfather's talons gently pat his growing belly and heard Grandfather's whispered promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be no more pain here, my child, not in the house of Grandfather Nurgle.\"</span></div></div>",

Even though the slob epidemic had not started yet he was still infected by the virus and his gorging at Uncle Chuck\u2019s had taken its tool on his body. His stomach hung over his meaty thighs and his moobs had grown to the size of grapefruits. His arms were heavy with fat and he was sweating now more than ever. He estimated his weight somewhere around 375 pounds but he did not want to think about it.

He did feel a pain of guilt for leaving Amy and Vanilla in such a way but knew it was for the best. At Vanilla\u2019s new size the decent pile of trash she feasted on had become the size of a small mountain so it would sustain her for quite some time. As for Amy \u2026 well, there was only so much he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing with his trek Silver began to examine the landscape and noticed that the trees of the Great Forest were dying. The leaves were brown and fell off the branches along with the bark of the trunk. The beautiful green grass had also been destroyed and was now a twisted wreck of yellow weeds. Silver wondered what could have caused such a thing to happen before he was forced to cover his nose. He had just made contact with the most fowl, disgusting odor he had ever smelt in his life. Just the brief whiff he took brought tears to his eyes. However it smelt familiar to him, almost like Vanilla and Amy but only on a grander scale.<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d Silver moaned as Knothole and its citizens came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike he feared the city was now overrun with dirty, smelly, sweating, farting, burping, pooping, swearing fat slobs. Every citizen was affected differently by the epidemic but the one consistency was no one weighed less than 350 pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, this is not good.\u201d Silver moaned as he slowly entered the city and the overpowering sounds and smells associated with constant burping and farting. The first person Silver \u2018recognized\u2019 was the 800 pound Rotor Walrus. Thanks to his blubber Rotor\u2019s weight had skyrocketed when the virus took over, crippling his once great intelligence and overworking his sweet glands which in turn coated him in a slimy shine. It was thanks to this slimy sweat that Rotor was still able to retain his mobility despite his weight. His body was so slippery that all he needed to do was fart and he would be sent sliding across the city, bumping into other slobs and smothering them with his girth. He found enjoyment from feeling the obese hands and feet pushing up against his body and sliding him away into another fellow slob, it was the most fun he ever had and could not stop laughing like an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver turned away and saw Antoine sitting in the distance. Thanks to the infection he was not only closing in on 900 pounds of pure fat, but most of it was going into his massive moobs and bulbous ass that was constantly farting and unleashing mounds of waste. His stomach was like a boulder and kept his fat legs apart. Underneath his sticky stomach was an ever-growing yellow puddle, signaling to Silver that he was also constantly peeing himself. His hair was greasy matted and drool flowed freely down his face and into his cleavage. Silver cautiously approached the soldier was busy playing with his manboobs that were now well past the size of his head.<br>\r\n\u201cAntoine \u2026 are you alright?\u201d Silver asked nervously.<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019est URP! Bon!\u201d Antoine wheezed as he became soaked in sweat from all of the effort talking took. Ignoring the horrified Hedgehog in front of him Antoine grunted and unleashed another pile of waste before going back to jiggling his assets.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSeveral moans could be heard coming from behind Antoine and Silver soon discovered the 640 pound Bunnie Rabbot gorging herself on her husband\u2019s \u2018leftovers\u2019. Her fat form jiggled wildly which caused her to sweat constantly, so much so that her robotic limbs were starting to rust right off of her body. Bunnie did not mind \u2026 in fact she didn\u2019t have much of a mind left. She just greedily scooped log after log of her husband\u2019s waste into her maw as fast as she could, not even bothering to close her mouth as she chewed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver did not know what to do. All of these people, their lives were being destroyed right in front of them but they did not seem to care at all. Silver tried to not let the sheer hopelessness of the situation get the better of him. Turning away from the massive slobs Silver headed towards \u2026</span></div></div>",

Turning around to see what the fuss was about, all he could make out were literal waves of varying obese animal citizens, all of them living up their hedonistic lifestyles in an orgy of eating, waste-expelling and love-making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, erm, excuse me ma'am- *BrAAAAApt~!* Oh eh, 'scuse me again...\" Silver shouted at a nearby passing by squirrel girl devouring a cake in each hand, each of her thighs was wide as Silver's stomach, turning around with what she assumed was a delicate, cute twirl but was more an awkward spin that sprayed feces in all directions. \"Hmmmm~? Oh my, aren't you- *FRPPPPPPTT~!* a cutie~? What can I... *Mmpth!* do ya for, lardbutt~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head to avoid giving off the wrong impression (and to subtly wipe off the specs of shit she'd sprayed over his face), Silver asked his questions about the mob as non-nonchalantly as he could muster, trying not to arouse any suspicion by acting grossed out at the clearly infatuated girl in front of him. From what he could muster from the few sentences the girl could say without stuffing her face with more sugary pastries or indulging in the smell of her own farts or even making several not-so-subtle advances on Silver, this mob was worshiping some sort of chosen pair, who represented the epitome of this new slob society their world had become. Naturally her wording was laden with more \"Oh man and they're <i>so</i> hot\" or \"and they're... Uh... Important! Heh, yeah!\", but the basic gist was all the same. Realizing she was out of food and not being able to reach behind herself to try and grasp some of her personal homecooked fudge, the squirrel girl told the hedgehog to call her and waddled off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... was sure... Uh, something... Well I better investigate what all this worshipping is about... It certainly isn't going to be pretty, I know that much...\" Eventually getting up as he tried to brush his wet self off, the once psychic warrior slowly started to try to wedged himself through the mob, desperate to reach some small, undetected pocket of slob-survivors to try and change the increasingly grim prospects that awaited their world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver kept his multiple-chinned head up high, trying to ignore the disgusting squelches and splats that happened every time he took another step in something soft and warmed. The obese hedgehog frequently fiound himself groped by a perverted and slob-obsessed admirer, squished between literal walls of flesh and even mistaking mammoth asscheeks as a gap between two separate individual's stomachs, naturally being rewarded with a waterfall of waste before being shoved out of the way by another, more mobile-citizen whom genuinely wanted to take part in the chocolate river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly an hour later and his fur almost completely shaded a dark, murky brown with small patches of white, an exhausted Silver saw on a large stage two blobs that despite his earlier experience, completely defied belief. Easily dwarfing the size of the previous blobs he'd had the displeasure of brushing up against in the mob or the dirty-mouthed Amy and Vanilla earlier sat piles of bright red and blue blubber, Mobius' once most formidable heroes now the world's most disgusting, gluttonous and depraved individuals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sonic and Knuckles were loving every minute of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of his weight situated in his mighty tree-trunk sized legs and house-sized asscheeks, Sonic's stomach still jutted out in front of himself by a good ten or so yards, the top-half covered in a thick layer of food debris, sweat and drool while his lower-half was splattered in literal tons of waste, most of which was naturally piling up behind him in a pyramid of brown, steaming slop. Piles of chillidogs, cakes and other goodies lined up around his fat-submerged face, the hedgeblob furiously devoured each comically oversized platter in a matter of seconds, only pausing to vomit messy leftovers up and greedily lick them up before another enormous treat was shoved in his ever-willing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles on the other hand had most of his weight focused on his stomach and new found moobs, the front-heavy echidna similarly being served nearly anything imaginable by an army of obese servants and maids awkwardly but happily stringing along food to the two uber-slobs. Stuck in utter awe, Silver almost didn't even notice a few maids walk around to the front of the two blobs, megaphone in tow as a few more produced enormous jacks and squeezed them underneath Sonic and Knuckles' stomachs and started to lift them up. Like most citizens who bothered to wear clothes in this new world, these maid's dresses did little to hide their asses or boulder-carrying panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hourly- *FRRPPPTTTT~!* Knothole slob Ceremoooan... uh... ceremoaaaaaaaanieee... Shit that's a weird word thing! Okay, the Knothole Slob Thing is about to... uh... *hic!* commence and stuff! So let's all just bask in the glory of our like... Totally fucking hot gods as they... Um... bestow their crap onto us- *BRAAAAAAAAPTT~!* '\" A particularly dirty catgirl in an extremiiley tight french maid's outfit announced to a cheering wave of slobs, waddling over to Sonic's head with the aid of a reinforced ladder as she placed the megaphone to the now slowest thing alive's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard the babe dudes- *Mmpth!* Enjoy the golden shower and chocolate starfish!\" A surprisingly coherent but distinctly lower-voiced Sonic said with his regular enthusiasm, both blobs suddenly spraying a jetstream of their piss into the applauding audience as messy diarrhea explosions also rained down on the mostly eager citizens down below. Struggling to breath, Silver fell to the ground and coughed and sputtered as he'd unwittingly ventured to the front-row seats of this repulsive 'Slob Thing', coughing up chunks of his former friend's leftovers before one thing stuck out in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

He tried his best to ignore the rest of the obese citizens who reveled in the former heroes waste. Silver tried to take shallow breaths to avoid inhaling the horrid smell coming off of him but his new weight made that impossible and he found himself exhausted and out of breath after only a few pathetic steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling onto his fattened ass Silver panted and gasped for air as sweat washed over his body. He tried to stand back onto his feet but could not muster enough strength. Little did he realize that his newfound \u2018immobility\u2019 was not a result of exhaustion, but rather was a result of his mind becoming sluggish and lazy. His psychic powers had kept his mind somewhat protected from the virus, but after his lengthy exposure to the virus he was no longer immune to the virus\u2019 mental effects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFFFFRRRRRRTTTT! Come BLLLUUUPPP! on \u2026. \u201d Silver gasped as he tried to move once more but his obese body refused to budge. \u201cI \u2026 have \u2026 to \u2026 save \u2026 everyone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what do BBLLLUUURRRPP! do you, like, mean save?\u201d asked one of the cat maids servicing Sonic and Knuckles. She had seen Silver fall and waddled over to see what he was mumbling about. The 600-pound maid had once been one of Knothole\u2019s most conservative and well-to-do women but that all changed when she took a whiff of one of Sonic\u2019s farts. She was now dressed in a far too-small maid uniform that was home to all sorts of stains. Her massive boobs had flopped out of the uniform\u2019s cups hours ago and now freely swayed across her massive gut. Her asscheeks yo-yoed up and down with every step she took and her inadequate panties were filled to the bursting point with her own collection of waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t \u2026 you \u2026 FFRRRTTTT! see \u2026 this is \u2026 wrong BLORP!?\u201d Silver panted. <br>\r\n\u201cW-W-W-Wrong?\u201d the maid looked at him blankly. \u201cLike sorry tons of fun, I don\u2019t like know what you\u2019re \u2026 uhhhh, what\u2019s the word? Oh yeah, saying?\u201d said the maid as she looked over the urine soaked, crap covered hedgehog and began to blush. \u201cLooks like you like enjoyed the \u2018Slob Thing\u2019, eh fatty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoyed it? NO! How can I enjoy this? How can you enjoy this?\u201d Silver spat.<br>\r\n\u201cLike it\u2019s totally easy.\u201d the maid said with a wink. \u201cThink about like it \u2026 well, don\u2019t think, it\u2019s like totally illegal or something, I think. Oops!\u201d the maid rambled on stupidly, much to the annoyance of Silver who was still struggling to stand. His body jiggled uncontrollably which all-but hypnotized the maid who stared intently at his shaking body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, you need to relax, Chubs!\u201d the maid said lustfully as she reached over and grabbed Silver\u2019s moobs and began to jiggle them and squeeze them without restraint. \u201cHe he he, your boobies are big! I like, like big boobies. I like have big boobies too.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cStop! BLLLUUUURRRPPPP! Let go of me!\u201d Silver screamed as a torrent of shit suddenly exploded from his ass with the pressure of a firehose. Silver fell silent after his outburst while the maid immediately shoved her hand down her urine-stained panties and began to play with herself. \u201cLike \u2026 Oh my gosh! That was \u2026 like too hot! You\u2019re like \u2026 a total Slob God like those two!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI \u2026 DON\u2019T \u2026 WANNA \u2026 BE \u2026 A \u2026 SLOB \u2026 GOD!\u201d Silver screamed. As if on cue an explosion of piss shot from him at the same force as his shit and sent the maid sent the maid flying backward. The maid orgasmed on the spot and when she eventually calmed down she waddled back to Silver, trying to drink what she could of his piss still running down her body.  Silver was disgusted by his actions but not as much as he had been before. He knew it was wrong but a growing part of him was telling him to let go and embrace what he had become.</span></div></div>",

He wanted to tell these perverted maids to leave him be, but now they were all too busy groping his fattened form and licking the shit off of him. The tickles of the maid\u2019s tongues erased Silver\u2019s remaining resistance, however there would always remain a small part of his mind that screamed out who wrong this was. However, the lust of twenty smelly maids who averaged between 600 - 900-pounds kept those thoughts well subdued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell come on you fat bitches!\u201d Silver ordered his harem as they began to roll him out of their God\u2019s sight, eventually stopping him within the cover of some dying trees and shrubs that would hide him from the rest of the population.

They had heard rumors of what was happening to their home and friends during their mission, and rushed back to see the extent of the damage. Every citizen of the forest was nearing immobility - if they had not already achieved it. Those still able to move about were quickly becoming the minority. Blobs of sweaty flesh oozed into the streets as either moans of consent, random obscenities, or nonsensical gibberish flowed freely from their mouths, along with rivers of drool and vomit. From their rears torrents of waste exploded from their cheeks and pooled all around their morbidly obese bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no green space left in the forest with the exception of green vegetables sprouting from the ground. These slob inhibitors grew freely from the mounds of disgusting waste and provided the immobile people with limitless food and allowed them to descend even further into slobdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy God, Sally. What happened here?\u201d Julie-Su gasped in horror. Amazingly neither girl had contracted the slob virus yet and took measures to prevent from being infected. They purposely avoided going near any slob they came across and held their noses when they heard a fart or belch. Wading through the deepening streets of waste both girls promised to buy themselves new boots when this was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d Sally said. She tried to put on a brave face but really she was scared out of her mind. This was such a terrifying environment and the thought of turning into such a vile beast almost made her cry. Sally tried to gather her inner-strength and after passing through another herd of idiotic immobiles Sally stopped in front of a blue wall and retrieved Nicole. <br>\r\n \u201cNicole, can you give us any insight to what\u2019s happening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYes Sally. It appears to be a result of the effects of an unknown vegetable discovered by Vanilla Rabbit several weeks ago. Tails was in charge of studying the plant and deduced it made all who consumed it transform into slobs. If just the juices are consumed then the effects are gradual but if the entire vegetable is consumed the subject the effects are immediate. This virus is also very contagious and can be passed on through a fart or a burp of a contaminated individual. Neither of you are safe in this place.\u201d </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally and Julie-Su looked at one another then returned their eyes to Nicole\u2019s screen. Sally gulped and asked a follow-up question. \u201cNicole, is this virus curable and can its affects be reversed?\u201d<br>\r\nNicole began to calculate and after a minute revealed her findings with only one word \u2026</span></div></div>",

FFFRRRTTTTT! That\u2019s \u2026 like \u2026 way \u2026 BBLLLOOORRRP! past \u2026 cool!\u201d<br>\r\nSally and Julie-Su spun around in surprise. They both knew who those words belonged to but what unnerved them was how they were spoken. The person\u2019s voice was very deep and his breathing was very labored. It was then the girls realized that the blue wall before them was in fact a wall of flesh that belonged to none other than the God his maids referred to as <i>Sonic the Hedgeblob!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally and Julie-Su craned their necks upwards to see Sonic\u2019s weight was now almost incalculable. He was so massive neither girl could see his face as his stomach and moobs obstructed it from their view on the ground. His ass had not lost out on its share of weight either and was now the largest part of him. Rising higher into the sky than his head Sonic\u2019s ass was working overtime and constantly sprayed out streams of liquid shit that his worshipers greedily drank with the hopes of one day becoming a Slob God like him. His body was soaked in sweat, making the maids jobs more difficult as they slipped and skidded across his slick, jiggling body as they continued to feed him whatever meal he desired. Food remnants rained upon his fattened form as chewing with his mouth closed had become too much of a hassle and he constantly overstuffed his gaping maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic had become so massive he almost took up Sally\u2019s field of vision. But out of the corner of her eye she spied another mass of red sitting beside her former boyfriend. The Slob God <i>Knuckles the Enormous</i> had grown significantly too but his weight continued to be distributed differently than Sonic\u2019s. His moobs had become so massive they actually began to weigh Knuckles down, forcing him onto his gargantuan stomach in order be comfortable. Of course this sudden movement erased what little energy Knuckles had remaining and he drifted off into a deep sleep that would last for several days if not weeks. Though unconscious Knuckles\u2019 body continued to perform its slobby habits. Drool freely flowed from his mouth as did shit from his rear. As he slept Knuckles dreamed of food of all varieties and began to unconsciously chew. This allowed the maids to continue feeding their slobby god and they knew he would be pleased with them when he woke up even fatter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally could only cup her hands over her mouth as tears rolled down her face. \u201cSonic \u2026 Knuckles \u2026 no.\u201d<br>\r\nJulie-Su was just as saddened by the condition of her love but something else was bothering her also \u2026 two things in particular. Julie-Su journeyed to Knuckles\u2019 chest and examined his right moob. The massive orb of sticky, smelly flesh was the size of a small mansion and completely dwarfed Julie-Su. The former soldier was disheartened by its size and began to run her hands along her own barely there boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never been gifted in the breast department and longed to have a generous chest that rivaled Rouge\u2019s. She was the smallest out of anyone she knew and now her even boyfriend was bigger than her! She was very unhappy with this. She had come down with a major case of boob envy and openly pouted. Then a thought flowed into her mind. If the virus infected her she could naturally grow the chest she always wanted and then some. She was hesitant at first but the more she thought about it the more and more it sounded like a good idea. \u201cAfter all, Nicole said there\u2019s no way to stop this thing, so why keep resisting?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The maid gasped in surprise and blasted Julie-Su in the face with a horrid fart. The stench was so powerful Julie-Su was thrown back and collided against one of Knuckles\u2019 massive man-boobs. Bouncing off of her man\u2019s chest meat Julie-Su ran back into town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was absolutely giddy as she felt herself begin to change as she ran. She had eaten earlier in the day but now felt as if she hadn\u2019t eaten in days. She also began to perspire with ever step she took, even though she was travelling only a block and a half to her favorite fried chicken restaurant. Dashing into the restaurant Julie-Su leapt over the counter and greedily began to feast on anything she could get her hands on. Greasy residue from torn chicken skins coated Julie-Su\u2019s face as she tore into her tasty meal without any tact. She scooped handfuls of french-fries into her mouth with her less than delicate fingers and those that escaped her grasp fell into her growing cleavage that strained against her vest. It seemed with every bite she took the echidna was adding more weight to her softening body. Her toned and muscular body that came from her years of military training was erased after only the first bucket of chicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer natural arm and legs had grown beefier while her rounding stomach pressed uncomfortably against her vest. What she was the most concerned about were her boobs and she was elated to discover they had grown as well.<br>\r\n\u201cUURRRPPP! Well, that was tasty, but it\u2019s still not good enough.\u201d Julie-Su commented as she cupped her slightly larger boobs and gave them a playful squeeze.

Sally was horrified what Julie-Su had said and tried to flee but the Food-mo-tron would not allow it. As soon as Sally bolted towards the door several hoses extended from Food-mo-tron\u2019s body and in a flash were wrapped around Sally\u2019s wrists and ankles. No matter how hard she struggled Sally could not break free from the binds and could only watch in horror as a feeding hose was slowly approaching her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally screamed and attempted to call for help but there was no one even smart enough to comprehend what was going on, let alone mobile enough to save her in time.  Julie-Su just grinned and drooled as the hose came closer and closer to Sally\u2019s mouth. As a final act of defiance Sally shut her mouth and refused to open her lips. Julie-Su would not let this stand and promptly let out a monstrously smelly fart that also saw several slimy turds escape her dimpled cheeks. Sally could not help but gag at the smell and when she did her fate was sealed. The Food-mo-tron\u2019s feeding hose entered her mouth and began the slobification process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hose muffled Sally\u2019s screams as it began to pump a concoction of fattening liquids like grease, lard, and oils down her throat. Every gulp Sally took added more and more poundage to her formerly athletic body. Her toned stomach was gone in an instant and replaced by a wobbling potbelly that in no time at all ballooned into a full-fledged gut. Her breasts filled and sagged with fat while her thighs and rear plumped and thickened. Sally\u2019s slender face welcomed a set of jowls and several chins that erased her neck from existence. Tears streamed down her face and snot poured from the Princess\u2019 nose as the force of the formula increased. Julie-Su laughed at this, finding the process to be very amusing as Sally rounded then passed the big 4-0-0. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearing 500 pounds of blubber Sally\u2019s body began to alter like her slobbified friends. Sweat streamed from her body like a fire hose that soaked and matted her fur in seconds.  Her B.O. became horrid as a result of the grease and her toe and fingernails grew long and yellowed. Her hair became greasy and dandruff freely fell from her scalp. She began to fart almost constantly, and her expulsions grew louder and smellier every time and made Sally cry even harder. As her teeth began to yellow and rot Sally could feel a good chunk of her intelligence disappear. Battle strategies and tactics were replaced by an empty void of nothingness and her common sense was also beginning to fade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it was over. The Food-mo-tron retracted its hoses and looked on with Julie-Su at its creation. The Princess Sally Acorn who walked into the restaurant was no more and had been replaced by a 950 pound blubbering slob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBBRRUUUURRRRPPPPP!!! Julie-Suuuuuu!

Her entire body would not stop jiggling and puddles of sweat pooled around her feet.

But this virus has given me a way out. Once I'm infected I can just sit on my ever-growing ass and live in a mindless stupor.\"<br>\r\n\"NOOOOO! Stupor bad!

She tipped the scales at 400 pounds, making her the skinniest person in Knothole but she figured it was a good enough start. Fiona\u2019s fingers poked and prodded her blubber and began to fondle her engorged breasts. They were clearly the largest part of her at 40 pounds a piece. And even with their weight her boobs hardly sagged and still retained their roundness. She closed her eyes as she began to rub her nipples when she felt something wet. Opening her eyes Fiona realized her massive milkers were starting to milk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh!\u201d Fiona gasped and looked at Sally who was staring intently at her breasts. She stared hypnotically at Fiona\u2019s assets and Fiona decided to have a little fun and tease her. \u201cCome on, Sally. You UURRRPP! know you want to have a sip. Dig in. FFFRRRPPPTTT!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNooooo \u2026 nooooo \u2026 \u201d Sally cooed, trying to muster some resistance but her stumpy legs were betraying her. With each pathetic step Sally took towards Fiona the more she was drawn to her jigging jugs. Fiona smiled devilishly as she heaved up her right breast up to Sally\u2019s face. <br>\r\n\u201cPlllleeeeeaaaassssse Saaaaaalllllllllly?\u201d Fiona sang mockingly. \u201cThey\u2019rrrrrreeee soooooooo fuullllllll of BLOOORRRP! yummmmmmyyyyy millllllllkkkk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all Sally needed to hear. Kneeling down onto her hands and knees the Princess puckered her lips and latched herself onto Fiona\u2019s fat nipple. Sally sucked like there was no tomorrow as Fiona\u2019s milk flowed down her gullet. The virus had also affected Fiona\u2019s milk. Instead of a rich creamy liquid emerging from her nipple a vile concoction had taken its place. The milk had clearly curdled and chunky from spoilage but Sally did not care. The taste was too delicious to give up. What Sally did not know was the effect Fiona\u2019s milk was having on her obese body. With every drop of milk Sally guzzled her body grew even fatter. After only a few gulps she had passed 1,110 pounds of blubber with no end in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona giggled with glee as pulled her emptied right breast from Sally\u2019s mouth and replaced it with her left. Much to her surprise Fiona\u2019s breast refilled itself with even more rotten milk than before in the blink of an eye. And as an added bonus Fiona\u2019s breasts grew larger after each refill. Fiona was overjoyed with this development but Sally did not notice. She moaned lustfully with her eyes closed as she greedily drank from Fiona\u2019s breasts. Her mind was now a complete haze. Her thoughts of resistance were lost to the vast emptiness that was now occupying her mind.<br>\r\nShe just kept sucking and sucking and sucking until the sound of Fiona\u2019s voice managed to break though her mental bliss. Okay Sally. That\u2019s enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally\u2019s eyes slowly opened to see Fiona standing atop a sea of brown, looking at her with her mouth hanging wide open. Her breasts were four feet in diameter and hung down to her dimpled knees but it was clear that was not the cause of Fiona\u2019s shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally attempted to turn around and see what had caught Fiona\u2019s eye but quickly discovered she was unable to move! \u201cWha? Ugg! Nuuuughhhh BURRP!\u201d Sally muttered as she tried to move again but quickly grew exhausted from her effort. What the Princess could not see were the results of her pig-out on Fiona\u2019s milk had on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had grown absolutely MASSIVE! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down on her monstrous stomach, Sally\u2019s breasts had grown enough to rival Knuckles\u2019 moobs and her ass was even bigger than Sonic\u2019s. The two dimpled orbs hung in the air, jiggling rhythmically as a river of constant crap and piss flowed down her underside. Her arms and legs had been swallowed up by the rest of her flab and all that remained were her morbidly-obese fingers and toes that she could barely wiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuuh? Huh? Wha? Guuuh?\u201d Sally muttered incoherently as drool pooled out of her mouth and into her gigantic cleavage below. The Princess\u2019 mind could just barely comprehend what had happened, let alone form a word. Sally Acorn was no more and was now a true Slob Queen whose poundage rivaled that of Sonic and Knuckles. She had become a sweating, shitting, stupid, immobile, 15,900 pound blob of endless jiggling fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Fiona was loving every minute of it. \u201cOh baby! I can\u2019t believe how hot you are!\u201d Fiona squealed as she ran her fingers through her oily hair. \u201cBut BLUP! We\u2019re not done yet!

Tipping the scales at 950 pounds the echidna gasped for breath with every step she took. Her boulder of a belly dragged on the ground and her massive mammeries swung back and forth with every laboured breath she took. Her mammoth ass was covered in cellulite and the insides of her checks were slimy from her frequent waste expulsions. Flab hung from her arms and on her face a greasy, zit-covered third chin was beginning to form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie-Su? You're BURP! a slob too? Fuck yeah!

The fat fox rolled her eyes at the pathetic sight in front of her and slowly lumbered her bulk towards Julie-Su. Grabbing one of her milkers in her sausage-like fingers once again she shoved her nipple into Julie-Su's mouth when she let out another disgusting belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, shut the hell up BURP! and drink!\" Fiona moaned as Julie-Su eagerly began to gulp down Fiona's disgusting breast milk. Like Sally before he Julie-Su's body grew at an exponential rate, growing from morbidly obese, to hyper obese, to ultra obese, to blobbish in less than ten minutes. Fiona was less patient with Julie-Su than she was with Sally and as soon as her breasts were almost emptied she yanked them away. She still wanted to keep some of her milk for herself so she too could transform into a beautiful blob of fur and flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Julie-Su's eyes fluttered open she was overjoyed to discover she was only 500 pounds lighter than Sally. But her joy turned to anger when she discovered her treasure boobies had barely grown! All of Fiona's milk had turned Julie-Su into a massive slob blob but almost all of her weight had gone to her belly and rear! Her boobs had only gone up by a single cup size at best! <br>\r\nJulie-Su freaked out and her tantrum returned with a vengeance. Her immobile form jiggled pathetically as she screamed and cried until she puked up Fiona's spoiled milk and expelled chunky diarrhea from her literal ton of an ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona felt a little bad for Julie-Su's situation but she did not want to spend any more time slobbing up anyone else up.

All they had found was a mere gem. It was blue, pebble-like and felt like it was made out of plastic, so this was obviously no Chaos Emerald, and Silver and Blaze weren't very happy of course. They'd returned home and were discussing about the gem; Blaze about what it could possibly be, and Silver about the ways in which he wanted to dispose of the trinket. \"I don't think it'd fit in the toilet, Silver\", pleaded Blaze. \"Surely it could make the fireplace look better?\" Silver squinted at the gem. \"I dunno\", he muttered. \"But either way I wanna get rid of this thing. Smash it, maybe. Knowing the cheapness of those ruins there's probably candy inside or something.\" He was messing around with it in his hands, coming to terms with how it felt when suddenly he noticed something strange- the the gem perfectly fit the circle in the palm of his glove!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Immediately he stopped complaining and had his eyes focused on the jewel. Blaze was confused and asked, \"What on earth are you doing?\" Silver whispered, \"No idea... but come to think of it there's something about this gem that just feels strange... Focusing my psychic powers on it... Nngh..\" No sooner did he say this that the gem suddenly flashed and disappeared in into his hand. Before either of the two could say anything, Silver suddenly fwoomphed up with fat, until he was the size of the room. Blaze had retreated over to the edge of the room, but even then she was merely inches away from Silver's newly acquired paunch. He sighed and said, \"Don't tell me that stupid gem did this to me...\" Blaze was about to reply but she had a feel of his belly. It was soft, and all of a sudden the memories started coming back to her- of a time when, lead by her cat instinct, she had always desired a very soft bed, but she'd repressed this personal quest as she had begun to mature. Now she couldn't stop thinking about it again, how could she now she had what she was looking for right in front of her?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe climbed up onto Silver and was amazed by the softness and how deep he sank into him, but what particularly caught her eye was his now massive mane, which looked very fluffy and warm. She dived into it without hesitation, much to Silver's shock, and she swam about in it before settling down, purring and pawing at it. Silver blinked and asked, \"B-Blaze? What was that you were doing?\" Blaze yawned and said, \"Nothing really.. I've gotta say though, this is quite an improvement for you, Silver.. You're my perfect bed...\" Silver blushed from being referred to as a material object and tried shaking her out of his mane in protest but his fur was too thick for him to do so- Blaze however could enter and leave it as she pleased. Blaze kissed him on the cheek and murmured, \"What d'you say about staying like this for much longer, my big cute bed?\" Silver rolled his eyes and growled under his breath, \"I... am not... a bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then grinned and tried removing her from his mane with his psychic powers, this time succesfully- she was now dangling just a foot above him in his teleknetic hold. She whimpered and tried reaching down for his fat body again. Silver laughed but when he started to see tears well in her eyes he knew he had to make a decision fast...</span></div></div>",

Was it still evening, or was she sleeping all through the night? She shrugged; it didn't matter. There was nothing she had to do today - no world to defend, no disputes to settle, not even a cat up a tree she had to help. All that mattered to her now was her brand new bed. She panned her head upward to look at his face, and smiled at what she saw. His face had become a round, doughy ball ringed with spines, its softness and smoothness lending it a near-cherubic charm. His relaxed expression and closed eyes only made him look more adorable, like a great big teddy bear that had somehow gone to sleep. Reaching out, she gently stroked his soft, spongy cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReadying herself for another snooze, Blaze stretched... and felt a strange, rubbing sensation along her back. Looking up, she saw she was inches away from the ceiling. Blaze looked back at Silver, puzzled. He didn't gain any weight while I slept, did he? she thought to herself. Carefully so as not to wake him, Blaze crawled down his sloping waist, noticing how little he had gained after that spurt, if anything. There was still no risk of the room falling apart at the seams. As she reached out for the floor, she gaped for a moment when her paw grasped at thin air. Silver, and she, were levitating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling back up, Blaze looked back at Silver's face and pondered. She was always accustomed to his telekinetic capabilities, but they always required a conscious effort. She examined his face closely; there was no strain there. There didn't seem to be evidence of any activity save for a gentle nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still got it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze jumped. Her head darted from side to side. She knew she heard Silver's voice, but the great big bed of a hedgehog had not twitched a facial muscle, let alone move his lips. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sorry. Couldn't... Ted to... 'f I... mind...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at his smiling, sleeping face. Telepathy, she thought, and it seemed he was just getting to grips with the basics; the second message was weaker and less distinct, like static on a radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. With his new-found immobility, of course he would rely on his telekinesis! No skin off my nose, she thought, as she curled back on his warm, fluffy mane and went back to sleep.</span></div></div>",

He could not stop himself from smiling at her; he couldn't recall a time when she looked so peaceful and relaxed. Years spent fighting Iblis had wearied her - wearied them both. He chuckled to himself; he had not counted on immobility and a bed being their reward. He shrugged as far as he could. If Blaze was happy, he supposed he would learn to live with it. Her approval had certainly helped him feel better, at the very least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought to himself as he sat in mid-air. His reflexive levitation had certainly not escaped his notice. He could feel the air beneath him, supporting him with minimal effort. No, he realised. Not even that. It did not take the slightest effort at all to maintain his altitude. He could not even remember when he decided he wanted to levitate. Suddenly, he could! He wondered to himself barely thirty minutes ago how he was going to move and, more specifically, how much more would he need to rely on his telekinesis to do so. Looking around, he grinned. Apparently, he thought, not as much as he had feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver looked around, pondering to himself. Propulsion briefly flashed into his mind, when a sudden burst of movement knocked him out of his reverie. Blinking, he saw a shallow, wide indentation in the wall, and a coating of plaster on his belly. He gaped; he must have hit the wall at 100mph! His eyes darted from left to right. He had to think of something, find anything, that could fix that wall. Breathing heavily, he looked back at the wall, hoping to calm down enough to find a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he could only find the indentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver blinked. He looked around; all he could see was a pristine wall. He was certain his belly had damaged it. He gulped. Something was not quite right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurrowing his brow, Silver decided...</span></div></div>",

Blaze had some pretty strong memories from her own planet, yet felt that what with Nega's obsession with the parallel world and all the friends she'd made there, she'd be better off there. Taking the Sol Emeralds with her, she managed to teleport over to Mobius with no qualms or dimensional rips to give her trouble. Yet, she wasn't entirely sure just where she had landed; it looked familiar, but then again, most of this planet was littered with dozens of loop-de-loops and checkered soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Blaze realized she had no idea where she had even sent herself to. Running around the landscape a bit, she was a wits end to find any familiar faces, even the unfriendly ones. She eventually found a collapsed log and decided to take a break, contemplating how she'd find her way out of this fairly generic forest-like Zone. She didn't have to; flying far above her in the distance was an annoyingly familiar pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, any help is good help, I guess.\" With a running start, she sprinted for the closest spring and hurled herself high into the air until she could meet the good doctor face to face. Instead, she found it was empty. Deciding to jump into the complex machinery rather than plummet to her doom, she fell into the comfy driver's seat... And was immediately strapped in, before she could even react. Blaze desperately looked around for another floating vehicle, or somebody standing below her, but curiously found that she was still deserted. Despite her struggling and a few well-placed fireballs, the straps refused to budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until a hologram zapped up from the dashboard of the pod that any other action happened; and what it had to tell Blaze wasn't going to make matters any better.</span></div></div>",

Whatever wasn't deep fried glistened like jewels; large chunks of gummy candy, marshmallows and chocolate oozed out of the crevices of the junk heap of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to top it all off, Blaze's mouth started to drool. Half submerged in the pile, she'd been too engrossed in surveying her surroundings to notice a large amount of saliva had been running down her mouth and onto her top. \"Eh...

Immense and what she would soon find to be forever unsatisfiable hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only a vague part of her subconscious protesting, Blaze started to literally dig into the pile, shoveling messy handful after mess handful into her mouth which hung wide open, barely noticing the stains appearing all over her clothes. \"Oh god, this CAN'T be happening!\" <i>Oh god, I need MORE!</i> With every stray thought of protest that popped up, another opposite thought seemed to appear and envelop the first, keeping Blaze absentmindedly set on devouring all that was in front of her. Within a few hours, she was already stretching the seams of her tights, having already blown a hole through her putrid farts. Again, her mind seemed a war zone of opinions. \"Oh man, this is disgusting! What am I doing!?\" <i>Louder! Brasher! Ranker!

It currently fought a losing battle with not just her belly, but her swelling, breasts which tore at the fabric whenever she moved.

Actually, 'apathetic' isn't quite the right word; after sitting down with a heavy thud in front of her personal sickeningly sweet and greasy feast, she bit her lip and with a slight grunt, forced out a thick river of what remained of what the fat cat had gorged on earlier. Ending with a wet fart, Blaze sighed as her <i>other</i> personal pile steamed behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maaaaan, that felt <i>good.</i>' She thought to herself, as she lazily swiped at some chips, chewing through the bag and all out of simply not caring about what she ate, as long as she was eating. Her digestive systems started to kick into gear, and unbeknown to the once regal cat (though even if she did, in this state she wouldn't do anything about it), the fat-cells within her body started to kick into gear at the mere sight of food within her stomach, spreading into her head and, to an even greater extent than the previous day, making Blaze's obvious physical changes seem less of an inescapable fact to her, and more of a... Necessity. A goal, something Blaze didn't so much have to simply wait to come to her, but something she wanted to strive for. Whatever had happened to her earlier, and indeed, describing anything else about Blaze would be irrelevant when describing the quickly growing, lumpy purple cat from now on; the only purpose in life she had now was to eat eat eat, and only in the most disgusting manner as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as a side-effect of her changing mental state, Blaze <i>loved</i> every minute of it. As her body continued to expand and approach the size and shape of a blob, her furry flesh further pushing against the tattered remains of her clothes and shoes, the only beads of sweat from over-exertion developing where Blaze had had to move her arms and and maw her food and her dimpled cheeks quivering with her frequent eruptions, Blaze was forever experiencing the most intense moment of pure joy. If anything even slightly negative popped into her clouded mind as she gorged and stank her way through her seemingly endless feast, pure elation would somehow instantly envelop it, leaving Blaze in an even greater state of euphoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was however a downside from Blaze's perspective of her current situation. However delicious, or at least edible this tower of junk was in front of her near-sedated and sweaty form, it wouldn't last forever. And when this pile reached its end, Blaze would be in something of a pickle if she felt like satisfying her new, ridiculously self-indulgent lifestyle. Or perhaps not: it wasn't long before the cat simply collapsed from exhaustion of moving her mouth for so long, and with a small tremor whose epicenter was her heavy backside, fall into a heavy slumber, a river of saliva soon gushing out of her open mouth. Yet somebody else was quickly approaching the same clearing Blaze slept in, incidentally intent on solving the mystery of where a foul stench which was forcing out the rest of the forest's wildlife was coming from. When the brave adventurer finally reached their answer, Blaze awoke to see, significantly smaller than her and clenching their petite nose... </span></div></div>",

Eying Blaze a bit closer (though still maintaining her distance from the cat's waste pile), she realized she didn't seem to be in any form of discomfort whatsoever. When Blaze started to slowly fill her mouth with some of the junk pile's food as she waited for Amy to speak again, she could swear by Blaze's jolly face, for some unfathomable reason, she was <i>enjoying</i> all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Blaze asked, some food debris falling out of her mouth as she spoke with half a chewed up cake still inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I'm not enturely sur whut to say Blase-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a stifled fart, Blaze sat upright and rolled her eyes. \"Amy, I can hardly make out what you're saying with your nose pinched like that. C'mon, remove the hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehog grimaced a bit, yet knew if she wanted to get to the bottom of all this, she'd have to be (somewhat) complacent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Blase! You steenk! Holf the woods reek of that shet pile behind yu!\" Amy yelled, too far in disbelief still to realize she'd perhaps been a bit too blunt with the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze crossed her pudgy arms and held her nose up at Amy, wearing a frown which was mostly concealed by her bloated cheeks. \"Hmph! I don't see why I should give you the time of day then-  <i>I</i> don't smell anything... Just talk normally!\" Blaze remarked. While she was irked by Amy's sudden awkwardness around her, she wasn't exactly sure why the pink hedgehog refusing to breath or smell any of her scent was annoying her more than anything else. It wasn't like she could blame her for not wanting to catch a whiff of the mess she'd caused, yet something in her mind seemed to keep egging her on to get the hedgegirl to remove her pinching fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n... She was also fairly weirded out that this trivial action seemed more important to her now than stuffing her face was earlier for some inexplainable reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Fione then, but yu o me!\" With a long hesitation and beads of sweat rolling down the sides of her face, Amy removed her clenched fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Hopefully I can get through all of this crazyness without having to breath. Or smell... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Aaaand take a whiff!</i>\" Blaze said with a smirk, smug with the knowledge that soon this girl would have to embrace her personal filth and then... Erm... Blaze was still scant on information as to why any of this was important. Yet she was too close to breaking Amy down to really contemplate the foreign voice in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Clenching her teeth and shooting Blaze a fierce glance, Amy's nose twitched as she took in the smallest possible sniff she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Blaze's wish for Amy to simply use her nose in her presence didn't seem to be important at all. Yet before Blaze could think to apologize to her, gluttony kicked back into gear and she was back gorging on the pile in front of her, unaware that on the other side, with eyes slightly glazed over as if in a hypnotic trance, somebody else was now preparing to join Blaze in her little meal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Blaze shifted herself as to better reach her source of ecstasy, lying flat on her exposed purple belly which was sweating so badly at this point a puddle was already begining to trickle out of her deep rolls of girth, Amy simply stood in front of the same food pile, next to Blaze, with a growing hypnotic stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Gluttony. You want it. Ohhhh, you want to indulge yourself, Amy. You've ALWAYS wanted to indulge yourself, and now, you have all the motivation you need.</i>' With only a slight twitch to show Amy's subconscious resisting these new foreign thoughts, the same voice within Blaze was barely missing a beat in wrecking havoc within the hedgegirl's mind. '<i>Take a look at your friend! Doesn't she seem happy? Blissful even? C'mon, one bite, and if you don't like it, we can go! I <b>promise</b>.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug in answer to the soft yet authoritative voice taking residence in her head, Amy stuck her hand into what was now a blended, melted mixture of cakes, candy and anything else that had been deemed similarly fattening. Raising this sticky clump of soft chocolate cake, with what looked like half a bag of icing dumped on top and residue from several other items of junk food, she took a bite. Not surprisingly, much like Blaze earlier it was the longest she spent on a single mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, Amy was simply standing in front of the pile as her hands flew into a frenzy, shoving almost more food into her eager mouth then it could fit. Her stomach was already begining to ever-so-slightly swell up; every bite seemed to be digested nearly instantly as to put on just that little bit extra plumpness on the girl's frames. When her legs eventually got tired, she merely sat down and dragged small piles of disgustingly sweat treats into her lap, ramming her face well into the horde to vacuum up anything in eating distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as anyone would expect with a digestive system working over a dozen hours faster than it should, Amy's behind was quickly met with more than a bit of extra padding; a growing pile of steaming personal waste was erupting from between her cheeks every half-hour. Amy, much like Blaze, was not even near a mental state to consciously acknowledge that she was soiling herself and expelling more gas then she had years before combined, let alone form an opinion on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet while Amy was well onto her way joining Blaze in slothful euphoria, the purple cat herself was slowly running out of steam. Or, more exactly, the ability to move her arms far enough to stuff her face. There was a plus to this however, since the less sugary fuel she was feeding herself, the less fuel the alien thoughts within her raptured mind had over her personality. By the time Blaze was down to simply wiggling a few sausage fingers stuck beneath a heavy blanket of purple fur, she had started to 'wake up'. Looking around a bit dazed, a thundering roar a few yards down her large figure fully brought her back to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Oh dear...\" Shifting her bulk with all her might, Blaze was able to sit upright, yet found her high-heeled feet were trapped in huge logs of bulk with tattered remains of her tights, which she realized with reluctance were her once agile legs. \"I'm completely pinned down.... What exactly happened here?\" She examined her entire body, raising an arm half a foot before having to let it drop due to its weight onto her exposed yoga-ball sized breasts resting on her gushing belly. \"Wait, I know... Crap... I could at least go for being brainwashed if I didn't have to keep the memories I had in the duration.\" As if on cue on her remark, her tail raised to signal a large log of poop pushed between her cheeks. \"And didn't have to keep a permanent reminder... Say, Amy was here at one point! She can do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her swollen chubby head side to side, Blaze quickly noticed Amy undergoing the same treatment she was no less than 5 minutes ago. \"Ffffffffffu- Wait a sec, I can wake her out of this! Sorry Amy, but this may burn your hair a bit!\" With a click of her chubby fingers, Blaze concentrated on Amy's pile of food, quickly setting it alight. To her relief, Amy recoiled at the event, Blaze taking the opportunity to wake her out of her hypnotic curse.</span></div></div>",

A few loud screams which were greatly muffled by the pile was all Blaze could hear for a minute, before Amy slowly started to get up. Dress, hands and face covered in a thick layer of dripping excrement, Amy wiped her eye's clean to give Blaze one of the coldest stares she'd ever been able to muster. Without even bothering to clench her nose at this point, she unleashed one of the loudest and longest bouts of profanity  and death threats directed solely at the fat cat Blaze had ever heard, and being queen of her own world had forced her to put up with quite a bit of strife before hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 15 minutes, Amy sat panting in front of Blaze, wearing herself out simply through hating somebody so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blaze stared at Amy for a moment, she felt a deep mixture of pity, embarrassment and confusion as she started to recount how she'd wound up in this bizarre state in the first place. As she opened her drooling mouth to apologize, all of these natural emotions suddenly seemed to be sucked out of her, becoming replaced by a combination of arrogance, smugness and the returning feeling of unsatisfiable yet elusive hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, you know how I can get...

I could really go for some deep fried hedgegirl smothered in chocolate...\" She started to genuinely drool at the thought, which prompted Amy to nod her head in compliance frantically. \"Well then, get to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze clicked her chubby fingers again, and Amy glumly set off to 'care' for the fatty feline.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Amy set to work reluctantly, Blaze somehow managed to kick her excessive binging to even greater heights. Entire armfuls of now stale chips were simply vacuumed up by the now constantly sweating cat, only pausing to cough up a few large globs of food when several pounds of pure food was too much for her throat to handle in one go. Naturally as Blaze\u2019s new\u2026 \u2018assistant\u2019, Amy was required to gather up any and all saliva-drenched debris and stuff them back into her never-relenting mouth. Having to wade in now disturbingly knee-deep fuzzy flab and being assaulted with enormous burps when she finally reached the cat\u2019s beaming face did little to make her life any easier. There were even a few times where there was so much debris Amy scooped up to feed back to Blaze that the ravenous feline had accidently wrapped her mouth around Amy\u2019s arms, noticing only when Amy seemed to be taking longer to feed her then usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for some time, Blaze\u2019s and Amy\u2019s new\u2026 Arrangement ending its first day with a very tired, panting Amy and a very satisfied Blaze, lying her chubby face back into a few furry neck-rolls as the rest of her body continued to ooze out, her sheer immensity keeping her warm against the cold of night. The bubbling and ever growing steaming \u2018mud\u2019 pile as she liked to call it also helped keep her cozy, even if the smell was still pungent enough to force Amy to pant and wheeze from laborious feeding on the opposite side of the pile. Noticing this as Blaze\u2019s more intelligible, but not necessarily more in-character traits started to remerge in her mind, Blaze waggled her chubby index-finger, still damp from all the saliva and food the glove it was wrapped in had handled, towards the pile, aiming for where she assumed Amy would be lying down exhausted. And just as she had guessed, a large shriek and a panting Amy was soon standing in-front of her (which was a few metres away from her head, due to her extended belly), conflicted with anger and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look cold Amy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gave Blaze a curious look, instantly knowing something was up if this blimp of a cat girl was focused enough to talk to her. \u201cYes. Very\u2026 Cold.\u201d She said as she patted out the remaining embers on her pink hair. Yet she actually was freezing; she\u2019d sweated so much from Blaze\u2019s intense slave driving it was as if she\u2019d gone swimming. Her BO would\u2019ve also been alarming if it weren\u2019t for her only companion\u2019s ludicrously offensive\u2026 \u2018Fragrance\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then\u2026 Why not sleep in here for the night?\u201d With some noticeable straining and clenched teeth, Blaze moved one of her bulbous arms just to point down to her sprawling purple belly, damp with wet with several dozen different rivers of half-chewed remains of the junk food pile next to them. Amy hesitated for a moment, knowing full well this was simply a command disguised as a request. \u201cEh, and if I don\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfffft, I\u2019m not still mad, Amy! I won\u2019t hurt you or anything! I\u2019ll just shove you down back for the night, if you catch my drift. Or whiff. Heh, get it? Eh, Amy?\u201d Yet the pink hedgehog didn\u2019t need any more encouragement to start immersing herself in the cat\u2019s enormous belly right up to her head, annoyed that for however disgusting this entire scenario was, she did make a pretty comfy bed. As she eventually fell to sleep, with a think trickle of Blaze\u2019s sweat tickling her backside, Amy wished that whatever the means, something would get them out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and Amy?\" Blaze asked just as Amy was about to doze off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhh... Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cleaning duties start tomorrow. Just thought you'd want something to look forward to! G'night!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Espio opened the door to the building forcefully. He'd been away from the agency for about a week due to having to train a little with his sensei, but he was looking forward to getting back on the job and earning some wages. As soon as he shut the door behind him, he noticed a small note on the noticeboard to the left. Snatching it with curiosity, Espio held it up to his face to read. It went as follows;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Espio,<br>\r\n          Gone away to Mighty and Ray for summer holidays. I'll be back in three months. Vector knows already, so I just wrote this for you.<br>\r\n                          Charmy'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, that figures. I thought it was unusually quiet around here\" Espio remarked, before crumpling the note in his hand. He tossed it into the waste basket as he walked through to the office. \"Good evening Vector\" he called out in no particular direction. \"I have returned to resume my duties as a Chaotix member, I do hope you don't mind the overrun, the results came a little late.\" Slinging his bag of equipment down on the deck, Espio opened up his locker and began to file the documentation into the fire bow he owned. Following this, he took out the scrolls oout of the bag and placed them upon the top shelf where they belonged. Then, he rummaged through his weapons to put back on their hooks. He had all sorts; Shuriken, Kunai, Sai, poison darts...\"Vector, are you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Espio finally realised that his boss hadn't responded to him at all, nor was he anywhere to be seen. \"Maybe I should leave the sorting for later...\" he murmured before running full pelt around the lower floor of the agency. No matter where he looked however, there was no sign of Vector. In a flurry of concern, he dashed upstairs and checked on Vector's bedroom. \"Oh no!\" Espio gasped as he took a gander. There were clear signs that there had been some sort of struggle in here, the furniture looked like it had been hit by a bomb! Espio deduced that Vector had been abducted unwilling, and sighed in helplessness as he knew he couldn't do anything about it until morning. \"Can't call Charmy at these late hours. Might as well get some sleep before mounting a rescue mission\". He slowly made his way to his own bedroom, removing his shoes and gloves when he got there, where he climbed into bed hoping his worries weren't enough to keep him awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Unfortunately, as he was close to drifting off, a sharp whistling noise forced him to sit up straight, his paranoia obviously uncomfortable. \"What was that?\" he whispered to himself. Clambering out of bed, he grabbed a nearby torch and shined it towards the door. Seemingly, there was no one there, but that didn't stop him from being suspicious. 'I don't like this at all...oh well, I do need my rest' Espio thought, before turning around. When he did, he felt a fierce brushing on his arm. \"Hey man, get that light outta my face!\" a jawed figure winced before crashing to the floor. \"Crocodilians! Three of them!\" Espio shouted as he saw the identity of the figures that had entered his room before. He low kicked the one he'd blinded before jumping to the wall. \"You must be the ones who abducted Vector, dishonourable fiends!\" He climbed up the wall and grabbed a second goon with his tails. \"Mmph, you're kinda heavy even for a croc. Lose some weight, please.\" With a powerful lash, he tossed the goon across the room and knocked him out, and gracefully fell to the floor himself. \"Come to think of it, you could stand to improve the hygiene too. Now where is that third...\" he managed to monologue, until he felt a sharp pain in his arm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Espio let out a scream of agony as he felt a numb sensation spread up his arm. He spun around to face the third goon, who had managed to inject some sort of substance into his body. \"We're sorry about all this, chameleon, really we are.\" he apologised profusely to Espio, who hissed with rage in response. \"It's just that you're wanted elsewhere, and this is the easiest way to transport live goods\". Espio growled, before attempting to retort. \"Live goods? Do you know how disrespectful that sounds? I don't care if...I'm numb, I shall make sure...you pay dearly for...your...your...\" Espio struggled, before collapsing on the floor unconscious. \"It ain't no big deal chameleon, it's only tranquiliser\" the goon responded before picking up Espio and hoisting him on his shoulder. Before he could move out, a shadowy feminine figure glided in, looking over the limp body of the chameleon she desired. \"How touching of him to care so much about his friend! The poor dear needn't worry so much; he'll be joining him in our ranks soon enough...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Espio had a headache as he came around. For a while, his eyes couldn't focus, and all he could do was mumble groggily. \"Ooh...goodness, my head...what happened\" he moaned as he tried to focus on his surroundings. As the sight grew clearer, he had a new question on his mind. \"Huh...wait, where am I?\" He peered around more. He was strapped to a chair, it was like a lounge chair only with metal cuffs to keeps his arms and feet restrained at an odd angle. The rest of the room was made of steel, and appeared cold, intimidating.  Before he could be left alone to his thoughts any longer, a slender female crocodile slinked into the room, unbeknownst to him the same person that had been in the agency last night. She was backed up by at least seven crocodilian goons. \"Greetings, chameleon, to my modest fruition of lifelong dreams! I do hope you are comfortable in that seat, I ordered the workers to make it extra plump for your relaxation benefit. And over there is my state-of-the-art security system, to make sure you are safe and well during...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Her voice trickled to a whisper as she noticed Espio's inattentiveness. Espio had instead observed something else about her; she was the most beautiful woman he'd ever laid his eyes on! Her proportions were just right, her delicate and expensive clothing oozed effortless chic, her aqua eyes radiated an underlying naive innocence, he was almost salivating at the sight. The female cleared her throat, knocking Espio back to his senses. \"Please, chameleon, I am not some sort of beauty goddess. I am merely plain and somewhat ugly Setella, heiress to the kingdom of Reptilia.\" Espio had to glance down and gulp his words after she spoke, desperate to focus on the fact he and Vector had been abducted. \"That is why I brought you here, actually.\" \"Hmm?\" Espio turned back, finally about to get some answers to the whole thing. \"I know that my awful looks won't be able to earn me a man no matter how I try. My suitors all tell me I am wrong and that it is purely me having low self-esteem, but I am sure they are simply trying to be kind.\" Espio rolled his eyes and shrugged. 'Figures that she'd be fickle,' he thought. \"Instead, I have not set my sights for the hunks. No, I am after the kind of man I want; a slob. A lazy, dumb slob who will love me unconditionally and allow me to cater to them for their whims! I want the perfect crocodilian lover!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hold on a second!\" Espio yelled, derailing her expositional monologue. \"You say you want the perfect crocodilian lover. For one, why pick on me when I'm not a crocodilian? For another, how would you know if they are obedient?\" Setella grinned from earhole to earhole, unsettling Espio. \"Well, I originally did want that only, and I found him...the perfect one!\" \"Vector?\" Espio quickly interjected. \"Yes, your best friend. I was going to take him and just leave it at that but...when I was doing the research on how to snag him...I found out about you and...I thought you were just too cute to leave to waste, so I decided that I'd get both of you to provide the perfect duo!\" Espio recoiled at her enthusiasm. \"You want me to be part of your love affair? Why would I agree to do that when I'm not a slob?!\" he cried. \"Although you are pretty delicious eye candy...\" he whispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Setella giggled, making Espio really worried at this point. \"Silly chameleon, that is what this machine is for!\" She pulled out a small controller and pressed the brown button on it. In response, a robot came rushing through the security door, and a machine of sorts lower from the ceiling. It appeared to have a television connected to it, as well as a...tube of sorts? \"This room is the brainwashing room of course. To make my lovers, I just send them through this system and they become willing slobs in no time! Would you like to see an example I prepared earlier?\"</span></div></div>",

Well, as he figured, there really wasn't much he could do while he was so restrained. He may as well see what the process he was about to be subjected to did to it's victims. Setella bubbled with glee at his acceptance. \"Goodie, I hoped you'd say yes! Guards, bring in the other lover!\" Four of the goons marched off out of the room. Espio's eyes narrowed in alertness. \"The other lover? You mean...\" \"That is correct,\" Setella interrupted, knowing what Espio was about to ask, \"You searched for your friend yesterday, so now I shall finally reunite you. Oh, it shall be so cute to see you bond again!\" Espio was about to protest that this wasn't what he had in mind, when the doors slid open again with a swish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Vector! W-what have they done to you?!\" Espio yelped in horror. \"Relax, Espio,\" Vector calmly replied, \"It's all good, I love what they've done, and I love being here!\" Indeed, Vector had changed; his once toned stomach was now flabby, with a rather large beer gut. That was the least obvious notable change, however, due to his overpowering body odour which was detectable even from a distance. As he walked, he also wasn't afraid to just let off the gas, pausing every now and then as he approached Espio to force out particularly rancid farts. \"Vector, no offense, but you reek!\" Espio said as Vector sat down next to his restrained friend. \"I know, ain't it totally awesome?\" Vector chirped, putting an arm around Espio's shoulder and bringing him really close to the stench. Espio held back the urge to choke as he tried to knock some sense into his leader. \"Maybe you do enjoy it, but we have to get back to the detective agency! Charmy's out as you know, so if he rings someone has to be there to answer.\" Vector stared at him, perplexed. \"Who's Charmy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Espio's eyes widened in shock. He couldn't believe that Vector could just forget about their third member so easily. \"I see you have come across the other little perk.\" Setella spoke up. Turning to face her again, Espio hissed viciously. \"Aw, do settle down! We have merely rid Vector of the memories that are not special to him, as well as some excess intelligence that hindered him from being truly placated. All that matters to him now are detective things, me, and you!\" Espio's scowl showed his anger at her for messing with his buddy. \"What kind of things are included in 'excess intelligence', may I ask?\" Setella smiled sweetly, once again making Espio nervous. \"Well, there is his mathematic skills, then there is his awareness of his dignity, and then there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She was interruputed when she saw how Vector's facial expression had changed. His eyes were now staring out in the distance, he was away with the fairies. Before their startled eyes, Vector proceeded to lift up his tail and gently push out a soft lump from his rear end. Espio cringed with empathy, while Setella resumed her explanation. \"And then there is toilet training. But enough of all that, I am certain he would rather cater to you than have me drone on about him!\" Setella marched over to the robot and began twiddling away at the control panel. Meanwhile, Vector snapped out of his trance and turned to Espio again. \"Vector, you do know you just...um...\" \"Yeah, I do that all the time. It's really relaxing when it's a bigger load!\" Vector grinned at Espio, who could only muster a hesitant smile. \"Okay then, time to begin with the treatment, boys!\" Setella called over, making Vector giddy and Espio panicked. \"Y'hear that? You're gonna be treated! I don't know what for, but I'm sure you'll feel so much better! \" Espio gulped at Vector's enthusiasm. There was no chance of talking him around now, and things were about to get a whole lot more humiliating. \"Vector, deary, why don't you decide what he's treated for first? You have a choice between external and internal change.\" Vector wanted to help his friend, so he was all too cheerful about choosing Espio's first course of brainwashing, albeit oblivious to the actual process.  </span></div></div>",

Espio could only gaze as the robot finished up and the television made a noise again. \"Subject identified as Espio Chameleon. Status in military; Elite Special. Standard brainwashing procedure is invalid for this rank. Inserting specially produced programme for subject Espio Chameleon.\" The machine whirred once again as the programme was hardwired into the robot, and the television image changed from the dark clinical image to a joyous and happy image of Setella standing in front of a psychedelic background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, this is when the awesome show begins!\" Vector said to Espio. \"They told me that you need to stare at the screen as much as you can for it to work properly, so I'd do it before the robot tazers you into it!\" he cheerily warned. Espio would usually rebel at this point, especially with Vector venting off gas constantly, but for a reason he couldn't explain he felt...compelled to obey. \"Greetings there, cutie!\" the video of Setella called out. \"If you are watching, this means you have been successful in becoming my second lover to be brainwashed!\" Espio daren't tear his head away, not noticing that the real Setella had gone by now, to watch it all in a separate room. \"Let us move quickly now; the robot servant will now feed you a pill of my design. Please eat it and see what it does! The programme will resume once you have produced a satisfactory amount of gas!\" The television flashed off, as Espio stared in confusion. \"Enough gas? Vector, what does she...\" Before he could finish his question, the robot approached him and forced a pill into his hand. \"Subject Espio, please ingest this.\" Espio was reluctant, but with Vector egging him on, he placed the pill upon his tongue. \"Huh, doesn't taste too awful. I could hold it on my mouth and let it fizzle without effect, then I wouldn't be affected!\" He beamed to himself for his cunning...that was until the tube from the machine forced itself into his mouth and shot out a small amount of liquid food! \"Sorry about that pal, forgot to warn you that they wash it down themselves!\" Espio only shook his head as he swallowed what little liquid lingered in his mouth. \"Forgiven. Besides, I don't feel it doing anything to me. Is it a placebo or so--ACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Suddenly, Espio was struck by a strange sensation forming in his gut. \"Oh man, this'll be so cool!\" Vector grinned, Espio unaware due to his discomfort. \"Cool? Really? It just feels painful! Does she want to kill me?!\" Vector didn't reply, instead merely rubbing Espio's gut with his hand. \"Chill homie, just let it out.\" \"Let it out? You mean...like...this?\" Espio, desperate for the pain to stop, went against his pride and let out a very putrid fart. Espio could only sit there in shock, as Vector applauded his effort. \"Nice one, Espio! Hey, you got any gas higher up?\" Espio glared at Vector in annoyance for his enthusiasm for his disgusting outburst. Since he wasn't moaning about it though, he felt comfortable in divulging his urge to belch, as he let a rancid one off in Vector's nostrils. Vector sniffed it gently, happy to see that his friend was responding to treatment so well. \"Ugh, don't ask me to do that again.\" Espio groaned. \"Don't need to, the gas is constant now!\" Vector laughed. To Espio's horror, he was correct; he was inadvertently farting stinkers at an almost continuous rate, almost making a melody with Vector's constant gas, Espio could only wearily accept his fate as he leaned forward to ease it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Just then, the shackles he had been restrained by opened up, and he slipped onto the floor. Moaning in pain from his fall, he climbed back onto the seat, his will too strained to entertain the thought of escaping. \"Congratulations!\" the television announced as Vector talked to Espio about the aches, being unusually alert. \"You have passed the first phase! This next phase will work on you in more invasive ways, I must make you aware.\" Espio rolled his eyes. \"That figures.\" \"Now, this programme is pre-set, so there will not be a choice on what type it is. I will tell you now that is it of the...</span></div></div>",

That doesn't really leave much to the imagination...\" He turned to look at Vectors obese frame, and knew without a shadow of a doubt what they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was my favorite part!\" Vector beamed, bumping Espio in the shoulder with his flabby arm, leaving a large sweat stain on the Chamelon, leaving him to try and clean up as much as he could. \"How could this even be possible? Vector was never this bad before... And what they...\" He cut himself off when he smelled some of his gas he expelled. He sighed \"Being a fat idiot like you isn't something I ever wanted to become.... Or expected you to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVector replied by letting out a big belch in his face before replying. \"Hey its not so bad. Give it a chance\" Espio winced, \"Give it a chance? Are you completely gone in there. The Vector I knew would ne-\" The sound of static interrupted him again. The Second Phase was about to begin, and the TV directed Espio to where he was supposed to sit. He didn't have time to comply or even try and resist, the robots from before dragged him over to the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspio was strapped in a fairly large couch. His legs strapped in to the  base by the two robots, who also took the time to remove his shoes and socks, while Vector waddled over and took care of his gloves. \"Won't need these any more. They'll get too tight.\" Vector explained to him, and quickly swallowed both the gloves he pulled off. Espio did seem to recall that Vector now only had his headphones on his possession. Aside from that he was completely nude. Too big to wear any of his normal attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then saw a podium rise up a few feet in front of him, with a button facing him. \"What is that?\" Espio asked, hoping Vector would answer, but he should have known Vector wasn't in the state of mind to answer anything. So he looked up to the screen, and there Stetella appeared, likely another prerecording, but he knew he would at least get answers from her. \"This is the Completion switch. Once this Button is pressed, Phase Two will end.\" Espio's eyes widened at the statement, and with Ninjalike reflexes, bent forward as fast as he could to press the button before anything could happen, only to he rammed in the face with the large cylindrical tube, shoving him back against the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspio tried relentlessly to force the tube from his face, which was conveniently covering the entirety of his mouth. It was a feeding tube, and he could see the edible mush sliding down the pipe right at him. He clenched his mouth shut to try and prevent it from entering, and instead attempt to reach the button with his arms. Although it was no use, with his back against the couch, his arms were nowhere close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVector sat down next to Espio and laughed. \"That's not going to work, your belly's gonna be the only thing that'll be able to push it now!\" Espio's eyes widened, as he felt the mush pressing against his closed mouth. They expected him to grow THAT big, the button was a good 3 feet in front of him. \"Oh Hang on Espio!\" Vector said in his blissfully unaware state, seeing the stopped up food entering his mouth. He  grabbed Espios jaw and horn, and pulled them apart, forcefully opening his mouth, allowing all of the mush inside of him. Espio almost gagged as the buildup he collected streamed into his mouth, and no matter how hard he tried to shut it again, the choking from the fast intake made that almost impossible, and almost immediately the changes were noticeable. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Almost like a water balloon being filled, Espio was experiencing the same feeling, not only was his belly inflating, but he felt his backside push back against the seat as it continued to expand, his enlarged rear making the flatulence ripple through the fat to escape. \"This is degrading\" Espio thought to himself as mush flowed into his mouth at a constant pace. By this point his belly had extended so much it had fallen into his crotch area and making itself comfortable on the couch as it expanded further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVector grabbed his fat rolls and jiggled them around. \"Hey you're shaping up real nice! Soon you'll be a certified fatass!\" Espio could only try and ignore Vector and the odors he was emitting, along with the invasion of his personal space, but he was already quite big, he could only guess, he'd say he'd be 50 pounds heavier. His arms look like two fat logs, and his belly would make Big the Cat jealous. Even if he could try again, he didn't think he'd be able to even lift his arm to try and press the button. The weight needed to press the button was made for Crocodiles like Vector, and not a Chameleon like Espio. He wouldn't be able to see his feet after this was over, or make use of them. Espio could only block out the events surrounding him and hope that it would soon end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity, he felt his belly press up against something, followed by the loudspeaker announcing. \"Phase Two Complete\" Espio opened his eyes and was horrified by what he saw. His belly had taken up so much room, it was touching the floor and squishing up against Vector, while his Moobs hung down low, close to his arms which were nothing more than fat balloons with hands. He couldnt even see his rear or thighs due to his fat cheeks preventing him from moving his head, but with each fart he felt escape, it traveled up the entire surface of his ass to escape, vibrating all the way. His feet were out of sight too, but he could tell, even if they were visible, they would be no use to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then he saw the door open</span></div></div>",

The slight rumbling from his rear prevented him from forgetting the constant stream of gas escaping him. He knew that whatever Setella had planned, he would be unable to fight it, and as she walked in the room he was thoroughly terrified of what she was going to do to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espio, you seem to be shaping up quite nicely indeed.\" she said to him as she walked over to the contraption and pulled a helmet from the control station, and placed it over Espio's head and strapped it in underneath his triple chin. \"You look so much better, but that attitude of yours...\" She looked at Espios scornful eyes, as it was the only way he could show his disgust at all at this point. \"That Attitude does need fixing.\" She said walking over to the machine and turning it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vector was just like you, but look at him now. He seems to be enjoying himself... and after you were so willing to go along with this. I'd expect you to be more compliant.\" Espio scowled, he never had any intent of actually following through with the conversion, but now that was out of the picture. Soon he'd be a braindead moron like Vector laughing at his own rancid farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetella pulled up Espios brainwaves on the computer and started looking for the Dials she was hoping to manipulate. \"I know this may seem harsh... but it is for the best. Think of how much fun you'll have after this.\" She giggled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call....this.....fun?\" Espio forced himself to say, finding it very difficult to move with his fat cheeks. He was going to attempt to speak again, but the helmet started vibrating over his head, and then he felt something. Something soft. Something wet escaping from his rear. He couldn't turn his head to see, but he knew he was soiling himself. He couldn't help himself and blushed in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetella watched him try and control himself, but no matter what he did, he kept pouring out from the rear. \"It's no use... You've completely forgotten how to control your bowels. And from how much you ate in the other room, it should last for a bit.\" She showed him the proof that she had altered his brain and deleted that skill from his memory. \"While I love my servants as the mindless drones. I love seeing them slowly drift away... Isnt it wonderful?\" Espio forced his hand to move enough to flip her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that certainly isn't very nice.\" Setella responded and went directly back to work. Her next plan of action was to remove his.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From the floor it would be impossible to see his head over the many tons of flab that covered the area. But from an observation room above. Those in charge of the Energy Situation could see the Chameleon in all of his glory. Espio was already on his 7th chin, and his entire face had been swallowed by fat. The only way to tell where his mouth was, is to follow the large hose that seeps in new meals by the hour. Had he been in his right state of mind, eating shit every day would mortify him, but now it seemed completely normal and welcomed. The only time the hose was ever removed was so he could expel a large belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him was a generator, using the gases he expelled to power the facility. From the Generator a large secondary hose could be seen that went into Espio's rear to make sure that no gas escaped to poison the area. This intrusive feature only served as a minor annoyance for him. It was only when the tube was forced to deal with his own Excrement, cycle it out and send it back to Espio's mouth did he notice, and to him it was an endless supply of free meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody else dared enter that room without hazmat suits due to the Odor Espio produced, but his mind was too far broken that the smells in the room were heaven to him. He could live the rest of his life like this and not care in the slightest.</span></div></div>",

This must be the part where...oh no...\" Espio shuddered with the thought of his mind becoming their plaything, not that he had any ideas to prevent it. Vector once again put his shoulder around him, this time able to bring him right up to his torso for comfort. \"Don't worry, Espio! This is the best part, I'm sure you'll love it!\" Vector smiled softly, reassuringly. Espio knew he should have scolded him for his ignorance, but he instead just smiled back, simply thankful for a friend that cared. The robot approached Espio again. \"Please ingest this, subject Espio.\" The robot handed another pill to Espio and he placed it on his tongue. The hose came down shortly after and washed it down his throat. Espio could only wonder what it did as the television came back on. Unlike the last time, there was no Setella or institution details, only a normal television show, it looked like a dumb movie. \"Remember buddy, stare at the television\" Vector repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  At first, it seemed innocent enough. Aside from the fact it was too simple for his tastes, it wasn't particularly having any effect. Some way through, Setella came back into the room to observe them watching. \"Espio, who is Charmy again?\" She asked with coy curiosity. \"Our third Chaotix member. Young, annoying, a bee who likes botany.\" Espio replied. \"Why do you want to know?\" \"No reason.\" Setella lied to him, before ordering the guards to bring them some refreshments. As they kept gazing at the stupidity on the screen, Vector and Espio couldn't help but gorge on the snacks and guzzle down the fizzy drinks as they came in, too focused on the television were they. Hours went by, and the films just got dumber and dumber. Espio was starting to see some entertainment in it all the while. Setella once again asked \"Espio, who is Charmy again?\" which Espio nonchalantly replied \"He's a member of the Chaotix...I think. He's a bee and likes mushrooms. Do you have to keep asking?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As the hours blurred by, things just deteriorated further for Espio. No longer fussed about the stench that emanated, the heat from the activated heaters was increasing his own body odour exponentially. Bits and drips were falling to the floor rapidly, neither reptile having a grip on their eating manners anymore. Espio did scoop some off the floor with his tongue when he lazily peered at them with the corner of his eye. The movies were getting ridiculously stupid now, with simply bimbos and slapstick dominating most of the action. Nonetheless, Vector and Espio laughed away at it like young children, with Espio occasionally making an obvious and stupid comment. Vector was even able to push out another load onto the seat, which Espio stared at for a second before cheerfully smiling at Vector's sigh of relief. Again Setella spoke up, now amused at their adorable bliss. \"Espio, who is Charmy again?\" \"He...or was it a she...well, they do...something...I think they're a butterfly, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  No one was keeping track of the time any more, not that the two detectives could tell the time now. Espio's intelligence and memory levels were rapidly falling to that of Vector's, and he never noticed it. The constant supply of snacks had taken their toll on his body, leaving him with a rather large beer gut. The movies were now of the dumbest level, but Vector and Espio still found them hilarious, which they communicated to each other through their farts and burps as well as their laughter. They were filthy and smelly, without any table manners and unable to prevent letting their emissions escape freely to the surroundings, the smell of which was fresh air to their nostrils. Then, out of the blue, Espio felt some sort of cramp inside his body. Vector noticed him keel, and gazed in excitement. \"Ooh, I think you're about to become one of us now!\" Espio, mustering the last of his intellectual side, could only softly mutter \"Why, Vector?

As his breathing got heavy, he grunted and tried to force the sensation out. After a few minutes of doing this, his mind suddenly switched off. All he was capable of doing was staring obliviously into the distance, not aware of even where he was. When he felt comfortable, he finally lifted up his tail, poised to do the deed. Eventually, much to Vector's joy, a mushy, brown mass emerged from out of his tail hole and onto the seat. Amongst really potent farts, Espio was soiling himself right there, and he didn't care a bit. It turned out to be a big load, to which Espio sighed happily once it was all out of him. Setella spoke up once more after he'd had time to let it sink in to them. \"Espio, Who is Charmy again?\" Espio turned to face her, and looked confused. \"Huh? Um, never heard of this Charmy person. But look baby, I made a big stinky!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Setella's satisfaction at instilling the traits she craved into her two potential lovers was high, to say the least; She giggled gracefully as Vector and Espio reached around the seat in search of more food, completely apathetic to the mess. In fact, every so often, they'd take a whiff of the air just to make sure they were still stinking it up as much as they could. The entertainment would hardly be called that to most people, it was simply videos of the values of a Reptilia citizen, more propaganda for Setella's kind and generous yet twisted and disgusting reign. Nobody minded it though. Certainly, he two newly instated consorts wouldn't. As she watched them eat some moldy scraps, Setella couldn't help but wonder if she had forgotten something that she needed to do for the process. She asked the two reptiles on the seat whether they knew about the missing something. Being simpletons now, they didn't know, nor did they particularly care as long as they could be satiated. She thought about it as she walked towards the door to leave them to it. \"Hmm, I'm sure I'll remember once I get up to the observation room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After a while, the robot reactivated and approached Espio again with more commands and a new pill. \"Please take--\" it was able to blurt out before Espio greedily snatched the pill, threw it into his mouth, grabbed the feeding tube and washed it down himself. He let out a small belch afterwards and lay back on the seat. \"Thank you, subject Espio.\" the robot answered. However, unlike the last times, it was not done at simply giving Espio the treatment. He popped out a second pill and approached Vector this time. \"As both of you are at the same phase of brainwashing, it is now time for you to resume the programme, subject Vector.\" Vector obliged, taking the pill from the robot, placing it in his jaws and waiting for the feeding tube to automatically make its way over to him.  Once it was washed down, he too lay back on the seat, content to chill with his favourite chameleon in the whole world while waiting for the pill to take effect. The robot told them that they were now...</span></div></div>",

I knew I had forgotten something about all this; there will be opposition to my plight from their previous allies, and there are currently no measures in place to counteract them!\" She then thrust the note into the larger guard's hand as she pulled out a device which manually controlled the dronebot by remote. \"It is fortunate then that I already packed just the pills for the occasion then, is it not?\" After a bit of fiddling, the device buzzed intimidatingly. \"Why, the pills I installed are energy pills! When I wanted a more reliable source of energy for my machines, I commissioned my top scientists to come up with a formula that would convert any non-reptilian being into a living, brainless power cell through their methane output. What they produced was a nanoneural override transmitted via being breathed from the air in an excessive quantity!\" The larger guard gasped, even though he had no idea what she meant. The smaller guard, however, recoiled in both terror and amazement as the pieces began to fit together in his head. \"And since your lovers have a constant stream of gas, they can spread it to whoever they pass on their travels! How truly disgusting!\" Setella smiled sweetly as she grabbed a nearby microphone, which was also remotely connected to the dronebot. \"I do not think about how wonderfully horrid it would be for the insignificant rebels, guard. I save that for my treasured citizens.\" The guards nodded to signify that they understood, and hurried out the room. She then flicked the microphone and relayed instructions into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You are now being deployed into the central urban establishment of Mobius\", the drone parroted. \"Once there, you are free to act as you choose towards the useless other urbanites, our workers will be able to deal with them as they arise.\" Espio happily squeaked at the opportunity to be left to work with Vector, while Vector himself had a question for the drone. \"Hate to be pushy, butt I was told there'd be a fattening in the programme. Is that still...?\" The drone moved over to the door of the brainwashing room as it replied back assuringly \"That is correct, but I am afraid there has been a change in the scheduled order. It will be done once the obstacle has been overcome, do not be concerned.\" When the drone was finished, it turned its attention to the security panel, which is overrode with ease. On the other side of the door were a troupe of at least thirty guards, all being led by the two guards that had been with Setella. \"Right blokes,\" the larger one began, \"our dearest Setella has entrusted us in getting you two to your destined co-ordinates in complete safety. Are you completely agreeable to allow us to do this for her?\" He gazed at Vector following this, who responded with an enthusiastic nod and a belch. \"Okay then, and what--\" he turned to Espio to say, only find that Espio was completely spaced out. The guards knew what this meant by now, so they just waited as he pushed out a small pile of waste with a beaming smile. \"I...take that as a yes, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere on Mobius, someone is going about their daily business, unaware that catastrophe was about to strike.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The intoxicating warmth of the sun. The soothing rippling sounds of the ocean. The feeling of soft golden sands beneath a luxurious designer towel. This is exactly why Rouge had made a beeline to this secluded spot once she found an opportunity to get some well deserved R&amp;R. She'd been in overdrive the last few days due to a criminal ring that involved three high-status politicians, and G.U.N. had asked her to spy on one of them to gauge how much of a threat the ring was to the upcoming province elections. Now that it was all over, she simply basked on her stomach in the sunlight as her skin tanned slowly and delicately. \"I should really think about what we're going to have for dinner tonight\" she sighed to herself. \"Can't exactly cook anything elaborate when all Shadow wants to do is recharge. Why does he even call sleep that anyway? I don't get him sometimes...\" Feeling that she'd had enough time to rejuvenate her skin, she slowly edged over onto her back before sitting up. To one side was a bottle of sun lotion and some empty cans of energy drink, which she placed into her heart-shaped shoulder bag. To the other side were some chic pink shades which she opened up and placed over her eyes. \"Goes with the bikini nicely, I should say!\" she admired in the reflection of the water. She then lightly tapped to get the sand out from being trapped between her toes and her boot-inspired sandals  before rising to her feet, ready to pack up and fly home. \"Better make sure this top gal didn't forget anything!\" she smirked before peering around and sorting through things. \"Now let's see, I have the litter, the lotion, my purse, the towel, the parasol, the communicator, the...huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped rummaging to stare in the direction her sensitive ears had picked up a whirring noise, like an aircraft. Sure enough, just a couple of miles away in the sky, a large, green camo helicopter was coming into view. Rouge knew about G.U.N. flight schedule, so she wasn't expecting anything to fly while she was resting. \"That doesn't look like a G.U.N. registered vehicle at all\" she mused. \"Whoever owns that thing must be violating countless military regulations! I guess paying them a visit wouldn't go amiss for them!\" She chuckled as she dropped her bag and crept over to a nearby crevice \"I'll need to wait for that thing to land before I can sneak on board though. If only Omega could see this, he'd shoot it down in seconds.\" The helicopter flew tentatively for a few minutes before hovering about 500 yards from where Rouge was hiding. The driver seemed incompetent to Rouge since the descent to the ground was unsteady at best, going outright unstable when it tipped over too far at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBANG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body of the helicopter suddenly made a sharp drop and hit the ground, seemingly damaging the hull somewhat. It was big enough to take the hit however. Rouge stayed in her place as she waited for personnel to come out of the craft. Sure enough, after a few minutes, about ten crocodilian soldiers marched out of the hull, all with surveying equipment. \"Hey guys, y'sure this is where Setella said to let them go? I thought she wanted to spread the nano-thing, this place looks deserted!\" one soldier spoke up, sipping a cold bottle of vodka after. The large guard from earlier approached him and gave him a backhander to the jaw. \"We can't land a helicopter in the middle of the city, you dope! She told us to land here and then guide the secret weapons to the city. From then we can deal the damage and get us some power cells.\" The smaller guard also from earlier turned to the other crocs and cleared his throat. \"Alright men, we have two hours to set up base here and get the weapons ready. Once they're outside, the city's stability will be on it's knees! Dismissed!\" As the soldier all began to dart around and unpack various doodads to build up some sort of building structure, Rouge thought about what she'd overheard. 'Secret weapons and power cells? They're terrorists, even if they do seem awful at it! I wonder what kind of weapon it is, biohazard? Chemical warfare? What if they're nuclear bombs?!' She worried as she thought about how much damage even the lousiest of idiots could do with a nuclear bomb, but shook herself out of it to focus. \"No matter what they are, I need to get in there and find them.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rouge wasn't known as one of the best spies in the business for giggles. With little effort, she was able to glide and hide past several croc soldiers, who were all too busy stressing over building the base in the allotted time to look out for any intruders, especially when they thought the place was desolate. \"How cute, they seem like such well-behaved goody do-goods\" Rouge whispered as she slinked past her twelfth witless obstacle without being seen. \"Shame I can't say the same about their body odour, how gross!\" She held down her gagging reflex as she finally snuck into the extremely large hull where the holding bay was. It was at least the size of two basketball courts placed together. \"Sheesh, how did this thing manage to fly, and not get grounded by the military at that?\" She looked around and saw various cages and crates strewn about the bay, with pumps and tubes hanging lazily from the ceiling of the hull. As she crept further in, she also noted how many vents the place had, which was strange for a vehicle like this. Edging around one of the crate stacks, she peered at two soldiers on a coffee break, eating pizza that could hardly have been called edible. Soon, she spotted a small door on the other side of the bay that none of the soldiers seemed to be using. 'I suppose that might be where our secret weapons are then. Security seems pretty lax for it' she thought as she crawled along the ceiling to her destination. She dropped down silently, using her wings to float, and drew out her pick nails to tamper with the lock on the door. With a click and a creek, the door swung open. Luckily nobody saw her as she moved through to the innards of the helicopter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, is it sweltering in here!\" Rouge gasped as the heat sharply became overpowering. \"And it stinks even worse!\" Bearing the torture, she powered her way through the hallway, determined to find what she was looking for. She saw more guards ahead, so she climbed into a vent and listened in on them to get some more info. \"This is still as boring as it was half an hour ago!\" One of the guards moaned before ripping a ripe one. Rouge grimaced upon hearing it, and the smell made it even worse. 'I do wish my nose wasn't nearly as sensitive as my ears...' \"Relax bud, not long now before those guys in there are let out, then the fun really begins! I've got my eye on this little vintage brewery on the edge of the park, you should come with me!\" Rouge's interest was perked by this croc's remarks. 'Those guys in there...so the secret weapons are living, breathing people? How tragic!' Quite conveniently, the lunch whistle sounded, and the two guards trotted off for more barely edible pizza and some gin cocktail shots. She knew this was her time to act. As swiftly as a deer, she dropped down from her hiding spot and ran towards the secured door. unlike the last door, there was a large steel bar across it, making just picking her way through impossible. Instead, she steadied herself as she unleashed a powerful screw kick to knock it down. It was noisy and left junk, but it did the job. Wincing slightly at the pain in her sandal-clad foot with which she had kicked the door, she fled through the door and approached the bowels of the aircraft. She could hear breathing and murmurs from inside, so she knew this was the right way. \"Okay, listen fellas, I don't have much time since the guards will be back in a few minutes. You just have to co-operate and come with me and I'll make they don't cause you any harm\" she spouted off as she ran through a small passage before kicking another unsecured door. \"I'm an officer of G.U.N, so you know you're in safe hands with me escor...what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally got sight the two hostages she'd come in to save, and was stunned at what she saw. Far from being a pair of helpless, weak humans as she had expected, she'd come across Vector and Espio, two men who were more than capable of fighting off these pathetic underlings. \"Huh?\" Vector grunted as he spotted her. \"Who are you?\" Rouge was shocked that Vector didn't recognise her despite having fought each other and negotiated deals in the past. \"Vector, how could you not recognise me? I'm on the Chaotix hit-list constantly!\" She turned her attention to Espio, who was staring at her with his head cocked to the side as he played with Vector's tail. \"Espio, knock some sense into your boss! You must recognise me, I'm one of your biggest rivals!\" Espio pouted in confusion before blissfully sticking his tongue out at her, annoying Rouge. \"Great, they must have messed with your heads someone, and stored you in this hellhole of waste...\" Vector jerked up suddenly and began to space out. Espio stopped playing with the tail and backed off, letting it stiffen up. \"Speaking of waste, lady, I think Vector wants to do another dump!\" Rouge stammered, partially at what she'd just been told and partially at how frank Espio was about it. Before she could ponder it further, she watched in horror as Vector ripped an extremely thick and smelly fart which allowed his mass to follow through. She couldn't help but breathe the stench in, she was too unsettled to cover her nose and mouth. Espio grinned at his pal, before turning to the womanly stranger and commenting \"Smell that? Ain't he just the best at letting it loose?\" This was too much for Rouge as she screamed in disgust. The guards from down the hallway could easily hear it, and came charging towards them at a rapid pace. Rouge, counting her losses. decided to save herself and leave the two Chaotix reptiles to enjoy their filth. \"It looks like they don't want to hurt you, so I can come back for you some other time.\" She ran full pelt, kicking down the guards as she went. Unbeknownst to her, one of the guards had placed a tracker on her before she totalled him, so she could be 'collected' at a later time. Nonetheless, she fought her way  through the forces and out of the helicopter, deciding to fly to the city in desperation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That's the third one that hasn't seen Rouge, Omega! Where on Mobius is she?\" Shadow vented as he exited from the bar. Rouge was supposed to have been back at her place before now, so he assumed she had gone to get a small glass of tipple on her way. However, he was having no luck in finding her at her favourite hang outs. Omega was nearing the end of his analytical judgments, which left them perplexed and without a single clue as to where in the city she could possibly be. \"There is another theory in my databanks.\" Omega asserted as Shadow lowered his head forlornly. \"The location of Rouge before she was due to pass through the city was the Emerald Beach.\" Shadow perked his ears and glanced sideways to Omega thoughtfully. \"So you're suggesting that we can find her if we head there to search?\" \"Affirmative\" Shadow liked this suggestion, so he motioned for Omega to follow him, and they both charged down the packed streets towards the beach. Pedestrians squealed and shouted as they charged through without a second thought about their well-being, their minds had only one objective right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to Emerald Beach, they interrogated the people there on what they knew about Rouge's whereabouts. While none of them had seen her, some did suggest that she may have been in the unused part of the beach away from everyone. After questioning about sixty people, Shadow heard a little boy crying, and pin-pointed the source to a fast food vending cart. As he approached, the mother saw him coming and begged him to assist. \"Please Shadow, he wanted to buy a cheeseburger but the vendor was bought out completely by what can only be described as a possessed bat! He idolises you, so maybe he'd calm down if you spoke to him.\" Shadow wouldn't usually take requests like this, but the mention of a possessed bat made him concerned for Rouge's safety. \"Alright madam, I'll talk to him. Omega, you ask the vendor if he knows where the bat was heading!\" Shadow proceeded to assure the boy that he could get just as good a meal through home cooking before he departed their company and spoke to Omega again. \"Well?\" \"The vendor is not certain, but he said Rouge headed in the direction of the back alley slums.\" Shadow exhaled heavily before looking towards said direction. \"That place is hardly visited by anyone, she must be trying to do something in secret. Come on, we have to hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the main path of the slums, he could see nothing but stacks of thrown out garbage everywhere. \"Rouge hiding in here is illogical\" Omega stated while incinerating more stuff. \"Mind keeping that to a minimum, Omega? Burning refuse doesn't smell very pleasant at all.\" Shadow whined. He was throwing aside pile after pile, having no luck in finding any clues on their goal. As another one fell to the ground, he could have sworn that it moaned. Still, he ignored it and moved to the other side. He kept digging through when a another pile fell and spread away, reveal a side path. Curious, Shadow cautiously walked down the path, with Omega following suit not long after. Shadow noticed there was a turning and absent-mindedly drifted to the right, oblivious to the rats that were scuttering about. His eyes still shut, he picked up a peculiar scent. \"That smells like...junk food grease and awful cabbage\" he concluded, before continuing on. \"You know, Rouge was supposed to have been at a fast food vendor, so maybe the smell comes from that...\" He opened his eyes after he'd fully turned the corner, only to be greeted by a blockade. Only, it wasn't a typical blockage, it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rouge!\" both Shadow and Omega exclaimed. The once petite seductress now dwarfed the alleyway with her fat, her belly alone must have been about 5ft in diameter. She had various sauces and grease scattered all over her front, and drool coming down to form a pool of saliva between her breasts. That smell of cabbage, it was also noticed, was not coming from the various remains of packaging that the food had come in, but from Rouge's constant farts. They couldn't actually tell if it was a lot of farts or one fart that was appearing to last forever. Either way, Shadow was appalled at what he saw. \"Omega, take an analysis of her. Rouge, what happened? Who did this?\" Shadow's voiced was close to cracking under the stress, so he quizzed Rouge out of desperation. To his chagrin, Rouge only responded with a low and brainless moan. \"No, she's completely mindless!\" He snarled in anger, wanting revenge on whoever had made her this way. \"Her metabolism has also been reduced to a very low level. This could be the cause of her sudden change of figure.\"  Shadow stood perplexed at what to do with her, she was far too stuck to move her by hand. \"Omega, get a Chaos Emerald out. I think I might be able to use Chaos Control if I grab her up top and concentrate hard en--HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, a huge steel pincer snaked over Rouge and grabbed at her waist. Shadow, now at wit's end, made a desperate lunge at Rouge, hoping that he could someone keep her pinned down. Omega rushed forward to help him out, but it was a vein effort as she was finally yanked from her spot, damaging the two walls she had been wedged between. Shadow and Omega shouted in panic as they were hoisted with her 20ft into the air, then flung into the back of a waiting convoy. Before they could get over their dazed state, the back door slammed shut, looking much like a cattle transport in that state. the two crocs in the front of the truck gloated over their success. \"Wow, her highness sure does know how to make the best plans!\" chirped the younger one wearing a brown newsie cap. The older of the two, sporting a large chin and a farmer's cap, pulled the throttle as he was about to drive off. \"Yesiree boy, at this rate, Setella will have her new battery system up and running in no time!\"</span></div></div>",

As she ripped into her first of many dripping taco's, the beans and meat falling all over her slumped body as she watched TV, she giggled a bit. Elise always been uptight, for sure, but... She'd never actually felt what it was like to really abuse her power. And now that she knew, she <i>LOVED</i> it. Where she'd normally stifle a fart, she'd simply lean to her side and let out the gas, accentuating rather than hiding its vulgarity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere normally she'd of worn a corset to hide her expanding gut, she purposely didn't change her dress size to emphasize her girth. Why, she wasn't even changing out of her dress outright! Far too much effort to expect of a princess, and she was fairly apathetic about all servants refusing to change and bathe the quickly spoiling girl. When she was finally finished with her current binge, she was completely decked in Mexican food, yet merely took a chubby hand and dragged it along her body, scooping up the debris into her anxious mouth. This was the life. Ironically enough, she was noticing that the staff that attended her was quickly dropping in number of seasoned veterans, but equally picking up in number of teenage boys who seemed all the more eager for her to 'mellow out'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho'd know that they'd be into this kind of behavior from a girl?</span></div></div>",

She steadfastly refused to change it, instead enjoying the way it strained against her expanding girth, riding part way up her now-dimpled, jiggling buttocks and thighs and marvelled at the rainbow of stains which decorated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe royal advisors, more than slightly embarassed about her new found habits yet hoping she would regain her senses eventually suggested it might be a good idea for her to step out of kingdom affairs for the time being. Elise all too readily agreed, feeling that they had been cutting into her valuable gorging time and that they required far too much moving around anyway. With that matter dealt with, Elise had all the time and resources she needed to keep a near constant flow of delicious, fattening foods to her waiting mouth. Elise now spent even more of her time than before sitting in bed, letting out impressive eruptions of gas from both ends and gorging on whatever she wanted as messily as she wanted, her room literred with the various remnants of her meals. The only things Elise forced herself to get up for at this point were to visit the bathroom or go for brief strolls around the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once graceful and demure princess was quite a sight to see for the servants as she waddled clumsily down the hall, her belly slapping against her thighs as she sweated profusely into her dress, stopping every few moments to catch her breath. When she was in a particularly cheeky mood, she would waddle as close to a servant as possible and let rip a particularly loud fart, and was rather surprised when many of the new staff actually seemed to enjoy it, as much as they tried to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elise continued with this royally slobby lifestyle, she wondered just how much more she could get away with...</span></div></div>",

She followed up by stuffing several meals worth of tacos into her bloated cheeks and letting loose with a tremendous fart which shook the bed. Elise giggled happily at this and continued to stuff her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her appetite only increasing the bigger and slobbier she got, Elise had expanded like a hygienically questionable balloon. Her belly protruded several feet from her, hanging down to her knees and her butt had grown into a huge, dimpled shelf which stuck out just as far behind her, relegating the back of her dress to thong duty. Between all the parts of her expanding body, she had reduced most of her original dress to tatters, her thighs exhausting the limits of her leggings and the remains of her dress now serving as a very tenuous makeshift bra. Elise managed to haul her tremendous body out of her bed with the help of some servants, showering food and crumbs onto the floor. She then began one of her brief strolls which she continued out of habit despite her steadily increasing size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly waddling her way down the corridor with her tremendous thighs rubbing together, Elise felt the approach of her most recent meals on their way out. Having abandoned all self-consciousness to indulge in her new lifestyle and totally convinced she could get away with anything, Elise decided to let nature take it's course right there and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise giggled happily at the servants expressions as she waddled slowly down the corridor while shoving a series of thick turds out of her colossal ass onto the polished marble floor. Every now and then she would stop and let out a long, wet fart.

As you were saying?\" Elise said earnestly, licking her greasy hands while keeping her eyes focused on the maid in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't mean to be rude to your highness, yet... <i>hygiene</i> seems to... no longer be a priority with our ruler?\" The maid was now completely victim to Elise's stare, who had now stopped licking her swollen hands and was closely following what the increasingly jittery girl had to say next. \"Eh... Um... Not my words?\" She said with a forced smile, feeling more threatened by the subtle look of anger on the princess' bloated face than she ever had by the rest of the senior staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hygiene seems to no longer be a priority?</i>\" Elise repeated, cementing the maid in her place. \"Do you <i>know</i> what I could have done to you, whatever your stupid name is?\" She reached out to grab the maid by the cheeks, but realizing the awkwardness of her position, merely pointed a pudgy finger dripping in cheese. \"I want you to take that back. And whatever else I know the rest of the staff are saying!\" The girl was on the verge of tears, and knew there were far worse things then merely having to stand by her on feeding duty Elise could do to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's... *Ahem*, there's nothing wrong with your hygiene?\" She looked at Elise's cold stare and continued at full speed. \"Infact,youhavebetterhygienethaneverybodyintheentirekingdom!Andyourbody,well ,youdefinitelyknowhowtosetyourselfapartfromthebackintermsofbeautyohgodpleasedon&amp; #39;tputmeontoiletduuuuutttty!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise looked at the now rambling maid and started to laugh. \"Ahahaha, ooooh man, you have NO idea how funny this sounds. I've been soiling myself for the past few weeks in public, eat anything I can get my hands on and haven't bathed since... Since who KNOWS when. Of course I'm a slob, and proud of it!\" The maid stepped back a bit with a look of confusion plastered across her face. \"I was having you on! Anyway, what did you have to tell me?\" Elise asked, taking another large handful from her nachos. \"And I'm gonna need a refill soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing her throat, the maid piped up. \"Eh, as I was saying, we're installing a... Mobile-toilet? I'm not sure what the actual name is, but since all of the cleaning staff and most of the usual staff have already quit, it's the only way we can prevent you soiling the entire castle.\" Elise giggled a bit. \"Pffft, I bet it's one of those bizarre things where you have to shove a pump whoknowwhere... Tell the senior's I'll use it if I remember and feel like it!\" Slowley heaving herself up as a river of sweat rushed down over her body over the laborious act of standing up, Elise added \"Eh, tell them to install pulleys around the place... *Pant* I'd prefer that over having to shove something up my butt.\" With a waddle and her old dress still serving merely as an ludicrously expensive thong and bra, Elise grabbed the maid's hand with her greasy hand and started her normal stroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, you don't have to act so upity around me nowadays.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid sighed a sign of relief. \"I thought as much... Oh, and Elise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

Her body was covered in food, trash, and her wastes, releasing waste every day. Her once beautiful castle was now littered with food, trash, and poop and her farts were in every room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of her servants had fled when her habits began to become even more disgusting than usual. Upon reaching immobility, she finally took her staff\u2019s advice and got one of those pumps that went into her butt and sucked her waste into a septic tank and also started using a chair that was hooked to her brain. One day, she found the septic tanks containing her waste and mistaken them for some sort of chocolate reserves. Upon eating it, she started to want more and finally reached full pigness. Since then, she ate whatever she could find, finally grossing out most of the staff to leave. Whoever stayed were there because they had either fear or to see how low the princess would sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Elise wheeled herself outside to soak up some sun while killing nearby plants with her farts.

The princess clutched her belly with her hands and called a servant to prepare her breakfast. Elise told her that she didn't care what food was given to her, as long as it was a lot. After 20 minutes, she returned with trays full of sweet pastries and a gallon of milk. Elise lit up with joy at the sight of it all and drooled as she had to make the nigh-impossible choice of what to eat first. The cookies \u2013 chocolate chip, Oreos, snicker doodles, etc. \u2013 were at a perfect balance between being too soft and too hard. The pies, be it pumpkin, blueberry, or chocolate, were at just the right temperature, no burns or chars. The myriad cakes, regardless of their being rectangular, domed, or circular, were delicately decorated in multi-colored frosting. The cinnamon rolls were glazed in sweet sugar and the croissants were fluffy and soft. The milk was heated to the point of steaming. Perfect for the cookies, Elise thought, so she decided to go for that first. Grabbing the pitcher of milk, she hoisted it up to her mouth and began guzzling the contents down her throat. The servant Carol could only stare in a mix of awe and disgust as the milk dripped down Elise\u2019s face. The princess gradually tipped the pitcher at an increasingly steeper angle, hoping to speed up the rate at which the milk was rushing into her mouth. However, as the pitcher\u2019s bottom reached a horizontal apex, the remaining cow juice splashed all over Elise\u2019s head. Her hair and clothes were totally doused and parts of her bed sheets were soaked as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, are you alright?\u201d Carol asked, dashing to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was dead silence, save for the ever-growing volume of Elise\u2019s gurgling gut. Apparently, she\u2019d consumed too much milk in one sitting, for once again her tummy was being cradled in pain. The servant tried to support her, but would soon regret doing so. Elise\u2019s belly began to expand, brought on by the multiplying air bubbles just begging to escape; a wish that would quickly be granted. The royal figure\u2019s cheeks ballooned as her pent up gas forced itself into her mouth. Her strained appearance filled Carol with an even greater sense of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess Elise, please say something!\u201d The servant begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*BBBBUUURRRRRRRPP!*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wave of gas that penetrated Elise\u2019s lips commenced an assault on Carol\u2019s senses. It reeked of partially digested milk and made her become green in the face. She tried plugging her nose, but this left her ear open for attack. The belch rang through Carol\u2019s eardrums, threatening to deafen her. It mattered not which body part took the brunt of the force, as Carol was going to suffer somehow at the hands of this near demonic eructation. Finally, after five long seconds, Elise\u2019s burp had concluded, though that was five seconds too long as far as Carol was concerned. The embarrassed princess instantly slapped a gloved hand to her mouth, donning a crimson shade on her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, excuse me, Carol.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a number of things racing through the wide-eyed servant girl\u2019s mind right now. In the span of three minutes, the leader of her kingdom had ordered a feast\u2019s worth of food, chug half a gallon of milk, and let out an ungodly belch in her face. Oddly enough though, the thing that surprised her most was that Elise apologized for it. This girl who\u2019d spent the last month gorging on food and breaking wind regardless of the venue just said \u2018excuse me\u2019. What was different this time? Was it because this came out the other end? Should there really have been another standard for burping instead of farting? Carol was over thinking this. It was probably just a one-time thing anyway, so there was no real reason to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite alright, your majesty, although I\u2019m surprised that you excused yourself, given your indifference toward releasing your gas from\u2026 the other end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol was now the one blushing, mentally kicking herself for flat out asking her boss such a weird question. What right did she have to know how another reacts to their bodily emissions? To her surprise though, the princess was rather casual about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I did. I may not care about my constant flatulence, but I find belching to be too rude to do around others. It\u2019d be nearly impossible to cover up if say, I were at a social event.\u201d Elise explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well I won\u2019t mind it if you burp like that again, as long as I\u2019m not at ground zero when it happens.\u201d Carol joked with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehehe, thank you, Carol. Now I\u2019m going to continue to enjoy my breakfast.\u201d Elise declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, your highness.\u201d Carol replied with a small bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise then turned to her food and rubbed her hands together in anticipation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris slowly opened his eye's a yawned, waking up to a fresh new day. Yet something immediately felt out of place, yet he couldn't exactly put his finger on what that was exactly. Attempting to sit upright, he found that he seemed pinned down. So rather, he tried rolling out of bed, only to feel himself come crashing down on the floor with a tremendous amount of force. Quickly collecting himself, Chris with a heavy amount of sweating managed to heave himself up, wondering if something had been attached to his feet or arms to weigh him down; he was still half-asleep after all. Yet what met Chris' eyes when he finally rubbed the sleep out of them and had a look down left him frozen stiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was <i>massive</i>, not to mention butt-naked. His belly hung down low over his waist like an apron with several rolls, giving him some natural decency. His legs were like huge logs, his feet mostly submerged in what looked like a pair of lumpy piles of blubber which quivered towards the ground. His arms were wrapped in fat which also draped and jiggled downwards due to gravity. Chris now had a pair of large bloated man-boobs which put every other girl's in the house own chest to shame. His pajamas were torn in shreds on his bed which now had a heavy dent in the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Did I miss something?\" Was the most Chris could muster after fully engrossing himself as a blimp in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo engrossed in his ridiculous new form, he didn't notice a certain pink hedgehog which had quietly waltzed in to wake Chris up. Like Chris, Amy merely stood in awe and confusion over Chris' new body. It wasn't until he could suddenly see her in the mirror that Chris quickly jumped backwards, which sent him toppling over onto his flabby butt-cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Eh, good morning?\" Was all Amy could say with a slight blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, what happened to you! You're HUGE! You're huger than huge! You're...\" Chris slowly picked himself up again, grinning awkwardly both due to his embarrassing new size and the fact he was indecent in-front of a girl. \"Yeah, I think I could realize that on my own Amy, thanks.... Look, I have absolutely NO idea how any of this happened! I can hardly move, I look like a human blimp and...\" The room suddenly started to quake as the boy's immense belly started to rumble. \"... And I'm starving!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't help I'm the only one here for the entire day...\" Amy thought for a moment, regretting her reaction to Chris' new... 'Problem'. If these roles were reversed today, she knew she'd have to rely on Chris to help her out. Chris' face turned a deep red. \"I don't have any clothes that fit me now.\" Amy quickly rushed out and came back into the bedroom holding a box of clothes. \"Here, all of these are... Eh, 'pluss' size.\" She slightly giggled. Grabbing a shirt with a pudgy hand, he tried to reach it across his body, but found the largest amount of movement he could muster was to move his ballooned arms ontop of his moobs. \"... Oh boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take a genius to know where this was headed. \"... I have to dress you, right?\" Amy reflected back on the fact that Chris would be having to do the same to her if she was in his situation. \"*Sigh* Let's get this over and done with then.\" Pulling a huge shirt over his flabby neck and equally fat arms, she heaved as she pulled them down, only to find they still only (just) covered his chest. \"That'll have to do for now... Oh man, the underwear. Do you really need pants Chris?\" She asked, looking at his utterly humiliated expression. \"Forget I asked that! It's no problem...\" She quickly injected, before grabbing some parachute-size briefs and after getting Chris to place his feet over either hole, started to pull them upwards, making sure they'd reached all the way to the top all around his waist. Surprisingly they fit; though she found some small tears were flab seemed to poke through, but it was better than nothing. She did the same for some jeans, but found they hardly got further than halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can live without pants.\" Chris mumbled, before started to waddle off. \"Let's just get something to eat before we try to find out what's happened, alright Chris?\"</span></div></div>",
