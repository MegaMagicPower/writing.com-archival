A nerd in his natural habitat!\" To Adam's horror, John's voice was filled with delight.

Let's find out! Drumroll!\" The sound  of hands drumming on locker doors rang out. Next thing you know, John reached down and grabbed his waistband. Adam braced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the prize goes to...tightie whities!\" John pulled so hard Adam went up onto his toes, squealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn swung him around and began using Adam as a weight, doing arm curls and bouncing him up and down.</span></div></div>",

Nicki watched as he squirmed she started walking, got out side, and hook Atams undies to the flag pole, where some jocks were hanging out they saw her hanging Atam and saw her hot pink bikini panties sticking out they snuck behind her, flipped her skirt, wedgied her, and put her on the same hook as Atam the jocks they hoisted them both to the top. They were both blushing at themselves, and each other. Nicki wasn\u2019t used to this like Atam was, so it hurt a little more, she looked over to Atam then behind her, unlike him her butt was exposed, so she reached over and pulled down his pants,\u201dwhat the heck I\u2019m already in enough humiliation I don\u2019t need more,\u201d he said blushing hard then before,\u201d I was putting us on the same level  those guys made my butt exposed, so I exposed yours,\u201d she replied pinching Atams butt in punishment,\u201deek,\u201d Nicki got one more idea, she leaned toward Atom and kissed his cheek, and their backs then straightened out making them sink into their undies more, they then reached behind the other grabbed the middle string, and pulled at the same time,\u201d eeeeek,\u201d squealed at the same time,\u201d your so cute Atom,\u201d,\u201d your cute to Nicki.

Daniel stared at the clothes; Adam was a complete nerd and a lot smaller than him, so these wouldn't fit, but on the other hand he couldn't stay like this the entire day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, he tried pulling the pants on. They were way too small and ridiculously tight on him; he couldn't get them up fully. He strained for a minute, and managed to get them ALMOST up to his waist. He tried on the shirt, and luckily he was skinny enough that he could get it on; it was really tight though. He stared in the mirror; he looked worse than a conformist, he looked like a complete tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed.
