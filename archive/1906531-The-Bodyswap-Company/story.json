He asked his mother, Michelle if she would take him to the place and switch bodies with him.Michelle was a beautiful brunette and stay home mother.She refused.She had no desire to be a kid especially a boy and her chubby son.She was disappointed that her son wanted to be a female.She was ashamed and didn't tell anyone even her husband about it.Justin was unhappy with her decision but not surprised.If he was Michelle he wouldn't want to become him either.<br>\r\nMichelle thought about it a lot.She didn't like denying her kids anything.She believed her life as a housewife  with two children was hard.She decided to let Justin who she felt was lazy change places with her for awhile.She believed that being in her shoes for even a day would be too much for him and he would want to change back.She told Justin about her change of heart.He was so happy!<br>\r\nMichelle drove them to the Body swap company in her new silver convertible.She chain smoked cigarettes on the way nervous about losing her femininity and adulthood even for just a short time.Justin was excited about his dream coming true.Soon he would be the one wearing skinny jeans,driving the car and smoking.Michelle told the customer service rep Brittany (who looked like a blonde college cheerleader) that she was agreeing to the switch with her minor child.Brittany had been a client who was so pleased with her change she got a job there.Mrs.Farmer also said the exchange would be for as long as Justin wanted it to be.Justin was excstatic!His mother really believed her life was going to be too hard for him to handle.He believed it would be a piece of cake.<br>\r\nBrittany explained that they would have access to the other's memories.So Justin would be able to drive and cook in Michelle's body and she would be able to play video games and know about  Star Wars in his.</span></div></div>",

After Justin finished he handed it back to Brittany who then directed him and his Mother to sit down on one of the green cushioned chairs behind them as they waited. It was a few minutes before an older gentleman in a lab coat opened the door to the left of the secretary, holding a clipboard and directing Justin and his Mother to the farthest door down a long corridor. It was there they saw the machinery for the first time, It was two chairs with restraints and several wires leading to what looked like electrical generators facing the chairs but against the wall. A dark haired man with a goatee entered the room, looking like the older man they saw before clipboard and lab coat and all.  <br>\r\n\"Mrs. Farmer, Justin, if you are ready let's get this show on the road,\" he said smiling.<br>\r\nMichelle Farmer took a deep breath, reassuring herself this would be temporary, no way Justin would be able to live her life. Justin on the other hand was ecstatic, looking over at his Mother and thinking to himself, \"I'm going to be her shortly.\" Her long brown hair in a ponytail, her athletic figure still showing through her attire of a gray hoodie, white shirt and grey sweatpants and sneakers. Her beautiful and flawless face, blue eyes and slender hands one of which containing the large diamond ring that made her <i>Mrs.</i> Farmer. Mother and child took their places as the man hooked them up to each respective machine, strapping them in just before he headed over to the large switch at the back of the room. He flipped it. </span></div></div>",

He took a deep breath and looked down observing his new cleavage and how it responded to the simple act of inhaling and exhaling. He placed his hands on his stomach, smiling at the feeling of his fit, toned tummy. He slowly began moving his hands up his body taking a moment to squeeze his new breasts as they made up to his smiling face. The sensation was wonderful, the feeling of feeling so much lighter, healthier and finally being the woman he had watched so intently for so long. He looked down at his hands, the small, slender hands, polish less fingernails, the large, diamond ring, the fingerprints that were now his.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired man entered once more, observing the behavior of both Mother and child and jotting down notes on his clipboard. Justin knew what to do now, as he gestured the man over to him. The plan was relatively simple, find a way to destroy the proof that his Mother was in his body now, by any means necessary. As the man made his way over to him, he knew what he had to do to become a <i> she </i> permanently. And before the man could utter a single word, Justin pounced on him. This was his first time kissing anyone but he was able to work his new found feminine assets to perfection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the man's tongue in his mouth moving back and forth and Justin began struggling with the hoodie he was now wearing, in order to hook the man in further. Exposing his cleavage which was restrained by a black, lacy bra. He felt the man's hands squeezing them, sending shivers of pleasure through Justin, the likes of which he has never felt before. </span></div></div>",

He squinted at the clock in his office, staring blankly as the hour hand flirted closer and closer to seven o'clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't even had time to read today's <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. And now it was well beyond close of business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe graying executive of Morpheus Industries leaned back in his chair and replayed the day's events over in his mind like a record tape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwelve hours ago, a snap meeting in the conference room on the fifth floor was called -- another large shareholder threatened to divest himself of the startup's funding. More setbacks in the \"Retail Implementation\" phase of the project. Earnings posted a negative 34 cents a share last quarter after Test Subject One reported unexpected aftereffects from the mind transfer machine. The experiment was supposed to be top secret, but somehow the reporters at the <i>Middleburg Ledger</i> identified, tracked down and cornered several employees briefed on the matter. It was Lawrence Deluse's job to know what those aftereffects were, and to dispatch a crisis management team to pacify the test subject while resolving whatever ghost in the machine caused the foul-up. At this point, preventing an ugly public lawsuit was the best-case scenario, he reported to the President of the corporation. That answer went about as well as could be expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remainder of the morning was spent with the technicians on the basement level. The space used to be a subterranean parking lot until the upper floors were fully staffed with operational employees -- accountants, financial analysts, HR, marketers, and so-called 'client relationship specialists'. Dozens of new employees were on-boarded in anticipation of a successful roll out of Morpheus' darling prototype, which had yet to be christened a name. Focus grouping a name would have to be put on hold, or else people might cheekily call it the \"brain scrambler\" after the infamous <i>Ledger</i> article published on Monday of that week. The technicians, comprised of various ethnic minorities from India, China, Japan, and other places Lawrence Deluse would struggle pointing out on a map, poured over the schematics to try and diagnose the problem of Test Subject One. Lawrence Deluse was not a tech-head like them, but he did combine a business and engineering degree at MIT so he came from the same intellectual pedigree. That was why he was tapped to be the firm's Chief Technical Officer eight months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afternoon involved putting out several fires in the procurement division. Supply chain troubles flaring up again. For the third time in as many days, a Chinese shipping company failed to obtain import papers to allow Morpheus' shipment of rare earth minerals entrance into the country. The essential supplies were impounded in a port in Shanghai. Millions of dollars of cobalt, molybdenum, titanium, and zinc required to build more mind transfer machines were inaccessible. If the only prototype machine Morpheus constructed were to malfunction, then it could be days -- weeks -- before spare parts and supplies would arrive in sufficient quantity for repairs. Lawrence Deluse spent another few hours listening to the gripes coming out of Finance, wondering why this had to be another one of his problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this wasn't enough, he had to endure another tirade from his wife when he explained the need to work late into the evening yet again. Helene Deluse, his wife of twenty-three years, was as helping as a woman could be. She <i>helped</i> herself to his hefty income, wealth, and leisure to travel and visit the local wineries as her husband worked. She herself came from a similarly privileged Yale family, with Yale friends and Yale money. That meant Helene Deluse also had a Yale appetite. She would complain about never being able to bring her husband along to weekend socials because of his proclivity for work. Through all of this, and especially through the last eight months, he never doubted her faith as a wife. But he noticed her figure becoming slimmer, fitter, her hair more vibrant and thick. Was she going to the gym and the salon for him? He didn't want to think of alternative reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey never had any children. There were few pictures of family in Lawrence Deluse's corner office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked out his eighth floor window at the other skyscrapers hugging the busy downtown streets. Most of the office windows were dark. Of the ones still lit, he wondered what the other harried, white-collar workers were fretting about this late into the evening. The fact that this was a Friday night hardly registered to him. Since the end of last quarter, Lawrence Deluse hadn't had any weekends off from work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, he decided to finally unfold today's <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. Skipping over the Finance section entirely, he flipped to a section he almost never bothered with. Culture and Entertainment. On the front page, he mused over an interesting topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Power Structures in the Workplace:</b></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Secretaries and Their Bosses</b></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">By Yehuda Klein, culture columnist</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Jennifer Clark never imagined her career at Simpath Technologies (NASDAQ: SIMP) would take her so far. Or, that it would end amid allegations of systemic sexual harassment by senior executives at the mid-market semiconductor manufacturer. Now, the former secretary has written a book on her experiences as a warning to other young women facing a patriarchal power structure at work.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"I always thought the business world was male oriented,\" She said in a telephone interview. \"I just never believed it was so pervasive.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Ms. Clark, 27, a graduate of Communications at Middleburg State University, touted her volunteer experience, proficiency in Spanish, and officer position on the Delta Epsilon Epsilon sorority as keys to landing a job as Secretary to former CEO Harry Torres. Mr. Torres, 62, resigned from his position at Simpath last week amid a flurry of accusations of sexual harassment. Ms. Clark has alleged that Mr. Torres pressured her into performing sexual acts for him to keep her job. While he has admitted no wrongdoing, Simpath has severed all ties to the former executive. Mr. Torres is now the third executive officer ousted from the corporation in the last three months for claims of sexual harassment, and the change in management has left shareholders reeling.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"I have to remember that men, including those in positions of power, are used to getting their way. Society gave a lot of privileges to men who used to get away with certain relationships with their subordinates. Not anymore. I hope women everywhere stand up, lean in, and demand to be treated fairly and without discrimination in the workplace.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>In her book, Ms. Clark writes about growing up in a small town, living with two brothers, and being pressured into making life choices that, she says now, she would change if given the chance. She claims that her job as a secretary has been stereotyped only for women, which causes her to check her own privilege.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Every story that you've ever read, you assume the secretary is a woman. Why do we allow this to happen?\" She asks.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Ms. Clark is still seeking a publisher, but her book is expected to be a best seller as it details the imbroglio surrounding Mr. Torres and Simpath. According to a recent study by the Frank Herbert Institute, 89 percent of employees in a secretarial position are female. That compares to 92 percent five years ago, and 94 percent ten years ago.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>A spokesperson for Simpath refused to comment on this article.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLawrence Deluse folded up the newspaper and frowned. He didn't know Torres personally; they attended the same conference in San Francisco a few months back. But he never took him for sexual misconduct. He thought about the various C-suite titles he's held over the years, and the secretaries who have worked for him, not recalling any instance of impropriety that might make the front page of the newspaper. Then again, times have certainly changed, the innumerable corporate-sponsored diversity classes attesting to that fact. No, he wouldn't be foolish enough to let some floozie secretary tempt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was concerning: mere allegations were enough to oust the visionary Torres. For the longest time, you couldn't say Simpath without thinking of the guy behind the company, very much like a Steve Jobs or Bill Gates. Which was why the allegations struck the whole tech industry like an earthquake. Lawrence had no doubt in the veracity of at least some of those allegations. But what might someone less charitable or with an axe to grind say about <i>him</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is why Lawrence Deluse resolved to ask his own secretary of her opinion of him. Of course, he knew her answer may not be the most truthful, given the inherent \"power structure\" alluded to in the article. But he needed some kind of validation. After a rocky marriage, uncertain business outlook, and major setbacks in the company's performance, he needed to hear the words: <i>You're still a good man</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe resolved to ask her first thing Monday morning. What was her response?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lawrence sat behind the large, wooden home office desk, fiddling with the paper reports that had been placed there this morning. The shares for Morpheus Industries fell another 21 cents, though the falling rate seemed to be slightly slowing down. As expected, the technicians had yet to find the mysterious flaw in the machine, asking for more time on diagnosis. And it seemed that the President had arranged a meeting with him later this afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLawrence set the stack of papers back on the table, taking off his reading glasses that corrected the vision of his aging eyes. Nothing but bad news seemed to follow him. It was already causing him to feel a certain emotion \u2013 a feeling of apathy. He wanted nothing more than to stand up, overturn all the desks and chairs in his room, and storm out of here, yelling \u201cTo hell with it all!\u201d But he knew this wasn\u2019t possible; not if he wanted to retain the job he\u2019d spent many years building up towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at his desk phone, he nervously picked it up with his bony fingers and dialed the extension to his secretary. His hands shook as the phone hummed in his hand. Once\u2026 twice\u2026 finally, he could hear a click as the secretary picked up on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Mr. Deluse. How may I help you?\u201d Came the sweet mezzo-soprano voice from the earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, Olivia. I would like for you to come to my office right now,\u201d Lawrence replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, Mr. Deluse,\u201d Piped up Olivia. \u201cI will be over in just a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word, Ms. Summers \u2013 better known to Lawrence as \u2018Olivia\u2019 \u2013 arrived at his office door promptly. This was no surprise to him, since her office (she was the only secretary in the building to be given an office instead of a cubicle or open-air desk) was right next to his. A brief knock on the door and a yell of \u201cCome in!\u201d was all it took for the brunette to enter and stand before his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Mr. Deluse,\u201d Repeated Olivia her earlier greeting. \u201cWould you like me to make a coffee for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA coffee did sound tempting for Lawrence, as he reached out to smoothen his droopy eyelids. He hadn\u2019t gotten much sleep last night, having been nerve-wrecked about all the work problems. Nevertheless, he simply shook his head and motioned towards the chair on the opposing end of his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit, Olivia,\u201d Softly commanded Lawrence, still gesturing to the chair. \u201cI want to talk to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia\u2019s face suddenly stiffened, turning stone cold, as she proceeded to sit down on the cushion chair offered to her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Mr. Deluse? I know it\u2019s too early for my yearly performance \u2013 it was scheduled for November. Was it because I took time off work to go see my family? I know it wasn\u2019t an appropriate use of sick days, but\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Lawrence interrupted, scratching behind his ear. \u201cI don\u2019t mind you using your sick days in that manner as long as you report to me beforehand.  It\u2019s just that\u2026 I have a question to ask you.\u201d He paused, leaning in and gazing into her wondrous, emerald eyes. \u201cWhat do you think of me? As a boss, I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. Olivia paused, surprised by the sudden question that came out of the blue. Lawrence felt as if though time began to stretch to its limits. The seconds passing by felt like minutes, hours, days even \u2013 as he waited for her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d She finally mumbled, placing her index onto her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s just so sudden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust tell me your honest thoughts. No need to sugarcoat it to me. Lay it on me like you would to your mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Mused Olivia, her eyes wandering upwards. \u201cI think that you\u2019re a very good boss. I have never faced any harassment or discrimination from you. You\u2019re always lenient and understanding when it comes to mistakes, and you genuinely care about others. When I worked as a physicist at the Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory, they overworked me, put me down, and constantly caused me stress. Here \u2013 I get much better pay and my workload is less burdensome. I never thought that I would work as a secretary after graduating from Caltech with a PhD in nuclear physics, but now I\u2019m glad I did. And I\u2019m glad to have you as a boss. And I would even say friend as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLawrence was stunned. Tears wanted to flow, but he held them back, remembering his late father\u2019s age-old adage \u2013 \u201cA real man doesn\u2019t cry\u201d. But to think that this was how his closest subordinate felt about him; it was unimaginable. He had always tried to treat others with an attitude he expected back from them: with respect and understanding. But he didn\u2019t expect that she had thought this highly about him \u2013 the depressed woman with shining intelligence he had hired 5 months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs\u2026 is that all, Mr. Deluse?\u201d Asked Olivia hesitantly. No doubt the question was still weighing on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. You can go now,\u201d Told her Lawrence, as the clicking of her heels began, before adding, \u201cA coffee would be nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, Mr. Deluse,\u201d Chirped Olivia, as she sashayed out of the room in her pencil skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLawrence breezed through the morning with an elated feeling on cloud-nine. All the misfortunates and tragedies that weighed him down were quickly forgotten, and he threw himself back into work. Everything was running so smoothly, issues were starting to be resolved, good news started pouring in. A permit for the shipment of goods had been obtained, and it would only take a couple days to resolve the problem with the shipping. Technicians had begun testing the device, and were quickly approaching to finding a solution. All the troubles seemed to have been swept away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLawrence didn\u2019t even notice as the time flew by, the two hands of his office clock merging together to indicate 12 o\u2019clock. It was lunch time. Normally, Lawrence would bring his own lunch to work; he was used to working even during this free time. However, he had decided to help himself to a treat, as he grabbed his car keys and rode to his favorite restaurant \u2013 Il Mare Bianco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was seated promptly, recognized by the waiting staff of the place. A table by the window, with a beautiful view of the paved streets and colorful signs. He looked down at the menu, browsing the many dishes he had and hadn\u2019t before, wondering if he should try the lamb with cr\u00e8me sauce or go for the tried-and-true linguini with calamari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restaurant was nearly empty at this time, which was a plus, except for a couple seated at a nearby table. The man was handsome, with a straight posture and militaristic gait. A trimmed moustache and beard completed his visage. He was the type of guy whom many of women would fall for, yet only few would get a chance at him. The lady sitting opposite to him had her back turned to Lawrence, but something about that crimson red dress and vibrant hair seemed very familiar\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do you find this place?\u201d She finally purred, caressing the arm of her companion. Lawrence nearly choked on his spit. There was no way he would ever forget the voice of his wife. What was she doing here? He leaned in slightly closer, straining his hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe food is quite good here. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. This restaurant was found by my husband. But that silly, old fool doesn\u2019t spend the time with me here anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAbout that \u2013 don\u2019t you think it would be bad if he found out our relationship between each other?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt that. He\u2019s been working late at nights recently. He doesn\u2019t even suspect what\u2019s going on\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLawrence was already out of the restaurant by that time. He understood. He understood everything. And it hurt; it hurt so much. His heart was beating rapidly, ready to tear apart. The gym, the salons \u2013 they weren\u2019t for him. They were for someone else. He should\u2019ve known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day seemed to sour as a result of this. Authorities found an error in the papers, delaying the shipment once more. The president yelled at him during his meeting, threatening to fire him if he didn\u2019t resolve the case. Technicians forgot to enter key parameters during diagnosis, leading to worthless results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 6 o\u2019clock. Everyone was gone by now. Lawrence exited his office, and began walking down the hallway to the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy even live\u2026\u201d Muttered Lawrence, walking past his secretary\u2019s room. She was also probably gone by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing the \u2018B\u2019 letter in the elevator, he took it to the former underground parking lot. He stood before the machine, which caused much grief and headache for him. It seemed to menace before him, taunting him, the doors left open by the technicians gaping wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is such a pain,\u201d Lawrence muttered. He suddenly heard the clicking sound of high heels approaching him. He turned around, not knowing who to expect, and saw the figure of his secretary standing before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright, Mr. Deluse?\u201d Asked Olivia, approaching him. \u201cI heard you mumbling something as you walked past my office. You seemed to be in a foul mood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d Hesitated Lawrence, thinking what to tell her. \u201cI just had a bad day. You know how it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, beginning to approach closer. \u201cYes, I used to\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words were cut short as she tripped over a ledge (a relic of its days as a parking lot) in the dim lighting, sending her tumbling towards Lawrence, causing them both to fall into the machine itself. His head hit the side of inside wall, causing the doors to slam shut and the machine to roar to life. Sparks danced in the air. The machine seemed to be falling apart, just enough energy left for one, last dying breath. Lawrence\u2019s last hope was that he didn\u2019t break something, as he began to lose consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do we follow next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although those above her called her a rising star, a go getter, someone who was moving up the corporate ladder. This all depended on who you asked of course, and Melanie really didn't care about the opinions of those who worked under her. Her single minded determination was something that spread to every aspect of her life, from her long jogs to keep her body fit, her eating habits made up of salads, and her lonely romantic life, born out of seeing all of her friends becoming housewives within the ages of 18 to 23. Melanie was deathly afraid of such a horrible fate befalling her, becoming dependent on someone else, becoming a fat, bloated, complacent female that seemed to be so common in this man's world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric Lawson was a quiet man, not rich by any stretch of the imagination, but a hard worker nonetheless. He was a person who simply existed physically, as his nights were typically made up of browsing various sites which featured body swapping stories. Something didn't really set right with Eric, although he did not cross dress or explore his night time explorations into this fictional idea further, and although he had been in previous heterosexual relationships in the past, he wished he could give being a female, even if it was for a short time a try. He often fantasized about becoming people at his work while he quietly passed out their mail with a easy smile and a few conversational words. One such fantasy was becoming Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie was 28, like Eric, yet she had done so much more in the same span of time. Her business suits and skirts were professional yet, still drove Eric insane as he could see the muscular, toned legs hiding in Melanie's pantyhose. Her short brown hair encased her beautiful face, high cheekbones and blue eyes, although Eric typically saw it berating various people around the office. As Eric searched through the junk mail at the end of the day as he often did, simply for coupons he ran across an advertisement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> Wonder what it would be like to be someone else? </b><br>\r\nHe read further to find that a Doctor in the city had found a way to transfer a person's consciousness into another person's body.

She manages the reporting division of Global Tech, overseeing mostly data analysts and a small team of writers. Margaret herself has had little time for pleasure in her life, working as a single parent to a teenage daughter of her own. At 39, she stands a touch over five and a half feet tall, and a tad over two hundred pounds.

Her long black hair is rarely out of a pony tail, and the thick glasses she wears hide an nondescript and acne marred face.

This morning she woke up with a headache, her teenage daughter yapping about a school dance she wanted to go to and she was stuck in a traffic jam. Instead of being half an hour early she now was just barely on time. She hated her life. If she could she would gladly give it away to someone else. Being a single hard-working mom wasn't easy and especially considering her ex didn't pay a dime for her or their daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now she was looking at an ad for the Bodyswap company. She was selected as part of a special promotion, a free body swap with anyone she would want. The only condition would be that the other person would agree to the swap of course. This was the escape Margaret was looking for the last fifteen years. She could start all over or at least temporary. She really could use a vacation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret was still thinking while she slipped out of her heels and touched the soft carpet underneath her desk. Problem was that she needed to find someone willingly to swap with her and not only that, someone trustworthy. Someone who wouldn't ruin her whole life if the other life would suck just as much as hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your coffee Ms. Taylor.\" A voice suddenly interrupted Margaret's thinking. Margaret looked up to see Kim Davis holding a cup of coffee in her hand. Kim was a recently hired intern at Global Tech. Margaret normally didn't like hiring interns just straight from university. They were too theoretical (coming up with the most idiotic ideas) or they were working too slow. \"Just adapting\" they would call it. So far both disadvantages weren't  applicable to Kim here. She was a hard working bright young girl, if she would continue on like this she could easily replace Margaret. Of course she wouldn't tell her superiors, but the girl had potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not only was she a smart girl, but also attractive. Kim was a health fanatic and her figure clearly showed that. She was as skinny as a willow tree, but still looked elegant. Margaret noticed even some of the male staff looking at Kim with the eyes of a predator. But so far she still was single. She would be the perfect body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Kim. Could you please sit down?\" Margaret asked Kim. Kim sat down with an elegant smile crossing her shapely legs. \"Did I do something wrong Ms. Taylor?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not, in fact I have a very lucrative opportunity for you. What would you say if you could have my position in the firm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim looked surprised at Margaret's offer. Was the lady gone crazy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not crazy if that's what you're thinking.\" Margaret said reading Kim's mind. I just came across a  splendid opportunity for the both of us. Have you heard of the Bodyswap company?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they provide clients the opportunity to switch bodies. Is that what this is about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret nodded. \"I think you would be the ideal candidate to replace me here at the company. You're a bright young girl with a lot of ambition and potential. I wouldn't just give away my body to just someone Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but wow I'm a bit overwhelmed here.\" Kim said feeling a bit hot all of a sudden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that, but understand that I'm trusting you with my most important asset. And think about the possibilities I give you with this. You get an even better understanding of the company, you can make the connections you could never do now and you could put forward your ideas how to run the place, wouldn't that be interesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret saw Kim thinking about her proposition. At first it looked like Kim was going to say no, but all of a sudden smile came upon Kim's face. \"All right Ms. Taylor, I accept it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid.\" Margaret said. \"I'll make the arrangements at the company. I think it's best if we swap during the weekends. That way we can both adapt to our new bodies and new lives.\" Kim nodded and after a few more words she left for her office space. Only one week of work and she would have her own office. Things couldn't be better.</span></div></div>",

This is really amazing.\" Margaret said as she twirled around looking at her reflection in the mirror. Just this morning she and Kim arrived at the Bodyswap company. Luckily Margaret already made an appointment as a line of people were standing in front of them, all being waved away. Seemed the company was not allowing everyone to use their machines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the building she and Kim were led to a small office where they were introduced to Dan, they're displacement manager. \"Just to oversee you two switching bodies and switching back in the end.\" He told the ladies as he held his introduction talk. He told the ladies they would switch bodies for the amount of time they both agreed upon. If they wanted to stay longer or shorter as each other they both would need to agree to it. And then the usual talk about how the Bodyswap company would not be liable for any damages in case something would go wrong. The usual stuff Margaret had seen before at companies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then both signed for the duration of one month, with the option of continuing it for a longer time. Margaret didn't see any problem with it and signed it with a big signature. Kim read the contract quickly and signed as well. And with that they would be allowed to switch bodies. Dan then took them each to a separate room where they would need to undress and put on the hospital gown. Then they could step into the Bodyswap chambers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now it finally had happened. Instead of the horrible look of her 39 year old body Margaret was looking at the body of Kim Taylor, or rather her body now for the month. Margaret couldn't believe how beautiful she looked and felt too. She felt way more fitter than before, it was weird touching her belly now, so tight now. And when she lifted the hospital gown to admire her new body, she was practically stunned. She never knew she could have such a good figure like this. And then her breasts, no sagging ones but breasts that still stood up straight and small nipples adorning her chest. Margaret wondered how they would feel, but that would be something to check out later. She wondered how Kim was doing inside her body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was staring at her naked body in the mirror. What could she say? This body looked bad, really bad. Clearly Margaret didn't work out much (or rather not at all). She saw all the fat at her stomach, her thighs and her legs. She touched it as she could almost not believe it. She really was inside Margaret's body. She now had the position she could only have dreamed of, but the cost. She could only stare as she felt her cheeks, chubby like the rest of her body. She hated this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she shouldn't think like that. Kim was determined to make the most of this, she needed to. This might be her only chance to allow herself to rise up through the ranks. She shouldn't waste this opportunity. And besides maybe she should make some changes in Margaret's life? Losing some weight wouldn't really hurt for one. Yeah, that was the spirit. She needed to make the most of it. And with that she held up her heavy bosom as she admired the cleavage she could create now. Perhaps Kim also needed to make a change to Margaret's wardrobe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho to follow from now on?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kim decided not to stare a minute longer in the mirror, at least not while she was here. She quickly walked over to the pile of clothes Margaret left for her. It was the weekends so Margaret was wearing some comfortable clothes. Some sweat pants with a grey hoodie and some basic white panties with bra. Holding the bra up Kim was amazed of the size of the thing. No wonder Margaret was always complaining with a pair of these any woman would. She quickly changed in the bra and panties, not trying to feel how snug the panties were surrounding her jiggling ass. She then put on the sweat pants, hoodie and sneakers. Looking in the mirror Kim found it weird to see her boss standing there instead of herself. Trying to smile a little, she grabbed the purse, and went outside to the reception area where she was called over by the receptionist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Ms. Taylor, Ms. Davis has asked me to give you this. It contains all the need to know information for the coming month.\" The receptionist handed Kim a file with all kind of documents, she would need them to be able to pretend to be Margaret. She made a file just like this for Margaret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, is Mar-Kim not out yet?\" Kim asked curious as the whereabouts of her former body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it seems she's still dressing up.\" The receptionist said uninterested before she had a call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Kim reckoned Margaret would be able to help herself, Kim decided to get to her new place of living. Outside of the building Kim quickly located Margaret's car, an old Mercedes. Somehow Kim always thought Margaret was the type to own something more expensive but never judge a book by it's cover. Kim stepped inside and could smell cigarettes. Apparently Margaret would even smoke inside her car. Well, that would be changing today. Kim hated smoking and if Margaret wanted to be in better shape she thought she should stop for her. Kim opened the file and quickly located the address. Starting the car, she took off for her new home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later she was standing in front of the lawn of a suburban home though a little deteriorated. The more Kim saw of Margaret's life the more she found she got the worst bargain ever. No, Kim shook ever, she needed to think positive. Kim opened the front door and called inside. Did anyone answer?</span></div></div>",

Kim noticed the hallway was kind of messy. Shoes were lying everywhere around and jackets were hanging right and left. Kim couldn't believe how messy it was. When Kim walked inside the living room she took a step backwards as her eyes almost bulged out. This was like a pigsty. Clothes were lying around everywhere; the dinner table wasn't cleaned up after this morning's breakfast and a pile of dishes was lying in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Margaret really live here? Kim pondered as she looked around. In her office everything was clean and spotless while her home resembled a garbage dump. With a sigh Kim rolled up her sleeves as she got to work. Kim put the clothes in the washing machine, did the dishes and vacuumed the floor. While cleaning she came across a note from Margaret's daughter saying she would stay over at a friend of hers. Kim couldn't blame the girl; who would want to live here? A few hours later Kim was finished and the living room looked a whole lot better now that it was cleaned up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Finally done.\" Kim said catching her breath. Margaret's body clearly wasn't used to doing so much work. Not to mention how sweaty she was. She could smell her armpits without holding her arms up. Kim made her way upstairs and to Margaret's room. As Kim entered the room she wasn't surprised by the mess in here. She knew her boss good enough know, to know that she wouldn't be any better cleaning her own bedroom. But for now Kim sat down on the bed; she would take of this room as well but after a well-deserving shower. Kim looked at the large mirror in the bedroom; a skirt hanging over it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was about to look at Margaret's body for a second time this day. It wasn't a sight she was happy about. She pulled off her clothes as she looked in the mirror. There she was Kim Davis in a body twenty years older; Kim stepped closer to the mirror as she saw the wrinkles on her face, her flabby arms, her chubby stomach and the cellulite that made her legs and ass so fat. She hoped that she would never turn out like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it happened. It was a sudden urge. Kim got nervous as she looked around herself for what it was. And  then her eyes rested on the pack of cigarettes on the night stand. Kim automatically walked over to it, but then she realized what she was about to do. She was about to go smoking, something she would never do. Kim walked backwards and turned herself around as she didn't want herself to be drawn. She needed to do something else. Anything else.</span></div></div>",

Really?\" He asked. \"Yeah I mean, what you'd think I'd swap with that jerk Kyle?\" Jake laughed \"haha I suppose your right...

It reads, \"Hi James or should I say Mrs. Johnson. You are now me and i am you. I overheard from other teachers that you were making fun of my big pregnant form. It is really hard teying to carry a life inside you for 10 momths without having to deal with snotnose kids like you. So you are permanently in my body and life forever. I get a second chance as a guy. Good luck shedding those pounds after the pregnancy. I already gained 75 pounds. Your husband loves to feed your large and weird cravings. And I am actually pregnant with twins. 34 weeks to be exact. Have fun and see you in class on monday Mrs. Johnson. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the two babies kick your bladder. Man, all of the sudden, cravings hit you very hard. You decide to head downstairs and notice the lavish house you are now going to live in forever. Memories hit you as you get to the bottom of the steps. You are Mrs. Samantha Johnson. You teach 11th grade U.S. History at the local high school. Your husband is actually a rich businessman. You only work just to feel fufilled and not lazy even though your husband makes more than enough for you to stay home. You make yourself a nice big fattening snack and waddle back upstairs and sit in the the bed cross legged so your belly is in the middle. You watch tv on the giant 4k tv in your bedroom. You have the day off because it is spring break. You sit and watch and stufd your face all day. You feel your belly growing bigger and your body gaining weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour husband comes home and wants to feed you and make love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",
