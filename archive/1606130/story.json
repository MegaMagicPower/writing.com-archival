Fearing the worse, I turned to face her when the bell rang. She had an evil smile on her face, and before i knew it, i was being dragged by my tie back to the clubroom. I swear, Haruhi has to live here, theres just to many odds and ends. <br>\r\n\"ok, you stay here.\"<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, Wait where are you-\" but she was already gone. <br>\r\nSighing, I realized That being the only one in the room was boring. Even Nagato wasn't here yet. That's probibly where Haruhi went, to go get everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo i sat down in one of the chairs, and turned on the laptop that was right there. As i did, i thought about Haruhi's computer. She's on it all the time, but we never see anything she does. </span></div></div>",

She had a few computer games, and the internet browser was up, nothing seemed outta the ordinary. <br>\r\nBut then I saw a folder hidden in the corner of her desktop. It was labled GTS, whatever that means. I figured, I'm bored anyway.<br>\r\nInside the folder, i found many pictures, and a few videos. It was kinda disturbing to finally know what haruhi looked at: Women, Fifty feet tall at least, smashing through towns. The video's showed girls Growing up to those hights, shreading there cloths. It was hard to belive that something like this excisted, but that didn't stop me from looking at it...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Well, this was definitely a direction I hadn\u2019t expected the day to take. Of course, unexpected occurrences are pretty common these days for me, but discovering that our ever-fearless and increasingly fear-inducing leader was into murder porn took a far different tone than the usual affairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Three different thoughts ran through my mind. One, do the others know about this? It seems like this would be even more incentive to make sure Haruhi never finds out anything about anything, so as silly as it is on the surface, it would probably be something they and their organizations would need to keep in mind. Two, how messed up is it that someone with this kind of a dangerous fetish has the power to make it happen? For that matter, if she\u2019s really into the idea of this, what if it happens even WITHOUT her directly trying? Even Koizumi couldn\u2019t rationalize it away if she or some other random girl suddenly ended up sprawled out on the streets at a hundred-plus feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    And thirdly, if she catches me looking at this, I\u2019m a dead man no matter what. This one struck me just in time, and no less than five seconds after I dove back into the safety of my own seat, in she came, followed closely by our resident Cheshire Cat. Smiling as incessantly as ever, Koizumi greeted me and sat down across the table, unsheathing a deck of cards for whatever our latest game would be. As usual, he gave no indication of whether or not he knew something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The next twenty minutes, by comparison, were unremarkable. Nagito entered and took up her designated place, I got my unusually distracted rear end handed to me in poker, and Ms. Supersadist presumably scrolled through and savored her unholy collection. Finally, while I was using half my brain to think about this new situation and the other half to try and determine if the grinning fool was bluffing again, Haruhi shot back up and proclaimed that she was going to track down the slightly tardy Miss Asahina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   I folded my hand, if only for the sake of speeding things up, and immediately briefed Koizumi on what I had just seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   His smile never wavered. \u201cIn a technical sense, that is news to me. Given recent events, however, I can\u2019t say it\u2019s all that surprising; in fact, it actually relates to something I wanted to discuss with you, and provides a rather easy answer for what had seemed like a difficult question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   What kind of recent events? It seemed to me like everything had been relatively normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cIn short, the last avatar I battled actually took the form of Miss Suzumiya itself. Not only that, but its behavior changed somewhat, too. From time to time, it paused its usual destruction of the local buildings to do some rather unsavory things to groups of imaginary people and other objects. I have to say, it was more than a little bit unsettling, in part because it was such a sudden transformation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Oh boy, that sure sounds promising. Well, as the resident Haruhi expert, any ideas as to why this is happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cObviously I can\u2019t give any theories with one-hundred-percent confidence, but to hazard a quick guess, I think it may be a simple matter of her discovering this fetish and craving the ability to act it out just like anybody else would. The manifestation of it in closed space could be seen as an additional way to subconsciously relieve a different kind of stress, if you know what I\u2019m saying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Can\u2019t say I really do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Now he seemed to grimace, if only for a bit. \u201cSexual frustration. It would be best not to go into excessive detail, but as I said, that entity did - or at least wanted to do - some rather unsavory things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Well, I suppose that\u2019s as good as official confirmation: somebody with the actual power of a goddess has sexual fantasies about killing scores of innocent people. As if I needed any more reasons to be so apprehensive of her. I voiced this sentiment, and Koizumi might have replied, but as the sound of movement in the hall got closer and closer he chose instead to resume his normal mask and deal us another hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It seemed to be just in time again. Miss Asahina, looking as usual lovely in ways I struggle to properly describe, entered with a slightly nervous face and her usual greetings. Nothing unusual there. Haruhi followed her in, closing the door behind her roughly, looking fired up about something or another. Business as usual there, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she opened her mouth.</span></div></div>",
