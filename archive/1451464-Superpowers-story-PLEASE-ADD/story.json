As Henry looked up, he saw a small ball of fire heading right towards him, at tremendous speed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" he wondered, as the ball of fire landed in the woods behind his house with a loud bang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry quickly got up and opened the wooden gate to the back yard, and walked outside. He was just tall enough to reach the latch on the gate, and he used both hands to push the door open, so he could go outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry knew he wasn't supposed to go outside, but his curiosity just had the best of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked into the woods, he spotted a odd, glowing object at a distance. As he came closer, he saw a small, blue rock, letting off a strange, blue light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was only wearing his sandals and his shorts, since it was very hot outside. He had been playing with his plastic truck and his small tricycle, pedaling around the back yard, when the meteor landed behind his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Henry approached the odd rock, the glow intensified. Then, when Henry got within six feet of the rock, a bold of bright light shot out of the center of the rock, striking Henry in the chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry immediately fell to the ground and passed out, laying close to the rock, as it continued to shower the boy with its odd, blue ray. A minute later, the rock's energy had depleted, and all of its alien power had transferred to the unconscious boy. The rock no longer glowed, and it turned to gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Henry woke up, to an odd feeling in his body. His muscles felt stiff and hard. He slowly got up, feeling dazed, and started walking back to his house. While walking back, Henry realized that he was getting heavier. His arms began to grow thicker; his shoulders widened a few inches; his chest stuck out further; his thighs were thicker and wider; and his calves were big and round and hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry stepped through the back door of the house and walked into the bathroom. He gasped, when he saw his reflection! He looked like a little gymnast! His shoulders were wider than before and his arms were really thick! He had abdominals now and his chest was sticking out by six inches. He had transformed into a little muscle boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... What the heck?\" he wondered, as he studied his physique in the mirror. He had changed, but in a way, he felt GREAT! He was STRONG! Very, VERY strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, his mother walked into the room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry... Uhh... Why did I call you that...\" his mom said. She shook her head and blinked for a moment when she saw him standing there. \"Herc... Uhh... Hercules, can you lift the car so I can change the tire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry stared at her with a quizzical look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Hercules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Hercules! What's the matter? We always called you that! Ever since you were born, because you've always been so strong!\" his mother replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you want me to... lift the car?\" Henry gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Herc! You've lifted things far heavier than that! What's the matter with you? Are you feeling alright?\" his mother asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure, mom! I'm fine! I've never felt better! I feel strong!\" Henry replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now, lift my car so I can get that flat tire off, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, mom...\" Henry - now Hercules - said, as he walked to teh garage, where his mom's sedan was parked...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They're twins, both thirteen. My mom and dad are always busy with some project, either apart or together but they still find time for the three of us. Sirius and Zoe are a bit weird, fighting over the strangest things such as herbs and who knows what kind of gadgets....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the point, my entire world turned upside down on my eighth birthday. I had just stepped out of the shower that morning and felt as if something was missing. I looked down and discovered a very important thing was missing, I had somehow turned into a girl! The high pitched scream that echoed from my throat would have cracked windows if I had not fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up, I found myself sitting on a couch, wearing a pink dress! I screamed again but someone touched my shoulder and I turned to find my mother and sister there, both grinning at me. \"Easy, Cire.\" cooing me, mom said. \"Take a deep breath so we can explain what is going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hand touched my other shoulder and I turned the other way to find dad and brother, also grinning, though their grin seemed a bit more sad. \"Compose yourself, son.\" softly, dad said. \"There is much for us to discuss regarding your current situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a breath, though it did not help much and mom began. \"First off, I am a witch.\" summoning a bright blue flame to her hand, mom said. \"Zoe is a witch as well, we command the powers of magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sirius and I are both mad scientists, we command the powers of chaotic energy.\" summoning a bright green flame to his hand. \"We are the pinnacle of technology, the masters of the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drama king.\" snorting, mom said. she then turned back to me. \"You, my dearest daughter, have the benefit of carrying a potential for both powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, the mixing of two 'magics' is very dangerous.\" serious, dad added. \"You, my gender confused <i>son</i>, must choose which power you wish to become a master of.\" he then smiled. \"Old school magic or new and exciting mad science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, dear...\" throwing dad a dagger look, mom asked. \"Old school...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You basically tip the balance in this household, Cire.\" looking at you, Zoe said. \"Only none of us can force the decision you must make.\" she then smiled. \"You must admit, though, you make a very cute girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed brightly at Zoe's attempt at a compliment then turned to Sirius as he spoke. \"The decision must be of your own free will.\" serious, he said. then he too smiled. \"You were born a boy, it is what you are used to seeing in the mirror every day. Why make your life complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four then fell into a 'polite' argument, forcing me to cover my ears. <i>\"Happy birthday, Cire.\"</i> sarcastically, I thought. <i>\"Your present is a major headache.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat am I to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Isaac woke to the sound of his alarm clock. It was nine o'clock in the morning of a Saturday, which was the perfect day for a birthday. His birthday to be exact. At midnight he'd turned ten years old, and he was ready for his party. At the moment he was only in his boxers, which were all he wore to sleep, so he quickly rushed to the bathroom to shower. When he got there he took a moment to look himself over in the mirror. He was average height for his age, about 4'5'', with medium length blond hair in a style like slightly shorter skater hair, and blue eyes. He had a fairly athletic body, and he was a pretty athletic boy so it made sense. He made an effort to do parkour, and it was a serious effort to work his entire body, and the results showed, his pecs showed a little, and he could flex a good four pack and biceps, and he had to admit he was proud of all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he also didn't want to let his pride get the best of him, so he kept it up, just to keep his body in top shape. He'd remembered reading about the Greeks and how they trained their body and mind because they believed each benefited the other. And he believed that too. So he worked out both. \"Isaac!\" his mother called \"Hurry up in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess I have to work on my punctuality,' he thought sheepishly as he turned the shower on. He quickly stripped, got showered, and got out. He dried off and wrapped a towel around his waist as he made his way back to his room where he put on fresh boxers, blue and white athletic shorts, and a white and blue sleeveless shirt. Then he dashed downstairs, rushing right by his older brother, Jacob who was twelve. \"Jeeze Issac, slow down,\" he heard his brother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Jake!\" he called. \"Hey mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning dear,\" his mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac's mom was in decent shape for her age, partly from trying to keep up with him and her hair was dirty blond. \"You're going to the skatepark in a little bit right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! I'm meeting my friends there, we'll come back here later for cake and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he did as he said he would. About an hour and a half later he was on his way to the skatepark where he met his friends. They mostly just hung out, skateboarded and talked. They tried to best each other's tricks. It was during Isaac's own attempt at one that the first significant event of the day occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was on his board and barreling down the half-pipe, then up the other side and into the air. Then, just as he was about to perform his trick he felt like something had pierced his body, causing him to go completely numb and lose consciousness. As a result he fell onto the ramp hard and slid down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, though he'd lost consciousness he felt like something was happening. He could hear voices. \"Do you think he's ready?\" one of them said, a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is his tenth birthday, the very day he shall receive the Powers of the Angel,\" a male voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that is Its will, than we cannot deny it,\" the woman replied, \"But to burden one so young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not underestimate human children. They have such great potential and are much stronger than we think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're rii... Isaac? Isaac!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac sat up straight, hearing one of his friend's voices. \"Woah! I'm okay! I'm fine,\" he said to the crowd that had gathered around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you had us worried,\" one of his friends, Matt, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was a bad fall,\" Carson, another friend, added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. My head feels like shit, but I'm fine other than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So dude, you down to keep chillin' here or do you want to go home and rest?\" Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac was thinking of the weird dream he'd had while unconscious, so it took him a moment to address Matt's question. \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

Where did he go?\" Carson panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right behind you, dude!\" a calm voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson turned around and saw Isaac standing behind him with his arms folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAAH! How did you do THAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I teleported! I can teleport me... And others too! I just need to decide where to send you and off you go!\" Isaac replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in an instant, Carson and Isaac were standing in Isaac's bedroom! With their boards on the ground before them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! How did I get here so fast?\" Carson exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My new powers, dude!

It was about then that Isaac heard something he didn't like. \"There you are you little shit,\" came the voice of a boy about two or three years older than him, \"Did you get the money for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, no I-I forgot,\" replied a boy who sounded about two years younger than him, \"I will though Ryan, just give me more time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac hopped off his board and ran towards the sound and saw, behind some trees, an eight year old boy with blond hair and fair skin opposing a thirteen year old boy with black hair. As he arrived he saw Ryan, the older boy, lift the younger boy up by the shirt. \"I'll just give you a reminder then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Leave him alone,\" Isaac called, dashing over to the confrontation as Ryan dropped his victim and looked at him in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who the hell are you?\" he asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaac. Now what the hell's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This little fag broke my skateboard a week ago and he hasn't paid me back,\" Ryan explained, \"Now get the hell out my way or I'll teach you to mind your own damn business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an accident,\" the younger boy piped up from behind Isaac, \"We crashed into each other and I broke one end off when I fell. I didn't do it on purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you said you'd pay me back,\" Ryan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only 'cause you said you'd break my nose if I didn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna break both your noses if you don't shut up and get out from behind that fag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit dude, you're not going to fight him are you?\" said one of Ryan's two friends suddenly, who until now had been leaning against a tree and watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? When did you two become such chickshits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This kid said his name's Isaac. I just recognized him, he's Isaac Turner, you know, that kid who's a brown belt in like, three martial arts. He did this demonstration at the park on the fourth of July.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm actually only a brown belt in two martial arts, I'm only a white stripe green belt in the third,\" Isaac corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet I could still take him,\" Ryan added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way dude! I heard that Jake tried to fight him and he ended up with his shoulder dislocated and three bruises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's bullshit, come on! Fight me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac sighed, \"Is there any way I could persuade you not to fight me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, is that wittle baby scared?\" Ryan asked mockingly, before aiming a punch right at Isaac's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac swiftly stepped aside and brought his arm down onto Ryan's back. Though he wasn't trying too hard he was shocked to see the blow sent Ryan hurtling into the ground hard and he made the loud groan of someone who'd been winded. \"My back!\" the older boy gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! You weren't supposed to try and kill him,\" Ryan's friend said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't trying to. That shouldn't have hurt him that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it did, now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on,\" Isaac said, pulling back Ryan's shirt and feeling his back for any extreme damage. \"His spine is fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, but seriously, what do we do now?\"</span></div></div>",

The injury wasn't bad enough to require 911, but Ryan also didn't seem like he'd be able to walk for at least a few hours. \"Dude, I didn't know you were that strong,\" Matt said, running up to him, \"I've seen you strike like that before, it doesn't usually do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, was this my fault?\" the younger boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could it be your fault?\" Isaac asked, \"I don't think I ever got your name either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron. And I did break his skateboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By accident. It was my strike that's injured him, so it's my fault,\" Isaac said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Ryan's fault for insisting on fighting you,\" Carson added, \"I'd say it's his own damn fault he's like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah I guess that's right too,\" Isaac admitted hesitantly, \"But I already threw his back out, I didn't want to slam a guy when he's down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can hear you,\" Ryan groaned, \"I'm still conscious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Isaac replied, \"It's called the silent treatment. Apologize to Aaron and we'll include you. And you have to mean it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Isaac's friends, and Aaron, began to chat, Isaac had knelt next to Ryan and begun feeling along his back for where the damage was. 'I wish I could make this at least a little better,' Isaac thought to himself. 'Hmm... Powers of the Angel.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't really know what to expect, but he knew angels in fiction could use light, and light could be used to heal. It wasn't much, but it was at least <i>an</i> idea. So he focused on trying to heal Ryan's back, restore the ruptured blood vessels and mend the strained muscles. And as he thought this he was surprised to see his hands glowing with faint white light. \"Guys! Look!\" he called to his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Are you friggin glowing?\" Carson asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say yeah, he is,\" Dillon replied, \"Not sure if you needed to point out that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you feeling Ryan?\" Isaac asked as he moved his glowing hand over the older boy's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually a little better. What the hell are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but apparently it's healing you. Will you apologize to Aaron if I finish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you apologize to Aaron if I finish? I don't want to heal you up just to punch your lights out again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh, sure, I'll apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac felt like Ryan was telling the truth, so he continued, and a few seconds later Isaac withdrew his hand, feeling Ryan was fully healed. He was proven correct when Ryan got to his feet. \"I don't know what you did dude, but I feel like that never even happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Now,\" Isaac said and gestured to Aaron, \"Apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... sorry,\" Ryan grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough,\" Aaron replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't they both pay for the new skateboard?\" Tristan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ryan and Aaron asked at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since you crashed into each other, you're both at fault, so therefore you should split the cost evenly between yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think of that,\" Ryan replied simply, \"Well kid, wanna do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! You know you only need to replace the deck, so that's much cheaper,\" Aaron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think of that eith- oh shit!\" he cried glancing at the time on his phone, \"I gotta go! See you later Aaron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, he called me by my name,\" Aaron said cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he was just angry, not mean,\" Isaac said, \"Hey do you want to come to my house? It's my birthday party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Just like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sick!\" Aaron cheered, \"Alright! Let's get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way Isaac, that light healing thing you did,\" said Matt, \"What was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Isaac replied with a shrug, \"I'm starting to get hungry, and that's all I'm thinking about. Let's go home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac was much more curious than he let on though. He just wasn't sure when he wanted to get to studying this new power of his, and what the full extent of it was.</span></div></div>",

He was only eleven, but his grandfather, the grandmaster of the Shadow Serpent Clan, inducted his order's members when they were five; at the oldest. He still fondly remembered that day; seeing his grandfather's incredible martial arts skills and hearing all the good the Shadow Serpents did and he knew that was what he wanted. Several black gis, belts and years later he was here, ready to take his next step towards being a ninja of the Shadow Serpent clan. His black hair was spiked like always, his emerald green eyes filled with resolve. He wore his best black gi and, of course, his blue belt, as well as a katana sheathed on his back. \"I'm ready sensei,\" he said at last, speaking out into the dimly lit room. The low light allowed only minimal vision because, after all, a ninja is at home in the shadows. He knew the room to be about the size of a small gymnasium anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warning, not that Ethan expected any, blows struck from multiple directions. Ethan struck back just as swiftly and silently. He was fighting Shadow Dummies, constructs of shadow magic that behaved basically as puppets to the summoner. It was his grandfather who was controlling them and using them as test targets. And Ethan did pretty well, using his katana skillfully, and his fists just as much. This was where he excelled; melee combat. The parts of the test he was more concerned with hadn't started yet. Finally the last of the Shadow Dummies fell and no more appeared. Ethan's grandfather appeared from the shadows; an athletic looking old man, caucasian like himself despite the art they practiced, with a white beard and moustache, twinkling blue eyes, and wearing a dark cloak. \"You did well Ethan. Now return to the waiting area while I prepare the next section of the test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan bowed and left the testing room and returned to a small, well lit room with a few chairs and meditation mats, as well as an exit to the outside hallway and a pair to the changing rooms. The next two parts of the test were the Chi Direction and Stealth sections. He was pretty good at the latter, not so great at the former, which involved directing one's chi energy into the forms of a Chinese element. Usually he only managed to create a burst of water that was no different than squirting someone with a spray bottle, or a flame that was better off on a candle than in a fight or as a distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gong sounded the beginning of the next section of his test, and he left the waiting room to find...</span></div></div>",

You tried, and barely succeeded, to look normal as you walked past your dad's personal study, which was set near the door so that he could tell when people entered or exited.<br>\r\n \"Dad, I'm going to the park.\" You said, and felt your heart skip a beat when you heard your voice and the barely concealed glee that was so easy to hear. You were about to open the door when you heard a quick yell from the library.<br>\r\n \"Did you do your homework?\" He asked through the study door in his unusually loud voice. You cringed a little, both from the idea he might wake your mom, and that he might have figured out that you left your homework for tomorrow.<br>\r\n \"Yes.\" You said a bit too fast as you opened the door. Your dad was about to ask why you were talking so quickly when you closed the door with a quick \"Bye dad!\" As your dad wondered if he should check your homework, or if you were trustworthy enough to leave be, you began the fairly short walk to the park at a quick yet not too fast jog, hoping to get away from your dad before he could check your homework.</span></div></div>",

You walked along, practically in a daze, as the peaceful summer world slowly passed by. As you reached the street crossing, you felt a small pang of guilt for tricking your parents, but decided it was fine if you did your work tomorrow. As you crossed, you heard a car coming fast, and realized that in the trance like state you had been in, you had completely ignored traffic. You raised your hands to cover your face as your life flashed before your eyes.<br>\r\nThere was a screech, a click, a crack, and everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff was having a horrible day. First he messed up nearly everything at work, then he found that someone broke his bumper by running into it, then he sat on his dinner in the car, and finally, every single light was red. Jeff hated today, and was going 60 miles an hour on the way home to relieve the stress. He didn't know why, but he loved going fast. he was just about to make the turn onto his street when some random kid walked into the middle of the street, right in front of the car. The kid seemed to just notice him, and covered his face as Jeff hit the brakes. There was a screech as the brakes kicked in, and just before he hit the kid, the world seemed to slow down. Jeff saw the terrified kid cowering with their face covered, the speedometer slowly dropping from 60, and his own sweating hands. Oddly enough, just before he hit the kid, he could have sworn he heard a click. It was quiet, but had a kind of authority, and Jeff was sure everyone within 5 miles could hear it. Then the car hit the kid, and there was a loud cracking sound, though Jeff still saw the world in slow motion. The kid bent at an angle that Jeff was sure no one could survive, and as the kid shot through the air, it was as if time were slowly taking effect. The boy seemed to accelerate as he flew, eventually hitting a tree in someones front lawn and falling to the ground in a heap. The car finally stopped and Jeff leaped out, ignoring the beeping that told him the door was open, and stopping only long enough to remove his seat belt. He reached the boy and thought he seemed darker in every aspect than when he had been hit. He picked up the boy and carried him to the nearest house. He knocked and rocked a little on his heels, silently urging the owners of the house to be home and be quick. Just as he was deciding to try the next house, the door opened. A woman with brown hair that reached her hips, cloudy green eyes that were almost gray, and a decent figure looked out and seemed shocked by the boy in Jeff's arms.<br>\r\n \"He needs help!\" Jeff said, breaking the silence, as he walked towards the door. \"Call the hospital!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was hoping she could go to the movies today. She hated waiting and had to admit to herself that she was a bit spoiled. She had heard of a new movie out, though at the moment the name escaped her, and had also heard that her friends were seeing it today. She begged and begged and eventually her parents agreed as long as she did her homework first and studied for half an hour. She was in the middle of her homework and was sitting at the dining room table when she heard a sharp knock on the door. Deciding it couldn't be too important, she finished her problem and went to open the door. She looked out in shock to see a man carrying a boy, the tree in the front yard seemed different, perhaps shifted a bit, and there was a car with two noticeable dents on the front. One dent seemed to be from a car bumper, the other from something smaller, perhaps a small animal. She looked again at the man, and realized he lived on her street. He had carefully cut and combed black hair, blue eyes, and was maybe two or three inches taller than her. She looked at the boy in his arms and had a jolt, looking over the boy she knew from school. He sat near her, and though smart, he cared more about enjoying himself than working. Before she could think and remember his name, the man spoke up.<br>\r\n \"He needs help!\" The man said, just as Sarah realized the man was named Jeff and the boy was bent at a horrible angle. The man began walking towards the door and followed up by saying \"Call the hospital!\"<br>\r\n This jolted Sarah into action, and she ran for the phone, dialing 911 the moment she could touch the numbers. The phone only rang for a second, maybe because they were free of calls on such a peaceful day, maybe because it was the emergency number, or maybe for some other reason.<br>\r\n \"How can I help you?\" A kind female voice said over the phone. Sarah barely kept from screaming at her, but kept her voice under control.<br>\r\n \"At my house, A man just walked up with an injured boy we need help.\" There was only a moment's hesitation before the voice responded.<br>\r\n \"Where do you live?\" Sarah thought through the nervousness and remembered her address. \"My address is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom sighed as the doctor came into the lobby, with a look on his face that suggested that there was bad news. As the doctor approached, he looked over his clipboard one last time before speaking.<br>\r\n \"Ma am, your son will live,\" He began, eliciting a relived sigh from the woman he was speaking to. He continued on after allowing her to calm down a bit first. \"However, he is in a coma, and there is another strange thing.

She continued to laugh for a minute before she stopped and looked at him.<br>\r\n \"Good one, but I know as well as anyone that doesn't happen to people. So,\" She said, her face becoming serious. \"what really happened?\" Paul (the doctor) sighed and looked at her sternly before continuing.<br>\r\n \"Would you like to see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to a black room with no memory whatsoever. You thought and thought and for a scary second you couldn't remember your own name. And yet, after a moment, it came to you.<br>\r\n \"Dan.\" You said, which seemed to prompt a swift flow of memories. You remembered everything, from leaving your homework to getting hit by a car by a loose memory of being carried then put into an ambulance. You looked around expecting to see a hospital room or maybe, if you were lucky you would see your bedroom with the lights still out.<br>\r\n But instead, you saw nothing. Before anything else, you assumed you may be blind, then that there may be something in front of your eyes. These ideas were instantly demolished as you saw a small light come into focus, and the floor, a rocky black substance that seemed to reflect light came into view. You took a step forward, then another, though why you didn't quite know. You eventually stopped in front of what seemed to be a large alter, and waited, wondering why you were there. You still were wondering when a person began to take shape on the alter. You gazed in both awe and fear as a person, or more specifically a middle aged man in rags that were probably once nice clothes, appeared on the alter. He stood taller than he should, about seven feet tall, with ragged black hair that reached his shoulders and deep, thoughtful brown eyes. You gazed for a minute after he finished materializing and, deciding you should speak, asked your first question.<br>\r\n \"Where are we?\" The man seemed to notice you for the first time as you spoke up, and he seemed to consider the question for a moment before responding.<br>\r\n \"We are in your mind.\" He said in a deep, ominous voice that was giving the feeling of confidence.<br>\r\n \"In my mind?\"<br>\r\n \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n \"But it doesn't look anything like I think it should.\" But even as the words left your mouth you realized that it was just like you expected.<br>\r\n \"Ah, but aren't you thinking \"A dead place for a dead person.\" ?\" You stared in surprise as he seemed to read your mind, and he just smiled a dark smile.<br>\r\n \"I was hit by a car, shouldn't I be dead?\"<br>\r\n \"No,\" He responded, getting a serious face immediately. \"you are alive because I changed you. People of your world are beginning to doubt the powers they don't understand, so I am fixing it. I am changing you and others in your world and giving them abilities. If you search the worldwide news, you will find that there were many other accidents at the exact same time as yours. The others will survive as well, and so I explain and leave you a choice.\" The man explained, gazing down at you and making you feel weak and insignificant by comparison.<br>\r\n \"Explain what?\" You asked nervously.<br>\r\n \"You see, each of you has been given a power of some kind or another. What I wish to explain are the basics of your powers, and what they may do. Yours is the most unorthodox and at the same time potent power of all those I have given. Yours is the power of evolution itself.\"<br>\r\n \"Evolution?\"<br>\r\n \"Yes, evolution. Your ability will be both your blessing and your curse. With it, you may imagine almost any change and enter a metamorphic state. By doing this, you can change small things about yourself, from eye color to breathing underwater. Yours is also vulnerable for a few reasons. For one, in the metamorphic state, the slightest wandering of thoughts can change the result of the transformation. Another is that the more drastic the change, the longer you must stay in the cocoon you grow when changing.\" The word cocoon made you gasp and your eyes felt like they were bugging out of your head. Before he continued, you could swear that there was a flicker of a smile on the man's face.<br>\r\n \"Yes, you enter a cocoon for a time. If anything breaks through the fairly flimsy cocoon, you will be completely unprotected until either you grow a new cocoon, or the evolution finishes. Luckily for you, for anything but the most drastic of changes, you will only remain in the cocoon for a few minutes. Also, of all the abilities given, yours is the most easily noticed. What this implies is that it will be hard to hide the changes that occur on your body. If I may make a recommendation, perhaps it would be wise to make yourself a powerful creature early on and change only slightly when needed.\"<br>\r\n \"What if I don't want to do this and become a freak?\" You asked, earning you a very serious glare from the man.<br>\r\n \"Then I will remove the power and your body will cave in from the injuries.\" You frowned, liking this option even less.<br>\r\n \"Alright,\" You said, giving in. \"How do I enter the state of...um...metamorphosis you called it?\"<br>\r\n \"You simply lay down, relax, and imagine the change happening. Also, in the metamorphic state, time will seem to go extremely quickly.\"<br>\r\n You sighed, not liking this one bit.<br>\r\n \"Three more questions.\" You said firmly. \"One, how can I tell where there are others like me with your \"Blessings\" ?\"<br>\r\n \"They will seem to radiate energy, but be warned, you do the same, and they can use this to find you.\"<br>\r\n \"Two, how do I get out of my head?\"<br>\r\n \"Simple, you are currently in your first metamorphic state. Any after this, time will just seem to go quickly, but this time I brought the two of us into your mind to speak. Imagine the changes you want, and wait.\"<br>\r\n \"Third, what-\" You began, before being interrupted.<br>\r\n \"What am I?\" You nodded, again amazed by his power. \"I am no god, since that is what you're thinking. I am a spirit with great power from long ago.\"<br>\r\nThe man then faded away, the words \"That was three.\" echoing in the air itself for a full ten seconds after he disappeared. Dan sighed and concentrated on what he should be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul led the woman into the room and as he opened the door he said \"Here is your son, I warned you.\"<br>\r\nShe looked in and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sighed and concentrated on what you might want changed. Obviously, you wanted to keep as close to normal as possible, but at the same time give yourself a few perks. You started with the most obvious ones and worked up. Water breathing, increased strength, a bit taller, faster would be useful, fire breath, thermal vision, and the ability to stick to walls at will. Thinking more deeply, you decided to think how each power would work. Small gills on the base of your neck for water breathing, but as small as possible while still able to breath and skin color of course. A tiny bit more muscle on the arms and legs for strength and speed. Slight change on leg length, though you would have to think deeply on fire breath. Thermal vision was obviously allowing your mind to switch between the normal vision apparent in most creatures and a slightly more rare ability to detect heat. The ability to stick to walls was a challenge, but you eventually remembered something on TV about the gecko and it's special method of sticking. So, you decided to set it up so that you could pull the tiny hairs used to get the \"molecular contact\" or whatever it was that geckos used to stick to walls on and off the face of your hands and tips of your feet. After a bit of thought, you decided that it would work for some food and drink (especially flammable foods and drinks) to be sent semi-instinctively to a second stomach, or fire stomach as you dubbed it. By semi-instinctively you were thinking like breathing, where you can stop but otherwise it automatically happens. Anyway, in the fire stomach, it would be converted into a flammable gaseous mixture whereupon it could be released at will from the compressed second stomach and ignited by a flame produced partway up the throat. For good measure, you decided to make your hands just slightly more thick for normal climbing and swinging, to avoid tiring your hands and to keep from getting callused.<br>\r\n After finishing your thoughts, you thought of returning to the waking world. After a few moments thought, you awoke to a hospital room and just for a second, you could imagine it was all a dream, and that you were recovering from the crash at a normal hospital. It all seemed possible imagining the dream you had. You stayed laying down for a few minutes and relaxed, when your dreams were shattered.<br>\r\n You felt a thin layer pull off of your body, something small at the base of your neck on each side fold in, a small change in your neck, the feeling of hundreds, if not thousands of hairs fold into your hands and a certain part of your feet, and a feeling of strength in your arms and legs. At the same time you saw a thin dark layer fold off of your body and seemingly into your skin, and you saw the world quickly flash from normal to a colored view you assumed was thermal vision, back to normal. You sighed and were about to get up when you heard a door open and heard a voice.<br>\r\n \"Daniel?\" Not only was the voice familiar, but the owner of the voice said your full name, and the only person who used that was...<br>\r\n \"Hi mom.\" You said, sitting up and looking into her deep, blue eyes that were nothing like your brown eyes. She stood 5'4\", or 5'7\" if you counted the high heels she was wearing. She was about 50 by your estimate and looked younger, though she was beginning to show signs of age. She looked at you for just a moment before beginning to get teary and rushed forward to hug you.<br>\r\n \"Daniel, you're alright! I was so worried about you, especially when the doctor made up that lie about you being in a cocoon.\"<br>\r\n \"Really, I feel fine.\" You stood, and found you were taller as well. Normally, your mom was just taller while wearing her high heels. But now, you seemed to have gained at least five inches, and were now taller than her. She looked at you, seeming to notice this as well.<br>\r\n \"Wow, you grew so fast! How long was I missing the growth spurts?\"<br>\r\n \"I don't know.\" You said, deciding to change the subject.<br>\r\n \"Are we going home?\"<br>\r\n \"As soon as you're ready, we can go.\" She responded. By this time the doctor seemed to have regained his speech and curtly disagreed.<br>\r\n \"No, you should stay. I know what I saw and I need to know what happened.\" You ignored him, but at the same time your mom seemed to be outraged.<br>\r\n \"Why, you're still insisting upon that stupid, idiotic idea that he grew a cocoon?! Leave us alone or I'll force you aside!\" You were slightly shocked by this, since your mom rarely did anything rash like that.<br>\r\n \"Come on, let's go.\" She said, spinning angrily on her heels.</span></div></div>",

You smiled even wider, deciding that after the day's events no one would blame you for skipping your homework. You closed and locked the door before beginning to practice the abilities you had given yourself. You started with the wall sticking, which worked fine though it took some practice to get used to it. You followed up with practicing the fire breath, then the thermal vision. Though the thermal vision worked, the fire breath barely did anything. After a moment's thought, you decided it was probably that you hadn't eaten since you got the power and, in turn, you didn't have any food in your fire stomach. You thought and decided that you probably would need another week or so to get used to the powers you now had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, gazing ever more intently at the TV and hoping yet again you were wrong. There had been more and more news reports on a group of people, mostly kids between 10 and 17, though by no means were those the limits, who went by the title \"The blessed\" who were going around committing crimes in the strangest ways. For example, there was one child of about 14 who seemed to have control of fire, going so far as making it shoot out of his hands and melting things. Worse, it was getting so bad the police were using lie detectors to check if people were one of the members or if they had powers at all. They hadn't done you yet but it was only a matter of time before either the police checked you or \"The blessed\" arrived and tried to recruit you...or worse... It was getting bad enough where you were whether wether you should just leave before your parents took the blow. You were nervous of when someone would figure out what you were.</span></div></div>",

You frowned and walked up to your room to get ready for bed, doubting you would get the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeid waited as Anne continued to search, waiting intently for the result. Eventually she seemed to wake, though he knew she had finished the search.<br>\r\n \"Well, what did you find?\" He saw her face change from the sleepy, bored look that she always had after searching to a more serious, yet slightly surprised look.<br>\r\n \"Well, I only found two here, but here's the thing. One of them was strong though they were weak from overusing their power, the other was very strong, stronger than most, yet they had barely used their power.<br>\r\n \"How strong were they?\"<br>\r\n \"The first one was about as strong as a high soldier who used their power a lot, so maybe they're stronger, just weak from overuse. The other was amazing, their power was almost as strong as the soldier commander, and it seemed to be slowly growing.\" Keid's eyes widened at this, since the soldier commander was the third strongest of all of them. If this person's power was growing...<br>\r\n \"This one is too powerful, we need to get them on our side, no other option. Let's go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirius smiled at the daily profits of his profession. He was a beggar and a thief, and he used to be weak and unskilled, but now, he was almost the opposite. It all started when he gained powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirius ran, having yet again failed to pull of the theft. He fingered the silver necklace which was the only item that was well and truly his, while continuing to run. He ran for a full five minutes before he saw them stop. He stopped, turned, stuck his tongue out at them, and looked to see where he was. His eyes widened as he saw he was in the building under construction, right in the shadow of a large metal beam being lowered. Sirius was about to run when he heard a snap and the beam fell. He shielded his eyes, and just before the impact, he heard a click, then a thump, felt a flash of pain, and the world blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sirius awoke in a luxurious bed and looked around. He saw he was in what seemed to be a high up room in a castle, maybe a king's room. He saw a middle aged man in nice rags slowly advance, then the man spoke.<br>\r\n \"Welcome, I am here to explain what I have given you.\"<br>\r\n \"Given me? What are you talking about? Where are we?\" Sirius asked in confusion.<br>\r\n \"To answer your second question, we are in your mind,\" The man said, before continuing. \"As for what I am giving, I am giving you a blessing, or a power if you will.\" Sirius was confused, and was getting worried about this man.<br>\r\n \"My mind? Then how-\"<br>\r\n \"How did we get here?\" Sirius merely stared in suprise and nodded.<br>\r\n \"I brought us here, the most private place I can currently bring you. But why we are here is so I can explain the blessing you now have. I have given you the power of shadow, to use as you will. The powers it grants will get stronger over time, but for now simply try changing your shadow into another living thing under your control for practice.\"<br>\r\n \"Of course, nothing is free of charge, so your body will change with the acquisition of powers.\" Even as the man said this, Sirius screamed as his skin seemed to burn and itch and stretch, yet he could still hear the man.<br>\r\n \"You will be able to sense others with a power as they will you, all you have to do is look for people who seem to radiate energy.\"<br>\r\n \"But what happens if I say no to this power?\" He said curiously, earning a serious glare.<br>\r\n \"Then I will remove the blessing and you will die from being hit with a steel beam.\"<br>\r\n \"Why are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n \"Because people of your world are losing faith in that they don't understand. And before you ask,\" He said, seeming to read Sirius's mind. \"To leave, merely imagine being back in the real world.\"<br>\r\nThe man vanished, and with nothing else to do, Sirius imagined leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirius awoke under a steel beam, and with a quick push, rolled it off of him. He looked around to find the cheery, warm day had descended into night. He searched and found two things. One was that his silver necklace had, surprisingly, remained undamaged. The other thing was that his skin was no longer pale, but a dark brownish black. Alternatively, his hair had stayed the blond he used to have. He stood and walked back to his cardboard box, hoping to try his power the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirius thought about it and realized just how weak he used to be. He sat down in his favorite of the forgotten chairs and continued to practice his powers. He smiled, thinking of how he had changed from a weak thief to a weak 13 year old with no understanding of his power to what he was today. He smiled, once again changing into a shadow then back, watching the TV that the former owners of the house had forgotten during their escape from the \"Haunted\" house Sirius now lived in. He especially liked the TV, even if it was a cheap little wind up thing that most would call cheap. He smiled a third time and stopped as he reached a news broadcast of The Blessed, and tuned in to watch it. He hated them and their flourishing use of their powers. They were just making people like him have a hard time keeping secret. He sighed and changed the channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a knock at the door, and looked out to see who it was. You saw a boy and a girl, both about 14 or 15, and they began talking to your mam as you looked. You walked to the balcony and looked down on the main room.<br>\r\n \"Hello?\" You heard your mom say to the two, obviously curious to who they were.<br>\r\n \"Hi, do you have powers?\" The boy asked while the girl just stood there, looking aroud as though searching for something...or someone...<br>\r\n \"No, why?\" You heard your mom ask, confused.<br>\r\n \"Does anyone in the house?\"<br>\r\n \"Not that I know of. Who are you?\"<br>\r\n \"That doesn't matter, what matters is-\" The boy stopped as the girl put her hand on his arm and spoke for the first time.<br>\r\n \"I sense they is upstairs.\" At this, both looked up, while your mom looked confused.<br>\r\n \"But only Daniel is up there.\" She said as she looked up, though the two teens had already spotted you.<br>\r\n \"Is that him?\" The boy asked, seeming anxious.<br>\r\n \"Yes, why?\"<br>\r\n \"We need to talk to him now!\" The boy said forcefully.<br>\r\n \"Not until you tell me who you are.\" Your mom said angrily. The boy scowled for a moment before answering.<br>\r\n \"We are recruiters for The Blessed, and we want your son.\" He said, even as the girl advanced towards the stairs. Your mom noticed this and walked in front of the two of them.<br>\r\n \"If you are who you say you are, you're wanted by the police, and also, leave Daniel alone!\" The boy seemed to be getting angry, and finally put his hand out, causing a branch to sprout out of the boards on the floor and start strangling your mom. Meanwhile, the girl seemed to turn into pure air and disappear.<br>\r\n \"Mom!\" You yelled, before jumping down the two stories between you and the boy controlling the branch. There was a small shockwave as you hit the ground, and the boy seemed to get nervous at your landing. Before anything else, you ripped the branch off your mom's throat and carefully set her unconscious body to the side before attacking the boy. You started by breathing fire, which surprised him and put an expression of pure fear on his face.<br>\r\n \"But you can only have one power!\" He yelled, barely dodging a second blast of fire and attempting to put out the flames on his shirt.</span></div></div>",

You punched and hit him straight in the jaw, knocking him to the floor unconscious with your extra strength. You walked over to literally throw him out when you heard a voice on the air itself.<br>\r\n \"If you move, I will enter your mother's lungs and cause them to burst.\" The voice threatened. You realized it was the girl, and slowly stood, hands up, and turned to your mother. At first it seemed there was no one there, but by changing to thermal vision you saw some of the air was warmer than the rest.<br>\r\n \"Change back, I can see you.\" You said with a smirk.<br>\r\n \"No, you're bluffing, no one can see air.\" You sighed and blew a jet of fire at the warm patch of air and were rewarded by a scream.<br>\r\n \"B-b-b-but no one c-c-c-c-can see me!\" She said in shock. You smiled and blew another jet of flame to where she was floating. There was another scream and she reappeared, looking absolutely terrified.<br>\r\n \"P-p-p-please don't hurt m-me.\" She begged. You walked over and, partially in pity and partially because you had never killed, you knocked her unconscious. You grabbed her and the boy and carried them to the dump a few blocks away. You returned home, closed the door and sighed. So much for more time. You started by writing a note to your mom so she could understand what happened when she woke. Next you prepared a bag of things for survival. You grabbed what could be useful and checked everything off in your head. Biggest travel bag you could find, check. Changes of clothes for a week, check. Food for two weeks, check. Survival knife, check. About $1000 in cash, check. various survival tools like a lighter, matches (yes, both just in case), three pocket knives, a shotgun, sniper rifle, two pistols and an Uzi from your dad's personal collection of guns(thank you dangerous collecting habits), ammo for all the weapons (again, thank you collections), and various items for sleep like blankets, pillows, a sleeping bag, two flashlights, two whole packs of batteries, and a laser pointer (who knows what could help?). You looked for anything else helpful and were about to pack when your eyes aligned on your families ancestral scimitar. Normally for show, it could be helpful...<br>\r\n \"Aw, why the heck not?\" You said, grabbing it and it's sheath off the wall. You started packing, grabbed a second bag, finished packing, left a pistol with ammo next to the note to your mom, and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirius's eyes widened as he felt the spike in power. Even he, who had no skill in detecting, could feel the energy being used. He packed and dashed out of the house, looking for the source of such power and hoping they were against The Blessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished packing, grabbed some extra pieces of clothes that may help like a jacket with a shoulder strap, and left. You got three steps before turning back for one more thing. You grabbed your key to the house and left, hoping to get far away from home very quickly. Meanwhile, you pondered what else to change about yourself. Obviously, stealth and discretion were unimportant now, and the only important part was being as tough as you could as quickly as possible. You walked for what your watch told you was three hours before stopping next to a tall tree. You climbed up with your special hands and got into a high branch, hiding your stuff in a spot you were sure was safe and closing your eyes to change. The only question that remained in your mind as you closed your eyes to change was how different you wanted to be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You remembered you had packed a picture of yourself for later, so no need to try and keep close to normal. You started with the obvious things. Tail with spikes and a poisonous barbed end, pitch black wings with membranes like a bat's wing instead of feathers (yes, feathers would probably look cooler, but the feathers would shed) that could fold almost flat to your back, fangs instead of canine teeth, even more strength and speed, scales on both arms strong enough to deflect bullets, while as flexible as possible, claws that use the same poison as your tail on your fingers and toes, ever so slightly thicker bones to keep almost the same speed and flexibility yet add just a tiny bit more durability, heightened reflexes, the ability to recharge and feed yourself through the rays of the sun like a plant, an immunity to your own poison...anything else? After thinking for a good five minutes and having no more ideas, you began the change. The world seemed to take an ever so slightly darker look and the sun seemed to speed up, like it were really being pulled along by a chariot like in the myths. You saw a bird fly past at what seemed to be 50 miles an hour, and felt the changes slowly taking effect. Sure, you reflected now, you looked nothing like a normal person, but you could always evolve to seem more human, or even change back. You saw a person of maybe 13 to 15 with dark gray skin somewhere between black and a pale color walk below. He had blond hair that contradicted his skin and seemed to be looking for something...or as might be the case, someone. He looked before sitting below the tree. You longed to yell at him to go away, but couldn't because he would see you, and besides, you couldn't move in the cocoon. You mentally laughed as something came to you.<br>\r\n \"Heh,\" You said in your head. \"no one ever looks up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirius looked and couldn't find anyone who might be releasing energy like that. Oddly enough, just a minute ago the flow of power from the person was almost stopped completely. He looked around one last time and sat under a large tree. Strange, he mused, that he seemed to be right on top of the source of power. He picked up his small bag and looked through. He had a few days of food, his only other pair of clothes, a flashlight that needed batteries, his wind up TV that seemed to have a good connection with the news channels, and a rusty knife he had found. He reached for his neck and felt his silver necklace and wished once more he had the key. He was saddened by the fact he owned such a nice thing from his parents and yet it's compartment was always locked. He sighed and put everything but his necklace and the knife in the bag and picked up a decent sized rock and beginning to sharpen the knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked in curiosity as best you could at the kid and his various things from the bag. He had an extra pair of clothes, a flashlight, an old wind up TV, and a rusty knife that seemed as if it had been dropped in a toilet and forgotten for a month. Then he reached to his neck, pulled something off and looked at it. Since you were unable to move your head, you couldn't get a good look at it. You relaxed as the boy stared for a moment at his things and then started sharpening his knife. This went on with you watching him sharpen his knife at what seemed to be double speed for what felt like ten minutes before he put away the knife and pulled out the TV. He started cranking and looked over various channels and spent the rest of the night surfing the various channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning (or about two hours later as it felt to you), you felt the cocoon beginning to pull back into you. You stood on the branch, stretched, and nearly fell over at the feeling of a tail and two wings stretching as well. This, you though, would take getting used to. You looked down and saw the boy, asleep, hands on the TV, and slid down the tree to him.<br>\r\n \"Wake up\" You said softly, hiding your wings and tail so as to not scare him. He got up and jumped as he saw you.<br>\r\n \"Who are you? Are you against The Blessed?\" He said, then noticed you were hiding something. \"And what are you hiding?\"<br>\r\n \"I'm Dan, I hate The Blessed, and I'm hiding the result of using my power, you?\"<br>\r\n \"I'm Sirius, I think The Blessed are too public about using their powers, and I'm not hiding anything.\"<br>\r\n \"What about whatever it was around your neck?\" He stiffened for a moment then reached around his neck and pulled off a shiny silver necklace.<br>\r\n \"This is the only thing I have from my parents, and I almost always wear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is the only thing I have from my parents, and I almost always wear it.\" Sirius said nervously, looking at the 12 year old boy before him. He looked strange, with his fangs and claws and scaly arms, and Sirius knew he was hiding something.<br>\r\n \"What are you hiding behind your back?\"<br>\r\n \"Something I made to fight The Blessed.\"<br>\r\n \"Can I see?\" The boy reluctantly stepped forward, revealing a long, snakelike spiked tail and two black bat wings. Sirius instinctively gasped and realized this was the one with the power.<br>\r\n \"Wow, can I travel with you?\" The boy seemed confused by this.<br>\r\n \"Why?\"<br>\r\n \"Because the two of us have a better chance of beating The Blessed together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Because the two of us have a better chance of beating The Blessed together.\" The boy, Sirius said to you. You debated in your head and realized he was right.<br>\r\n \"Alright, but let me get my stuff.\" You tried to fly up, hitting your head on the way with an audible and very comical *THUD*, causing Sirius to laugh a little.<br>\r\n \"Looks like you need some practice.\" He said mockingly. You felt your cheeks turn red and you could only mutter a string of rude curses as he laughed a bit harder. You grabbed your stuff and returned.<br>\r\n \"Well, I did only just get the wings this morning.\" You were about to begin walking when something occurred to you.<br>\r\n \"Where should we go?\"</span></div></div>",

He looked around and saw Anne laying on a nearby pile of garbage either asleep or unconscious. Keid felt his chest and jaw to find burns and dry blood respectively. He moaned and walked over to Anne to find she was missing a lot of hair and had gone to sleep, probably after getting them out of there. Keid picked her up and carried her to a nearby hill with a good spot in the sun. He laid her down in the shade, hoping for a nice breeze, and laid down in the sun to let the plants around him heal him while he thought. about what happened. The boy, Daniel was his name, he had done something no one, not even the soldier commander or the other leaders could;He used multiple powers. He had shown extreme strength, jumping down two stories and not even being hurt, while at the same time, he showed fire control with his fire breath. It was supposed to be impossible to have multiple powers, even more impossible for anyone but a rare few like twins to have the same power as another. He moaned slightly in discomfort as the plants fixed his jaw, then relaxed as the throbbing from before went away. He smiled, standing, fully healed, and looked over at Anne. She was special, everyone knew. Not only could she exert her power enough to change her physical form, which was in itself rare, but she could also detect others at long range. Keid thought about healing her, but decided against it, remembering she liked to be independent most of the time. Heck, he was lucky to be a close enough friend to go on missions with her. She stirred and awoke, breaking Keid from his reverie. He smiled at her as she stood, preparing to thank her for getting him out of there when she began cursing. His smile faded as he asked the obvious question.<br>\r\n \"What's wrong? What happened?\" She seemed to notice him just then and glared slightly before asking:<br>\r\n \"How did we get here?\"<br>\r\n \"Didn't you take us here?\"<br>\r\n \"No, he saw my air form, shot me twice with fire, and knocked me out.\" Keid was shocked by this. To do this, Dan would have needed either thermal vision, mind reading, or sensory control or viewing.<br>\r\n \"How?\"<br>\r\n \"I didn't feel him enter my mind, so he didn't read my mind, and I didn't feel anyone take control of my senses, so it was either thermal vision or sensory viewing.\" Keid barely held a gasp. That was three powers and after this, Keid expected Dan had more.<br>\r\n \"We need to catch him!\"<br>\r\n \"Catch who?\" Keid paled as he heard the voice of that boy, Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sirius approached slowly, you in the trees and Sirius in the shadows themselves. You had given each other a quick and basic understanding of the others power for future reference. You poked your head down out of a tree at hearing the boy speak.<br>\r\n \"We need to catch him!\" The boy said with a hint of desperation in his voice. You smiled and spoke.<br>\r\n \"Catch who?\" You could have sworn you saw the boy pale as he spun around. You thought and were glad you had left your bags behind and had your wings folded to your back.<br>\r\n \"Daniel!\" The boy yelled, causing the girl to jump and spin the moment she touched the ground. You smiled, showing off your wickedly sharp fangs in the process. The boy was too scared but the girl wasn't.<br>\r\n \"Did he have f-f-fangs before?\" The boy looked and finally noticed the fangs glinting at him in the sunlight.<br>\r\n \"No.\" He said, going even whiter than before.<br>\r\n \"So,\" You asked, trying to keep the mood nonchalant. \"where's your base?\" The boy finally seemed to get his wits and glared at you.<br>\r\n \"As if I would tell you.\" He was about to turn and leave when his shadow changed slightly, looking more like Sirius, though remaining black.<br>\r\n \"You should tell us.\" He said from the shadow, spooking both the boy and girl.<br>\r\n \"Why?\" The girl asked, though the boy seemed to understand.<br>\r\n \"Because,\" Sirius continued. \"if not, I'll destroy this one by absorbing his shadow.\" This time you saw the two visibly pale, going pure white, and having all their cool demeanor shattered.<br>\r\n \"All right,\" The girl said, cracking from the pressure. \"It's to the west, but you need us both to get in.\"<br>\r\n \"Fine, we'll take you with us.\" You said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, you and Sirius had gotten a police car with full gas (though Sirius didn't say he had scared away a poor, fat old officer wet his pants with fear to get it), and you put the two hostage Blessed scouts in the back while you sat in the passenger seat and Sirius drove (he was older, and besides, not only was he slightly more mature from living as a beggar and thief, but his skin and extra height from his power made him seem closer to 17 than 13) You made sure the back was locked, the bags were quick to hand, and Sirius drove on.</span></div></div>",

You managed to keep this pace going for about a week before you had to stop.<br>\r\n \"We have a problem.\" Sirius said with a frown.<br>\r\n \"What?\"<br>\r\n \"Well, we're out of gas.\" You got out and opened the trunk only to find that there was no gas left there either. You scowled and walked around to the back where the boy and girl were playing cards with a deck you got them a while back. You opened the door, to both of their surprise.<br>\r\n \"Get out, we're out of gas.\" They obeyed and stepped out, obviously enjoying the chance to stand.<br>\r\n \"Is there any way we can get into the base without you two?\" You asked, hoping you could let them go, hating to keep prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeid was beginning to enjoy these people. Sure, he wanted to get them on his side, the side of The Blessed, but he was beginning to realize they were a lot nicer than the members of The Blessed. For one thing, he and Anne had tried to capture him and kill his mother, yet he got them a deck of cards to keep occupied with. If Dan and that other boy had been members of The Blessed, they would have killed them the moment they got the chance. The car stopped and Dan and the other boy...Sirius, Keid remembered his name now, talked on the other side of the soundproof glass before Dan got out and walked to the trunk. He seemed to look for a minute before he walked to Keid's door and opened it. Keid and Anne stepped out and stretched for a minute as Dan mentioned they were out of gas before asking them a question.<br>\r\n \"Is there any way we can get into the base without you?\" Keid was shocked by the trust Dan put in them, considering they could give him a fake reason and leave. Oddly enough though, Keid felt he should tell the truth, and one look at Anne gave the impression she was thinking the same thing.<br>\r\n \"No, and I'd like to ask a question.\"<br>\r\n \"Sure, what?\"<br>\r\n \"Can we be on your side?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked by the question and were more than a bit nervous.<br>\r\n \"Why, when you like The Blessed so much?\"<br>\r\n \"Because,\" The boy, who you had learned was named Keid said. \"we have learned that you're a lot nicer than the members of The Blessed.\"<br>\r\n \"How so?\"<br>\r\n \"Well, members of The Blessed would have killed us by now, weather we were important or not.\" You considered this and the fact he wasn't grouping himself with the other members of the blessed, and realized that description fit perfectly with what you knew about them.<br>\r\n \"What about her?\" You asked, pointing to Anne.<br>\r\n \"I would like to join too.\" She said, and for the first time you realized she spoke strangely, like she was unfamiliar with speech. You were still suspicious, but decided to leave it.<br>\r\n \"Alright, welcome to the team. Grab your stuff and we can get going.\" Everyone grabbed their own stuff, though Keid and Anne had very little to take with them. You were by far the most weighed down by your stuff, and remembered something before you left.<br>\r\n \"Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.\" You said as you reached into the bags and pulled out the guns from your dad's collection.<br>\r\n \"Choose your favorite.\" You said, laying them out on the hood of the car. Everyone chose pretty much as you expected, Anne taking the Sniper rifle, Keid taking the shotgun, and Sirius taking the two pistols. You took the Uzi, it being the only other gun, then handed Sirius the survival knife and sheathing the scimitar across your hip (since your wings restricted you from putting it on your back). You handed out the ammo, gave Keid and Anne each a pocket knife (not much, but something). You gave Sirius the lighter, while splitting the matches between Anne and Keid.<br>\r\n \"What about you?\" Keid asked, before you blew a small ball of fire into the air and looking through your bags some more.<br>\r\n \"Oh.\" Having long ago put batteries into Sirius's flashlight, you gave the remaining two flashlights to Keid and Anne. You looked again and closed the bags, sure nothing else could be passed out.<br>\r\n \"Let's go.\"</span></div></div>",

He was the leader of The Blessed, and his enemies progress was angering him.<br>\r\n \"Send out troops to stop them.\" His voice was cold and heartless, and his second in command knew not to question him. He rushed to the command booth and sent out orders. Four strong soldiers were to leave at once to intercept the two powerful boys and the traitors. They were not to hold back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned at the dust cloud in the distance. You stared for a minute before bringing it up to the others.<br>\r\n \"Be ready for anything.\"<br>\r\nBut nothing could prepare you all for what happened next. You heard a ghastly screech and had to cover your ears. You could see the shape now, and could tell it was human...almost. It was enormous, at least twice your size and as thick as three of you. On it's back were three others. One was a girl screeching to the sky and you could tell it was the one hurting your ears. There was also a boy glowing with power and another girl, this one was holding a very big rock in the air without touching it. The three on the big ones back jumped and rolled aside and you realized what was about to happen. Quickly, you locked your legs and braced your arms, without a moment to spare. The big one ran straight into you and pushed you along, leaving tracks where your feet were being pushed along the ground. If it weren't for your extra strong limbs, the psycho you were deciding to call the juggernaut probably would have broken every bone in your body. You could see the screeching one attack Sirius, the glowing one attack Keid and the psychic one throw her rock at Anne. You had to stop watching, however, as you felt the juggernaut bunching his legs to jump. You instantly went from locking your arms and legs to clawing for a grip on the enormous freak as he left the ground and went at least six feet in the air. You managed to climb onto his back and hang on as he landed and spun around, trying to throw you off. You clawed and scratched with claws and tail, but it didn't seem to phase him. Fire breath didn't work either you quickly learned, and you tried to think while at the same time avoiding falling off the huge person below you. You grabbed your sword and sliced at the back of the neck, leaving a noticeable cut and causing the juggernaut to yell in pain. It finally got the idea you feared and jumped, landing on it's back and crushing the air out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirius covered his ears as the girl screamed again and nearly deafened him. He gritted his teeth and willed her shadow to turn against her. She continued to screech for only a moment before her shadow climbed out of the ground and punched her in the side. She screamed, not using her power as the blow broke a rib. She spun and swung with a lightning fast punch, knocking the shadow down and causing herself to cough up blood, seeing as it was her shadow she just punched. She seemed to understand this and turned on Sirius, yelling so loud he could see the grass vibrating below their feet. He yelled out as well, only making it worse as the tones mixed and hit a pitch that was sharper than the single scream. She smiled and stopped, allowing him to collapse. She walked up to him and spoke quietly.<br>\r\n \"Most call me the banshee, you can probably tell why.\" She reached down for his neck when she saw his shadow and her own reach up and grab her. They covered her mouth before she could scream and pulled her to the floor. Sirius stood and looked down at her. His face softened slightly.<br>\r\n \"You're like me in that we both have powers, but the differences are our strength.\" He pulled back a fist and swung. She cringed and he stopped just before her face. Sirius sighed. He was stronger, he was hateful of these people, yet he was no murderer. He hit the back of her head with his palm and knocked her unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeid dived back and barely avoided the blast of energy as it struck. He looked up at the boy and sent a branch out of the ground at his head and didn't even phase him. He shot another bolt of energy and Keid dodged yet again. Keid grunted, barely keeping out of the way of the deadly arcs of energy as he thought. A minute later, he noticed that the boy was getting tired and had an idea. He created a wall of wood on each side of the boy and covered it with a roof. He didn't have to wait long for the boy to do as he had hoped and release a wave of energy. This wave was strong, huge, and bright, but the boy seemed very tired. Keid repeated the action a few times, the other boy getting more tired every time, until the boy literally fell asleep on his feet. Keid smiled and tied him up under some tree roots and other plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne dived aside as the rock smashed into the spot she was just standing in. She climbed to her feet and shot a concentrated burst of air towards the girl trying to crush her with a boulder. The girl lost her focus and dropped the boulder, narrowly missing Anne. The psychic girl lifted a large piece of the terrain and flung it at Anne, who threw it aside with a burst of air. The girl seemed to be getting frustrated and lifted a tree out of the ground and shot it at Anne. Anne used her wind control to push it back and for a few moments it was a struggle of will between them. Finally, the psychic girl grunted and the tree shot towards Anne. She did the only thing she could to avoid it; Change into air. The tree passed through her and she shivered slightly before flying over to the girl and into her lungs. She debated killing her, but dismissed this idea and instead caused the girl to black out. Anne left the girl's lungs and re-materialized, shaking herself slightly to get rid of the tight feeling of being in someones lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed and couldn't get free for a moment before yelling out and pushing the juggernaut off of you. You heard a yelp of fright as the juggernaut left the ground against his own will. You stood, as did the juggernaut, before it darted forward. This time you were ready and locked not only your arms and legs, but your tail as well, flapping your wings against him and managing to slow him down. You finally felt your bones beginning to get real damage and you yelled out, both in pain and fury, and felt adrenaline kick in.<br>\r\n \"You won't get me down that easy.\" You said under your breath to the huge person pushing you along. You pushed as hard as you could, feeling the two of you slow down. The man whimpered in fear and confusion, probably because this had never happened before. You pushed, staggering him, then swung a punch with all your strength. You felt it connect, then the juggernaut literally lifted a foot off the floor and landed, back first and unconscious, on the grassy floor. You cracked your knuckles as the others surrounded you.<br>\r\n \"Ready to move on?\"</span></div></div>",

You want to be like the most powerful superheroes you read from comic books and watch from cartoon shows. You thought of some of the best ones and brought them up. They were omnipotent knowledge (meaning that you have the ability to know everything, similar to Captain Marvel, and includes all mentality abilities), superhuman strength (more powerful than Superman himself), superhuman stamina (stronger than Captain Marvel), enhanced mental and physical abilities (a.k.a. The power of Zeus in Shazam minus the lightning stuff), unlimited bravery, unlimited range of fighting skills, ability to fly, superhuman speed (100 times faster than the speed of light), invulnerability, quick reflexes, ability to stretch long lengths, extreme flexibility, ability of growing and shrinking thermal vision, x-ray vision, heat vision, super breath, super hearing, night, microscopic, and super vision, super olfaction, shapeshifting, physics and reality manipulation (to see those abilities, go to: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_superhuman_features_and_abilities_in_fiction\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_s...</a>), accelerated healing, technopathy, telekinesis, water breathing, wall climbing, and fire and ice breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you have to think deeply on how each ability will work which won't otherwise; and means changing yourself. You develop a part of your brain that has unlimited knowledge and stores them permanently; but it can also give you unlimited bravery, ability to have super vision, the ability to adjust your eye vision from thermal to x-ray, and microscopic  vision, can also make your vision useful in night, help lift objects with focus, gives you connection with electricity to control electric-powered stuff, and gives you the knowledge of fighting skills. You also include a few more muscle including one type that covers all of your muscles and fatigue free; it also gives you super human strength, stamina, elasticity, enhanced mental and physical abilities, extreme flexibility, super speed, and quick reflexes. You also add gills on the base of your neck for water breathing. You also add a new part to your bones that can make you airborne and fly. You upgrade your ears and other senses to have super olfaction and also (for the ears) super hearing. You also toughen your skin to be resistant to vulnerability along with other organs at the exterior on your body and also give them accelerated healing. But you also have to think about wall climbing, fire and ice breath, super breath, shapeshifting, growing, shrinking, and physics and reality manipulation. You later thought about having a gecko in your house and how they can stuck to walls, using thousands of tiny hairs to make \"molecular contact\" to the surface and help stick on it, but you will gave to apply it for your feet since they gave stick on the walks too. You also upgrade your lungs to rake in large amounts of air and store a lot even in a small space, by squeezing the space of air molecules into a small space and do this for each one. That way, you can hold a breath as powerful as 100 hurricanes. For the fire and ice breath, you create two new stomachs, replacing your original stomach. One stomach if for the fire, and other is for the ice. The hot foods would go into the fire stomach, while cold food will go to the ice stomach. The fire stomach will turn the convert food into a flammable mixture for fire breath, while the ice stomach will absorb the remaining heat if the food to help freeze the air. You unleash one of them by a developed organ that controls which breath to use. For physics and reality manipulation, you create an organ that can do molecular control on your arms, hands, brain, and legs that can control and manipulate objects. Finally, the toughest, shapeshifting- you have to find a way to shapeshift but you face many obstacles finding a way. Finally, you had a idea: you create an organ that can change your DNA, mold your body into new forms, and change your look. But is also can change your size from the growth and shrink powers you wanted. And to top everything off, 6 inches of height will do.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou felt the new organs you thought forming in your body, your skin toughen, muscles forming around your body, gills forming around your neck, your new stomachs form, your lungs upgraded, and you grow 6 inches on height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after the changes are done, you see light appearing out of the open, and the cocoon disintegrate. Then, you began to open your eyes, as of it were a dream. Finally, you officially wake up, seeing the hospital room around you, as if what happened was a dream, even though it wasn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour soon back to the real world and awake. The changes took at least a week to occur, and your injuries from the accident earlier have recovered. You soon hear and see the doctor and your mom come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness son, you're back to normal!\" the doctor explained, \"you have been in a cocoon got a week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my son\", your mother says to you, \"I'm glad to see you again\". She hugs you around your body as if he came back from war, even though there is no war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my son, we can finally go home\", she says. You and mom say bye to the doctor and leave the hospital. Your mom drives home and talks to you about the incidents a week ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh son, how did you get into this?\" your mom asks, \"I thought you were dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry mom\", you said. \"I was going to the park when a car hut me. It was because. I forgot to look out for the traffic\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should always watch where the cats are\", your mom said,\"you could have died!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry mom\", you say, \"I promise that will never happen again\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, you reach home. Fortunately, you don't have to do that homework assigent that was unfinished last week. Since school is starting tommorow, you prepare for school and began to think about the situation that happened. But you began to wonder, is it safe to tell your mom that you have developed powers? What will be the reaction be? Will you risk it all by telling her your secret?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill you or not tell her secret?</span></div></div>",

You felt immense vertigo, but continued to look until you knew looking any longer would either make you throw up or go insane, at which point you threw your head back, dropping the mirror in the process. It fell to the ground, shattering into hundreds of pieces.<br>\r\n \"Dang it, how can I find out what it was now?\" You asked yourself in a voice you vaguely realized was almost too quiet to hear. You frowned and looked down, realizing you were almost completely invisible.

To sum it up simply, when your reflection was normally supposed to be visible you were visible and solid unless you concentrated hard on not being visible, at which point your reflection would be. When you were invisible, you were almost like a ghost, only you could only affect the world if you concentrated, and even then you could only make small changes like a strong gust of wind, a small tremor, a spark, something like that. Also, coming into contact with a mirror burned you and horribly weakened you. More than anything else, however, you were getting BORED! Sure, you could mess with people, but it got old after about two days. The only people still fun to mess with were the police who were endlessly increasing their security on the mall. You felt bad about how sad your parents were, but they would be scared if you appeared and told them, you were sure of it. You smiled, making another gust of wind blow a random officer's sandwich into the mud. Oh well, at least these guys always cheered you up.</span></div></div>",

He heard a commotion and, bored, listened in. He could vaguely hear the voices of Andrew, Kurt and Ian, the three heads of security in the area.<br>\r\n \"How is the rest of town?\" He could hear Kurt ask.<br>\r\n \"Everywhere but the mall everything is normal.\" Andrew responded.<br>\r\n \"And, dare I ask? How is it going there?\"<br>\r\n \"Well, we're still getting reports of ghosts, and there are still unexplained acts going on.\"<br>\r\n \"Unexplained acts?\" Ian asked. Dave almost shuddered. Dang, Ian had a cold voice, full of such venom normally that Dave was surprised there wasn't a trail of acid everywhere Ian walked.<br>\r\n \"It would be easiest to show you.\" Dave could hear Kurt put a storage device of some kind, probably a USB stick, into the computer and play a file. Dave heard nothing for a moment, then something like someone snapping and lighting a match at the same time, then a burning noise. The noise continued for a moment, then Dave jumped at the sound of an explosion.<br>\r\n \"Where did the spark come from?\" Ian asked with more curiosity than venom for once.<br>\r\n \"We have no idea. Luckily, no one was injured by the car exploding.\"<br>\r\n \"I have an...acquaintance...who deals with these kinds of things for a living. I'll call him.\" Ian said.

Well, this was going to be yet another boring day. At least you were getting better at manipulating the world. You smiled and stood, floating to the place where the police always waited. You stopped and scratched your head, curious at the lack of police cars. You saw a man in strange robes walk in your general direction, but you ignored him. People walked around all the time, you reasoned.<br>\r\n \"Where could they be?\" You wondered out loud. \"They're here every day. Maybe they're wondering how their car exploded, and so they're-\" You stopped and turned to the man. He was frowning in concentration and staring straight at you.<br>\r\n \"Can you hear me?\" You asked, though you could already guess the answer. He seemed to ignore you, which didn't surprise you. He reached into his robe and pulled out a small bag of flour, blowing the contents at you. They went through you, not the least to your surprise. He continued, trying various methods that you were finding increasingly ridiculous until he reached into his coat yet again. He pulled out a silver cross, moving it in a complicated pattern. He continued, pulling out a piece of garlic. After a moment, he put it away. He pulled out a plant, probably wolf's bane considering his previous guesses. He waited a moment, then put it away. You were about to burst out laughing when he pulled out his next item, the laughter dieing in your throat.<br>\r\nBecause he reached into his coat and pulled out a mirror.<br>\r\nYou gasped right alongside him as you became visible and solid. You were wondering how he had known, while he quickly reached into his coat and pulled out some curved object made out of black metal with streaks of gold. You had no idea why, but you were struck by immense fear. You tried to run but couldn't move. He came steadily closer, the mirror in his left hand, the symbol in his right. You threw all your energy into one final, desperate attempt to escape.</span></div></div>",

The only thing that looked different was a window floating in front of you, showing you a view of the man in robes looking down at you, smiling. Your blood chilled and you felt true terror as you realized what had happened. He had caught you.

It was bring your daughter to work day and she had been forced to come, despite having come every year before.

Every year it was the same, and she only came to get out of school.<br>\r\nShe was called a tomboy by many people, but she didn't care. It was more fun than being what they expected her to be. She looked around the room, searching for something to entertain her. She spent a good hour in absolute and unyielding boredom before she looked to the front door, a man in robes running past and into the office. Alex, interested in anything but staring at the wall for the next few hours until she was allowed to go home, walked to the door and listened in.<br>\r\n \"I caught the saboteur!\" She heard a triumphant cry, probably from the robed man.<br>\r\n \"Who was it?\" Answered a cold voice.<br>\r\n \"It looked like a normal eleven or twelve year old boy. Here, look into the mirror and you can see him.\" She heard some shifting as everyone in the room looked into the mirror.<br>\r\n \"Remarkable. Come, let's go. We have to ensure the public that the danger is gone.\" Alex ducked back into the office as four men, including the robed man, left. She waited a moment, then looked at the door. Her dad was in the bathroom and the men were gone, maybe she could look at the mirror they had been talking about.</span></div></div>",

She came out in a long, rectangular room with a long, ornate table running the length of the room. At the end of the table she could see a small glint from a shiny or reflective surface. Running as quietly as she could, she came to the end of the table and looked at the object. It was a round mirror about as big as the palm of her hand, maybe a bit bigger. It was perfectly round, but the amazing thing was that after a minute or two, she could see a person take shape.<br>\r\nIn the mirror she saw a boy of about eleven or twelve, just as the robed man had said. He was laying on his side with his back to Alex. She slowly picked up the mirror and looked around the boy, seeing only what seemed to be glass. The boy turned towards her and they stared at each other in awe for a moment, a person each side of an impossible barrier. Finally, after what seemed like ages, Alex broke the silence.<br>\r\n \"Hi, i'm Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, hearing something. Even in your short time in the mirror, you had learned that you couldn't go anywhere, no matter how fast or whether you crawled, walked, ran, jogged or flew. You had also learned that because nothing moved in the mirror, there was no sound. You waited for a moment, then realized the noise was breathing. You turned around...<br>\r\n...and came face to face with a girl of about your age, looking at you in awe. You stared at her in awe for a minute that felt like an eternity, relishing the feeling of being in anyone's hands but the robed man's. Finally, she spoke.<br>\r\n \"Hi, i'm Alex.\"<br>\r\n \"I'm Dan.\"<br>\r\n \"How did you get into a mirror?\"<br>\r\n \"I'll explain, but can we get as far away from the man in robes as possible first?\" She seemed to think for a moment, then responded.<br>\r\n \"It may be stealing, but I'm curious. Besides, if he kept you, it would be like slavery.\" You smiled. Finally, someone who understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex put the mirror in her pocket and walked out of the office, walking back to the booth her father manned and sat down in the second chair. She sat down and, seeing no one around, pulled out the mirror and began to speak with Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex walked into her room, jumped into bed wearing the same clothes she had gone to the police HQ in, and pulled out the mirror containing Dan. Through experimentation, they had discovered that, while Dan could use his power through the mirror, he had difficulty affecting the person holding the mirror or the mirror itself. He could affect either one, it just took much more effort.<br>\r\n \"So, how did you get trapped in a mirror?\"<br>\r\n \"Well, I was at home, getting bored with my homework, and decided to go to the park...\" Alex listened intently to the story as Dan told it, wondering about it for a few minutes afterward.<br>\r\n \"Will you let me out of here?\" Alex looked at Dan as he asked the question. She sighed and shook her head.<br>\r\n \"Sorry, but I can't do that. For one thing, I don't know how to get you out. Maybe breaking the mirror would work, but it might just kill you instead. Secondly, no matter how honest you may seem, I still don't know if I can trust you.\"<br>\r\n \"I have to admit, you make a good point.\" Dan sighed and thought for a moment.<br>\r\n \"How about you hang onto the mirror for awhile, and I'll help you until we find a way to get me out?\" Alex thought about the good and bad that could come of the deal, eventually deciding it was worth it.<br>\r\n \"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over as Alex yawned and woke. You didn't seem to need to sleep while in the mirror, so you had watched through the night out of boredom. Alex stood, grabbed some clothes and walked to the bathroom. You waited a minute, then she came out, wearing normal school uniform. She walked over and grabbed the mirror, putting it in her pocket.<br>\r\n \"Not exactly reassuring, being put in somebodies pocket.\"<br>\r\n \"Sorry, but it's the most likely place to keep a mirror.\" You had to give her that, so you settled down to relax.</span></div></div>",

Then he walked out of the subdivision where he lived with his mother, until he reached the main, busy road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew was barely fourteen years old; he was tall and skinny. Standing almost six feet tall, he looked like he was already in high school, but he was still in the eighth grade at middle school. He had bright, blue eyes, and a friendly face. With his long, wild, curly blond hair, he had all the girls looking up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was happy, cheerful, and well-liked in school. He was shy and well-known, and he was geeky and still popular enough among his peers. Since he was one of the tallest boys in his class, the bullies didn\u2019t bother him too much. He wasn\u2019t much into sports, although the PE Coach would have loved to have him play on the basketball team, for obvious reasons. He was more of a computer geek than anything, and he loved spending his free time learning how to build websites and how to write his own programs on the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew was an only child, and his parents were divorced from the day he was born. Since his mother had gained full custody, he never got to see his father, except for certain holidays and birthdays. His mother was several inches shorter than him, so that made him pretty much the man in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he reached the busy intersection, he pressed the button at the traffic light, and waited patiently for the signal, which indicated that it was safe for him to cross. He wanted to get to the other side of the street as quickly as possible, so he could buy the carton of milk, and then get back to the house. He just wanted to return in time, so he could chat with his friends and play his computer games. When he finally got into the grocery store, he marched over to the aisle where the freezers were, and he quickly located the type and brand of milk, that he knew that his mother had wanted for him to buy. Then he grabbed the carton from the fridge and walked towards the check-out counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had paid and walked out the store, he strolled back to the traffic light. To his great disappointment, he realized that the light had just changed, meaning that he now needed to wait for the next change before he could cross the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked before him, he spotted the location on the other side of the street, where he wanted to be at that moment in time. He was growing impatient, and he wished he could just be on the other side of the street in an instant\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All he could see was the spot on the other side, at the base of the other side of the street, next to the bus stop, where he desperately wanted to be at that moment in time. He fixed his eyes at that location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, like an answered prayer, in a blink of an eye, Andrew suddenly found himself standing next to that bus stop, while holding his carton of milk in his right hand. This time, he was facing the traffic, but he was clearly standing on the opposite side of the road, facing the supermarket where he just came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d he asked himself, as he looked around. \u201cDid I cross the street already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Andrew looked around in complete confusion.

Was he losing his mind? Did he just suffer a memory lapse? Did he just cross the street and forget that he crossed it? Why couldn\u2019t he remember walking across the street just now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped and turned around, and he noticed that the light had finally changed just now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s strange! The light changed now\u2026\u201d he said to himself. \u201cBut I\u2019m already here\u2026 How did I get here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew turned around again and continued to walk home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he made it back, he unlocked the door and he walked in. Then he strolled into the kitchen and placed the carton in the refrigerator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan\u2026 I\u2019m thirsty\u2026 But I\u2019m in no mood for milk right now\u2026\u201d he thought, just when he spotted a two-liter bottle of soda, which sat unopened in the bottom shelf of the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached down and grabbed the bottle and closed the door. He poured himself a glass of soda before he sat down at his laptop in his bedroom. He decided he wasn\u2019t going to worry about the weird incident anymore, because he had crossed the street and he just couldn\u2019t remember doing it\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had consumed three glasses of Coke, and he needed to relieve himself. He stood up, holding his glass in his hand, and he finished whatever was left in the glass before setting it down on his desk. Then he quickly tapped \u201cbrb\u201d on his keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, all that soda goes through me like water\u2026\u201d he chuckled, as he pictured his bathroom in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to walk towards the bedroom door when suddenly, in a flash, he was standing in the bathroom, facing the sink, and staring at his reflection in the mirror which was hanging from the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap!\u201d he gasped, as he looked around in confusion. \u201cIt happened again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew looked around and confirmed that he was indeed in his bathroom: He noted the dirty laundry hamper, the shower curtain, the familiar toilet, the sink, the trash can, and the large mirror. He looked down and recognized his toothbrush and cup, and his hairbrush.  He was happy that he recognized the familiar surroundings and the items in the bathroom, but he was still perplexed about the strange way that he got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy bathroom! I\u2019m in my bathroom!\u201d he cheered. \u201cBut\u2026 How? I never walked from my bedroom to my bathroom! This is freaking weird! It\u2019s as if I teleported in here\u2026 Or something\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew quickly relieved himself and flushed the toilet. Then he washed his hands, and dried them off on the towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is freaking me out\u2026 I had better just take it easy\u2026\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cI need to relax and clear my mind\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then walked out of the bathroom and slowly made his way down the hall to the kitchen. He just glanced straight ahead of him, not thinking of anything but walking in the same direction. He was scared and confused. Strange things were happening to him, and he needed to talk to his mother about them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally passed the living room, he plopped down on the couch and turned on the TV. He figured he would just wait for his mother to come home. After a few minutes, he closed his eyes, and dozed off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I couldn\u2019t remember crossing the street at all! It was like I teleported across four lanes of cars in a split-second\u2026\u201d he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then when I got up from using my laptop, I felt like I needed to go to the bathroom, and suddenly I was standing in the bathroom but I couldn\u2019t remember walking from my room to the bathroom at all. It happened twice in a row! Either I\u2019m forgetting things, or something really weird is going on with me\u2026\u201d he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh boy\u2026\u201d his mom sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re just like Uncle Edward\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUncle Edward?\u201d Andrew asked his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had an uncle who would pop up all the time just like that\u2026\u201d his mother continued. \u201cHe was very nice\u2026 he was originally from Norway\u2026 he also teleported just like you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you know about this?\u201d Andrew asked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 It runs in the family\u2026 You just need to learn how to control your teleportation power, Andrew\u2026 Just think\u2026 You can teleport to school and you can get to places in an instant\u2026 You can be anywhere in a second!\u201d she added with a smile. \u201cLook at it as a gift, not as a curse\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but\u2026 I don\u2019t want my friends to think of me as a freak!\u201d Andrew blurted out. \u201cI\u2019m a freak! A mutant! An alien!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Andrew\u2026 You\u2019re a boy with an incredible gift\u2026\u201d she assured him. \u201cYou just need to get used to it, that\u2019s all\u2026\u201d she said calmly, as she ran her hand over his blond, curly hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d he replied. With his arms extended sideways. \u201cHow do I get used to something freaky like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust think of a place you go to, often, and teleport there and come back!\u201d she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sure!\u201d he said as he rolled his eyes. \u201cLike, where?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, school is out!\u201d she chuckled. \u201cYou always have something to get out of your locker! So, why don\u2019t you practice teleporting to school and back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Andrew stared at his mother in complete disbelief. He was in total shock, while it seemed like his very own mother was acting like she was very happy that he discovered that he now possessed this teleportation power! Would he be able to muster enough courage to teleport to school and back?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The frat guys were clambering up the stairs of the dorm building. Hugo didn't even know where he was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot!\" he yelled out loud. And it was the truth. Why did he constantly get himself into these situations? Why didn't he just ignore the party instead of trying to force himself in. Why didn't he have the sense to leave the carton of eggs at home instead of looking for trouble. He could be in his dorm room safely finishing his ten page paper for English 115. But, no. When had he ever listening to reason?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe burst onto the roof of the building. Where now? Where the hell was he going from here? Late autumn rain was pouring down from the black sky. No stars, just flashes of lightning and rolling peals of thunder. Tiny raindrops and hail stones pelted his face as he searched desperately for a fire escape or some way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door burst open again. Hugo dove behind a rusty air conditioning unit. The frat guys were pissed off, now. Not only had some freshman punk showed up at their party without an invitation, the little prick had started throwing eggs at people. The leader wiped the last strings of yolk off his face. He told his boys to spread out and find the kid so that he could personally kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo tried to make a break for the door, but one of the guys, probably a linebacker, tackled him from behind. Hugo was instantly flattened to the ground. He thought he felt the cell phone in his pocket snap in half, but it could've been a bone. The leader stormed over and grabbed Hugo by the hair, pulling his head off the ground. He glared at Hugo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody...does that to one of my parties...and gets away with it,\" he yelled over the thunder. It was getting closer now, and the storm was getting worse. One of the frat guys jumped when another clap of thunder shook the old dormitory building to its foundation. Hugo took the opportunity to spit at the leader. The wind blew it back in his face. Always the little hothead, he chastised himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe linebacker pulled Hugo up and held him so the leader could take a few swings at him before letting his muscle do the dirty work. Before he had a chance, Hugo elbowed the linebacker in the side. He was released and ran for the door back into the building, but another guy blocked his path. They were converging on him, determined not to let their prey escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo jumped up on top of one of the old air conditioning units, which was slick with rain water and hail. The frat guys rushed to climb up and drag him down, but before they got within a few feet of it, there was a flash of light, accompanied by an ear-piercing blast. Time seemed to slow to a crawl. Hugo could feel the electricity frying his brain, spreading down his spinal cord, causing his arms and legs to spasm and writhe. He could see flashes of light erupt from his finger tips and streams of blinding electricity pouring out his feet into the a/c unit. He could feel the rain on his face boil off. He could feel his feet lift off the ground. He could hear distant screaming, probably his own. And then, there was nothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo groaned. He felt as if his whole body was on fire, inside and out. Light came streaming into his eyes. There were blurred shapes around him. Slowly - too slowly - they shifted into focus. There was an IV bag hanging above his head, dripping steadily into a clear tube that ran all the way down to his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" a soft voice, said. Hugo rolled his head over to the other side of the hospital bed. A young woman, about his age, was sitting next to him, holding his hand. Dark brown hair fell in curls around her face. Her pale face was beautiful and kind. Her eyes were sharp and intelligent, but they were red from hours of crying. She frowned and did her best to keep from weeping as she spoke. \"Don't you ever do that to me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo just stared at her, studying her face for several second before he remembered who she was and why she was here. Rachel - the only girl he had ever known who could put up with him. He remembered her, now. He wasn't quite sure why he was in a hospital, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel,\" he said. It hurt to speak. His neck had been badly burned and moving any of the muscles in his head was painful. \"Rachel, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to stem the flow of tears. \"Oh, baby...the doctors...they say you were struck by lightning.\" Lightning? What were the odds of that? How on earth had he been struck by lightning? Suddenly, she looked angry again. \"What the hell were you doing on that roof last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy had he been on the roof? Wasn't there a party there? No, the party was downstairs. He had gone in, armed to the teeth with eggs and water balloons... Then, he remembered the fight, the escape, being cornered on the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was...I went to that party,\" he started. \"And, well, I wasn't too popular there. So, I had to make a hasty get away...and I ended up on the roof...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit him in the arm. He cringed. He was sore all over. \"You idiot! Goddammit, Hugo! When will you ever learn to think before you do something stupid?\" She got up and stormed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel! Wait!\" he called after her. His neck hurt and his shoulder, and most of his face, but he didn't want her to blame him for this. She had threatened to break up with him if he didn't learn to keep his cool. He didn't want to lose her. He couldn't. \"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped. Something here was out of place. The remote to call the nurse with was hovering an inch off the bed. Just hanging in space. Then, it dropped to the ground. He held his hand over it again, but it didn't move. Instead, a Get Well card on the table next to the bed inexplicably slid off the table, hung in the air for a second and then clattered to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo looked at his hands. They were unharmed, unblemished by the searing lightning bolt. He wasn't a believer in telekinesis, but this was hard to explain away. What on earth was going on?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything around him gave off a field of electric current that caused the hair on his arm and the back of his neck to stand on end. What might've been mind-numbing boredom was a constant adventure. The more he moved things with his mind, the better he got at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy objects were a problem. The hospital bed would roll, but he couldn't get lift it off the floor. More than one object also provided a challenge. He could easily manipulate the Get Well card, sending it tumbling and spinning through the air. But when he tried to introduce an empty paper cup, he had difficulty controlling them and both would clatter to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few days, his burns had stopped burrowing under his skin. A small mirror hung on the wall by the door to the sterile white room, but he couldn't see it from where he lay. So, when the nurse left after checking in on him, he focused all his attention on the mirror. It was smooth and cool and felt a mile away. It was a long way to reach, but he did his best to feel around the edge of the mirror. He could feel the nail it hung on. Slowly, carefully, he lifted it up off the nail. It hung in the air for a moment as he tried to bring to the bed so he could see his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered how Rachel would react now that the bandages were off. What would he look like? How bad were the burns? His attention returned to the mirror as it dropped five feet to the linoleum with a crash. He cringed. The nurse came rushing back in and was surprised to see the broken glass on the floor. She looked at the shattered mirror, looked at the lightning strike victim, and looked back at the mirror. Hugo just shrugged and pretended to be just as surprised as she was. Mentally, he chastised himself for letting his mind wander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the nurse came to discharge him.

You push the door quietly open and sneak in. There is noises coming from your parent's room, you sneak to the door. As you come closer the noises become more and more like muffled screams. Your heart is racing in your ears but you peer into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad is tied to a chair. Two large men, dressed in grey suits, are busy intimidating him. One of the men has a gun pointed at your dad's head, but your dad is refusing to speak. You catch his eye and his eyes widen, he mouths to you that you should run but the men catches him and turns to see you crouching in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad starts to scream that you should run but one of the men holds the gun against his head again. \"If you run we'll kill him,\" the man said.</span></div></div>",
