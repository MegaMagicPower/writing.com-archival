He was a 22 year old male with brown hair and eyes, and a decent build. He would no longer have to deal with his sister Heather on an everyday basis. Heather was two years older than Sam and had red hair, blue eyes, and an athletic body. On the other hand he would be able to see his girlfriend, Nora. She was also two years older than Sam, had blonde hair, brown eyes, excellent body, and was working on her doctorate while working at a locally famous diner. They had been going out for two years now and Sam was enjoying life.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Sam had just finished unpacking the last of the boxes and was finally done moving into his new place. He was so excited to be starting a new chapter of his life. All of the sudden, Sam noticed a strange gas coming through the vent, he began to cough, and shortly after he blacked out. He awoke some time later and though it took him a while to regain his bearings he realized that he had shrunk. By his estimate he was now three inches tall. \"This can't be happening.\" Sam thought to himself. Just then the door opened and though he could not yet see who it was, Sam knew he had to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was at the door?</span></div></div>",

Sam ran towards her and tried to get her attention. She did not see him and made her way into the kitchen. Sam ran after her and then proceeded to climb the kitchen drawers to get on the counter and get Nora's attention. \"Where could he be?\" Nora asked herself as she looked around for something to eat. Sam had finally made it onto the counter when Nora placed a plate right next to him, almost knocking him off the counter. Sam regained his balance as Nora started gathering ingredients for a  lettuce, tomato, cheese, and pickle sandwich with mayo, mustard, and ketchup. Sam always thought she had weird cravings. Sam climbed onto the plate and started jumping up and down while waving his arms. When Nora come back to the plate to start making her sandwich she noticed Sam and almost fainted. \"What in the world happened to you?\" she asked. Sam told her the entire story and when it was over Nora picked Sam up and held him to her face. \"Listen, Sam,\" she began, \"due to your current circumstances I have two options. One, I can keep you and be your guardian and no one will find out. Two, I can eat you and live my life as I please and no one will find out. Now I want you to guess which option I will pick.\" Sam was scared now as his life hung in the balance and in timid manner Sam answered, \"the first one.\" \"Well,\" Nora said, \"you are.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Sam right or wrong? </span></div></div>",

After she was done she told Sam that she had to go work the lunch shift at the diner. Nora left the apartment and quickly drove down to the diner where she rushed inside, put on her uniform and told Sam to keep down. Sam put his head down and eventually fell asleep. Nora was running to and from the kitchen and bumped into another waitress while going to retrieve an order. This bump jarred Sam loose and awakened him. Now Sam was separated from Nora in a busy diner at lunch hour. Sam was still half-awake. He was about halfway between the kitchen and the actual eating area of the diner while numerous waitresses were always rushing past him. He was not short of options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat course of action did Sam take?</span></div></div>",

The substance held his body down, making it impossible to get free. Though he couldn't see anything, he could feel himself enter the oven. \"I envy whoever gets you.\" Sam could hear barely hear Rose say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like an eternity in a volcano. The heat stole most of Sam's energy. Sam felt like he was going to burn to death, until he felt movement again. He could hear his prison placed down somewhere and then cut. His piece was lifted, revealing bright light. Sam was able to see the outside world, but the question still remained: could the outside world see him? The shrunken boy and his pie were placed onto a plate and carried out to the customers. Though it was difficult to see, Sam realized that Nora was the one carrying him. However, as he tried to think of a way to get her attention, the plate he was on was set on a table. He could see his customer: a beautiful 29 year old woman with orange hair and a ponytail. Though she was wearing a shirt, her bellybutton was exposed, sending shivers throughout Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy.\" Nora said and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I will.\" The woman said, getting her deadly fork ready for an attack on her pie.</span></div></div>",

Nora then grabbed Sam, laid him on the lettuce leaf, squirted ketchup on him, followed by a slice of cheese, a slice of tomato, and finally the other slice of bread. Sam was frightened at this point. \"Any last words?\" Nora said. Sam told Nora that he still loved her and that he no regrets. Nora lifted the sandwich to her mouth and took the first bite. Her pearl white teeth cut through the sandwich with ease, just barely missing Sam. Sam watched as Nora chewed and knew that he would be between those crimson lips next.

She got up and went into the living area to answer the phone, with Sam watching her lovely round rear as she walked away. It was a terrifying but interesting situation for Sam, being eaten wasn't exactly on his list of things he wanted to experience. He was at least glad that it was Nora that was going to do it. He knew that he would most likely end up as extra padding on her lovely ass. Though now that Nora was away not paying attention, he decided that he really didn't want to be munched and crunched to death. He thought that if he escaped, he could later, when she might be thinking more clearly, convince her not to eat him. Sam tried to escape, but when he tried to move he couldn't. The ketchup was quite sticky, plus being three inches didn't help; at that size, the ingredients, that were on top of him, were heavy enough to pin him in the sandwich. He stopped struggling, he just had to except that he was going to be lunch. He could hear Nora shouting in the living area, \"Are you sure I have to go over to the university today? Why can't I come tomorrow.....okay, I'll be right over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He made his way into the store and found it difficult to avoid feet so he climbed up the nearest set of shelves. Sam climbed the shelves but the breeze caused by passing shoppers made it incredibly difficult to maintain his hold and he fell into one of the bread boxes the store had on sale. As he fell he tried to grab a hold of the shelf again but all he did was pull down the door of the bread box behind him. Now trapped in the bread box, Sam decided just to take a nap. Not too long after, Sam was awoken, someone had picked up the bread box. Sam tried to make himself noticed by any means possible. Finally the door to the bread box was opened and the female saw Sam and was in shock. The female worked at the store and was speechless.

Sam had no trouble falling to sleep as bread turned out to be more comfortable than he thought. Morning came around and the door to the bread box was opened. \"Rise ans shine my little snack.\" Amanda said with enthusiasm. Sam reluctantly awoke as Amanda grabbed him, and set him on the counter as she prepared Jennifer's BLT with cheese, but in this case the B was for boy. She laid two slice of bread out, spread one with mayo and the other with mustard. Amanda then laid the lettuce on one slice of bread, followed by Sam, a squirt of ketchup, and a slice of tomato. Sam was still too asleep to resist and was barely aware. Amanda finished the sandwich with a slice of cheese and the second slice of bread. By this time Sam was completely awake but the weight of the sandwich on his chest prevented him talking. Amanda loosely wrapped the sandwich in plastic wrap, and placed it in a brown paper bag. Just as Amanda finished fixing her lunch, Jennifer came downstairs, grabbed her lunch and ran out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer arrived at the grocery store, walked in her office and placed the lunch bag on the desk. Sam struggled to get out and after hours of trying, he was finally able to escape the sandwich. But just as he did, the lunch bag was tipped over and all the contents fell on the table. Sam thought quickly though and his behind the yogurt. Jennifer surveyed her lunch as Sam tried to come up with a means of escape. He waited until Jennifer took a drink of her water and made a mad dash down the side of the desk. \"Wait a minute.\" Jennifer exclaimed. Sam was sweating bullets as he thought she had seen him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was Jennifer talking to?</span></div></div>",

Is that-? No way-\" she could barely manage to get her words out due to the sudden revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a really long story...\" Sam says in exhaustion, finally glad to see a face he recognizes, \"First I was taken by a psychotic maid, then made to be somebody's BLT, Boy Lettuce Tomato, barely escaped with my life, and desperately tried to get help standing on a loaf of bread you happened to buy.\" She is still shocked, trying to process \"How did you get so-\" she gulped hard on the unbelievable subject, \"small?\" That's when you shake your head in response with a shrug \"Your guess is as good as mine, Heather,but it hasn't been a pleasant ride, everyone has been treating me like I'm some savory snack!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it would be a once in a lifetime snack...\" She says trying to sound empathetic but also in thought about it. You look up at her with a questionable stare as she then stutters \"N-Not that I want to try eating you or anything!\" You just shrug off the thought as you're sure she didn't mean it, she's your sister after all, you should be able to trust with anything, even being shrunken down to an edible size, right? Sure she's known to tease, but- <br>\r\nYou stop thinking too hard on it, she's your sister and she loves you. \"I just need a break...\" You manage to say to her as you now lie down on her hand in exhaustion. Heather only smiles as she brings her hand up to her face to get a better look at her now little brother, little, funny how that works now, she thought, now he really is smaller than she gave credit for. \"I think I know what to do.\" She says to you as she sets you down on top of the bread box and continues to do what she was going to do before, prepare dinner. <br>\r\nShe pulls out the loaf of bread, milk, cinnamon, butter, eggs, vanilla extract, and nutmeg for French toast for dinner, it's cheap and simple when there's not a lot of food to eat... She looks over at you where she put you, sleeping soundly on the bread box... She did just buy some food... And you did just come with the food she just bought, you told her yourself, that makes you her property now... Her food, that is what she bought after all.<br>\r\nBefore she starts cooking her and her roommate's dinner for the night, she finds a little piece of string and ties it around you as you sleep to make sure you don't go anywhere. Once your little body is secure, she goes back to making dinner, now that ALL her food ingredients are set. It took her only a couple minutes to get a platter made with French toast on it, she then puts melting butter the top of it, and calls her roommate, Kerri over for dinner. <br>\r\nHeather serves up to plates with two pieces of French Toast on each plate, but around this time, you start waking up to see your sister's massive fingers untying you when you had no idea you were even tied in the first place and she picks you up and plops you down on a plate with the French Toast.<br>\r\nBefore you can even realize what's going on or act, you are doused in syrup by Heather and then sprinkled on by powdered sugar, making it difficult to move around, stuck on the French Toast. Then your plate is set down on the table and your next predator sits in front of you.</span></div></div>",

Sam tried to wiggle his way out but before he could he was covered in mustard, ketchup, and relish. Luckily there wasn't a whole lot of weight pressed against him so he was able to make his way on top of the hot dog. The hot dog was lifted into the air and Sam grabbed on tight to the hot dog while trying to get her attention. She opened mouth and took a bite of the hot dog. Sam yelled to try to get her attention and as she moved in for the second bite Sam thought she saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she see him?   </span></div></div>",

Did you think I was going to treat you as a real person? Yeah right. You are my pet, and my servant. You disobey and you shall be my food.
