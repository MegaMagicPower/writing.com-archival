He shot up when he realised he had no idea where he was. He was in a plain white room, in the room was the single bed he was on with a red blanket, along with a red dresser to the other side of the room, there was a door leading out on the far wall. Ash tried to remember what had happened, he was in a forrest of some sort, he was separated from pikachu and then...then...<br>\r\n\"The Beedrill!\" Ash announced, remembering now, he was poisoned and some Team Rocket Grunt mistook him for a Jr member. This certainly was one huge mess Ash got himself into. The ebony haired boy jumped as the blue-haired grunt opened the door and peaked his head inside.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you awake?\" he asked, looking over to you. He smiled and walked inside. \"Good, you've got a pretty big day today, you may not have gotten that Ratatta yesterday but where we're going you'll find even better pokemon!\" Ash didn't know how to respond, he was NOT going to join Team Rocket, they were evil! But he couldn't have the grunt think he wasn't a Jr. Member, he couldn't risk a fight in Team Rocket's base, especially without Pikachu. \"Come on, get up!\" the grunt encouraged, \"I can't change your diaper with you under your sheets.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait! What?\" Ash asked, completely dumbfounded, it was only then that Ash actually took notice to what he was wearing. He was in black pyjamas with the Team Rocket Symbol on them and now that he was told there was no mistaking that there was a puffy diaper wrapped around his waist. <br>\r\n\"It's not that bad,\" the grunt rolled his eyes, \"It's not like I don't change you on a regular basis.\" Robin was absolutely horrified when the Grunt picked him up and laid him down on the dresser, which apparently doubled up as a changing table.<br>\r\n\"I don't need you to change me!\" Ash shouted, trying to resist. The man took off his shirt with relative ease and yanked off his pants shortly after, Ash was only ten after all and not overly strong. When his pants were removed Ash was in complete denial, he now had a clear view of his diaper and it was definitely USED!<br>\r\n\"Don't need a change huh?\" the grunt smirked, \"I suppose your diaper can magically change itself?\" Ash didn't understand, why was he messy? He didn't even wet the bed, there was no way he should have pooped. It must have been the poison, he was so disorientated that he shit himself. \"Ok, all done!\" the grunt announced, he picked up Ash and placed him on the ground, Ash probed the diaper for a moment, he felt so weird with one on, but if he wanted to keep his cover he would need to act like the Jr. Member he was thought to be. \"I suspect you can dress yourself?\" Ash nodded. \"Good, meet me in the mess hall when you're done.\" The grunt leaves the room and Ash quickly throws a Jr. Rocket uniform on, the only thing in the dresser.</span></div></div>",
