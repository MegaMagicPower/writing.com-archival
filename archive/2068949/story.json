However a package was delivered to the office inside said package was a remote with a spectacular power. The power to swap bodies around. The remote came with an instruction booklet. Not that there was any need for it. The buttons were clearly labeled \"Aware swap\" and \"Unaware swap\" respectively.<br>\r\nThe person who received the remote was going to send the package back, but then they thought 'If someone sent this they must have wanted it to be used' The one who received the remote took it and then head off to their work. Now for the most important question The person who received this amazing remote was?</span></div></div>",

He had a case today and was horribly unprepared, there was next to no evidence in the defenses favor, the prosecutor was Edgeworth, and worst of all, his defendant was Larry. Despite being in the detention center Larry decided to take advantage of Phoenix, he's refusing to cooperate unless phoenix got him a date with \"That cute Maya girl\" as he put it. Phoenix got to outside the courthouse and found Maya waiting for him. \"NIIIICK! you're almost late! Our client might think you aren't the greatest lawyer ever! We can't let him know that you aren't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix ignored her after awhile and sighed. If only there was someway he could delay this trial and investigate the crime scene for evidence. Phoenix then remembered the package he received this morning. He didn't think it would work at first, but then again, he has had stranger experiences then this. He thought over his options, He could swap himself with Maya and make Larry cooperate with him. He could swap himself with the judge and immediately postpone court for a while so he could investigate more. He could even swap Edgeworth with Maya and have the prosecution make a fool of itself for a delay, which would have the added pleasure of seeing Maya in Edgeworth's body goof off in public. Phoenix reread the insturction booklet thought over his options over and over in his head. Until he decided on...</span></div></div>",

He didn't mind doing it since Edgeworth had prevented him from investigating yesterday. He got the remote out and pointed it at Maya, who at the moment was still ranting about things. He pressed the button and nothing happened yet, due to him not selecting another person yet. As soon as court started Phoenix and Maya went to stand at the defense stand. As soon as Edgeworth came in and stood at the prosecution's stand phoenix aimed the remote and pressed the swap button. Does his plan work?</span></div></div>",

On the other side of the courtroom was Maya's body, with channeling robes, giving the prosecution's opening statements. However that was not nearly as strange as the sight right next to him, Edgeworth's body was giving him a pep talk and hopping up and down slightly \"Don't worry Nick, we have this in the bag!\" Phoenix nearly winced hearing Edgeworth's voice say that. Phoenix could hear the people in the stands in the courtroom talking. \"Mr. Wright's assistant is as weird as ever, what is that thing on her outfit, a napkin?\" One of the random people in the stands said. Another spoke up \"Mr. Edgeworth's channeling robes are as amazing as ever! More lawyers need to dress like him!\" Phoenix was making his usual sweating exhausted face. He got the remote back out to swap them back when suddenly \"Mr. Wright! There is no T.V. in this court! Also, if anyone is going to try and mute people it's me! Put that thing away!\" The Judge yelled at him 'Of course, the one time he is paying full attention to what I bring out' Phoenix monologued internally. Phoenix wanted to scream, not only would he have to deal with a trial he was in no way prepared for, but he would also have to deal with the confusion of the bodies around him, this was going to be a long day.</span></div></div>",

He sighed, he knew he was going to regret this decision in a short while. He aims the remote at Maya, who is going on and off about how he isn't the greatest lawyer ever and he owes her a burger for being late, he presses the button to swap and nothing happens yet. He then aims the remote at himself, pausing for a brief moment to say goodbye to his body, and presses the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant he notices the changes, the first thing he notices is he is much is shorter than before. He feels heavy hair hanging from his head, part of it falling in his face before he brushes it away. As he brushes it away he notices his hand, it is much smaller than normal. The next thing he notices is the loose fitting channeling robes around his body, how did Maya deal with wearing this? It felt so weird to him. After examining his body some more Phoenix remembered why he swapped in the first place, to get Larry to cooperate with him!

You must be Ayam Yef, My evil impostor!\" As she spoke she heard her own voice, she looked down at herself. She began to feel all around herself. She screamed again. Phoenix immediately grabbed her and pulled her into the courthouse. \"Maya, there is a lot of places you can scream. On the steps outside a courthouse is not one of them!\" Phoenix said, which sounded odd in Maya's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NIIIIIIICK! What's going on?!\" She said still panicking. \"Okay, just calm down and I'll explain\" Maya sat down on a chair and listened to Phoenix. This must have been odd to any bystanders since it looked like Maya was talking down to Phoenix like a child. After having to explain almost every detail of what happened twice to Maya she had calmed down a little. \"Sooooo, you want to use my body to make Larry tell you everything that happened the night of the crime?\" She asked. \"Yes, This was the only way I could think of!\" Phoenix said, not wanting to think about what he will have to do to get Larry to talk. \"Why didn't you say so before we swapped?! This will be so much fun, pretending to be you while you talk to Larry!\" Phoenix got a dumbfound expression \"Eh?\" He exclaimed. \"Welllll, it's going to take a little while to convince Larry, and the trial is going to start soon. Sooooo, I'll pretend to be you in court while you talk to him. The mere thought of Maya acting up in his body made Phoenix wince, but before he could speak up he heard the voice of a Bailiff \"Phoenix Wright! You are needed in the courtroom!\" The Bailiff yelled. \"Wish me luck!\" Maya said as she ran, no, not ran, <b>SKIPPED</b> away in Phoenix's body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was a horrible idea!\" Phoenix yelled to himself. He ran to the defendant's lobby to talk to Larry, Larry was not allowed in the courtroom itself due to stress he caused to everyone involved with every case he's been related to.</span></div></div>",

You don't just shout those things and then get a Not Guilty verdict.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack!  I don't?\"  Maya yelped.  As sweat dripped down her face Maya said to herself, \"Oh man, Nick makes all this look so easy, I didn't know there was a whole lot more to it than yelling at people til they confess something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Why are you trying to get me to confess pal!  It's that Butz guy who's did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth looked at who he thought was Phoenix and wagged his finger in disappointment, \"Detective, no need to become offended, Wright has simply lost his nerve, he's taken on a case even he knows is hopeless and is trying to bluff his way through the proceedings as usual.  Only this time the evidence and our most esteemed judge will not let that happen.  Right your honor?\"  Edgeworth gave a theatrics bow to the Judge at the end of his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little flustered and flattered the judge began to blush a little, \"Why yes Mr. Edgeworth you are quite right.  Mr. Wright, for your needless outburst I'm going to have to give you a penalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if a little explosion of life was being taken away, Maya gasped in surprise and said to herself again, \"Ack!  That wasn't supposed to happen!  Oh Nick, Larry.  I'm sorry, I guess I'm just not good enough to be a lawyer.  I'm barely good enough to channel spirits.  Phoenix and Mia are supposed to be the lawyers not me, I shouldn't be pretending like this.  Nick just needed me to not screw up until he got information out of Larry and I couldn't even do that right.  Oh Mia, I wish you were here to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust at that moment, the spirit medium in the lawyer's body had done what she does best besides eat hamburgers, she summoned down the spirit of her sister in order to help save the day, but where did Mia take form?</span></div></div>",

Which was why she always comfortable whenever Maya or Pearl summoned her in court no matter the occasion no matter how grim it looked.  Mia could always get a quick handle on the situation and help out in whatever way she could.  Although this occasion was obviously a bit...different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Mia noted is that Phoenix wasn't beside her in the defense side as usual when she was channeled.  Instead she was all by herself.  The next thing she noticed was her outfit, instead of being in Maya or Pearl's usual channeling robes, she was wearing a very familiar blue suit.  Mia sighed, \"Oh Phoenix what have you gotten yourself into now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Mr. Wright...is something the matter?  Do we need to take a recess?\"  The often confused judge looked at Mia with a confused look, Gumshoe also looked bit confused while Edgeworth just have a very noticeable twitch above his left eye as they all looked at Mia.  Mia took a deep breath and looked at the court record and knew what she had to do.  \"No your honor, but detective I noticed a contradiction in your testimony....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of going back and forth with Gumshoe and Edgeworth, Mia managed to find enough questionable evidence to prove that it couldn't have been Larry who committed the crime, although the real suspect was still out there.  Mia was still getting odd looks from Gumshoe and the Judge and Edgeworth was still glaring at her with daggers in his eyes, but that didn't matter now.  Mia had to get to the truth.  She left the court room and right outside of it were Larry and who she thought was Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry was the first to say something, \"Wow Nick!  You're sure looking a lot better than you usually do.  You start using a new shampoo or something?  Come on, give your secrets to your good pal Larry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go home Larry, you're not guilty but knowing you that won't stick for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks Nick!  You're the greatest man!  I'm going to go celebrate by getting me a new girlfriend, want to help me out with that Maya?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix, who's jaw hadn't been picked up off the ground since Mia entered, managed to say, \"Go home Larry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, well, see you guys!\"  Larry said as he left to probably get himself into even more trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Maya, what's going on, how did you teach Phoenix the Kurain Channeling Technique?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix knew that he should probably tell his old boss the truth about the situation.  \"Well Mia you see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and before I could get the information Maya was dragged off the court and I couldn't switch us back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was expecting a stern talking to from Mia, but was surprised to see that she just sighed but smiled, \"Phoenix, as usual you impress me with how far you're willing to go for your clients.  It probably wasn't the best time to do what you did, but your heart was in the right place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but my plan didn't even work, you had to come in and save the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because it didn't work doesn't mean it wasn't worth a shot, and besides you gave me a chance to be a lawyer in court again and I appreciate that Phoenix, although you should probably switch back,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right, this is kind of weird.\"  Phoenix said looking at how Mia was making the buttons on his suit strain.  \"I'll just switch back now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait until I leave this body first!\"  Mia said, but it was too late, Phoenix had already activated the swap.  And instantly Phoenix knew something was very very wrong.</span></div></div>",

Maya was quite surprised, \"So it wasn't a dream, I was in your body but I still managed to channel Mia...but you swapped back and now you are you again but you have Mia's body and...my head hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine too Maya, this is all weird and confusing.\"  Phoenix got out his crummy cell phone and looked at his reflection in the dirty screen, he looked exactly like Mia except for the fact he still had his signature spiky hair.  As he gazed into his former mentors eyes he was taken out of the moment when Maya blurted out, \"Oh I know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have an idea how to get me back to normal?\"  Phoenix said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but I think we should get some burgers!  I can't think on an empty stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the situation, Phoenix smiled, it was one of the things Maya did best for him even if she sometimes made his wallet cry.  \"All right, let's go eat and talk things over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went to Maya's favorite burger join and got the usual.  Phoenix couldn't help but notice he was getting some weird looks but he just shrugged it off.  After watching Maya eat her fill of burgers Phoenix had an idea.  \"I know, how about you try to channel Mia again.  Maybe it will...fix me or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea Nick.\"  Maya said wiping some burger remains from her outfit.  She closed her eyes and strewed up her face in concentration.  After about a minute she asked, \"Is it working Nick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked down and saw that nothing was changing, \"Sorry, nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drat!\"  Maya said pouting, then another idea came to her, \"Oh I know!  Maybe we should go train at a Kurain temple!  We could meditate under a frozen waterfall for 24 hours and lay down on a bed of nails and do all sorts of things to connect to the spirits.  I'm sure that will help and it'll be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis idea did not sound at all like fun to Phoenix.  \"I don't know Maya, we don't know if that would work and I've got a ton of stuff to do at the office including trying to find who framed Larry, I've still got to talk to him to try and get his testimony.  And then I've got other cases to work on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to be stuck like that forever Nick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't, but I don't want to get far behind on work, I've got bills to pay.  Plus this might be something that just...goes away on it's own.  I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya looked at Phoenix skeptically as Phoenix made a final decision.</span></div></div>",

Maybe I'll go with you after we get paid for this case.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phoenix had thought about the situation logically and knew what the best option was, \"I'm going to go try to talk to Larry and find out what he knows.  I wasn't able to get anything out of him when I was in your body but I know he knows something about what happened.  And he didn't seem willing to tell you so I figure I'll try as someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya nodded, \"Okay, I get what you're saying.  If Phoenix and Maya can't get Larry to talk, maybe Phoebe Wright can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.  So that means that you will be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya gave a salute, \"Don't worry Nick, I won't stop bugging Edgeworth until he tells me everything he knows about everything!  I'll take his car keys to stop him from getting away.\"  Maya was about to dart out but stopped when Phoenix told her quickly, \"Don't do that!  I've got enough to worry about without having to defend you in court for theft!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, maybe I'll just tie his shoelaces together.  That'll stop him!  Or maybe I'll take something else.\"  Maya said as she subtly grabbed the swapping device and left she said to Phoenix, \"Take care of my sister's body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my body Maya it's just I have Mia's...shape.\"  Phoenix said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then take care of my sister's shape, see you.\"  And with that Mia left leaving Phoenix to get ready for his meeting with Larry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix wasn't sure why but during their phone call Larry had insisted they meet over supper at one of Phoenix's least favorite places in the world, Tres Bien.  Phoenix entered the almost completely empty pink restaurant to be greeted by the proprietor Jean Armstrong.  \"Ah, you must be misure Butz dining partner.  Let me show you to your seat.\"  Jean took Phoenix by the arm and took him to a special table with a strong vanilla candle and Larry waiting for him at the other side of the table.  Larry quickly stood up upon seeing Phoenix and ran to the other side of the table to pull out the chair.  \"I'll leave you two to chat while I prepare your meal, the Tres Bien special for two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  Phoenix said as he sat down with a fake smile.  He couldn't tell who was protesting more, his stomach or his wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry sat down across from you and said with a chuckle, \"This is one of my favorite places to eat, it's super special and I hope you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I'll...like it.\"  Phoenix lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe Nick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked at Larry, stunned for a moment, what couldn't he believe about him?  That he'd gotten him out of jail again?  \"What about...him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe he's been hiding a cutie sister like you from me, the jerk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, um well...I've never told my friends about him so we're even.\"  Phoenix said on the fly.  Of course he'd never told Larry about 'Phoebe'.  She didn't exist until <br>\r\nthe whole body swap mixed with channeling gone wrong episode that Phoenix found himself in.  Wanting to get the info he came here for Phoenix started, \"So Larry about what you saw...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was cut off by Larry ducking under the table.  Phoenix thought about bending under too to see what he could be looking at, but after a beat Larry struggled to pull up on the table a giant arrangement of flowers.  \"I got this for you.  I hope you like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!  But how could you afford something like this when you can't even pay your legal fees!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry smiled as his cheeks turned pink, \"Well...I work a lot of jobs.  And as for Nick, I know that he just wants me to be happy and getting things for nice people like you makes me happy.  Nick's my best friend, I know he'd understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I most certainly do not!</i>  Phoenix thought looking at the flowers that had to have cost over $100.  \"Well if you don't want to pay Phoenix for your legal fees, why don't you pay me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry looked like he was about to cry, \"Do-do-do you not like the flowers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his friend upset Phoenix overcorrected, \"No no of course I do!  I just love them I just,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You LOVE them!!?!!?\"  Larry seemed to have certainly perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh man, I hope Maya's doing better with Edgeworth.</i>  Phoenix thought miserably to himself.</span></div></div>",

She had been at Edgeworth's office pestering him for at least an hour now and he would not even consider helping them with the investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Edgeworth. Won't you at least think about helping us?\" Maya said while standing inf front of Edgeworth's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth was going through some files, barely paying attention to Maya \"For the 17th time, no. Now if you please leave, I am very busy working on this and other important cases.\" Edgeworth said, turning a page in the file he was reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Why?!!?\" Maya practically whined, hoping that getting him annoyed would eventually change his mind. She wished Edgeworth wasn't always so stubborn<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth winced at her whine, but decided to answer, hoping to keep her quiet. He looked up at her and began to speak \"Because I am a prosecutor and Wright is a defense attorney. We are rivals, while I personally think of him as a friend, we can not work together. We may both work to find the truth but if we both pursued it from the same angle, it could escape our grasp. I conduct my investigations with the help of the police, however, sometimes we miss an important detail. This is where Wright and his own personal investigations come in. He finds what we missed and gets to the truth in his own way. I do hope you understand.\" Edgeworth answered. Hopefully satisfying Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Maya was listening to every word Edgeworth said, she decided to focus in on one part. \"So, if you weren't a prosecutor, you would have no problem working with Nick?\" Maya asked, slowly reaching for the swapping remote she had up her sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth sighed and looked back to his file. \"Yes, I suppose in that scenario we would work together. However, if your trying to convince me to quit my profession as a prosecutor, then you're simply babbling nonsense.\" Edgeworth bluntly told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya got a devious grin on her face \"Oh, I bet I can get you to stop being a prosecutor in 5 minutes!\" She Said with a slight laugh in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth looked up at her, a slightly annoyed look on his face \"Fey.\" He said with the same serious tone he usual spoke to Phoenix with. \"Stop this nonsense before I have to forcibly remove you from this office.\" Edgeworth closed with files, reached for a phone, and began to dial security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! How about we make a bet! Just give me 5 minutes! If I can't get you to stop being a prosecutor and investigate with Nick in five minutes, I won't come here to bother you for three months!\" Maya begged. Nick would often send her down to deal with Edgeworth. Both her and Edgeworth were sick of needing security to come up and remove her from the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth stopped dialing, although he didn't put the phone away. The idea of Maya not bothering him for three months was promising. \"You said bet, meaning you would benefit if you won. What do you want in exchange?\" He asked her, admittedly curious about what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A three month supply of burgers!\" Maya said with a smile and a bit of a jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth was nearly face planted, although he should have seen the coming from a mile away. He thought over the offer. \"Five minutes.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya nearly jumped with joy. She got the remote from out of her sleeve, pointed at Edgeworth, and pressed the button. In an instant they were swapped.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Maya was in the middle of creating a fiasco at the prosecutors office, Phoenix found he was in a bit of a pickle himself.  At the table for two at Tres Bien not only did Phoenix find himself surrounded by flowers, but by chocolates, stuffed animals, and a number of other gifts that Larry seemed to have an infinite number of.  And each time Larry would give Phoenix a gift, Phoenix would tentatively turn it down.  And when that happened Larry always started to tear up and break down making Phoenix feel back and Phoenix would overreact and tell him how much he loved his new present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry was on a euphoric high after Phoenix reluctantly accepted his gift of a scented shampoo, \"I gotta say Phoebe, seeing your smile makes it worth all the jobs I work and then some.  You're so cute I'd get arrested a hundred times over for you!  Oh and then you'd defend me in court like a fierce warrior princess and I would ride with you into the sunset where we'd live happily ever after!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix perked up the mention of Larry being arrested, maybe this was the opening he was looking for.  \"Larry if you get arrest, I don't know if I could save you every time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, of course you could, Nick does it all the time and you're like a thousand times better and smarter and cuter than he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thanks Larry,</i>  Phoenix thought a little annoyed, \"But I can't defend you unless you're completely honest with me and you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry broke down in tears again and shouted as loud as he could, \"ALL RIGHT I ADMIT IT!\"  Phoenix accidentally knocked over one of his many new stuffed animals as Larry continued, \"I admit it!  There were other women before you, but their done!  Over.  Kaput!  I've only got eyes for you Phoebe, now and forever more until the Earth exploses and the aliens take over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix banged his hands on the Tres Bien table knocking down even more of Larry's presents, \"HOLD IT!  I'm not talking about that, you haven't been honest with me about where you were and what you were doing the other night, I need to know because if you don't tell me you might get arrested again and sent to jail for the rest of your life and I won't be able to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry looked very meek, \"It doesn't matter if I got to jail, I'll have your love to keep me warm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Larry!  If you don't tell the truth I'm walking out of here and you'll never see me again!\"  Pheonix was so annoyed with Larry at this point he almost meant what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry for a brief moment got  a serious look on his face, \"All right, if it means that much to you and our relationship, I'll tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry then spent the next few minutes giving his testimony.  It turns out he was at the scene of the crime to go on a date with a woman (surprise surprise) and was stood up and was so embarrassed that he was stood up he didn't want to tell anyone he was even there.  But when he was there he saw a mysterious woman in the distance, he thought it was his date but she ran when she saw him so Larry didn't think it could be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix finished writing down his Larry's testimony and put it in the court record.  He didn't know how much this would help crack the case, but it would help figure out what happened and help the police find the real killer.  Still looking down Phoenix said, \"Thanks Larry.  You've been a big help, but you should really go tell the police about what you saw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right I guess.  No problem Phoebe, you're the best girlfriend a guy could ask for,\"  Phoenix was stunned at hearing the word 'girlfriend' but before he could correct Larry on this matter, Phoenix looked up just in time to be be kissed by one of his best friends.  \"I already paid, I'll see you later Phoebe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix just sat in his chair frozen for a while before leaving to vomit, it was the first time that had happened at Tres Bien and the cause wasn't the food.  Walking like a zombie, Phoenix finally made it back to Wright and Co. law offices where he was surprised to see that somebody was waiting for him.</span></div></div>",

Phoenix was in too much shock to listen to their conversation, though he did keep his eye on them as he flopped down onto the couch. Maya pointed at him and appeared to ask Edgeworth something to which Edgeworth nodded. Maya began to walk over to Phoenix, looking angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wright, I want a full explanation, now. \"What appeared to be Maya demanded while tapping her foot and angry scowl on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Phoenix a few second to process that Maya was acting differently, he then realized that she was talking and exactly like exactly. \"Edgeworth?\" Phoenix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Wright. As you can see, Ms. Fey has shown me what that swapping device's capabilities.\" Edgeworth replied, very annoyed at the situation. \"She also informed me after our own swap that you currently have the body of your mentor Mia Fey.\" Edgeworth continued, doing one of his signature finger wag/points. \"Be honest with me Wright. Where did you get this device?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was still trying to process this whole day himself. Maybe it was better to let Edgeworth in on the details. He explained how he had no idea where the package came from and that the only thing included with the remote was the instruction manual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth paced back and forth thinking Phoenix's story over. It didn't make any logical sense, however, Edgeworth was in no position to deny the fact that the remote did work. His thinking was interrupted when his own body literally hopped between his and Phoenix's conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess what Nick! Edgeworth said that he would help us investigate what happened with Larry!\" Maya said, hopping with joy. Which was a sight that would make anyone stare in shock. She had the swapping remote in her hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Phoenix can ask why, Edgeworth began to explain. \"Ms. Fey made a wager with me, she used the remote to win. There's nothing else you need to know Wright.\" Edgeworth explained, not wanting to go into the full details of the bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of...\" Maya began, as if on cue. \"Time for you to pay your half of the bet!\" Maya demanded of Edgeworth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Switch us back and I will give you your reward.\" Edgeworth responded, getting impatient about being in Maya's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! If I switch us back you won't have a reason to give me those burgers!\" Maya said, pocketing the swapping remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Fey! Swap us back right now!\" Edgeworth said, starting to get angry. Though his usual angry expression looked cute on his new body. He reached toward his own body's coat pocket<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Maya said and took a few steps back, causing Edgeworth to trip and fall. Edgeworth got back up and began to practically stomp toward Maya, who began to run around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix laid down on the couch, he was too exhausted for this. As Maya kept running from Edgeworth she stuck her hands into her new coat's pockets. In it she found something REALLY interesting. She pulled it out and showed it to Edgeworth and Phoenix. \"Look what I found! Car keys and a wallet!\" She gloated, causing Edgeworth to pale up. \"Maybe you won't have to reward me Edgeworth! I can pay for them myself now!\" Before Edgeworth could do anything Maya had run out the door, keeping the swapping remote with her.</span></div></div>",

He turned to Phoenix and started to make demands \"Wright, were does Maya usually go to eat burger? I need to get there before she spends all of the money in my wallet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was still lying on the couch, staring at the ceiling in disbelief over the incident with Larry. \"I don't know. She eats burgers from plenty of places, she might go to them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth nearly turned pale at the thought of Maya going all over town in his body, stopping at every burger joint she came across. \"Wright, we need to go find her!\" he yelled. \"We'll take your car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a car.\" Phoenix groaned, not wanting anything to do with Maya and Edgeworth's situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth was ready the bang his head against the wall at this point. There was absolutely nothing he could do to catch up with Maya. He could try chasing her on foot, but that would be a waste of time. Not only did he have no idea where she was going, but she was also in a car while he was on foot. Plus, it was getting late, wandering the streets in a young girls body would probably be dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she damages the car, I'll be forwarding the bill to you, Wright.\" Edgeworth said, and expression of anger on his face. He went to sit down on a spare chair that Phoenix kept around the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of silence, Edgeworth spoke up. \"Despite the current circumstance, I intend to keep my end of the wager with Ms. Fey.\" Edgeworth began, referring to the case that Larry was just proven Not Guilty in. He went over to Wright's desk and picked up some case files that he had brought with him. \"This everything I obtained in my investigation with the police. While our only initial suspect was Butz, there was some evidence that just didn't fit with that theory. While Mia Fey, being channeled to your body, in court earlier used this contradictory evidence to win a not guilty verdict, it still raises the questions of WHY we have this evidence and WHO actually committed the crime.\" Edgeworth said, shuffling through the evidence. \"As far as my investigations go, there was no one else at Gourd Lake that night.\" Edgeworth continued, showing Wright the profiles of who was involved with this case. \"Ms. Fey informed me that you didn't conduct your own investigation yet. I shall assist you. We should leave immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix sat up and looked out the window and saw that the sun had set. He wondered if he and Edgeworth should return to the crime scene now or wait till morning. On one hand, it would be much easier to miss evidence in the dark than during daylight. On the other hand, the real culprit may return to the scene and destroy evidence if they wait till morning. What did Phoenix decide to do?</span></div></div>",

Besides, we don't have to go to court tomorrow so we'll have all day to investigate with no distractions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No distraction?!\"  Edgeworth said making Maya's face look about as mad as Phoenix had ever seen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean no courtroom distractions, besides, you aren't the only one who's had a life altering experience today,\"  Phoenix said gesturing to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.  You're right Wright.  Sorry.\"  Edgeworth said gruffly crossing his arms.  There was some silence between the two rivals before Edgeworth broke the silence.  \"Where does Maya usually sleep?  I should probably go there since I don't have my keys and don't want to risk be caught breaking into my own home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya sometimes takes the bus to Kurain village but when it's this late I usually let her stay in the office.  Heck I usually sleep here more often than my own bed, it feels more like home.\"  Phoenix smiled to himself, he'd only ever told Maya that and maybe it was because it was Maya's body but he felt comfortable telling Edgeworth this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. That's very...\"  Edgeworth not quite sure what to say gave a quick cough and changed the subject, \"Well Wright.  Do you have a secret bed you want to tell me about or do I sleep on the burger wrappers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are sleeping bags and pillows in the closet, you can take the couch, I'll take the floor, or my desk, or whatever makes me more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth went to the closet and pushed aside an oddly placed step ladder, he pulled out two sets of pillows and sleeping bags.  Wanting to get the day over with and trying not to think about what Maya was doing to his bank account Miles Edgeworth got in the sleeping bag on the couch.  Maya's accolite robes weren't as comfortable as his normal expensive custom made pajamas, but they were comfortable enough for Edgeworth to eventually drift off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix kicked a bunch of trash and strewn about paperwork into a corner and put his sleeping bag on the ground.  Thinking back on the day Phoenix had to admit he didn't completely hate the weirdness of it all, and it somehow resulted in a not guilty verdict for Larry and the first real lead on the case.  Although Phoenix did wish for a moment he was in his home so he could at least use some mouthwash to wash the last remains of Larry's kiss away.  The last thought Phoenix thought before finally drifting off was, <i>I wonder if mind bleach is a real thing?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning the two lawyers got up bright and early.  They were a little nervous that they hadn't heard from Maya yet (Well, Phoenix was worried about Maya while Edgeworth seemed worried about his possessions) but they knew they had a job to do.  Phoenix changed into another blue suit.  It was awkward but he was familiar enough with his suits that he could do it with his eyes closed...and in this case he made sure his eyes stayed shut as he changed out of respect for his mentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done changing he and his assistant for the day opened the door to try to begin the investigation.</span></div></div>",

Somehow Phoenix and his friends always got involved with cases like this. The general area surrounding the public beach had been sealed off by police tape. However, no police were there at the moment, probably because the initial police investigation had ended. There was an outline of where the body was was outlined in white chalk as usual. There was a bloody cart that sold samurai samurai dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we begin our investigation?\" Edgeworth asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.\" Phoenix replied, seeing Maya's body talk in such a professional way was very odd to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't rest until we investigated every nook and cranny.\" Edgeworth said on habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right. You go over by the lake itself. I'll look around this area.\" Phoenix explained and sent Edgeworth off. Phoenix walked over to the samurai dog stand to investigate.  Strange, this stand seemed familiar. Phoenix tried to remember where this stand belonged to. \"That's right this stand is - oh no.\" Phoenix said plainly as he remembered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Phoebe!\" Larry shouted from behind Phoenix, causing Phoenix to turn around. Before Phoenix could say anything Larry had brought him into a hug. After Larry stopped hugging him, he handed Phoenix some chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?!\" Phoenix yelled as chocolate was shoved in his face. Which Phoenix took out of habit from last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I work here! I'm the, uh, most successful seller of Samurai Dogs sold at Gourd lake.\" Larry bluffed in an attempt to sound cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix rolled his eyes \"Why are you at the crime scene?! Didn't the police tape give you the idea to stay away\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Police tape? You mean the yellow jump rope stuff? I just ignored it. It's one of the lamest toilet paper pranks ever.\" Larry explained \"Plus, I saw you past the tape. I knew it was a sign that it was our destiny to meet here and have the perfect date! \" He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was ready to puke, again, as Larry talked about another date. Before he could say anything Larry had taken his hand. \"C'mon, Phoebe. This beach is boring. I know a nice boat we could ride in the lake on!\" Larry exclaimed and began dragging Phoenix to the boat rental shop. This one NOT going to be a pleasant experience. Phoenix tried his best to think a way out of this situation.</span></div></div>",

Well I've got to go see you later Lar...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you don't have to go!\"  Larry said cutting off Phoenix, \"It's not closed, well it is, but I can open it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix still wanted to get away but his curiosity was taking over.  \"What do you mean you can open it up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I actually run that boat rental shop.\"  Larry said with a dopey smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...just...why?  How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I don't mean to scare you, but this boat house was run by a murderer!  But me, Nick, and Edgeworth made sure he was put in jail.  I did most of the work though, don't let Nick tell you any different.\"  Phoenix groaned as Larry said this.  Sure Larry's testimony during that case had been vital but Phoenix had to do a lot of digging through Larry's murky testimony.  \"And when the murderer Yogi guy went to jail the people who own the land needed someone to run the boat house and they saw I worked just over there at the Samurai Dog stand so they hired me on the spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So they just didn't bother finding anyone qualified.</i>  Phoenix thought to himself.  \"Well, that's neat and explains a whole lot.  But I don't think I want to ride on a boat with you right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be nervous Phoebe!  I mean, just because the guy who used to own this place took a dude out on a boat and shot him doesn't mean I'd do that to you!  I mean the girl I liked before you used to take some dude out on the lake all the time  It's actually how I met her.  I thought it looked super cool and romantic so I wanna take you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Larry said struck a chord with Phoenix's lawyer mind, \"That girl you keep mentioning to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're not jealous!  It's cool that you want to fight her over me.  I've always wanted to see a catfight, but even if she pulls your hair and stuff I'll love you anyways!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!  Larry, focus, that girl you keep mentioning.  You said she hung out with a guy out here,\"  Phoenix started looking in the case file until he found what he was looking for, a picture of the victim.  \"Was this the man she would go out on the boat with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry looked at the profile picture for a second before saying, \"Yeah Phoebe, I think that's the dude...wait!  Why do you have a picture of another man!\"  Larry looked like he was about to start crying.  Phoenix put the picture away but before he could focus on this breakthrough in the case he had to deal with the Butz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Larry it's nothing, it's all just a part of a case, now could you tell me something more about what they did out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry got stars in his eyes as he grabbed Phoenix's hand and said, \"I got a better idea, I'll show you!\"  And before Phoenix could protest again, the two were on a rowboat and were already on Gourd Lake.  Phoenix decided to ignore Larry as he rowed and just tried to look around the lake and it's shores to see if he could see something but nothing stood out.  \"Larry, do you know just what exactly they were doing out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry nodded, \"They were doing this!\"  And Larry ripped open his shirt.  Phoenix gasped and looked away afraid of where Larry was taking this but a few seconds later a hurt sounding Larry said, \"Did I do something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix slowly turned to look at Larry and Phoenix's jaw hit the ground.  Apparently under Larry's clothes he was wearing a full scuba outfit, oxygen tank and all.  \"But...just...why?  How?\"  Phoenix asked for the second time in minutes.  Larry was certainly full of surprises lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The people who own the land were looking for a scuba instructor and saw me by the Samurai Dogs and hired me on the spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The people who run this place really need to extend their job search beyond the hot dog stand.</i>  Phoenix thought before realizing why Larry stripped down.  \"So...the victim and that woman were diving at the lake?  Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but it was always in this area and they'd always bring a box with them.  I think they were fishing for lobsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I need to find out what's down there.  Larry, do you think you could go down there and get the box for me?  Please?\"  Phoenix said not realizing how cute Larry found him asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At once!  One lobster dinner for my cutey coming right up!\"  Larry fell out of the boat and a minute later he emerged with a box.  Phoenix quickly opened it seeing that it was full of cash.  \"What in the world were those two up to?\"  Phoenix said to himself as Larry rowed them back to shore.  With box in hand Phoenix said, \"Thanks Larry, you've been a lifesaver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you babe!\"  Larry said and once again surprised Phoenix with another kiss on the lips.  It was said that you could hear Phoenix's internal screaming all the way to the Kurain village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Edgeworth in Maya's body had gotten tied up with someone at the other end of the lake.</span></div></div>",

He had not run into any evidence that he hadn't during his initial investigation, however, it did no harm to double check. He discovered many footprints, meaning that no citizens were bothering to obey the police tape. As he investigated he looked across the lake and saw a boat. On instinct he looked out toward the boat. Maya's eyes were better than his, he was starting to need glasses but he didn't want to get any. He looked at the boat and saw...Phoenix and Larry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What possible reason could he have for going there?\" He questioned aloud. He hoped that Wright actually had a reason and didn't just leave all the actual investigating to him.

He recognized the girl as Maya's young cousin Pearl. \"What are you doing here?\" He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A person came to the village and said they wanted a spirit channeled. I came all the way to town on the tray-in to get you. I went to Mr. Nick's place, but you weren't there.\" Pearl said, then began to cry \"I've been running all of the city looking for you.\" She cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth couldn't help but feel sad for the young girl. He let Pearl continue hugging him until she was done crying. Once he was done he ended the hug and began to lecture her. \"It was very irresponsible of you to wander around the city with no destination in mind. You could have gotta hurt or worse in a city like this.\" In his own body this would have sounded like he was ridiculing her, in Maya's body it was nothing more than a motherly lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his lecture Pearl had seemed to cheer up. She was probably happy that Maya, or who she thought was Maya, was happy to see her. She then grabbed Edgeworth's arm and began to pull him along. \"C'mon, we have to get to the village so you can channel that spirit!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth walked along with Pearl for a little while as he thought of a way to avoid going to Kurain village.

I have to investigate a very important case.\"  Edgeworth said pulling Maya's channeling robes from Pearl's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl let out a cute little gasp before covering most of her head with her hands, \"Are you doing something for your...special someone.\"  Pearl said turning a shade of red.  Edgeworth stumbled back a few steps turning a bit red himself.  \"Special...someone...no I'm just investigating a very important murder trial at the moment.  I'm working with Phoenix Wright and I can not afford any distractions from any channeling or any...special anybody's.  So please go to your home and leave me be and try to find someone else to channel whomever it is you need to speak with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl nodded, \"Yes Mystic Maya, I know you need to help out Mr. Nick.  I'll just have to try to summon the spirit myself.\"  Pearl rolled up her sleeves and pulled out a picture of a man.  Out of curiosity Edgeworth happened to glance at the picture and snatched it from Pearl's hands.  \"The murder victim!\"  Edgeworth couldn't believe it, he'd been out searching for clues and one had appeared before him thanks to this little girl.  \"Young miss...Pearl I believe.  Who wants Maya to summon the victim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl looked at Edgeworth with a very confused look on her face, but she answered, \"Um...I don't know the man, I only saw him for a minute.  He had big eyebrows and wanted to meet with you Mystic Maya.\"  \"And this man is waiting in Kurain village for...me.  Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl nodded, \"Well it looks like I'll be going with you after all.  I may be able to get some new clues from this man who seemed to know the victim.\"  Edgeworth looked back out to the lake and saw Phoenix and Larry were still out there and groaned as he continued to speak to himself, \"I don't know what you're doing Wright but it better not be as big a waste of time as it seems.  Right.\"  Edgeworth turned back to Pearl.  \"Take me to this village.  Lead the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long trip Edgeworth and Pearl set foot in Kurain village where there was a very intimidating presence waiting for them.  \"You're late.\"  A soft and low voice spoke, but the voice was clear and Edgeworth knew this wasn't a man to be trifled with.  It took a moment but after Edgeworth saw him he knew who it was.  The tall man before them was Winfred Kitaki.  A man who had a hand in a lot of crime but as much as the prosecutions office tried they could never make anything stick.  Edgeworth straightened up and gave a polite bow, \"I'm sorry for being late, now before we attempt to do the spirit channeling I'm going to have to ask you a number of questions concerning the victim, I mean the spirit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitaki didn't seem to enthused to be answering questions he would never have answered from a cop or prosecutor, but he seemed to really need the help of the spirit channeler so he reluctantly answered.  Edgeworth grilled Kitaki for an hour about the victim and found some useful information.  It turns out the victim worked for Kitaki and seemed to have made off with a good chunk of money.  He was trying to track him down when the victim turned up dead.  Kitaki believed the victim's personality changed as soon as he met some mysterious woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kitaki had given Edgeworth plenty of information that made him suspicious, it seems obvious that Kitaki wasn't the killer.  Edgeworth stood up to leave to make it back to the city to compare notes with Phoenix when Kitaki's voice softly said, \"Now please Mystic Maya, I've told you what I know.  Now summon the no good rat and help me out.\"  Edgeworth froze, he had no idea how to summon a spirit, he barely knew anything about the process.  Edgeworth stammered, \"Well yes...indeed...if you will just give me a moment's time I believe I can arrange...\"  When all of the sudden something happened that made Edgeworth's jaw drop.</span></div></div>",

Edgeworth had to admit, he felt a bit nervous right now. Two of the most infamous criminals that he knew about were in the same room as him. He stayed calm though, while these two would be wary of any prosecutors in the same room as them, they would have no reason to be wary of a spirit medium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winfred, what are you doing? I told you not to come to ask these spirit mediums for help! This rat stole money from us, so we will be the ones to fix this problem.\" Plum Said in a serious, almost threatening voice to her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinfred Kitaki appeared to want to say something, but he gave into his wife's demands. \"Alright little Plum. We'll find him ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlum seemed to cheer up a bit. \"Good.

Also, forget the conversation that you just heard.\" Winfred's voice got threatening on that last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Winfred and Plum left, Edgeworth let out a relieved sigh. After getting over the nervous situation he was just in, he gathered his thoughts. He needed to get back to Wright and tell him about the information that he had learned from Winfred Kitaki. The two of them would also have to be more careful in their investigation now. The Kitaki's were searching for the money that the victim had stolen before he died.

Edgeworth had only seen pictures of the place due to the case there a ways back and it seemed to him to still have the...unique charm it had before.  He felt he was going to suffocate on the lack of proper elegance but he could have time for that later.  Before he knew it he had been shoved into a locker room and told to hurry up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth had never seen something so...orange in his life.  He did not want to touch the thing let alone wear it, but with Armstrong and his oddly unnerving eyes stuck in his head Edgeworth decided it best to get it over with and not let anyone ever find out about this.  He reluctantly put on the uniform.   He did it quickly and as respectfully as he could for Maya's sake.  Finally he emerged from the dressing room ready for the 'lunch rush' that Armstrong insisted was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to Edgeworth's confusion the rush never came.  The only customer Edgeworth had to wait on was an old man with an unusually large nose who insisted on the special.  Edgeworth delivered it and couldn't help but notice that the food was not what held the old man's attention.  Edgeworth clinched Maya's fist and somehow managed to keep his cool long enough for the old man to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that this ordeal is done, I believe it is time I left this place.\"  Edgeworth said removing his apron.  \"Oh no madam!  You must not, for now zee dinner rush will soon come and vee must be prepared!\"  Armstrong quickly went back to the kitchen.  Edgeworth knew he had to get out of this now.  He spotted the phone and knew the only way he'd make a quick and successful escape is if he had someone to pick him up, he doubted he could get far enough away on foot and he didn't know the bus schedule.  Making sure Jean was not looking, Edgeworth picked up the phone and thought about who to dial.  Wright was the first that came to mind since he already knew his situation and owed him for leaving him alone at Gourd lake while Wright was lollygagging about in a boat.  But as much respect as he had for Wright in court, in this situation he wasn't sure he could rely on him.  Edgeworth then thought about calling one of the more reliable people he knew, but that person would help him and not Maya so he'd have to tell the whole sorted tail leaving him open for humiliation and criticism.  But then again, Franziska von Karma would criticize him anyways no matter the situation. </span></div></div>",

Not only would he be ridiculed by her, but she would most likely ask to use the swapping remote, which after this situation Edgeworth never wanted to even hear about again. With this though in his mind he began to dial Wright's cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he a few rings Wright picked up \"Hello Phoen- Phoebe Wright speaking.\" Phoenix answered, his voice sounding sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wright. I'm in a situation. You need to Come to the Tres bien restaurant and pick me up.\" Edgeworth explained, not sure why Wright was using a female name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you there?\" Phoenix said, then it sounded as if he gargled water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story that I do not wish to go into. Are you drinking something?\" Edgeworth asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Gourd lake's disgusting water.\" Phoenix said then continued to wash his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wright, why?\" Edgeworth asked with a hand on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....don't want to think about it.\" Phoenix answered, then puked. Either from the the lake water or from thinking about what happened earlier. After a few seconds Phoenix changed the subject \"I can't pick you up, but I can give you the bus schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth sighed. \"Yes, do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next bus should be there in about an hour or so.\" Phoenix told him, then continued to gargle lake water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth paled at the thought of being here for another hour. \"Are you positive that there are no buses to arrive sooner than that?\" He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I gotta go.\" Phoenix said before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth sighed to himself. Perhaps calling Franziska would have been the preferable choice, but he made his choice and would have to wait an hour. He sat down at one of the tables, he doubted any customers would show up before the bus arrived. The Tres Bien uniform was not what he would call comfortable to sit in.</span></div></div>",

He considered reading something, however the only thing that Tres Bien had to read were fashion magazines, which he had absolutely no interest in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat there, bored and looking at the clock, the door to the restaurant opened. To his surprise it was Maya in his body that walked in. It took only a brief glance to realize the damage that Maya had done. She had split ketchup all over his cravat! He stood up and walked over to her, she seemed as surprised to see him as he was to see her. \"Fey, what have you done?\" He asked, tapping his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya had a feeling she knew what Edgeworth was talking about, she grabbed the cravat as she talked \"Oh, this. I had some stuff on my, your, face. So I used your fancy napkin to wipe it off.\" She explained with an innocent giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth didn't think that it was funny \"That cravat was very expensive, not to mention it's a sign of elegant high class life-style. It is not a napkin!\" He said enraged, which made Maya sad. As Edgeworth fumed about his cravat he remembered something. \"Fey, you have my car, correct?\" He asked, hoping to get out of here as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I kinda, don't know where it is.\" Maya said sheepishly. \"I was having trouble driving, so I parked it in the first parking lot I saw and I forgot where that was,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth was ready to bang his head against the table, he glared at Maya.

So after scraping his tongue with a tree branch, Phoenix took the bus and went back to his home base of Wright and Co. Law office and wait for word from Edgeworth.  Plus Phoenix wanted to get a nap in, he felt drained.  Larry tended to have that effect on him, more-so lately than usual.  So he curled up on the couch and got some shut eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later Phoenix woke up and noticed he'd missed a phone call.  He recognized the number as Edgeworth's cell meaning Maya had tried to get in touch with him.  \"Well, it's good to know she hasn't put Edgeworth's body into a burger coma, he'll be glad to hear that.\"  Phoenix decided that he should fully wake up before calling Maya back, he didn't want to be only half awake when dealing with her when she's excited which she surely still was.  So Phoenix made his way to bathroom and splashed his face with cold water.  Looking up in the mirror he still had a hard time believing what he was seeing.  Staring back at him was still his mentor Mia's face and body with his spiky hair and usual blue suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia, I'm glad to see you, but I really wish it wasn't in a mirror.\"  Phoenix said to himself sadly before jumping at the sound of something he wasn't expecting.</span></div></div>",

Edgeworth left my acolyte robes in the locker room of that weird restaurant!\" Maya exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time, that was necessary.The locker room was through the kitchen, the owner of that establishment wouldn't have let me change if he thought I was going to leave.

We need to go back there and get my robes back! Please!\" She begged, putting a teary face on Edgeworth's body, which was very unnerving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Phoenix could give into Maya, Edgeworth interrupted \"We've already wasted so much time best spent investigating. It would not be logical to waste anymore. We should head back to the lake at once.\" Edgeworth explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix thought it over. Maya always had her acolyte robes and he would feel bad if something bad happened to them while they were with Armstrong. At the same time though, Edgeworth was right.

I don't know if I feel comfortable with him just floating around either.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, who should he be?\" Maya asked. \"It ought to be someone we know or can keep in touch with, I think.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're at a courthouse. Maybe a lawyer Phoenix knows is around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably. Even Phoenix's regular friends seem to find their way to courtrooms,\" Maya replied. \"Honestly, I don't know if he has any friends who haven't been wrapped up in a murder case,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix took umbrage to that, but he couldn't really express it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! There's someone!\" Maya exclaimed as she point to someone exiting the courthouse. \"Phoenix, if you're listening, take that person.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it? </span></div></div>",

There's someone!\" Maya exclaimed as she point to someone exiting the courthouse. \"Phoenix, if you're listening, take that person.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked to where Maya pointing and saw Franziska Von Karma leaving the courtroom. It was clear she was working on some kind of case. She seemed to be muttering something about 'Foolish fools' under her breath. Before deciding to actually go into her body Phoenix took a second look around to see if there was anyone else he could fly into, unfortunately for him, he couldn't find anyone else he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix took a deep breath and floated into her. After he did he was immediately disoriented, he stumbled back and fourth for a while, Franziska's heels were incredibly hard to stand in. Switching with Maya earlier was strange, but Franziska's body was a completely different feeling. Although both of their bodies felt like a completely other world to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix stumbled over to Maya and Mia. Maya giggled a bit seeing the 'perfect' Franziska Von Karma have trouble walking. \"Couldn't I have just taken the body of some person. Did it have to be her?\" Phoenix asked, extremely uncomfortable in Von Karma's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Nick, but you can't just take someones body, what if you mess up they're life!\" Maya said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it!\" Phoenix shouted \"That's a contradiction! I doesn't matter whose body I'm in. I'm not going to act like someone else!\" He yelled, getting strange looks from people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet Phoenix, you're yelling like a crazy person.\" Mia told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" Phoenix asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a long and hectic day.

A man in a uniform seemed to be approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're needed in the courtroom!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phoenix slowly walked into the courtroom. Extremely nervous about the situation he was in. How was he supposed to prosecute a trial, let alone a trial that he knows nothing about. Out of habit he walked over to the defense stand. Making the entire courtroom look at him oddly. After at least a minute Phoenix realized his mistake and stumbled over to the prosecutions stand, he took note of how the defense attorney in this case was one he didn't know, thankfully, it was strange enough to act like Von Karma in front of an entire courtroom of strangers, but he would never be able to keep up the act in front of someone he actually knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Ms. Von Karma?\" The Judge asked \"It's not like you to make a mistake like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix processed the question for a few seconds 'Act like Von Karma, Act like Von Karma' He thought to himself over and over \"Mistake? I don't make Mistake. I am perfect\" Phoenix said 'What would she do next?' He thought for a second, then attempted to whip the judge. The whip just fell limp in front of him. \"Just start the trial, uh, Foolish fool.\" Phoenix knew he was doing a horrible job at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, we shall begin the trial at once. Opening statements Ms. Von Karma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. Just, Give me a second!\" Phoenix said. Von Karma thankfully had all the files on the case in her court record. Phoenix got out all of the files, then as he began to read them, he dropped them all. He quickly went down on the floor to pick them all up. \"The, Um, The prosecution has a decisive witness, and, some evidence.\" He explained to the court. \"The Prosecution calls the detective in charge of this case to the stand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoenix continued to pick up the files, detective Gumshoe went up to the witness stand. He stood there in silence. Phoenix wondered why he wasn't doing anything, but then he remembered he was the prosecution \"State you name and occupation.\" He said, imitating Von Karma's usual tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dick Gumshoe, I'm the Homicide detective in charge of this case!\" He said with his usual cheeriness. \"Detective. Describe to the court the findings of the police investigation.\" Phoenix ordered, which he had to admit felt good. Under his breath he also sighed in relief, he shouldn't have to do much while the defense does their Cross-Examination. As Detective Gumshoe kept getting pressed and his statements being objected to, Phoenix stayed silent, he knew absolutely nothing about how to prosecute, he always payed attention to his defense, not the Prosecution's strategy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Gumshoe entire testimony was proven to have more holes in it than Swiss cheese by the defense, Gumshoe look over to Phoenix. \"Aren't you going to say anything!\" He asked Phoenix while giving a sad look. Phoenix knew he had to do something, but he didn't know what. He did the first thing that came to mind \"The Prosecution would like to call it's decisive witness!\" He told the judge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, the detective has barely said anything, and all of the evidence presented so far has been proven irrelevant by the defense! I'm ready to give a Not Guilty verdict at this time!\" The judge said and held up his gavel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OBJECTION!\" Phoenix yelled. \"Just let me call fourth my witness! I swear I'll turn this trial around!\" He told the Judge, who gave him with a strange look. Phoenix tried to whip the Judge again in hopes of changing his mind, the whip fell limp again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, the prosecution may be allowed to call forth one witness. after a fifteen minute recess\" The Judge announced and hit his gavel on the desk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked through the now unorganized files for the witness Von Karma had prepared. After finding out their name and reading through everything that happened in the case Phoenix felt just a little less bad about his horrible performance in the Courtroom. This case was simpler than ones he had worked on, either that or his cases were always extremely difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what he gathered reading the files a man is being accused of murdering his girlfriend, the witness was a friend of the girlfriend who had been staying with them. Phoenix looked through the case, his defense attorney habits kicking in. The main reason the man was being accused was the time of death and that the witness had seen the murder at that time. Phoenix looked through the evidence and found that the oven was left on and open, he deduced that this would change the time of death, meaning that the testimony prepared for the prosecution's witness had to be fake, just like the time of death. Phoenix was so busy reading the files that he didn't realize that 30 minutes had passed. A Bailiff walked into the room \"Ms. Von Karma! The Judge is getting impatient! Please! H-Hurry!\" The Bailiff said, clearly afraid of being whipped by Von Karma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix ran over to the courtroom in a hurry, Leaving Von Karma's heels behind so he could run. As he entered the courtroom shoe-less he got even more strange looks then he did before. Once he was all settled he called fourth the witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witness, a man with a shaved head and a muscular build, stood at the stand and gave their testimony, The Judge gave the defense permission to cross examination. However, a cry was heard in the courtroom before the defense could say a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OBJECTION!\" Phoenix yelled and looked to the witness he called. \"You say that you saw the murder at 8:30 correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, 8:30 was when he died after all.\" The witness said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Von Karma? What are you doing? This is your own witness.\" The Judge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just getting some facts straight, Your Honor\" Phoenix said, too caught up in the moment to act like Von Karma. \"You say that 8:30 was the time of death, however, that can't be right. He said, holding his files. \"TAKE THAT!\" He said and presented the open oven evidence. \"The oven was left open, meaning that the time of murder could not have been 8:30. So, why did you testify that you saw the murder at 8:30?\" Phoenix demanded the question to the witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis witness was nowhere near as resilient as the normal witnesses Phoenix dealt with, so after a while he broke him and the witness confessed to being the real murderer. Phoenix felt proud when the Judge gave the Not Guilt verdict and everyone left the Courtroom. However, this feeling didn't last long. During the whole trial he looked like a complete idiot. He also proved the defendant not guilty, making Von Karma look incompetent. He could imagine the news now. This was bad! He may have just ruined Von Karma's reputation. hopefully this trial wouldn't affect her that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing he could do now. He decided to leave the courtroom before something else happened to make this day worse. He headed out the door of the courthouse, leaving behind the heels he took off earlier. Where does Phoenix head?</span></div></div>",

He paused to consider things for a moment, but decided that being barefoot was preferable to walking in those heels. <i>'She'll get them back somehow,'</i> he reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked, he did a quick inventory of his new belongings, and found a set of keys in Franziska's pocket. The one that most stood out to him was a car key. Phoenix's eyes seemed to light up. \"It's been a while since I got the chance to drive,\" he muttered in Franziska's voice. He'd been relying on buses and taxis for quite a while now. He clicked the car alarm button and managed to locate Franziska's vehicle - a nice car not unlike Edgeworth's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's unfair that prosecutors get such nice things; I should let myself enjoy her stuff while I'm here!\" Phoenix opened the door and got in the car. It seemed well kept, but a bit empty. \"Hmm, y'know, Maya might prefer it if I leave her and Mia alone for a bit,\" he reasoned. \"I <i>probably</i> have time to find a pair of shoes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the address on her license, Phoenix eventually managed to find Von Karma's residence. It was a bit of an ordeal, but he managed to not crash her car. He would've felt awful if he hurt her reputation and wrecked her car in the same day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to her key ring, he managed to find one with a number, which he took to be her apartment number. He took the elevator a few floors up, getting some looks for being barefoot, and came to the door of her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice place she lives in... was expecting like, a dungeon to be honest.\" Her home was very clean, like her car. It was decorated a bit sparsely but all the furniture she did have seemed to be rather high quality. It wasn't very spacious, though. There was a bedroom, a bathroom, and a living/eating area. It seemed she lived alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Wright just grab a better set of shoes and leave, or does he stick around and search her home a bit more? He didn't know too much about Von Karma personally, and there'd be no better way to learn more about her than to look through her things consequence-free. </span></div></div>",

He looked around her apartment for a closet so he could replace the shoes he lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile searching for one a thought came to mind, what would Von Karma think when he depossessed. From her point of view she would have been unconscious for a day while her body went and made her act like a foolish fool, and she wouldn't have any idea why. Phoenix felt really bad about this, but, what's done is done. If he didn't do this, he wouldn't have any body right now and who knows what would happen to him if he just floated around blindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending a few more moments in thought Phoenix found the closet. He opened it and looked over Fraziska's clothes. To his surprise she had more outfits than just copies of the one she usually wore when prosecuting cases. Phoenix was convinced that prosecutors just wore the same kinds of outfits every day, Edgeworth always wearing the same kind of suit didn't help change that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska's wardrobe had a surprisingly wide variety of outfits. Ranging from 'Formal to Extremely Formal' if Phoenix had to describe it. He didn't see any casual clothes. Casual clothes probably weren't 'Perfect' enough for a Von Karma he figured. However, this came to Phoenix's detriment. He looked through all the shoes she owned and found to his disappointment that she didn't own a single pair of shoes that didn't have heels. He stared at the shoes with a disappointed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began to put the shoes on he thought of something. He didn't think Von Karma had any other kinds of clothes, surely there must have been other people who thought that. If he changed his clothes now, maybe no one would recognize his body if he was wearing something else. That way he didn't risk ruining her reputation even more. However at the same time he figured that changing her clothes would be a HUGE breach in privacy. Thinking it over a while he decided to...</span></div></div>",

While changing her clothes was a extreme breach of privacy, but this whole day he has been unintentionally ruining her reputation. He didn't want to screw up her life anymore, so the less likely to be recognized, the better. He put down the shoes that he had grabbed and continued to look through the closet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked through her closet to find something to change into. Girls clothing was like and alien world to him. One particular outfit caught his eye though. It seemed to be a mix between the outfit he usually saw her in and an outfit he saw in pictures of her when she was younger that he saw when he walked into the room. It had the the white undershirt of both outfits as a base. It had elements of her current outfit such as her pencil skirt and her heeled shoes. It also had elements of her old outfit such as the tailcoat and a cravat similar to her father's and Edgeworth's. Though it had some elements that completely separated it from the other two. It had frills at the end of her sleeves and toward the neck. It also lacked the stockings of her usual outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked over the outfit a few more times and decided to wear it. Although it was similar to her current outfit, it was different enough that hopefully not many people who don't personally know Von Karma wouldn't recognize him. Plus the outfit being similar to Von Karma's meant that when he did get to his office Maya and Mia would recognize him as him Von Karma's body and not some stranger. He took it out of the closet and prepared for what he expected to be any even more difficult part of the day than needing to prosecute....Changing a women's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to take off the clothes he was currently wearing, being as careful as he could to not look at Von Karma's body in her underwear. He put on the frilly white undershirt as quickly as he could so he could avoid the most noticeable part of his new body, though, the fact that there was a small mirror in the closet that he could clearly see his new body in didn't help. Next was the pencil skirt, he tried to put that on as fast as he could too. Now that he was wearing more than underwear he proceeded to put on the other articles of the outfit. The tailcoat was the easiest part of the outfit by far, since there wasn't much difference between it and a tailcoat a man would wear. Next up was a particularly difficult part. The carvat, Phoenix tried for what felt like an eternity to tie it right, the fact that it was dead center in front of his new, larger, chest didn't help much. how did Edgeworth wear a triple version of this thing every day? Next was what Phoenix had deemed as the vain of his existence, heeled shoes. \"Maybe I could go barefoot again?\" Phoenix thought aloud to himself. He decided to buck up and deal with it like a man, or woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had different clothes on he looked at Von Karma's body in the mirror once more. He looked different, but he was still clearly Von Karma. He went back to the closet and looked for something else to help make him look different. He soon found what he was looking for, a large, light blue sunhat that was the same color as Von Karma's hair. He put it on and it covered most of his new head \"Perfect.\" He said. Unintentionally sounding like Von Karma. He in the mirror once more before grabbing the car keys and heading out the door. Where does he go?</span></div></div>",

We've been going around town to her favorite places since then.\" Mia said with joy in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix couldn't help but smile hearing this. As hectic as this day had been, some good had come from it. His reminiscing on the past few hours was cut off by Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to meet up back at the office now? Or should we meet somewhere along the way?\" Mia asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix felt really bad about cutting Mia's time with Maya short. \"Actually, the case Von Karma was put on is going to take more time than expected.\" Phoenix bluffed. \"I won't be able to meet up with you till 10 o'clock or so.\" Phoenix said, before wanting to bite his tongue. It was only around 1 o'clock right now. What was he supposed to do for 9 hours?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Mia asked, a bit suspicious. Before she could suggest that Phoenix leave Von Karma's body Maya had yelled over to her \"Hurry up, Sis!\" She yelled. \"Gotta go Phoenix, We'll meet at the office at around 10\" Mia said before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix sat in the car seat for a while thinking about what to do. \"You couldn't have said a sooner, could you?\" Phoenix asked himself as he put his head on the wheel in disbelief.

He figured something innocuous would be best; maybe he'd just watch a movie or something? After the fiasco at the courtroom he was hesitant to do anything that would require any sort of interaction.When Franziska woke up, he didn't want her being anymore confused than she already would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*riiiiiiing riiiiiing* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Franziska's phone disagreed with Phoenix as he reached a red light. He reached into her skirt pocket and pulled it out. \"Hello, Franziska here,\" he said uncertainly into the phone. He really hoped that whoever called him had the wrong number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho spoke on the other end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What's happening?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's been a murder. I'm currently investigating but I need help,\" Edgeworth continued. \"Gumshoe is unavailable and there's no one else I can call.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix thought it over. 'Maybe I can fix my mistakes at the courthouse,' he thought. Sure, he embarrassed Franziska at that trial, but the defense attorney was probably going to win anyways. If he went and solved a murder in Franziska's body, she'd get the credit and maybe the botched prosecution would be overlooked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right there. Where are you at?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not far from the courthouse. After Wright found his client innocent, the police went to investigate a new potential witness - it seems someone else reached him first. You best hurry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was shocked to hear that it was related to Larry's trial. Mia must have given them a lead while he was still in Maya's body. If the killer knew that though, then they must have been there for the trial. He supposed it was his responsibility to see the case through, since Larry had been client. Putting Franziska's heels to the pedal, Phoenix sped off to the courthouse, where police cars were scattered all around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out of Franziska's car and approached a cop near the perimeter. Before the cop could stop him, he began to speak. \"I'm Prosecutor Von Karma, let me through,\" he ordered, pointing to Von Karma's badge. The cop merely nodded and stepped aside much to Phoenix's satisfaction. '<i>That was <i>much</i> easier than usual'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth gave Phoenix an odd look as he approached, most likely due to the change of clothes. Phoenix tipped the sunhat upwards a bit to show his face, and Edgeworth suddenly recognized him as Von Karma. \"Ah! Franziska, that was quick. I expected your normal attire.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes I wear different clothes,\" Phoenix suggested, sounding a bit too nonchalant for Von Karma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd dispute that, but I'm scarcely in the mood to argue,\" Edgeworth replied. He pointed to the scene of the crime - a body laid out in the parking lot, now surrounded by a white chalk outline. Various officers were surrounding the body, taking photos and looking for any evidence. There was no blood, but as Phoenix approached, he saw a series of bruises covering the victim's neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was strangled,\" Phoenix muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, but we don't have a weapon yet,\" Mile's replied. \"The killer might've done it bare handed, but that would be inefficient, and there aren't any signs of a prolonged struggle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I suppose we ought to investigate,\" Phoenix said, somewhat uncertain. He'd never really investigated alongside Edgeworth or the police before. Usually they were all obstacles. At best he had Maya, who was only an obstacle half of the time. He figured he would just try to investigate as usual. </span></div></div>",

He assumed she was there reporting on the trial, being a journalist of sorts. She looked quite excited with what she found, and as Phoenix looked over her shoulder, he was her camera displaying several photos of what appeared to be... Mia's body with his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh lord, she got photos,' he didn't need his publicity to get any weirder. If it got out that Phoenix Wright turned into a woman mid-trial, his reputation would... well, it'd certainly take a turn he didn't want to go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess I have no choice.' Silent and frustrated, Phoenix floated forward, and suddenly felt himself regain corporeal form as he took Lotta's body.Her body briefly shuddered, but soon he found himself in control as he was looking at the pictures through her eyes. \"Ugggggh,\" he grumbled in her voice, lacking her southern twang. He could feel the weight of her crazy hair-do on his head. \"Well, gotta atleast do SOMETHING to justify this,\" he said as he went about deleting Lotta's photos of the trial. \"Sorry Lotta, but you've caused me enough problems.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Lotta</i>, hurry up and get over here!\" Phoenix could hear Maya shout, giggling to herself. She was enjoying this too much. Phoenix shuffled over to Mia and Maya slowly, trying to ignore the discomfort of his new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya seemed to find his discomfort hilarious, and one he got close she immediately brushed a hand through his new hair. \"Ahahaha! Isn't this wild?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix grimaced at the predicament, \"please don't do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya just laughed even more. \"So THAT'S what she sounds like without the twang? Ahahahaha.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Maya, be nice to 'Lotta',\" Mia said, trying to hold back a chuckle of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit later, and Maya, 'Phoenix', and 'Lotta' found themselves back at the Wright an Co. law office. They drove there in Lotta's van... which Phoenix suspected she lived out of while on 'stakeouts' judging by the spare clothes and snacks scattered all throughout it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now what?\" Phoenix asked, unsure of why they weren't switching everyone back to normal yet. He supposed he could at least be grateful that Lotta wore unisex clothing, but it was a small consolation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya seemed to think about it for a moment. \"Hmm, oh! Mia, while you're with us, we should go do something fun! Maybe we can go back to Kurain village and you can spend an afternoon there, or we can go find something around town to do. I think Mr. Powers is getting back into shooting a new season of Steel Samurai, we could visit him! Or we could hit up another local tourist spot; I hear Nine Tails Vale is a neat town to visit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia thinks about it and decides she'd like to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think we'll take the train this time though, no offense Phoenix, but that van was way too cluttered.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I be offended? I'm not <i>actually</i> Lot- oh nevemind,\" Phoenix figured he wouldn't bother, Maya was a bit too giddy to pay attention anyways. He sorta felt like a third wheel to be honest, a feeling only exacerbated by being in Lotta's body instead of his own. He let Mia have his body for the day so that she could spend time with Maya, he kinda wondered if he should bow out of the trip and just let them have fun together for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let's head out!\" Maya shouted excitedly as she grabbed Mia by the arm, basically dragging her towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Phoenix go with them, or make an excuse to stay?  </span></div></div>",

They left Lotta's van behind at the office. Phoenix sorta wondered what would happen to Lotta when he left her; she'd have to be pretty confused after blacking out, not to mention angry at losing her photos. Phoenix didn't hate Lotta, but for whatever reason he felt like it wouldn't be that big of a deal. Lotta had caused him a lot of trouble in the past, so if he just took a day from her, it would be a bit of payback. The lady who camped out to take pictures of Gourdy the lake monster is probably capable of bouncing back anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the train settled, and the three of them exited at Kurain Shrine. Maya seemed ecstatic to show Mia all the things that had changed and also the things that stayed the same. \"And here's Ami's urn! Remember that? Still breaks after all these years,\" Maya went on, showing her sister in Phoenix's body everything and anything, no matter how trivial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix figured it'd be best to not interrupt them, so he decided to make himself scarce and went for a walk around the grounds. As much as her hair bugged him, he had to admit Lotta's body wasn't the worst. Being a woman was weird, but she was in okay shape, and her clothes were pretty normal as well. He got a few odd looks from some of the others living on the grounds, but they accepted his presence since he arrived with Mystic Maya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoenix strolled the grounds, he got rather caught up in how tranquil the whole place was. \"May as well give Lotta something to remember the event by,\" he chuckled, as he realized that her camera was still slung over his neck. He snapped a few photos of the grounds before deciding to sit down at a bench to look over them. As he did so however, he realized...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In just a moment, it became clear due to the wetness on his backside that he just sat on a freshly painted bench. Phoenix closed his eyes and a took a deep breath. \"UGGGGGGGGH,\" he exhaled, frustrated, in Lotta's voice as he got up from the bench. A quick check with his hand revealed his fear - white paint coated Lotta's pants and her jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Lotta,\" he muttered, \"I think I just ruined this outfit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStiffly, he reached into Lotta's pockets and pulled out her cell phone. It was a bit old looking - probably bought for cheap. He punched in his own number, and Mia answered in his voice on the other end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello, Mi- Phoenix Wright here,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia, its me, Phoenix,\" Phoenix-as-Lotta replied, \"I had a bit of an incident. Where did you guys go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! We're over at the meditation room right now. What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix paused for a moment, \"...I sat on paint.\" He scowled as he heard Mia chuckle on the other end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you probably should come on by then. I'm sure Maya can help you out. We'll stay put for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful,\" he replied dryly as they both hung up, cursing his luck as he walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahaha!\" Maya laughed, seeing the paint-covered Phoenix enter the chamber. \"Wow, honestly, that <i>sounds</i> a bit like something Lotta would do. She must be rubbing off on you,\" Maya said, a grin plastered over her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha,\" Phoenix replied sarcastically. \"Can you atleast give me a hand while you laugh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, don't worry,\" Maya said, \"I managed to get you a change of clothes, although I doubt you'll like it.\" Suddenly, a door off to the other side of the room opened, and Mia-as-Phoenix entered with what seemed to be a set of channeler robes - like Maya's but a size bigger. Phoenix frowned at this, but Maya clasped her hands and continued, \"we didn't really have any normal sets of clothes, but it'll be funny! Don't stress about it, we'll all have a good laugh later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoved the clothes into Phoenix's hands and ushered him into the channeling chamber, \"now hurry up and change! No one uses this room regularly so you should be fine.\" Before Phoenix could reply, the door slid shut, leaving him alone in the eerie, candle lit room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again uncomfortable with his new body, Phoenix looked down at himself. Undressing hadn't been part of the plan. He held back his disgust though and began to take off Lotta's jacket, revealing a sweater underneath. Unfortunately, the sweater was also a bit wet around the ends, so he took that off as well, now down to a t-shirt. The shirt was dry, but unfortunately, Lotta's pants weren't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Phoenix figured he may as well change the whole outfit. He threw off the t-shirt, trying his best to keep his eyes away from his chest as he then threw on the Kimono, tying the sash around the waist. With the top part of the kimono secure, he then kicked off Lotta's boots and removed her jeans. The kimono went down to his knees, but it still just felt very uncomfortable to not wear pants, especially in someone else's body. He tried to shove it out of his thoughts as he put on the sandals Maya had given him and folded Lotta's wet clothes. He supposed she <i>was</i> overdressed for the weather, but Phoenix sorta preferred to be overdressed while using her body. Thankfully, he didn't need to mess with hair braiding or beads or anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya just continued to snicker as Phoenix exited the chamber. \"Are you sure you don't want to stay this way? I'd love to see Von Karma in the maid outfit next.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix merely shot her a glare, \"I think I'm more than sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a real buzzkill sometimes, Nick. Anyways, just drop your clothes in the basket over there for now. We have things to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix raised an eyebrow. \"Like what?\" </span></div></div>",

Between being involved in several murder cases, and even temporarily losing his prosecutor's badge, the events he had gone through made him all the more grateful for the peace and quiet he had now been granted. He still had work to do, mainly paperwork for other cases he had dealt with, but for now, he was intent on enjoying the moment of calmness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment that was abruptly brought to an end as he heard a knock on the door to his office. Edgeworth stared at the door for a moment, his cold, icy glare having no effect on the wooden object, before letting out a sigh. He set his teacup down on his desk, before getting up and opening the door. To his surprise, there was no one there. If not for the fact that this was the prosecutor's office, he might have suspected someone was playing a trick on him; a sort of \"ding-dong-ditch\", as it were. However, considering the level of maturity that most prosecutors possessed, that seemed unlikely, and Edgeworth instead opted to have a better look around to see where the knock on his door had come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take him long to find his first clue; a small parcel left on the ground on front of his office. Considering where it was, and the knock that had preceded its arrival, it hardly seemed like a coincidence. Despite the parcel being unlabelled, the evidence pointed to the fact that someone had left this parcel here for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I wonder why they left it here instead of handing it to me in person,\" Edgeworth pondered aloud, closing the door to his office once more and taking the parcel back to his desk with him. Carefully opening it up, he found a small device inside, somewhat like a TV remote, accompanied by an instruction manual. After quickly reading through the manual, Edgeworth began to reevaluate his earlier assumption that this wasn't just a prank. A device that allowed people to swap bodies? Preposterous. Who would even think of something like this, and why choose him of all people to pull this trick on? The more he thought about it, though, the less this seemed like the sort of thing anyone at the office would do as a prank, and the more curious he grew about whether it would actually work or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could decide what to actually do with the remote, he heard another knock on his door. Hoping it wasn't another strange parcel, Edgeworth pocketed the remote and opened the door. Waiting patiently for him to open it, was non other than...</span></div></div>",

The vibrations from the door slamming had caused the pieces on his nearby chessboard to fall over and nearly knocked over the cup of tea he had placed on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving her around during investigations was a delight, during days off was less so. \"Kay. I believe I have already explained to you that barging into the prosecutor's office and causing a ruckus could get both you and myself charged for disturbing the peace.\" He lectured her as he went over to his chessboard to pick up the fallen pieces and put them back in their rightful place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He he, Sorry Mr. Edgeworth. It won't happen again.\" Kay apologized, although this was a stock apology she would give to Edgeworth anytime she would do something that he either disagreed with or lectured her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he picked them up he remembered the device that had been delivered to him. While testing it on Kay would be a breach of her personal space, she had done plenty of breaching of his personal space. Additionally, it wasn't as if they were going to be swapped very long. This was just and experiment of the remote's capabilities. If it worked, he would swap them back immediately. If it didn't, then he would throw out the remote like the piece of prank garbage that it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kay sat down on Edgeworth's couch, he pointed the remote toward her and pressed the button.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Edgeworth pressed the Aware Swap button, and almost instantly he found himself across the room, sitting down on the couch. That wasn't the only change, though. He was shorter and slimmer, and he certainly wasn't male anymore. Looking down at himself, his body was now definitely female, several years younger too, and he was dressed in Kay's usual outfit. A bit of black hair fell down in front of his eyes. Without a doubt, the remote had worked, and he was now in Kay's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, if he was in her body, she was in his, as was evidenced by the loud scream coming from his body, which he wouldn't be surprised if it could have been heard from inside the adjacent offices. She patted down her body, or more accurately Edgeworth's body, frantically, knocking the chess table over in her panic. She looked up at Edgeworth, in her body, and practically yelled, \"Mr. Edgeworth, what's going on!? What did you do!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange, to say the least, for Edgeworth to see his own body moving of its own accord from an outside perspective, but stranger still to see it acting in such a manner. He stood up slowly, and said, \"Kay, calm down. I can ex-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down!?\" Kay interrupted. \"I'm supposed to be the thief around her, but now you're stealing bodies!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay, I didn't steal you body,\" Edgeworth replied, taking a much harsher tone, although it didn't seem to have as much weight to it with Kay's voice. \"Now calm down and stop shouting before you get us both removed from the building.\" Kay went silent, not entirely sure how to react to seeing her body act that way. Once he was sure she had quietened down, Edgeworth resumed talking, \"Good, now allow me to explain. A few minutes before you arrived, I found a package outside my door, that contained a remote.\"  He went to show her the remote, but realised it was was no longer in his hand. He looked around at the floor around him, and over at the couch where he had been sitting, but it didn't seem to be anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could check anywhere else, Kay held up her and, revealing that she was holding the remote. \"You mean this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth frowned. The remote must have stayed with his own body after the switch. That seemed like a major design flaw for the remote, allowing the person you'd swapped with to swap right back, or preventing you from making further swaps. \"Yes, that's the one. It came with an instruction manual claiming it could swap people's bodies. I thought it was just some practical joke, but I decided to see whether it would work or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it works,\" Kay said stating the obvious, looking at the remote curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it does. Now, could you people give it back to me so that I can swap us back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth wasn't sure if Kay didn't understand, or if she had just been distracted by the remote and wasn't listening. He was pretty sure it was the latter, but elected to explain regardless. \"I only swapped with you to test the device's capabilities, I have no intention of keeping your body. So, if you could please hand me the remote, I will swap us back into our correct bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay couldn't help but find it weird to see her body acting so formal like that. The remote had piqued her interest, though. She could only imagine how much easier her life as the Great Thief Yatagarasu would be with a little gadget like this. It could be like hiding in plain sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay!\" Kay was snapped out of her daydream by an increasingly-impatient Edgeworth, who was standing with his hand outstretched, waiting for Kay to give the remote back to him. He was growing rather uncomfortable in Kay's body as he noticed more and more differences, and he wanted to swap back into his own body, and then figure out what to do with the remote from there.</span></div></div>",

This was merely an experiment of the device's capabilities, we do not yet know it's full potential. So, if you would kindly just swap us now.\" Edgeworth demanded while tapping Kay's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay barley listened to what Edgeworth had said, but she could tell that he probably didn't want to stay swapped. She was looking at the remote with amazement in her eyes. \"Think of all the things we can do with this! Being the greatest thief ever will be a breeze with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth wasn't pleased with Kay talking about using the remote for thievery, he even less pleased that she was talking about it while in his body. Before he could say anything Kay had began to walk toward the door as she opened the door Edgeworth spoke up. \"And just what are you doing?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going out to see how much fun I can have with this remote!\" Kay said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth stomped toward her \"Absolutely not, you cannot go out in my body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... catch me if you can!\" Kay said and ran out the door, slamming it behind her, the vibrations of the door knocked down the cup of tea Edgeworth had placed down earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth tried to catch up with Kay, but circumstances such as Kay slamming the door, her getting to the elevator first, which made him need to take the stairs, and the distractions of Kay's body and clothes made his efforts futile. By the time he made it downstairs Kay was already driving away in his car. Did she even know how to drive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe considered going after her at this point, but he had no idea where she was even going. She would probably come back when she wanted her body back, he presumed. He decided to go to his office and clean up the mess that Kay had left behind.</span></div></div>",

The more time he spent in Kay's body, the more uncomfortable he felt. He tugged at the hem of Kay's skirt in an attempt to cover up his legs a bit more. He didn't want to stay in her body any longer than necessary, but without any idea of where she might be going, he couldn't really go get the remote from her. In hindsight, he realised he probably should have tested the remote on someone less likely to run off with his body, or at least someone more like himself in terms of age and gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe luckily managed to make it back to his office without encountering anyone along the way. Having to be in Kay's body was bad enough, Edgeworth didn't want to have to try acting like her as well. He shut the door behind him, hoping nobody else would disturb him, and frowned at the state of his office. Kay hadn't been too destructive, but his chess table had been knocked over, the pieces scattered across the floor, and his teacup had been knocked over, spilling tea all over his desk. Luckily he hadn't had any important files still sitting on the desk, or they would have been ruined. The remote's manual was now soaked with tea though, and practically unusable. It occurred to him that Kay didn't actually know about the other button on the remote, the unaware swap. He really hoped she wouldn't try it out while the two of them were swapped. Of course, he'd have no way of telling if she'd used it or not, he'd just see whichever body Kay swapped into as being his real body. He shuddered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth set about cleaning up his office, starting with standing the chess table back up. He couldn't help but notice it seemed a bit heavier than normal. Kay wasn't weak by any stretch of the imagination, in fact he had felt faster and more agile while trying to run down the stairs to catch up with Kay, but considering he was now several years younger, a bit of a loss of strength was understandable. He gathered up the chess pieces off the floor and set they back up where they were meant to be positioned. Now it was on to his desk. He tossed the manual and the box that had come with the remote into the trash, and placed the teacup back with the rest of his tea set, but found himself lacking any sort of cloth to clean his desk with. If he'd been able to dry it off, he could continue with his work until Kay eventually came back, assuming she would, but he couldn't very well do that while his desk was still wet. It should be too difficult to find some paper towels or something somewhere around the building, but that would unfortunately mean leaving his office again, something he didn't want to do while still in Kay's body. However, it was either that, or sit around doing nothing, so Edgeworth slowly opened the door to his office once more, looking around to make sure the hallway was empty.</span></div></div>",

He made a mental note to stock up on some later, just in case a situation like this happens again. As he made his way to the elevator, his heart stopped. The Elevator opened before he got to it and out came detective Gumeshoe, his subordinate. Although, he supposed Gumshoe wasn't his subordinate now that he was in Kay's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay, what're you doing here pal?\" Gumshoe asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth dreaded that this would happen. Although he could tell Gumshoe about the remote and the swap with Kay, he doubted Gumshoe would believe him. Who would believe someone claiming to be in someone else's body? Unfortunately, that meant Edgeworth would have to do his best Kay impression. \"I need to go and get some napkins so I can clean up...Mr. Edgeworth's desk.\" Edgeworth said, he imitated words that Kay would use, but he still spoke in his own usual tone of voice. Thankfully Gumshoe didn't seem to notice. Referring to himself as 'Mr. Edgeworth' was surreal to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I just saw Mr. Edgeworth drive off in his car. Why were you in his office after he left?\" Gumshoe asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He, uh, he told me to clean up his office while he was gone.\" Edgeworth came up with an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He left you to clean up?\" Gumshoe asked, but then smiled \"Don't worry about that, I'll clean it for you pal! I've made plenty of messes in Edgeworth's office over the past few years. You go out and enjoy yourself, I can handle this!\" Gumshoe exclaimed, excited at the opportunity to do something to help others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Edgeworth said bluntly. He didn't want to go anywhere in Kay's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, pal. A young person like you should be out enjoying themselves, not stuck in a stuffy office like this.\" Gumshoe insisted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth couldn't believe it, Gumshoe had never disobeyed him before. While he was in Kay's body he had no authority whatsoever. Edgeworth was going to say something else, but he heard the elevator open again. He looked behind Gumshoe and saw a security guard approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard walked around Gumshoe and stood in front of Edgeworth \"You. Many of the personnel in the building complained about a teenage girl running around and causing a disturbance. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.\"  The guard explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth was worried something like this would happen. With how he and Kay were running down the building it be ludicrous if none of the people in the building called security. Although this wasn't good for him. He couldn't just disobey the guard, that would get Kay in trouble with the law and he would like to avoid her having a criminal record. He decided to just obey and leave the building. As he headed to the elevator he heard Gumshoe yell behind him \"Don't worry, Pal! I'll clean up Mr. Edgeworth's office for you!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Edgeworth exited the building the fact that he was now wearing a skirt became more apparent as he felt a breeze blow between his legs. What was he going to do now. He supposed the only logical thing to do was go after Kay, but where could she have possibly gone? Not knowing where to go, he decided to head for one of the more widely visited areas in the city. Where did he go?</span></div></div>",

Apollo knew it wouldn't do any good for her to be cooped up in that house after all that had happened though, especially since she no longer had her father with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the afternoon and things were going slow at the office. Trucy and Mr. Wright were out, and it seemed Apollo had no cases to work on, as he lounged about at the work desk Mr. Wright had finally allotted him. \"Guess since nothing's going on, I'll check on Vera,\" he decided as he got up from his chair and exited into the lobby. Once there, he came across a strange package on the table. \"Hmm? Who ordered this?\" Figuring he only stood to anger Mr. Wright or Trucy, Apollo took the liberty of opening the box on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn it, he found the remote and its instructions. It all sounded like something out of a science fiction movie to him, and not a particularly good one. \"Maybe Trucy just bought it as a prop,\" he mused. As he thought more about it though, he realized it <i>would</i> be very convenient if the device did what it said. <i>'If Vera could just, like, spend a day as someone else, maybe it'd give her a chance to broaden her perspective.'</i> There wasn't much harm in trying, its not as though Vera would judge him when it failed. The device SOUNDED crazy, but then, Mr. Wright once got a testimony from a ghost! Weirder things had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later, Apollo reached the Misham house, which he had visited several times before during his investigation of Drew's murder. \"It can't be good for her to still be here...\" he muttered as he parked his bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the door, it occurred to him that he never put much thought into <i>who</i> he would try to switch her with. All things considered, he was the only candidate right now. However, the instructions didn't say the remote had a timer at all; he could use it on her here and then find someone like Trucy to switch her with later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Apollo just switch her with himself, or does he try to switch Vera with another person? </span></div></div>",

She seemed rather uncomfortable. \"Are you me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It's me Vera, Apollo,\" he replied, shocked to hear Vera's voice sound anything but monotonous or nervous. Vera just seemed confused. \"Er, this will take a while to explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's how it happened,\" Apollo finished, as Vera looked at the remote, still in his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you use it on me then?\" She asked, having calmed down but still seeming confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to help you,\" Apollo explained. This was all really weird now that he vocalized it. Part of him wondered if he should like, hand this device over to scientists now that he knew it worked, but he decided to just keep on going. \"You still seem so anxious after the trial, so I thought it might help you to get a new perspective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, what about the auction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll handle it for you,\" Apollo promised. \"But I do want you to show up for it.

He lifted the remote again, \"so, do you want to keep the remote, or should I hold onto it? I think it might be safer here, since your home is more quiet.

Not missing a beat, he could see Vera fall in the distance, and he winced. She seemed fine though, and got up, deciding to just walk the bike away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning from the window, Apollo realized what he had just promised. '<i>A week?!</i>' He let Vera have the remote too, so he couldn't just take another body in the meantime. \"Probably should've waited... well, too late now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo had been too busy explaining everything to Vera that he forgot to really notice his body, but now that he was alone the differences began to dawn on him. It was a bit embarrassing to admit, but he realized that he was actually a bit taller now that he was Vera. The fact that he had Vera's tight clothes were making him a bit uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around the house for a bit, realizing he'd never seen anything but the kitchen and Vera's studio. Eventually he found what he believed to be Vera's bedroom, which was... rather empty. There was a bed, a stand with a clock, a mirror, and drawers of clothes. It was a very bland room for an artist. \"Guess she and her dad saved decor for the rest of the house.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, he was surprised as to how different Vera's face looked with himself in control. Her eyes were widened, her eyebrows raised, and she just overall seemed more expressive. Her clothes were still bothering him, however. Feeling a bit restricted, Apollo untied Vera's hair, letting it fall loose over the back of his head. He also removed the smock, now just wearing her sweater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" he said, \"now she looks a bit more relaxed.\" He idly wondered if dressing more informally would help Vera calm down a bit. Her clothes were right there in the room, but he wasn't sure if he wanted to go as far as dressing her yet. <i>'She's okay with the swap, but I feel it'd be in bad taste to immediately undress...'</i> He had a week to kill; thinking about it, this was almost a break for himself as much as Vera. He continued to stare in the mirror, starting to fiddle a bit with his new, longer hair. Did he opt to look over Vera's wardrobe, or did he look for something else to do? </span></div></div>",

After staring for a while he decided to change Vera's clothes, the tightness of his current clothes made the changes of is new body all to apparent. He opened the drawer and began to look through the clothes Vera had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching through it he found an outfit that he felt would be easy to change into. It was a simple outfit. A red and white striped tank top, the colors reminded him the clothes he usually wore during trials and such. He had debated to himself whether or not he would wear a skirt or pants. He had decided to wear a skirt because he wanted Vera to see her body relaxing like other people and every other girl he knew wore skirts, with Ema being the exception. He also wanted to try and get a feel for being a girl since he would be one for the next week, and what better way to feel like one then wear a skirt. He got a red circle skirt, the same color as the red parts of the tank top he grabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking out the outfit was pretty easy, the next part not so much. He placed the clothes he grabbed on Vera's bed and began to change. He began by taking off Vera's sweater, closing his eyes as he did so. Once it was off he wrapped it around his head as a blindfold. Once that was done he attempted to put on the tank top, it took him a few attempt, but he soon managed to do it. Next up was the skirt, he slipped off the pants that Vera was wearing before, his new legs felt very cold as he did so.  He picked up the skirt and began to put it on. Why did women's clothing have to be so complicated! Once he was done he looked in the mirror. He couldn't help but smile, the reflection in the mirror seemed a lot happier then Vera usually was. The clothes also made her look like a female version of himself with long dark blue hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had changed clothes, what should he do? Should he just hang around Vera's house like she usually did, or should he go around town as Vera?</span></div></div>",

With his new outfit prepared, Apollo put on some shoes and ventured outside of Vera's home. Thankfully it was warm out, so he didn't have to worry about being under-dressed as he moved down the sidewalk in only a tank-top and skirt. He noticed a few of Vera's neighbors looking surprised as he left; he bet they hadn't seen her leave the home alone in a long time. Some of them might not have known she existed to be honest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo decided to ignore them and kept walking, being sure to keep his posture straight. <i>'Look confident, feel confident.'</i> He figure that if he was going to attend that auction in Vera's place then he ought to get used to social interactions in her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured it would be too easy to just visit Trucy or Mr. Wright; he spoke to them every day and they both knew Vera too. It'd be best to be around people who didn't know Vera at all. \"Always people over at the park... I guess that's why they call it People Park,\" Apollo spoke to no one in particular. it was a nice day, so even if he didn't meet anyone, he could go for a walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Otherwise, if I wanted to be a bit more risky, I could go to see Clay,\" he muttered, a smirk on his face. It HAD been a while since he last visited the Cosmos Space Center. It had been open to tourists since the famous trip that Solomon Starbuck took years ago, and Apollo had plenty of friends and acquaintances at the center. Most notably, Starbuck himself and Clay Terran, a friend of his who was training to be an astronaut. Apollo snickered a bit at the thought of meeting them like this. It could make for nice practice, seeing how they might treat him in a new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Apollo decide to head over to? </span></div></div>",

Apollo thought hard about what he should say to Clay. <i>'What would make him want to talk to me?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it came to him, and right on time, as Clay seemed ready to leave. \"Anymore questions before I get back to work?\" he asked with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling fine?\" Apollo asked from the back of the group in Vera's voice, a smirk forming on his face. A few other tourists gave him funny looks and he saw Clay lift an eyebrow as he processed the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah!

Apollo remained quiet, as he was quite familiar with the ins-and-outs of the place. Eventually, it came to an end, but Apollo decided to hover around the station for just a few more minutes, feigning interest in a photograph of the staff that was posted up in one of the exhibits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there,\" he heard a voice from behind him, and he turned around, accidentally twirling his skirt, to see Clay standing in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Terran, right?\" Apollo asked, trying to hold back a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me Clay,\" he said. \"I just wanted to know, what made you ask that question back there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to know how you were doing,\" Apollo replied with a shrug. He realized he wasn't acting much like Vera, but he was having fun at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm,\" Clay responded, sounding a bit skeptical. \"Well, I appreciate the concern. What's your name?\" He extended a hand as he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo took his hand, realizing that Clay didn't seem quite as tall from Vera's body. \"I'm...

Apollo sat down at the stand, smoothing out his skirt as he did, and both ordered a bowl. He was glad that Clay chose somewhere simple like this; it made the whole thing feel a lot more relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I've seen your face somewhere,\" Clay said. \"Are you an actress, maybe?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo realized that Clay must've heard about the trial a while back; it'd be ridiculous if he hadn't. After all, it was the debut of the jury system and Apollo himself had taken part in the proceedings. Technically, Apollo was now the defendant from that case. If he claimed to be the defendant from that proceeding, it would ruin a lot of the anonymity he had, as Clay would immediately connect Vera to Apollo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an artist, actually!\" Apollo replied, deciding to just omit the truth rather than tell a lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

Clay seemed to ponder this as he ate his food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" he quickly slurped down what he was eating, \"that's probably it then.\" Apollo sighed some relief. He continued to eat his noodles when Clay asked another question, \"could I see some of your paintings then, Vera?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught Apollo off-guard a bit. <i>'Geeze Clay, awful friendly with the ladies aren't you?'</i> \"Oh? Are you interested in art?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I love artwork,\" he gave a thumbs up and a smile. Apollo raised a skeptical eyebrow. <i>'First I've heard of it.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo could see through Clay pretty clearly. He was sort of having fun though; not to mention that Clay paid for the meal. He supposed it wouldn't hurt to invite him back to Vera's house. However, Clay DID seem somewhat aware of who Vera was. Apollo imagined that his change of appearance had thrown Clay off, but if he spends to much time with him, Clay might recognize him as Vera Misham, which would complicate things a bit. What did he settle on? </span></div></div>",

He had only ever seen the studio room until today, but a quick search revealed a small kitchen area, a bathroom, and a small living room with a TV. \"Didn't think they'd be the kind to watch TV, but I guess it'd get boring otherwise,\" Apollo figured. There was one other door, and Apollo figured, by process of elimination, that it was her father's room. It must have really stung for Vera to suddenly be in this house all alone; as far as he knew, Vera hadn't removed any of her father's belongings. Apollo decided to not mess with Drew's room for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing that sad thought out of his mind, he decided he'd try to do what Vera would. \"Vera likes... to paint I suppose.\" Apollo wasn't much of an artist, but it couldn't hurt to get into character. It seemed that some of the paintings in the studio were unfinished, or left to dry, so Apollo was careful to not mess with them as he searched for a blank canvas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he was set up with a painting easel and a canvas picking a stool to sit down on, Apollo set to work. He tried to think of a subject and eventually decided he'd paint something from a case, as Drew Misham did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA messy hour or so later, Apollo decided he was as done as he ever would be. The canvase was messy and splotched, as were his arms, but Vera's clothes were thankfully unharmed. <i>'Probably should've worn a smock,'</i> he realized as he put the brushes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe painting was messy and the colors were all a bit off, but Apollo figured it was as good as he would ever get. It was a painting of the 'Devil' face that he saw on Kristoph's hand at the end of the case. It was a surprising moment; he had never seen that 'tell' when he had worked for Gavin, and it was hard to get the image out of his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll let that dry,\" Apollo decided. He honestly wasn't sure what he'd <i>do</i> with that painting, but it was a fun diversion. He went over to the bathroom and began washing the paint off Vera's arms when there was a noise; the doorbell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...who would come visit Vera?\" Apollo muttered as he walked over to the door.

Just a week ago, he had scraped through what had been the most stressful case of his life. Not only did his defendant almost <i>die</i>, but he only managed to scrape through due to the newly introduced Jury system. Apollo had the feeling that it'd be a while before Juries were truly implemented in the courts, so he doubted that he'd get off so lucky again. He appreciated the break while he had it. He realized he would likely need a new edge soon if he wanted to keep up in future cases. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was stirred by a buzz at the door. He got up from his cramped office and stumbled his way to the front door, maneuvering around Trucy's scattered things. \"She's going to need to learn how to share office space,\" Apollo said a bit bitterly as he reached the door. Upon opening it, he found no one was there, but instead a small package, addressed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't recall ordering anything,\" he muttered as he took it to the coffee table and opened it up. Inside he found a curious remote with only two buttons, and an instruction manual. \"Switching bodies? That's just ridiculous.\" It was something out of a bad movie, but it'd be awfully convenient if he could switch bodies. A lot of problems would be solved if he could investigate a crime scene under the guise of a new identity, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*knock knock* Apollo suddenly found his thoughts interrupted by a knock at the door. Grumbling, he got back up and kicked his way through Trucy's things again, opening it up to find the large frame of Plum Kitaki, the mother of a past client. She seemed rather upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Kitaki? What's wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Justice, I'm very glad you're here! Its my son, you see.\" Apollo had feared this, and let out an exhausted sigh. \"Please, just hear me out. They arrested him for a robbery, but I know he didn't do it. He's a good boy; the family is getting out of such business.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you Mrs. Kitaki,\" Apollo said a bit nervously, \"but your son is just... a hard client to work with. He's not very keen on talking to attorneys.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There must be something you can do, you helped him once. Please, just talk to him; neither me nor my husband have any legal experience. We can't investigate on our own.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo took a deep breath and thought about it. His eyes flickered over the remote.<i> 'Wocky would probably be more forthcoming with his mother than me.'</i> Being Plum would be rather... unpleasant, but Apollo doubted it would work anyways. If it did... well it wouldn't be for long, right? \"I might have <i>something</i> that would make investigating easier,\" Apollo admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlum brightened up, \"I knew you'd have something! What is it then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo went over and picked up the remote. \"We'll find out in a second,\" he said as he closed his eyes and pressed one of the buttons. Did he click aware swap as meant too, or unaware? </span></div></div>",

The swap definitely worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to his body, which was in the middle of touching itself in shock, it was clear that Plum was in his body as well.

Go talk to my son. Then come right back. Immediately\" Plum said as she picked up her broom off the floor. \"If you don't...\" She said as she unsheathed the sword from the broom. That looked terrifying even in Apollo's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes ma'am\" Apollo said, which sounded odd coming from Plum's body.

He was heavy, and clumsy walking on her ridiculously raised sandals. Plum's kimono only made the feeling exacerbated; everything felt so... loose. Not to mention that Plum was about twice Apollo's age; he never realized how much energy his body had until now. All his chords of steel rehearsals and bike riding sessions really paid off; Plum's body felt a bit winded just getting into the cab! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd it go, Mrs. Kitaki?\" the driver asked him. Being called \"Mrs.\" jut drove it all home how bizarre his situation was. As he sat down, the sensations of his new body became even more obtrusive. <i>'She's so... ugh, blubbery.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It, uh, went fine. I'm fine,\" he replied. Mrs. Kitaki's voice still felt alien to him. \"I need you to drive me to the detention center right away though. It's important.\" He tried to sound commanding but flubbed a bit. Mrs. Kitaki always seemed self-assured, but Apollo just appeared uncomfortable as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it ma'am,\" the cabby replied, thankfully ambivalent to Apollo's behavior. Soon he was off to the detention center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep the meter running,\" Apollo told the driver as they reached the station. He supposed that was one benefit of using Kitaki's body to investigate - cab fare went on her tab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waddled into the station with his arms crossed, one hand keeping the device secure in his sleeve. He didn't dare risk losing that thing. The officer working at the desk looked at him strangely as he approached, \"can I help you ma'am?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm here to talk to... my son,\" Apollo explained. He hadn't envisioned himself saying anything like that for a long time, but here he was. \"Wokky Kitaki. He's currently being held on suspicion of a burglary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer looked through the some files. \"He should be done with questioning now; I'll show you to him.\" With that, they walked to the room Apollo had visited many times before. Only now, he had to be a concerned mother rather than an attorney. He doubted his presentation won a lot of points; it was a bit hard to be concerned about Wocky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" Wocky shouted, a bit surprised as Apollo sat down across from the window to meet him. \"You came already?  I told you I'd be fine - I ain't afraid of jail.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo looked Wocky over a bit. He seemed.... skinnier. A bit pallid. If Apollo had to guess, Wocky was recovering from surgery. <i>'Glad to know they got the bullet out of him atleast.'</i> Wocky just looked at him in confusion at his silence. <i>'Oh yeah! Concerned mom.'</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wocky, just look at you! You're as skinny as a twig. You wouldn't last a minute in jail,\" Apollo said, affecting his voice as much as possible. Wocky seemed to cringe a bit at this, and Apollo admitted that seeing Wocky actually listen to his words gave a bit of satisfaction. \"I want you to tell me everything you did... son. Mr. Justice is going to need it all if he wants to help you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a half hour later, Apollo had the full story. Wocky claimed that when the convenience store was robbed, he was walking back home and was merely caught up in the action as the robbers left the premise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where were you at before? If anyone saw you, they can give an alibi.\" Wocky's face went a bit red. \"Wocky, tell me where you were or else! You weren't committing a DIFFERENT crime, were you?\" Now that he'd been conversing, he realized Plum had some mean vocal chords. Not too mention a wide mouth; it was no wonder even Wocky would listen to her. Apollo was almost having fun now that a usually troublesome client was so easily spilling forth. The remote was definitely giving him an advantage, he knew that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please mom? Do I have to?\" He seemed embarassed by whatever the truth was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now come clean!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... I was at a book club...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo stared at Wocky with a blank expression on Plum's face. \"That's it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand! Even if I'm out of the thug-life, I gotta keep up appearances! Tough guys don't go to book clubs, but, well, I'm still recovering and all so I was bored...\" he shamefully looked away from Apollo, who couldn't believe what he was hearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I needed to literally become the guy's MOM to get him to confide that?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well give me a name! Who's in this book club? We can go find them and with their testimony you'll be cleared!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky grunted before finally giving Apollo a name from the club. Who was it? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was worried that either Mr. Wright or Trucy would come by the office while he was gone. He shuddered at the thought of Plum in his body acting like herself in front of them, he doubted Plum would bother keeping the swap a secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlum in his body was sweeping the floor, which looked rather odd from Apollo's body. She looked up when he arrived \"Mr. Justice! You're back! How is Wocky doing? Can you prove him innocent yet? \" She said, it was clear she was worried about Wocky. Any mother in her situation would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo explained to her about what happened at the detention center and how Wocky was allegedly at a book club on the night of the robbery. He kept quiet about who he was with, he didn't want Plum to find out her son was hanging out with the man who stole her panties during that case a while back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, Mr. Justice.\" Plum said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now that that's done, I'm going to switch us back now. Okay?\" Apollo said as he got the remote from his sleeve. The sooner he could get out of Plum's large body and back into his own younger body, the better<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha Ha! Yes, I don't know how long I could stand being in your scrawny body! It will be so great to be at home in my beautiful body!\" Plum said, clearly not enjoying the swap as much as Apollo was. Apollo rolled his eyes as Plum went on to talk about how much better her body was then his. Then again, he was thinking the same thing about his body the whole time he was in hers. \"Well, hurry up already.\" She said as she once again pulled the sword out of her broom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo pointed the remote at Plum in his body and got ready to swap them back...</span></div></div>",

He slowly put the broom sword down on the coffee table, a bit nervous at the weapon. He looked to Plum, who seemed similarly happy switching back, patting down her body to make sure everything was in tact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized he was staring at her and laughed, \"Ahaha! What, miss it already? I don't blame you. Next time though, be sure to ask permission first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Apollo replied sarcastically. \"I think this is yours,\" he said, pointing to the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Right, and this is yours,\" she said as she handed him the remote , taking the broomsword from off the table. \"Now, I'll keep that little device of yours a secret so long as you get my son declared innocent, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo nodded, \"You got it Mrs. Kitaki. I doubt it'll be a hard trial to win; his alibi should be solid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! I'll see you tomorrow then,\" she said as she walked out of the office and back to her cab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo sat down again and began to reread the manual, still shocked about everything that just happened. He could scarcely believe that worked! Usually he'd have to pester a client with evidence or something to get them to cooperate, but with Plum's body he just had to nag. This would prove an amazing investigation tool if he used it carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the clock and decided he was best served going to interview Stickler. Stickler was a troublesome person; rather full of himself and emotional. It SHOULD be a simple interview, but then, Wocky should've been a simple interview as well. \"I did sort of humiliate him at that trial,\" Apollo mumbled, recalling how he outed Stickler as a panty thief. \"It might help to approach him as a different person.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to test the remote a bit more, Apollo figured he would find a person to switch with. He knew Stickler was a big fan of Trucy's stage performance - so he might listen to her. Otherwise, a figure of authority would be his best bet; someone like prosecutor Gavin or the Detective Skye. He was hesitant to use it on one of them though; revealing the remote to the 'enemy' so to speak seemed a bit unwise.  </span></div></div>",

Wesley was a huge fan of her magic show, especially here magic panties act. He even committed panty thievery to find the secrets of her magic act. If he became Trucy he could probably get Wesley to talk about what happened that night in exchange for the \"secret of the magic panties\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo looked at the clock, it was around three. \"Trucy should be home from school soon.\" He thought aloud. As soon as Apollo thought that, Trucy came in the door. She had a habit of doing things like that. Apollo jumped from surprise as she suddenly came in, getting a laugh from Trucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Polly. You won't believe who I saw on my way in!\" She said in her usual happy mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, was it Ms. Kitaki?\" Apollo said with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! how did you know?\" Trucy said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was just here. Wocky was arrested for robbery, we're going to be defending him in court tomorrow.\" He explained. \"I already talked to him. He should have a solid alibi, but we have a bit of a problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Trucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The person he was with last night was Wesley Stickler.\" Apollo began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The panty thief?!\" Trucy interrupted him. She was completely devastated when her magic panties were stolen and she hadn't forgiven Wesley for what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm going to go talk to him, but, I don't think he'll want to talk to me after what happened.\" He explained. \"So, I'm gonna need a little bit of help from you.\" Apollo said and pointed the remote toward Trucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need me to-\" She began, but she was interrupted by Apollo pressing the button on the remote \"-Do\" She finished, but was shocked by the voice that came out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo had successfully done an aware swap with Trucy. He hadn't been in her body for more than a minute, but it already felt a lot more comfortable than Ms. Kitaki's body. Trucy's body a slimmer than his own, and the fact he was now seven years younger made him felt a lot more energetic. Although, Trucy's magician outfit covered a lot less of the body than Ms. Kitaki's kimono, making him notice the changes to his body a lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy in his body was having a reaction similar to Ms. Kitaki when she was put into his body. She was feeling around, not believing what happened. \"Polly! What did you do?!\" She shouted shocked. Apollo's cords of steel made her much louder. Unlike Ms. Kitaki, she didn't drop the remote on the ground when she was swapped, probably because she was used to holding things, such as her panties and her hat, in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo calmed her down and explained everything to Trucy, he explained how he had swapped with Ms. Kitaki to get Wocky's alibi. Once she knew what was going on, Trucy seemed a lot more excited about the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That's amazing Polly! Think of all the cool things we can do with this remote! It could be the greatest magic act ever!\" She shouted excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried about what she would do, Apollo took the remote from his old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Give it back!\" Trucy said and tried to take the remote back. Apollo held it out of reach from her, which was hard to do with her now being taller than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trucy, this remote is a very special thing. If you use it in one of your shows someone might steal it from you!.\" He tried to reason with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I won't use it in one of my shows, but can I at least play with it a little?\" She said and tried to put on a cute face to get her way, but it didn't exactly look cute from Apollo's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo sighed, it was clear she wasn't going to give up. \"Fine, I'll let you play with it.\" He said. Trucy reached for the remote again after he said that, but he pulled it a little further away. \"AFTER I talk to Wesley.\" He finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Hurry up and go! I wanna play with it as soon as I can!\" Trucy said and practically pushed Apollo out the door.</span></div></div>",

Plum turned her head to Apollo, and mouthed something at him. Apollo could only assume she was asking him to use the remote, but he hesitated. If he did use it, Trucy would still drag him off, leaving the remote with Plum, and he probably wouldn't be able to continue the investigation right away. Furthermore, as they got more distant, precision became harder to maintain; it was possible he'd switch with Trucy by mistake, or even someone on the bus!

If he had done it right, he should have ended up being dragged around by Trucy as she tried to get him to relax a bit. Apollo realised that in his rush to try and swap back with Plum, he must have accidentally pressed the Unaware Swap button, rather than the Aware Swap one. Unfortunately, this meant that while he did have his own body back, everyone still thought he was Plum Kitaki. This would also make things a little awkward once Plum and Trucy returned in two hours, since Plum would now believe that Apollo's body was her real body. He'd have to do both an aware swap and an unaware swap on her in order to set things straight. Apollo just hoped Plum wouldn't be in too much of a rush to get \"her body\" back. If he did the aware swap first, there was a chance Plum might run off before he could do the unaware swap, but if he did the unaware swap first, Plum might get suspicious about what he was doing or something. Either way, this wasn't exactly a good situation to be in. It would probably be easier to explain what had happened, but Apollo had a feeling that might complicate things, and if Trucy stuck around, it would mean exposing his little secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo let out a sigh. As much as he would have liked to get started on the case, there wasn't much he could do with the world believing he was Plum. At the very least, he'd feel more comfortable waiting in his own body for the next few hours than he would have been in Plum's. He felt a little guilty, knowing that while he got to wait around in his own body, Plum would be spending the next two hours or so feeling very uncomfortable in a body she didn't know was really her's. But regardless of how he may feel, there was nothing he could really do about it now. Apollo took a seat inside the office, not daring to go anywhere else with everyone thinking he was Plum, and planned to wait out the two hours until Trucy came back with his client's mother.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully Mr. Wright never showed up to question why who he thought was Plum Kitaki was doing Apollo's work. The time hadn't been too stressful, it was almost like a regular day at work even, but knowing that the world currently saw him as another person, something he needed to fix as soon as possible, was enough to put him on edge. As it reached the two hour mark, Apollo put everything back in its place, before sitting down on the couch and waiting for Trucy to return with the real Ms. Kitaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt ended up being an extra half-hour after that when Plum and Trucy finally returned to the office, the latter surprised to see Apollo there. \"Oh, Mrs. Kitaki. You're still here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you said to come back in two hours, and you didn't lock the door to the office when you left,\" Apollo stated. He left out the part about him actually staying at the office during those two hours, rather than leaving and coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" Trucy replied, seemingly buying Apollo's story. \"Well, I guess I'll let you two get on with your legal stuff, then.\" Cheerful as ever, Trucy practically skipped out of the room. It seemed she had enjoyed her afternoon together with 'Apollo'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Kitaki, however, was nowhere near as pleased. The moment Trucy was out of earshot, Plum looked menacingly at Apollo and asked, \"Why didn't you swap us back before she dragged me off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried, trust me. You just got too far away before I could target you properly.\" Apollo decided not to tell Plum that it was actually his fault for pressing the wrong button. What she didn't know, couldn't hurt her, and trying to explain to her that she was actually already in her own body, she just didn't know it, would probably only make things even more confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, swap us back now. I can't stand being in your body for a second longer.\" Apollo nodded, trying not to think too hard about the fact that Plum was referring to her usual plump form as \"your body\".

Doing it this way,  the remote would stay with his own body, now inhabited by Plum, who had dropped it when the swap occurred. Unlike the first time, though, the remote fell right into a big pile of stuff Trucy used for her magic tricks. Which meant that if he wanted his body back, he'd need to act fast and find the remote in the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could do so, Plum spoke again. \"After all you've put me through, you'd better get Wocky declared innocent,\" she said, stepping around Trucy's stuff to get her broom. \"Oh, and don't you even think about using that thing on me again, understand?\" She revealed part of the sword hidden within her broom to emphasize how serious she was about this. If she knew what was really going on, though, Apollo had a feeling she'd be begging him to use it on her again.

That was the chance Apollo needed, as he waddled over to the pile of Trucy's stuff as quickly as he possibly could considering the body he was in, and began rummaging through the pile to try and find the remote. It didn't take too long, seeing as how the remote was still fairly close to the top of the pile, but Apollo was afraid he may have already wasted too much time. He headed to the office door and looked around, hoping to spot Mrs. Kitaki before she left with his body.</span></div></div>",

He began to get scared that Plum would get away before he could do another swap. Hopefully she hadn't got a cab and left the building yet, he began to head downstairs hoping to catch her before she left. He went as fast as Plum's body could, but as he kept going he got more winded and soon he was barely at walking speed. By the time he got outside Plum was already long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body was gone. He could try going to the Kitaki family home to get his body back, but with how serious Plum was about not swapping with her again, she would probably do something horrible to him if she saw him around her home with the remote. With his spirit broken, he headed back up to the office to contemplate his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got back to the office, he sat down and looked at the remote. Although it was useful in getting Wocky's alibi, it also lost him his body and possibly ruined his life. At the same time though, the remote was the only thing that could fix him at this point. While getting his body back from Plum wasn't an option at this point, he could swap with someone else. While sticking someone else with Plum's body was a pretty horrible thing to do, staying in Plum's body was WAY to uncomfortable for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about what kind of swap he should do. He settled on doing another unaware swap. He wanted to keep his life the same, but with a body more comfortable than Plum's. Plus, the person he would switch with wouldn't know they had been swapped at all. The only question at this point was WHO to switch with. The nearest person was Trucy, but did he really want to give her Plum's body? Trucy was a great person and he didn't want her to deal with having a body like this. Another option was to swap with Mr. Wright. If he did that he would be male again. There was also plenty of other people in town he could switch with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking over his options he decided to switch with...</span></div></div>",

He looked down to see Trucy's petite body instead of Plum's hefty frame. It was a rather drastic change, to say the least. Trucy's body actually made him feel a little vulnerable with how small she was, but regardless, he felt much more comfortable in this body than in Plum's. Looking back into the room, he saw Trucy was still practicing her magic tricks, lugging around Plum's body as if she'd done it her whole life. He still felt a little bad about doing this, but the euphoria from getting out of Plum's body was overpowering that at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo closed the door again, and left the office. <i>\"Alright, time to get back to investigating, the old fashioned way,\"</i> he thought. That said, he did still bring along the remote, which he put in the pouch Trucy had at her hip, just in case. It wasn't until he got outside that he realised how much more revealing Trucy's outfit was. He could feel the wind on his arms and legs, blowing through his hair, and up his skirt. That said, this was still more tolerable than being Plum. \"Alright,\" he said to himself, doing his best not to worry about the fact that Trucy's voice was coming out of his mouth, \"Time to go get Stickler's testimony.\"</span></div></div>",

Trucy had been walking when he pressed the button and thus he was unprepared to start moving once the swap was done. He looked around and saw he was on th bus, meaning he did an aware swap with Trucy instead of Plum. As he thought about his mistake he heard his own voice start talking to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, uh, Trucy. I think we really should go down to the detention center and talk to, uh, Wocky. You know how he is, he wouldn't make it a day in prison!\" Plum said in his body. Seeing his body act like a worried mother was one of the eeriest things he had every seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Kitaki, it's me, Apollo.\" He told her. Hearing Ms. Kitaki's voice come out of his mouth earlier was weird, but hearing Trucy's was even weirder. Unlike Ms. Kitaki's, Trucy's voice was one he heard on a daily basis and now he was in control of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Kitaki looked at him with a shocked and angry expression. \"And just WHY did you swap with her and not me?\" Plum asked, tapping Apollo's foot in a threating way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo got scared \"B-because the two of you were moving so fast and it messed up my aim.\" He explained to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Kitaki thankfully believed him, that could have gotten ugly if she didn't. \"Alright. We better go and explain to poor Trucy what's going on, she must be freaking out.\" She reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, we better hurry.\" Apollo said and began to head for the front of the bus. As he walked toward the front of the bus he felt a sudden movement and fell backward. The bus had started moving, leaving Trucy in Plum's body back at the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo grabbed on of the seats on the bus and used it to stand back up. He began to head to the front of the bus to ask the driver to get off, but as he did a thought came into his mind. He had to go and talk to Wesley Stickler and he probably wouldn't cooperate with Apollo if he went to question him as himself. He was a fan of Trucy's magic, so maybe being Trucy would help with that, plus with Plum in his body she could personally contribute to the investigation to get her son a not guilty verdict. At the same time though, he couldn't just leave Trucy in Plum's body back at the office. She was probably scared out of her mind in Plum's body, not to mention she also had the remote. What if she used it while he was gone? Or worse, lost it? Plus she almost, unintentionally admittedly, made him stay in Plum's body for an extra two hours. Making her stay as Plum for a little while would be like some kind of Karma <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought over his options and decided to....</span></div></div>",

However, Apollo saw his face soon turn sour, \"wait! <i>THAT </i>sicko? Why would Wocky ever associate with him?!\" She was suddenly fuming, disgusted to be reminded of the \"panty thief\" who had robbed her clothesline around the time of Wocky's original trial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd guess they met after the trial. Stickler was a witness after all,\" Apollo offered. \"Anyways, while its a bit cruel to leave Trucy stranded back there, I had planned to take her body for this interview anyways. Stickler is a fan of her magic shows; he won't listen to me after what I did to him in court, but he might be willing to talk to her, especially if he thinks I can give him some of her secrets.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not so sure of this,\" Plum replied, still concerned. \"She still has that... contraption, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but Trucy can probably put things together, and I don't think she'd lose it. And this way, you can help the investigation to get your son free, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose...\" Plum replied. The thought of being able to participate in her son's defense certainly appealed to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them were suddenly jolted again as the bus came to an abrupt stop, Apollo pulling his arms up to hold onto Trucy's hat. \"Oh! This is where we get off I think,\" Apollo states, getting up from the bench. Acting like Trucy would, he gripped Plum in his body by the arm and pulled her out of the bus and onto the street corner. \"Come on! The fast we do this the faster we get back to Trucy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short walk later, and the two managed to find Stickler silently reading in the back of the University Library. Apollo got some odd looks due to Trucy's getup, but brushed it off as the two approached the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo-as-Trucy gave a cough, but Stickler gave no notice. He cleared his throat again, louder, but still nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, weirdo! We're talking to you!\" Plum suddenly shouted, smacking her hand down on the table, prompting Stickler to drop his book and bolt his attention upwards. Plenty of heads turned at this; the library was quiet and Apollo was suddenly realizing just how <i>loud</i> his body was. Apollo was thankful that she didn't have the sword; he feared what Plum would do to him if she was armed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear! Y-you! You wish to destroy me again?!\" He cried out, seeing what looked to him an angry Apollo Justice, who months before had ruined his reputation in a public court trial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! Its nothing like that!\" Apollo asserted, stepping between Plum in his body and Stickler. \"We're uh, here on an investigation,\" he said, trying to sound cheerful as possible with Trucy's voice. <i>'Be friendly, keep the peace.' </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, what could you want from <i>me</i>? I'm perfectly innocent of any crime.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft, yeah right,\" Plum said, dismissing him. \"You sure you haven't been stealing anymore underwear since June?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStickler looked all around, terrified that people might be hearing this. \"Please, not so loud! What do you want from me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to sound upbeat, Apollo interjected again. Imitating Trucy, he playfully knocked her hat to the side and gave an uncertain smile, \"don't worry! It's nothing serious. We're representing Wocky, you know him, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the rude brute from the reading circle?\" he asked, calming down a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What was that about my -\"</i> Apollo put a hand over Plum's mouth, silencing her before she got them kicked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's being charged for a crime he didn't commit,\" Apollo explained trying to maintain his cool while Plum was furiously trying to break away, \"but he said you can give him an alibi. You saw him last night, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his book shut, Wesley looked Apollo in the eyes. \"Maybe. I can give you my testimony... if you do something for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short period later, the two were back on the bus, returning to the office. Plum's hair was askew, her face still red with anger. <i>\"He just wanted to know a magic trick?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo shrugged. \"Some people are really weird like that,\" he said complacently. By this point, nothing surprised him much. \"Anyways, explaining the 'magic panties' routine to him is Trucy's problem. The important thing is, he'll testify for us, so the prosecution won't have much to throw on Wocky aside from circumstantial evidence.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them jumped out of the bus at the stop right outside the office. \"I don't think Trucy would go anywhere,\" Apollo said, \"lets get in there quick and explain what happened to her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Trucy (and by extension, Plum's body and the remote) inside the agency? </span></div></div>",

Eventually though, she finds it underneath a stray sheet. \"Where did it go?\" she muttered through clenched teeth, struggling to throw aside tarps, hoops, and other props. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Trucy, it's not like it could have gone anywhere, right? I'm sure its here,\" Apollo interjected, trying to keep things cool. He gave a nervous laugh as Plum glared at him. \"Don't worry Mrs. Kitaki, it can't have gone far.

This sparked an idea in Trucy's mind. if Ms. Kitaki didn't want to defend Wocky in Apollo's body, then maybe Wocky would want to defend himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy made her way to the detention center. She told the guards that she was a friend of Wocky's and she was led to the usual detention center visiting room.

She wouldn't believe it herself if she hadn't been forced into swapping earlier. \"Wocky, I think I can get you out of jail early.\" She whispered, it would be bad if she said that aloud and the guard heard what seemed to be talk about a prison break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shorty, you know me. I can handle the click! Any G can! 'sides, Pointy-locks is gonna get me free in a few days\" Wocky said smugly and 'gangster like'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy sighed, she really should have expected him to act like that. She pointed the remote at him and pressed the aware swap button again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant Wocky was acting a lot less smug. He was looking around the visiting room in terror and then at his body with a look of shock, and then he looked at Trucy. \"Trucy?! What did you do?\" Wocky's body asked.

There was a lot of filing to do between cases, and the law office had just finished a hell of a case at the space center. It was an emotional roller coaster, but it was finally over, and the people involved managed to find some closure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then they dumped all the paperwork off on Apollo. The moment the exciting stuff ended,Trucy and Athena made themselves scarce. Furthermore, Mr. Wright suddenly had business over at Kurain. Apollo suspected it wasn't as important as Wright led on though. Thus, Apollo was left all alone to see the case out to its boring conclusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, in the mid afternoon, Apollo finally finished the paper work with an exhausted sigh. He got up and stretched his arms and legs, but was interrupted by a ringing at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? A client maybe?\" Apollo had wanted to relax after all that, but it would be irresponsible to turn away a potential defendant from the office just because he was tired. He walked into the cluttered lobby - filled with Trucy's props and knick-knacks, and opened the door only to find no one there but a package on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd,\" he muttered as he picked it up. It was a bit late for mail, and usually they wanted someone to sign for these things, but he decided to ignore it and check the package out. Laying it out on the coffee table, he tore it open and pulled out a small remote and a set of instructions. After reading it over, he was incredulous. Body Swapping was impossible... but then, one would think that spirit channeling or robot uprisings were also impossible. He thought about it, and the idea of swapping bodies was appealing. He could be like Trucy and live without a care in the world, or become someone like Mr. Wright and be his own boss. It'd be great! No one could shove paperwork on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured there was no harm in humoring whoever gave him the device. It wasn't that heavy and didn't seem very dangerous. Worst case scenario was he just asked Athena to do the paperwork next time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does he try to switch with?</span></div></div>",

Apollo went to Trucy's room at the agency and saw her working on her magic panties act for what seemed to be the millionth time. Apollo briefly wondered whether or not he should ask her before he tried to swap, but decided against it, if this thing didn't work then he would be mocked by her for weeks at the very least!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo aimed the remote through the doorway subtly to avoid being seen pointing it and pressed the button.

He could feel Trucy's hair tickling the back of his neck, her hat resting atop his head, and her dress clinging tightly to his body. The biggest change though was the void between his legs, and the weight on his chest. Trucy's magician outfit, although not exactly what he'd call 'revealing', showed off a bit more than his usual suit, and only made the changes even more obvious. He also noticed that he no longer had the remote, and instead held a magic wand and a large pair of panties in his small, gloved hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Apollo could do anything else, he heard a loud scream behind him, along with a clattering sound. He quickly turned around, feeling Trucy's cape swish around him as he did so, to see his own body, now occupied by Trucy, staring at him, fear evident on her face. The remote had dropped to the ground, which was probably what the clattering sound was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Polly, what did you do!?\" Trucy screamed, terrified of what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I swapped bodies with you,\" Apollo answered, remaining calm since he was the one who'd caused the swap. It was still strange for him to hear Trucy's voice coming out of his mouth though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But how? This isn't... you shouldn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo placed Trucy's magic stuff down on a chair before walking up to where Trucy had dropped the remote, Trucy following him with her eyes the whole time. He picked up the remote off the floor and showed it to her, realising how much taller Trucy was than him now. \"I used this remote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Apollo could even get anything else out, Trucy interrupted. \"But, how does it work? And why'd you switch with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo sighed, before explaining everything, from the remote arriving at the office, to his reasons for swapping with Trucy. Once he had finished explaining, Trucy seemed to understand, but she still seemed to be very uncomfortable in Apollo's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she said, finally starting to calm down, \"If you wanted time to relax, you probably shouldn't have swapped with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have a show to do tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo frowned. Had this been anyone else, he would have asked what they meant by \"a show to do\", but since this was Trucy he was talking to, he knew she was talking about a magic show. That wasn't what he was frowning about, though. \"I thought Mr. Wright said no shows while he's in Kurain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I just couldn't say no to a chance to perform. So, you can't be me right now. I need time to practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not exactly how Apollo had intended this to go. If Trucy had a show tonight, he'd have to find someone else to swap with to get his day off... or would he? Sure, it wasn't a \"day off\" exactly, but the life of a magician might still be more relaxing than that of a defense attorney. Trucy was still in her teens, and she made it all look so easy, so how hard could it really be?</span></div></div>",

C'mon, it's my show, can't you just switch us back now?\" Trucy begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A show you weren't supposed to do in the first place. I'll give you a choice. Either you let me do your show for you. Or I'll call your dad, in your body, and tell him that you were planning on doing a show tonight.\" Apollo bargained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy thought about it for a while and eventually sighed and answered Apollo. \"Fine, you can do my show from me.\" She said with her head down. after a few seconds of silence she perked up again \"But, we're going to need to work double time! Pick up that magic wand and prepare to do some magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next three hours or so were spent by Trucy teaching Apollo some basic magic tricks. Card tricks, and coin tricks, remove your thumb, the simple stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" Trucy began \"I think you're ready to learn a real magic trick, The amazing Mr. Hat!\" Trucy exclaimed \"But, before I teach you have to know that not everyone can be a good partner to Mr. Hat, it takes a lot of practice and...\" Trucy began to ramble on<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo ignored her and activated Mr. Hat, he had seen Trucy do so many times on investigations and the like that it be impossible for him not to have learned how she did it. He did Trucy ventriloquist act with Mr. Hat \"I think Apollo can do this just fine, but you really shouldn't have taken the show request in the first place.\" Apollo laughed as he made Mr. Hat say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Et tu, Hat?\" Trucy joked with a laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Apollo laughed he realized there was another trick that Trucy hadn't shown him yet. \"Hey, what about your magic panties? Aren't they your signature trick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have my body, but the secret of the magic panties is for my mind only.\" Trucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Apollo could say anything he was interrupted by the chime of the clock. \"Ah! It's getting late, the show will start soon! You need to hurry!\" Trucy said and began to nearly push Apollo out the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" Apollo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you wanted the day off and someone has to do your paperwork.\" Trucy said with a smile \"Don't worry, I can do it. You just do your best at the show, it's at the wonder bar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Apollo was practically pushed out of the office, he noticed he still had the remote in his left hand, he held onto it the whole magic training session to avoid Trucy swapping back with him. Having nowhere else to put it, Trucy's outfit had no pockets. He put it under Trucy's hat, it should be safe there, he hoped. he decided there was nothing else he could really do at a time like this and began to head to the wonder bar, hopefully this show wouldn't be a complete failure.</span></div></div>",

Looking over to back where he was standing, he saw Trucy standing there gawking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whuuuu....What just happened? Polly, why am I you? And why are you me?\" Trucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... The confusion begins.\" Apollo thinks to himself \"Right now, I have my body, but the world sees me as Trucy Wright. Trucy has her own body and the world sees her as Apollo Justice. However, Trucy thinks that my body has always been hers, and that I have always had her body. She must be freaking out, even though she is in her own body, this is so weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm well, you see, there's this remote',\" Apollo explains about the remote, which he took back off Trucy, and about how he wanted a day off from work so he swapped with Trucy, skipping the part about the failed unaware swap the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let me get this straight, you want me to pretend to be you for a day so that you can rest in my body? Fine, but you're treating me to some Super-Spicy Curry!!\" Trucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'll go enjoy my day off I guess even if it is albeit weird.\" Apollo mumbles.</span></div></div>",

He was still in Trucy's body, and he was still wearing her outfit, but now it was apparent that their life roles had been swapped as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to go make sure that everything had worked, so he left her room to go search for the new Apollo. He found her, sitting down, embroiled in the paperwork he had been trying to avoid with this whole gambit. She looked busy and determined, and seemed serious. He figured it must have worked if she was like this (he doubted she be sitting there calmly doing his paperwork if she didn't think she was him), but he decided to probe her just to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, Polly?\" It was a really strange sensation to hear her voice come out of him when he spoke. He tried to do his best impersonation of Trucy, flashing an overly cheery smile and using her old nickname for him. He even found himself posing like her, his hands girlishly hidden behind his back and his feet pulled inwards facing each other. Still, it was strange; acting like her came to him very naturally. Did the unaware swap have some effects on him as well? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Trucy. I'm a bit busy now, sorry. I'm up for some magic tricks later, but I gotta work now.\" Trucy seemed to be thinking just like he normally did, so he really was in the clear to have a day to relax. This device was incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Polly, I understand. I'm going out, okay? I'll be back in just a little bit.\" Trucy shook his head at her and immediately went back to work. Apollo decided he'd go out someplace. Maybe to a cafe or the park or something, it didn't really matter; he just wanted to get out of the office for a bit.

He had never really extensively looked in here before, (he never had a reason to), but that didn't stop him from being curious now. Sure, it was snooping a bit, but it <i>was</i> technically \"her\" room now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened her drawers, finding a bunch of girlish outfits and accessories. She had a small bookshelf filled with teenage romance novels and magic trick guides. It sure was Trucy's room, alright. Just for fun, he even jumped on her bed for a bit, wriggling around in the soft sheets. Trucy had a really comfortable bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to leave, he caught a glimpse of his new self in the vanity mirror. He couldn't help but smile as he looked at himself. He twirled the sides of his dress as he stared at his new body. He didn't quite know why, but knowing he was, for all intents and purposes, Trucy Wright, filled him with a sense of happiness and bliss he hadn't felt in a very long time. He found himself uncharacteristically giggling to himself as his grin grew wider and wider. He started to understand why Trucy acted so cheery and happy all the time- it was as if her body was sending a constant stream of pure dopamine into every corner of his brain. He felt totally relaxed and carefree. Still giggling and sporting a giant smile, (it was tough to resist the urge to), he practically pranced out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said goodbye to Trucy and walked out the door.

'Thena,\" Apollo asked has Athena dragged him away from the bus stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember that old TV show, <i>The Steel Samurai</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yeah!\" Apollo responded, a bit too enthusiastically. Athena seemed a bit surprised, Juniper probably didn't watch shows like that as a kid, but Apollo was always a big fan of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it turns out that Mr. Wright was the attorney for <i>both</i> actors who played the Samurai; the guy who played him on TV and the guy who played him in the stage performance,\" Athena explained, \"so, I managed to meet Will Powers! He's really cool, and he's going to play the Steel Samurai in an upcoming movie. He said he'd let me go behind the scenes for a day of filming, and I'm sure he wouldn't mind if I brought a friend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds amazing!\" Apollo exclaimed, his new voice reaching a pitch he was a bit uncomfortable with. He relaxed his tone and said, \"let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 minutes later, Apollo and Athena were on set of the Steel Samurai movie, but strangely enough, so were the police. Tape was set all around the set, and a number of officers were blocking the way, diverting civilians. Curious people they were, Apollo and Athena approached the police line, and came across Detective Ema Skye. \"Why are there always police...\" Apollo heard Athena mutter as he decided to talk with the detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Detective Skye, what's happening here?\" Apollo asked from Juniper's body. This familiarity earned a strange look from Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot recognizing either of the two young women approaching her, Detective Skye seemed a bit cold. \"Nothing for you two to concern yourself with - its official police business. Run along, it doesn't do anyone any good to have teenagers run around an investigation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped for a moment, an raised an eyebrow at Apollo. \"How do you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo grimaced a bit; that was dumb of him. How could he forget who he was at the moment? \"Er, I've seen you on the news before!\" he rebounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective seemed to buy it, although Athena still was giving Apollo a somewhat strange look. She dismissed it though and returned to the detective. \"Please detective, we're friends of Mr. Powers!\" she exclaimed. \"Is he okay? We need to know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if its really that important to you, then I can tell you that Mr. Powers is okay. However - and don't tell anyone I told you this - he's currently...\"</span></div></div>",

He glanced at Juniper, who took advantage of Athena being distracted to pick up the remote and switch bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Apollo and Athena were standing very close to one another.

Juniper sighed, and confessed, \"Apollo found a remote that can swap people's bodies around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena raised an eyebrow, uttering, \"What?\" That was definitely not the answer she was expecting to hear. \"So you two were acting weird, because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were in each other's bodies, yeah,\" Apollo interjected. He figured he may as well come clean as well since Juniper had already let Athena in on the secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena wasn't sure what to believe. On one hand, their story sounded completely ridiculous, like something out of some sort of weird sci-fi show, and the logical side of her brain told her there was no way body swapping like that should be possible. But on the other hand, she hadn't heard any discord in their voices when they had told her, so were they telling the truth? None of this made sense. While Athena silently mulled over the facts, Apollo and Juniper shot nervous glances at each other. They had already told Athena the truth, what more could they do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Athena spoke up, saying only two words. \"Prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Apollo mumbled, not entirely expecting that response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove it. You've still got the remote, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.\" Apollo held out the remote for her to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo frowned. Athena could certainly be forceful when she wanted to be. \"Shouldn't we be heading to the detention?\" he said, trying to change the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Mr. Powers is counting on you two, right?\" Juniper added, backing up Apollo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apollo!\" Athena's voice sounded a lot more serious than normal. \"From my point of view, you and Junie sound like you're crazy. So unless you prove to me that that remote works, you're not getting anywhere near Mr. Powers. He deserves a lawyer who's actually sane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo sighed. It seemed the quickest way to get this over with and let him and Athena continue with their jobs would be to prove to her that the remote actually worked. \"Okay, fine. Just, hold still for a second.\" Athena complied, crossing her arms and staring at him as he decided how to do this. The easiest way to prove to Athena that the remote actually worked would be to perform an aware swap on her. Swapping with Junie again, or doing an unaware swap, wouldn't really do anything to persuade Athena that it worked. But then there was the question of who to swap Athena with.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With just the press of a button, Apollo found himself once again in a female body, although this time he now possessed the body of his colleague, Athena Cykes. If suddenly finding herself in his body didn't prove to her that this was real, and that he and Juniper weren't crazy, he didn't know what would. He had decided to swap himself with Athena, rather than swapping Juniper with her, since he had already swapped Juniper once without her permission today, and it didn't really seem right to do it again. Of course, he could have just asked for Juniper's permission to swap her with Athena, but that didn't cross his mind until he was already standing in Athena's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo's plan didn't seem as smart, however, when he was forced to cover his ears from Athena's screams of shock. Athena with his chords of steel and him with Athena's sensitive hearing made for a killer combo. Of course, even without Athena's hearing, Athena's scream had been loud enough to make Juniper wince a little as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is... how? I... what?\" Athena rambled, not entirely believing what was in front of her eyes. Her eyes darted back and forth between the male body she now possessed, and her own body standing in front of her, hands clamped over its ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Athena, indoor voice, please,\" Apollo said, slowly lowering his hands as Athena started to calm down. \"So, you believe us, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena nodded, a grin starting to spread across her face. \"Yeah, of course I do. This is so cool!\" Not used to Apollo's voice, Athena found herself shouting a little too loud again, and apologised as she noticed Apollo wince again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was about to suggest that they swap back and go see Mr. Powers, but before he could do se, the lawyer duo were distracted by the sound of someone trying to suppress their laughter. It didn't take long to figure out who it was coming from; the only other person in the room, Juniper. \"Sorry,\" she said, realising she had inadvertently interrupted the conversation, \"I kind of see what you were talking about with us acting weird, 'Thena.\" Apollo smiled, realising how weird it must be for her to see him and Athena acting like each other. He had swapped with two other people now, but he had yet to see how two other people who had been swapped acted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis momentary distraction that Juniper had provided gave Athena the opportunity to steer the conversation in the direction she wanted. \"So, why'd you swap with Junie, Apollo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mr. Wright's basically loaded me with all the paperwork while he's away in Kurain, and since you're not helping out at all, I decided to use the remote to take the rest of the day off by swapping with Juniper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena sighed at how mundane Apollo's reason for swapping had been. She had almost expected this to have something to do with Junie's completely obvious crush on Apollo that he was somehow oblivious to. \"Have you used it at all before that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, it just came in the mail today. I don't even know where it came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you don't even know where this thing came from? What if it was dangerous? Did you even think about that before using it on Junie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sorry. Maybe if you helped out a little more at the office, the idea of taking a vacation wouldn't have been so appealing to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling more than a little awkward about being present for the argument that was unfolding, Juniper decided to intervene. \"Well, the remote isn't dangerous, so that doesn't really matter, right? I mean, Apollo and I switched and nothing bad happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena sighed, realising she had gotten mad over nothing. \"Yeah, I guess you're right. Sorry about that, Apollo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. Just, try not to dump all your work on me all the time, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Apollo had a feeling she was still going to do it anyway, but at least she apologised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally taking control of the conversation back from the over-emotional Athena, Apollo said, \"Well, we should probably swap back and head down to the detention center to see Mr. Powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want your vacation anymore?\" Athena asked in a joking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a client now. My day off can wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should probably get going too,\" Juniper interjected. \"Good luck on the case, you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later, Junie,\" Athena called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you, Juniper. Thanks for letting me use your body for a little while,\" Apollo said, taking on a much more calm tone of voice than his bodyswapped companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Juniper had left, Athena headed towards the door too, stating, \"Well, we should get going, we've got investigating to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo, however, blocked her path to the exit. \"Before we leave, give me the remote so I can swap us back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena frowned. She had silently hoped that Apollo would forget about that, as she was starting to enjoy this whole bodyswapping thing. The remote had been in her hand after the swap, and she had slipped it into Apollo's pocket so that she'd be the one holding onto it for now, but Apollo had gone through this before and knew where the remote would end up. \"Why do you have to be the one that keeps it?\" Athena asked, hoping to have more time to play around with this gizmo that caused all sorts of scientific impossibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because finders keepers,\" Apollo replied, not having a real reason besides that. \"Now give it here.\"</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, Athena's eyed widened as Juniper in her body realized what happened. She didn't seem that shocked, having done it before, but she and Apollo both ended up clamping their hands over their ears as Athena gave a short but loud shriek from Juniper's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the - how the!\" She was flailing her arms about confused, losing Juniper's hat somewhere in the commotion. \"It really worked! This is amazing! And weird!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One way to put,\" Apollo said as he pulled his hands away from his head, \"now can you quiet down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah, sorry,\" Athena muttered, pulling Juniper's hair in front her eyes in amazement. \"Why would you keep this a secret from me Apollo!? And why did you switch with Juniper?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo crossed his arms and rolled his eyes, \"I kinda just wanted a day off. Today was the first time I ever used it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you just found it? Do you know where it's from?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Just showed up in the mail,\" Apollo admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds simultaneously irresponsible and <i>boring </i>use for something like that,\" Athena said, looking at Apollo judgmentally. \"Honestly you're the only person I can imagine who would use something so cool for something so mundane!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, can I go back to my body now?\" Juniper asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo sighed, \"yeah. There's no point in switching now that we have to go help Mr. Powers.\" He lifted the remote once again, clicking aware swap to put Athena and Juniper back to normal. Juniper was relieved and picked her hat back off the ground, but Athena seemed a bit disappointed that the change was so brief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that we have that device, we ought to put it to good use! Keep it with you, it might help us with our investigation,\" she clasped a fist in her palm, \"and afterwards we can get back to having fun with it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... going to head back home. I don't know if I want to keep messing with something like that,\" Juniper interjected nervously. \"You two can keep doing as you like, but it just makes me a bit nervous.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine Juniper,\" Apollo said, \"we'll see you around. Anyways, we ought to head on out Athena.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gone seperate ways from Juniper, Apollo and Athena eventually arrived at the detention center. Apollo couldn't help but notice that Athena kept glancing to the device in his pocket. He could only assume she was going through all the ridiculous possibilities it posed, and was a bit worried at what she would want them to do with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they managed to have a moment with Mr. Powers, who was held behind bars. \"Oh! You two must be Athena and Apollo, right? Mr. Wright has told me about you two.\" He was a big, imposing man, but his tone was genial. He kept cool under the pressure pretty well; probably because this wasn't the first time he had been arrested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we're sorry Mr. Wright isn't here - he's out of town at the moment,\" Apollo explained, Athena still seeming lost in her fantasy. \"We've handled plenty of cases ourselves though, don't worry. We'll get you through the trial no problem. Now, can you tell us about what happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Powers explained that, right before shooting had happened, one intern went to go find the director, only to find that she had been stabbed. The director survived, but she was in critical condition. The knife was later found inside Powers' trailer, although it had no fingerprints. Regardless, Powers was immediately labeled the primary suspect and was taken into police custody. It wasn't long after that that \"Juniper\" and Athena apparently stumbled upon the crime scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then!\" Athena declared, suddenly speaking, \"lets go investigate Mr. Powers trailer! If the culprit planted the knife there, they had to leave something else behind, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Apollo agreed. It sounded as good a place as any to go. He turned to Will, \"thanks Mr. Powers. I'm really sorry you have to go through this again. We'll get to the bottom of this, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Powers thanked them again, telling them not to worry about him as they got up and left the precinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the filming location, Apollo and Athena stood outside the police line. The crime was so recent that no one on the scene was letting them in. Even Ema told Apollo that letting attorneys in was a no-go, as the police weren't done yet. Apollo frowned at this but as he looked to Athena she seemed all smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you so giddy about Athena,\" he asked, a bit worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the perfect opportunity!\" She exclaimed! \"We can get an edge over the prosecution if one of us uses the device to go investigate undercover as law enforcement. The other can stay behind and make sure whoever we switch with stays put and doesn't make problems with our body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds rather illegal,\" Apollo replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no laws against body swapping,\" Athena asserted. \"They might MAKE some after this, but they can't prosecute us for something that's never happened before.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo grimaced. \"Ugh, alright, but I feel this will get us in trouble. Which one of us should switch?\"</span></div></div>",

She had only been swapped with Juniper for around a minute and really wanted to get the feel of being in someone else's body. She had so many ideas for what to use the remote for and couldn't wait to try it out on her own for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. first we need to find someone to switch you with.\" Apollo told her. He wasn't complaining about staying in his body. He had already been someone else for most of the day and being in his own body felt like he was back from a long vacation. At the same time though, he had to admit that going into someone else's body was interesting and trying it again would have been nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the people entering and leaving the crime scene, looking for someone to swap Athena with. Then, as luck would have it, he spotted someone that would be perfect to swap her with. It was the prosecutor in charge of this case. If he swapped Athena with them then she would be able to go into the crime scene and investigate alongside the police. Investigating right alongside the police would probably get them a more coherent understanding and evidence of the case then their normal investigations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo turned to Athena to ask for her permission before he swapped her. \"How about them?\" He asked her. Not that she really had much choice, there wasn't exactly many people at the crime scene that she could switch with. The only people around other than dectective Skye and the prosecutor were random police officers, and he doubted that Athena wanted to swap with some random low rank police officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena looked at the prosecutor and eyed them up for a second. \"Oooh, that should be fun. Switch us up!\" She was WAY too excited to swap with someone, Apollo thought to himself. Especially swapping with someone who was the opposite gender. Then again, the first person he had swapped with was a girl, so he really didn't have a right to judge her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo pressed the aware swap button while pointing at Athena, then aimed the remote at the prosecutor and pressed the button once again. Who did he swap Athena with?</span></div></div>",

Switch me with Gavin!\" This seemed like a dream come true to her. She was hopping up and down, giddy like a school girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do when he's in your body?\" Apollo asked, not sure if she was thinking this through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena just shrugged, \"the moment we switch, use those 'chords of steel' you got and scream in my ear! He'll probably pass out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo gave her an incredulous look. \"Are you sure that'll work?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! My ears are very sensitive, remember?\" She said as she wagged a finger at him. \"I'm used to it now, so it wouldn't work on me, but when I was little I had sensory overloads a lot - its why I had the big headphones! If you did it right away, before he could adapt, I bet he wouldn't be able to take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but would your BODY be okay?\" Apollo asked, still seeming skeptical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fiiiiiiine,\" she said, waving her hand. \"Now, get him in the remote before he gets away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo rolled his eyes at the plan and complied, selecting Klavier as the first target for the swap. Klavier briefly noticed them in the distance and waved, but continued to go about his work on the crime scene. Apollo and Athena then went about finding a place to do the swap from. Eventually, they decided the office would be the best place, since it wasn't horribly far and no one would be able to interfere at all. Athena sat down on the couch, brimming with excitement, \"alright, now do it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo grimaced, clicking the aware swap button. For a brief moment, Athena's arms went limp and she seemed dazed. She looked like she was about to say something before Apollo interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"OBJECTION,\"</b></i> he shouted, as close to Athena's ear as possible. Her eyeballs shook for a second, before she collapsed in a heap on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way that can be safe for her body,\" Apollo mumbled, as he shook a hand in front of her eyes. It seemed like it worked - Klavier was passed out and wouldn't cause any trouble. \"There's no way I'm doing that a second time.\" He took a moment just to make sure his breathing was normal before he was satisfied enough to leave the office and head back to the crime scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the police line, he found what seemed to be Klavier Gavin with a ridiculous grin on his face and an offput Detective Skye waiting for him. \"There he is!\" Klavier shouted, \"Apollo, come on in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't think we're ready to let defense attorneys in,\" Ema said dryly, as she opened a bag of Snackoos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the prosecutor here?\" 'Klavier' asked rhetorically. \"I say he's in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggh, your funeral,\" Ema said as she turned and walked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So! Did it work? It worked right?\" Athena turned to ask Apollo. Seeing Klavier act so excitable was unnerving to say the least. His voice sounded a bit higher with Athena using it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and it was disturbing,\" Apollo informed her, still weirded out. \"I don't know how long he'll stay conked out for though, so we should be quick.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Athena replied, snapping Klavier's finger and putting a hand in pocket, trying to imitate his posture. \"Let's go search!... Achtung!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe investigation generally went on like that, with Athena pretending to be Klavier and doing a bad job at it. Not to mention she seemed to get lost in her own eyes anytime they passed a reflective surface; Apollo was sort of glad she wasn't left alone with his body for very long. The police all seemed a bit bewildered by it, and Apollo couldn't help but worry about how Klavier would react to all this when he woke up. <i>'Guess its not our problem.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo made a point of looking over all Klavier's files. It seemed the victim - Director Nichols - had been stabbed in the right side of her ribs. Drops of blood could then be tracked out of the trailer, but ended a few yards out. The knife itself was found in a trashcan in Power's trailer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Powers is right handed, right?\" Apollo asked Athena, who gave a confirming nod, Klavier's weird hair curls bobbing as she did. \"If that's so, then the knife wound should have gone through the left ribs if she was stabbed from the front. That means our real culprit is likely left handed.\" Apollo made note of this - it'd be important to recall for later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued their investigation, both of them interviewing witnesses around the studio, Apollo made note of another vital piece of information: the knife matched up perfectly with the type of knife found at the Craft Service station, and one knife was reported to have gone missing earlier. If they could get a witness to confirm that Powers hadn't been there that day, it'd give an important alibi alongside the hand used to do the stabbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo pulled out his phone and looked at the time - they'd nearly been investigating for an hour. He began to worry about Athena's body back at the office. What would Klavier do if he woke up? \"Athena, I think its time you switch back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, really?\" she seemed disappointed. \"I kinda wanted to keep it up for a bit longer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't risk Klavier waking up,\" he said as he pulled out the device. \"I'm going to make you a target now and switch you with him back at the office; ideally he'll never even realize we were involved. Keep looking around while I go back for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I'll see if there's anything important left to sweep up! ...Herr Forehead,\" she giggled a bit at the catchphrase. Apollo scowled - he was glad to get her out of there, she was having too much fun. Normal Klavier was annoying enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeparting the crime scene, Apollo went back to the office, hoping everything was as he left it. Was Klavier still there when he got back? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Apollo walked into the office and was glad to see that Klavier in Athena's body was still there. He wasn't so glad to see that Klavier was awake now. Klavier was looking at Athena's face in the mirror, playing with Athena's large crescent moon earing and making various faces.. Once Apollo closed the door Klavier looked over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Herr forehead! How was your day at the crime scene?\" He asked in his usual accent, taking the fact he was in another body surprisingly well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo couldn't believe it, even in a situation like this Klavier stayed in his usual mood. He was even able to guess that he and Athena went to the crime scene  \"Aren't you surprised to be in a girl's body?\" He asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlavier gave a laugh and sat down on the couch. \"Of course I was, at first, but I like to make the best of situations. It doesn't take a prodigy to figure out that you caused this, why else would you knock me out? When I woke up I chose to wait around until you and the Fraulein came back. Now let me ask you something Herr Forehead, how did you do this?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was actually impressed with how Klavier figured everything out, but he didn't know if he should explain everything to him. He would probably have tell him about how he could swap peoples bodies, considering how Klavier already figured that out. but maybe he should omit what does the swaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Apollo thought about how to explain everything to Kalvier, Klavier looked at the remote in Apollo's hand. \"What's the fancy toy?\" He asked. Apollo paled a bit as he Klavier noticed the remote. Klavier looked at Apollo pale and gave a light hearted laugh. \"So that's how you did it. Pretty sweet toy there, where did you get it?\" He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo explained the whole thing to Klavier. Everything from getting the remote in the mail, to swapping with Juniper, to swapping Athena with Klavier. After hearing everything, Klavier did his signature air guitar. \"Achtung Herr forehead! Quit the journey you've had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo let out a sigh of relief, he honestly expected Klavier to make a few jokes at his expense about how he swapped with Juniper earlier. After getting his thoughts together, he pointed the remote at Klavier. \"I'm gonna swap you back with Athena now, okay?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So soon? C'mon, I've been in this office the whole time, most of it passed out. I barely know how it feels to be in this body. At least let me go and walk around outside in this body for a bit. I'm sure the Fraulein wouldn't mind being in my body for a while longer.\" Klavier tried to convince Apollo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo thought about it, but decided against it. \"Sorry, but I told Athena I was swapping you two back right now.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How 'bout I meet you halfway. Let's take a walk down to the crime scene and when we get there you can switch me and her back?\" Klavier tried to negotiate with Apollo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo thought about it, Athena and Klavier did seem to both be enjoying the swap, maybe it would be better to walk down with Klavier and swap them then.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't really sure what amazed him so much. Klavier had a smile and was turning his head all over the place to catch any sound they passed by, be it a casual conversation or chirps of birds. \"You're getting a kick out of this; what's up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's her ears, Herr Forehead,\" Klavier replied, excitement in his (or Athena's) voice. \"She hears everything with so much clarity - and even things normal people wouldn't hear at all. I'm noticing every little fluctuation. It's pretty exciting for a musician; I'd kill for these ears.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt kinda made sense to Apollo when put that way. He hadn't been in Athena's body yet, but she had told him before that she could hear the most minute of emotions in people's voices. Klavier acted nonchalantly about everything, but Apollo knew he took the things he loved pretty seriously. And Klavier loved two things: music and justice. Athena's ears were probably more intensive than any pair of headphones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they arrived at the crime scene and came across a very confused Athena as Klavier. \"He woke up?!\" she asked, startled to see herself walking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I did Fraulein Attorney, but don't worry, I'm not mad,\" Klavier replied with a smile. \"In fact, I'm interested.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena turned to Apollo, \"so why didn't you switch the two of us back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo gave a shrug, \"you seemed to like being him and he didn't want to switch, so I agreed to walk back here with him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Athena's eyes lit up like stars. \"You say you don't want to switch back yet?\" She asked Klavier giddily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Mr. Justice allows it,\" Klavier replied, snapping a finger and pointing to Apollo. \"See? She digs it and so do I, so why switch yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo frowned, \"because the two of you are lawyers on opposite sides of a case. It's kind of a conflict of interest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all on the side of the truth Apollo, you know that, and I trust the two of you; so what do you say Cykes, want to prosecute a case?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena seemed overjoyed at Klavier's offer, \"heck yeah! I get to be a rockstar! You're gonna lose anyways, but yeah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo brought a hand to his face and sighed. \"Fine, if you two are really having that much fun, then you can stay. Just know that you're both taking a risk here.\" Suddenly, he felt himself wrapped up in an abrupt hug by Athena-as-Klavier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo! You're the best, Apollo!\" He heard Klavier laugh from Athena's body as she let him go. The whole thing left him deeply uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I gotta prepare for the case! Slept on the job it seems, let's go back to 'our' office, Herr Forehead,\" Klavier-as-Athena said. </span></div></div>",

Why?\" Athena asked. \"I thought we were staying swapped for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I already selected you with the remote before I headed back to the office. If I use it on you two again, then it won't have anyone selected anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Planning on using the remote yourself, Herr Forehead?\" Klavier asked. Apollo still found it pretty strange to hear Klavier's accent coming out of Athena's body. Speaking of accents, he hadn't noticed until he spoke to Klavier, but Athena in Klavier's body seemed to have been speaking without an accent. It wasn't as obvious, though, which was probably why Ema hadn't mentioned it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but this way, if we need to use it, it'll be ready. Okay?\" Klavier and Athena both agreed, and with the press of a button the pair were back in their own bodies. Apollo knew he could just leave everything back to normal like this, but he had agreed to let them keep each other's bodies for a while, and so, he almost immediately swapped them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good luck, you two,\" Athena said, a grin on her (or technically, Klavier's) face, before heading back to towards the crime scene to assist the police investigation, now that she was a prosecutor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too,\" Klavier called out, while Apollo just waved goodbye to what used to be his colleague. He had a feeling this was probably going to be the strangest case he'd ever worked on in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's go,\" Apollo said, turning away from the crime scene, and heading back towards the office. Klavier followed close behind, still somewhat marveling at how everything sounded with Athena's ears. Even though his colleague and the prosecutor on the case had switched places, Apollo was still going to take this case seriously, and was currently running over the facts in his head. He'd probably need to go back and investigate more later, but he and Athena had managed to get some good leads that he and Klavier could investigate; the knife, and the culprit's left-handedness. Although, without having Athena let them back into the crime scene, Apollo wasn't sure they'd actually be able to follow up on those leads just yet. Maybe they should go talk to Mr. Powers instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they neared the Wright Anything Agency, Klavier finally broke the silence. \"So, did you and Miss Cykes find any new leads while I was out, Herr Forehead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo frowned. He was not putting up with this for however long the case would take. \"Do you have to keep calling me that? It's weird hearing Athena say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlavier grinned at Apollo's discomfort. \"All the more reason to keep calling you that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, your accent makes it kind of obvious that you're not really Athena, you might want to work on that if you're going to be pretending to be her in court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, maybe I could pull some strings to get a judge on the case who's never met us before. That might sort out a few problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo couldn't deny that, provided he could actually arrange it, what Klavier said might actually work. He remember that Mr. Wright once told him that a prosecutor did a similar thing before to pose as a defense attorney while Mr. Wright was in hospital. \"What about Trucy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Wright's out of the country right now, but Trucy's not. How are you going to fool her into thinking you're really Athena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... is a very good question. I'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Now come on, we have a case to prepare for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, we're here.\" It hadn't even been that long, but Apollo was already starting to regret his decision to let Athena and Klavier stay switched. The two of them entered the office to go over the facts Apollo and Athena had learned while investigating.</span></div></div>",

He eyed the two of them thinking about which one would be better to investigate as. Ema's clothes were mostly gender neutral, so he wouldn't have to deal with wearing women's clothing, but he would have to deal with hearing the voice of someone he knew come out of his mouth the whole time. On the other hand, the police officer was of lesser authority, so there was less of a chance of her being pulled away to go somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought about who to swap with Athena got impatient \"Hurry up Apollo!.\" She yelled at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it! I'm thinking.\" He said and went back to thinking it over<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena got bored \"Five seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Apollo gasped as sh caught him of guard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four, Three, two..\" Athena counted down with a grin on her face and her finger getting closer to the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait a second!\" Apollo shouted at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One!\" Athena said as she pointed randomly at one of the girls and swapped Apollo with one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant Apollo found himself beyond the police lines and in a new body. He looked down at himself. Ignoring than two unfamiliar bumps on his chest, he saw he was wearing a lab coat, a green button up shirt, and a pair of brown pants. It was obvious he was now in Ema's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to head outside the crime scene to get Athena. He got a few strange looks as it looked like the lead detective in charge of the case was leaving early. He made his way out to where Athena and his body were. To his surprise Athena was standing next to his unconscious body. He quickly ran over to check on his body. \"What happened? Did she faint?\" He asked Athena<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, she didn't faint. I flipped her and knocked her out!\" Athena said cheerfully. Which got a glare from Apollo \"I had to, what if she screamed or something? People would have thought that you were crazy, I know I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo put his face in his hands. He really should have expected that. \"Please tell me that you didn't accidentally break my arm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I make no promises.\" Athena told him. \"C'mon, we better get investigating.\"</span></div></div>",

It didn't <i>seem</i> like there were any major injuries, but he dreaded the inevitable switch back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop worrying 'Detective Skye',\" Athena said as she slapped an uncomfortable Apollo on the back, \"Apollo will be fiiiiine. We have an investigation to do! Forensics and all that right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right,\" Apollo replied unhappily. <i>'This better be worth it...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour's worth of investigation later, Apollo and Athena managed to fill their court record with blood samples, fingerprints, shoeprints, and whatever other evidence they could find using Ema's tools. Apollo had to admit, the purse was embarrassing at first, but it's contents were useful. It was especially nice having Ema's trinkets at hand without having to convince her to help ahead of time. Being a woman was bit... strange, but unlimited freedom at the crime scene was amazing. Just a shame he had to suffer a judo flip to make it workable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, Apollo was beginning to worry about his body they had just left behind outside the scene. He hoped there wouldn't be anything serious when he switched back; the fact that his body was unconscious especially worried him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Athena,\" he said in Ema's voice, \"I think we need to switch me back now. I don't want to risk losing track of my body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure. That labcoat looks so good on you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously - if I'm going to need a crutch I ought to do it now rather than later,\" Apollo said, no longer joking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena turned her eyes down, looking guilty. \"Alright, here's the remote. I'm sure we'll get to look at the scene the normal way soon anyways,\" she said as she handed him the device. She then immediately cheered back up and said, \"next time though, I switch with Detective Skye! I really like her hair.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you'll need to get someone else to judo flip you,\" Apollo said idly as he walked out of the police barricade again to the bench where they left his body. He was thrust into this by Athena, and it really felt like he was violating Ema's privacy, even if he was just her for an hour, he was worried that he was 'experiencing' too much for comfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the bench though, was his body still there? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He clapped a hand over Ema's face as his expression contorted in shock. <i>'Oh God no!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked left to right, \"where could she have gone!?\" Surely she wouldn't have gone far of her own accord, right? If she went looking for her own body, then she'd most likely stay around the crime scene. He looked around, left to right, in a panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Skye, what are you searching for?\" the female officer from earlier asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A man was here on this bench! Red suit, red hair, did you see him?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop seemed a bit frightened about how frazzled 'Ema' was over this. \"Uh, well, the man was sleeping on the bench, and no matter what I did, he wouldn't wake up. So, I called the ambulance - they're taking him over to the Hickfield clinic.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Dammit!</i>' Someone must have noticed his unconscious body and called for help. Athena really overdid the throw. He wasn't going to let her hear the end of this, but first he had to get his body back. Not bothering to get Athena, he rushed over to the nearest police car. \"Detective, what are you doing?\" the officer  asked, confused at the detective's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to go to the hospital,\" Apollo said. Fishing for an excuse, he quickly thought one up, \"I found some important evidence, and I'm going to interview the victim once she wakes up. It's urgent.\" Hesitant to argue with a superior, the cop just nodded as Apollo turned the keys and drove to the ER, turning on sirens as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo didn't actually <i>own</i> a car, so his driving skills were rather rusty. Thankfully, the siren pulled through. Traffic moved aside for him as he used Ema's body to rush after the ambulance. Parking outside, he hurried into the clinic, clearly not used to running with his new center of balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Detective Skye, with the police,\" Apollo said as he awkwardly fished Ema's police badge out of her coat pocket, flashing it to the lady at the desk. \"I need to see a man who got brought here recently - he was found on a park bench?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was a bit taken aback by the sudden entrance of a cop, but she complied and looked through the files. \"Ah yes! His ID said he was a Mr. Apollo Justice?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo smiled, grateful, \"yes! Is he okay? I need to see him immediately.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady signaled for a doctor and inquired about the condition of Apollo' body. The doctor turned to Apollo-as-Ema and informed him that his body had just woken up as they entered the building, and that...</span></div></div>",

She probably had at least a concussion - he'd just look crazy if he started babbling about body swaps to her! <i>'I just... have to play it off until her memories come back,'</i> he realized. It was only once she was in her right mind that he could delineate what happened. She would certainly not be very <i>happy </i>with him after all of that, but it was the best he could do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes!\" Apollo replied, stepping forward with a hand outstretched. \"I'm, uh, Ema,\" he explained, \"I'm a detective. I was nearby when you were hurt, but...\" Apollo paused. He needed to spin this, \"...we're actually best friends!\" The case hadn't even started and he was already caught in a bluff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Ema replied, rubbing the back of her head. \"You do look familiar...\" she mumbled. \"Er, if its not too much trouble, what's my name again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, you're Apollo Justice, a lawyer,\" Apollo told her as he nervously put his hands in the pockets of Ema's lab coat. \"You're partner got a bit reckless and accidentally knocked you over. Don't worry though, you'll be fine!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma shook her head a bit, \"I'm just not recalling anything, but something feels off. Are you sure I'm an attorney?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Positive! Just say it with me - 'I'm Apollo Justice and I'm fine!'\" Apollo shouted with Ema's voice. \"It always makes you feel better! Just let it rip!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma cleared her throat. \"I'm Apollo Justice and I'm fine!\" There was a brief moment of silence before Ema shook her head, \"I don't know Ema, I didn't get much out of that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to walk you out of here, okay?\" Apollo suggested. \"I'll take you back to my- I mean your, office, and we'll have Athena watch after you. Just, follow me, please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so, Athena, its very important that you keep a close eye on <i>Apollo</i> until he gets back all of his memories. <i>Okay</i>?\" Apollo concluded, after explaining the situation to Athena back at the Wright Anything Agency. He was glaring daggers at her from Ema's body, while Ema herself was taking inventory of the messy lobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena nodded nervously, \"uh, of course Detective Skye. Trucy and I will take very good care of him.\" She ran her hands through her ponytail nervously, clearly hearing the anger in Apollo's voice. It was her brutal methods that caused this whole scenario, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for her, Ema's phone began to ring, playing the theme song to <i>Pink Princess</i>. Apollo fished it out of Ema's bag and looked at it with a grimace, \"great, its Gavin.\" Without hesitating, he clicked a button and hung up the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're already getting into character pretty well, right?\" Athena said jokingly, trying to ease the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo turned his attention back to Athena. \"I have to run back to the crime scene, but I'll have more words for you later. You're going to have to handle this case in court tomorrow, and I won't be able to help you as the detective, so be prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena winced at the thought, but nodded nervously. \"Er, don't worry! I'll be fine, probably.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo just shook his head, and turned his attention back to Ema in his body. \"Uh, Apollo, I have to go now, but Trucy will watch after you! If Athena gives you trouble, just call me, okay?\" he said, trying to sound assuring as he thwacked Athena in the head before waving goodbye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, bye Detective Skye! I'll be fine... I think?\" </span></div></div>",

Looking down, he still saw Juniper's body and the dress she had been wearing when they swapped. Did Juniper miss? Maybe she pressed the wrong button? Was this actually his body, but he just couldn't tell because Juniper had performed an unaware swap or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fears were unfounded, however. There was a reason why he was still in Juniper's body, but it wasn't because Juniper had pressed the wrong button, as Apollo was about to find out. He suddenly heard his own body scream, and with his chords of steel, the scream was loud enough that Apollo found himself actually having to cover his ears. His body seemed to be staring at Athena, a terrified look in its eyes. It was then that he noticed Athena was also covering her ears, a somewhat guilty look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena turned to look at him, slowly lowering her hands from her ears, and said just one word; \"Oops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo's jaw dropped as he realised what had happened. In her haste to swap back, Juniper had accidentally targeted Athena instead of him. Which meant that now he was still in Juniper's body, she was in Athena's body, and Athena was in his body. That would explain the screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either he or Juniper could say anything, Athena, in Apollo's body, yelled again. \"What's going on!? Why am I standing over there!? Why am I Apollo!?\" She didn't seem to be taking the swap as well as Juniper had when she and Apollo had first swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Athena, calm down, it's going to be okay,\" Apollo said, trying to do his best to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem to work. \"Junie!? You're in on this too!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, actually, I'm Apollo.\" Apollo tried to break the news to her as lightly as possible, and failed miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena went silent, her jaw dropping as she looked back and forth between Apollo and Juniper in her body. \"Then, you,\" she mumbled, pointing at Juniper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper nodded, \"I'm really Juniper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena looked almost ready to faint. \"I think I need to sit down.\" She sat in silence for a moment, breathing deeply in an attempt to calm herself down. In the meantime, Apollo and Juniper looked at each other awkwardly, not really sure what to say. Juniper still had a bit of a guilty look on her face, knowing she had caused this, even if it was by accident. Athena, having finally calmed down a bit, said, \"Alright, you guys had better start explaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo explained the situation to Athena, just like he had to Juniper before. This time, though, he had to add on the part about swapping with Juniper and everything. Juniper also added her own comments to the explanation. Athena sat silent through the entire story, listening to every word, occasionally looking down at the remote she had found in her hand when was suddenly swapping into Apollo's body. How does Athena react once they're done explaining?</span></div></div>",

Then again, he supposed he'd be concerned too if one of his best friends suddenly started acting differently for seemingly no reason. It would probably be best to just pretend to go home to put Athena's worries to rest, and then actually go back to the Wright Anything Agency and swap back with Juniper so he could handle this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay 'Thena,\" he said, remembering to use the nickname that Juniper referred to Athena as this time. \"I guess I haven't really been feeling like myself today.\" He held in a smirk after saying that. Athena had no idea how true that really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just get some rest, and I'll talk to you later, okay?\" Apollo was glad to see Athena seemed to have calmed down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo saw Athena start walking off in the direction of the detention center, pulling out her phone as she went. Hopefully Juniper would be able to imitate him well enough over the phone, and Athena wouldn't end up concerned about his well-being as well. With Athena on her way, Apollo also left Global Studios, heading towards the Wright Anything Agency. With any luck, he should be back into his own body soon, working on a new case, and Juniper could go home, back in her own body as well. He hadn't gotten to spend that much time in Juniper's body, thanks to Athena dragging him off to Global Studios, but it didn't really matter right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally making it back to the office, Apollo knocked on the door, before seeing if it was unlocked. With a quick turn of the handle, Apollo was inside the office, hoping to see Juniper and swap back.</span></div></div>",

To his surprise, the office was actually completely devoid of human life. Apollo started to get worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juniper?\" he called out, hoping she was just in the bathroom or something. He received silence in response. \"Juniper?\" he asked again, his voice sounding a little more panicked this time, and he started searching around the office. He checked every room, multiple times, but it was no use; Juniper was nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo sat down on the office couch, taking deep breaths in an attempt to calm down, feeling the steady rise and fall of Juniper's chest as he did so. He tried to think about why Juniper would have left the office. Athena had called who she thought was Apollo to tell him about the case, but Juniper wouldn't have actually gone down to the detention center, would she? Thinking back to what he had told Juniper when the two of them first swapped, he remembered his reasons for the swap in the first place; to take the day off. Sure, he had only meant to get away from all the paperwork Mr. Wright had loaded him up with, and once he found out about Mr. Powers getting arrested he wanted to get back into his own body and investigate, but Juniper didn't know that. Had she left to go meet Athena at the detention center just to make sure Apollo still got his day off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Apollo was worried not only about himself being stuck as Juniper, but also about Juniper trying to handle the investigation. Sure, Juniper was studying at Themis Academy, but she hadn't actually graduated yet, and she was studying to become a judge, not a lawyer. She would be way out of her element here, and Apollo was sure Athena would be able to pick up on that fairly quickly, just like she had picked up on his odd behavior earlier. Apollo had wanted to use the remote to finally find some time to relax, and yet all it had brought was more stress. If he wasn't so worried about what was going on, he might have laughed at the irony of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up once more, pacing around the room as he considered his options. He and Juniper needed to swap back as soon as possible. Sure, he had told Athena that he'd be heading home and relaxing, and Athena might not appreciate that he had lied to her, but this seemed a lot more important right now. He'd just have to head down to the detention center, and hopefully Athena and Juniper would still be there, and then he and Juniper could swap back. There was only one problem with that plan; he had left the remote here at the office when he left in Juniper's body. Without that, he'd be unable to do anything about this situation. He may as well just continuing with his day off, an idea which seemed very appealing right now. He shook his head, dismissing those thoughts, not wanting to leave Juniper stuck doing the investigation in his place. He started searching amongst all paperwork on his desk, hoping that Juniper had left the remote here when she left.</span></div></div>",

He collapsed back down onto the couch, letting out a big sigh. Juniper must have taken it with her when she left. It made sense, he had told her not to lose it, after all. That made things even more complicated. If he had the remote, he could have swapped back with Juniper while still staying out of sight of Athena. After how worried she'd been about him back at Global Studios, he really didn't want her worrying even more, nor did he want her to know he had lied about going home and relaxing. Juniper would be the one dealing with the consequences after they swapped back, so Apollo didn't want to mess up her friendship with Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only there was a way to get to Juniper, and the remote, without getting Athena involved. But how? After a few minutes of coming up with nothing, the office phone caught Apollo's eye. Of course, his phone! Athena had called Juniper on the way over the the detention center, so it seemed likely that Juniper still had his mobile phone with her. If he could call her and get her to come back to the office while Athena kept investigating, they'd be able to sort this whole thing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly running over the the phone, kicking around some of Trucy's magic stuff that had been left around the office as he did so, Apollo dialed the number of his mobile phone and held the receiver up to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of ringing, he eventually head his own voice from the other side of the call. \"Hello?\" he heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juniper, it's me,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause, before Juniper spoke again, sounding somewhat muffled, as if she wasn't talking directly into the phone. \"I've got to take this call, I'll be back in a second.\" She seemed to be doing a pretty good job of imitating him. After some sounds that indicated she was leaving whatever room she was in, she said, \"Hi Apollo.\" Her voice seemed quiet, almost like she was whispering. She was probably at the detention center, and didn't want other people hearing this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juniper, I'm sorry about this. I didn't think a case would come up while we were swapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You know about the case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I, uh, ran into Athena while I was wating at the bus stop. She took me to Global Studios, and that's where we found out about Mr. Powers' arrest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So you haven't really gotten to relax on your day off, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't really matter right now. Do you have the remote with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You told me not to lose it, so I took it with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo let out a sigh of relief, knowing that Juniper still had the remote and it wasn't actually lost. \"Okay, good. If you come back to the office, we can swap back, and then I'll take over the investigation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Juniper seemed surprised to hear Apollo asking to swap back. \"I thought we swapped so you could have the day off, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, but that was when it was just paperwork that I had to do. Now that Athena and I have an actual case, I really should get back to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I can handle this, if you want, and you can just relax today. We can swap back tonight and I'll fill you in on how the investigation went.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo frowned. Was Juniper trying to convince him to not swap back? It certainly seemed that way, but Apollo wasn't really sure why. Maybe she was actually enjoying being in his body and didn't want to swap back yet. Apollo almost wished he felt the same way about her body, but he hadn't really had much time to get used to it with the case springing up so suddenly. He still wasn't sure whether Juniper could handle doing the investigation in his place, and do a good enough job of it to fool Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think it would be better if we swapped back and I did the investigation myself. That way, there's less of a chance of Athena finding out about the swap.\"</span></div></div>",

The only time Athena thought something was wrong was when I called her 'Thena by mistake.\" Juniper explained to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo felt a bit bad. He had done a horrible job a pretending to be Juniper when he was out and Juniper had apparently done a pretty good job at being him. Maybe he should let her handle the investigation for today? \"Are you sure you're okay doing this?\" He asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I took some extra classes on investigating crime scenes. Robin and Hugh also talks to me about what they learn. I'll be fine. 'I'm fine'\" She said, imitating Apollo at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Juniper imitate his usual phrase was, unnerving to say the least. Apollo thought about what to do. It really seemed like Juniper wanted to stay as him for the day, but he couldn't just leave the investigation to someone else. After thinking it over for a minute or so, he decided to let her stay as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but call me as soon as you are done so we can swap back.\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Apollo. I'll investigate as good as I can.

This time though, he knew there was a case he should be working on that Juniper was taking care of for him. It was hard to get his mind off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Apollo, you can do this,\" he told himself. \"Just relax and enjoy the day like Juniper wanted you to.\" He let out a small laugh, realised what he had said. He was still calling himself Apollo, but he wasn't really Apollo anymore. As far as the rest of the world was concerned, he was Juniper Woods. It was an odd thought to say the least, but Apollo thought that perhaps if he focused on who he was right now, rather than who he really was inside, perhaps it'd help him take his mind off the case. Taking a page out of his usual Chords of Steel routine, Apollo shouted, \"I'm Juniper Woods, and I'm fi-\" He was cut off as he broke into a coughing fit. It seemed Juniper's voice wasn't ready for something like that. \"Bad idea,\" he said to himself as he recovered, before stepping outside and heading back to the bus stop he'd been waiting at before Athena dragged him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he'd been running around in Juniper's body practically all day, Apollo still felt strange to be walking around in public like this. He could feel the wind blowing around the light fabric of Juniper's dress, and her long braid pulling down on the back of his head. It was all rather strange, but none of it particularly unpleasant. He'd just need to get used to it. Thankfully, this time the bus arrived before anyone came and dragged him away, and he was able to get on without anyone recognising him. After how he'd struggled to pretend to be Juniper while talking to Athena, he didn't really want to go through that again. Apollo mostly occupied himself during the bus ride by playing around with Juniper's dress and hair. It still fascinated him that he was actually in someone else's body, and those were the parts he could mess around with without attracting unwanted attention or violating Juniper's privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for him to reach his destination. The bus dropped him off at a stop near Juniper's house, the forest she lived near not too far in the distance. He headed off towards the forest, after first making sure he had Juniper's phone with him so she could contact him after the investigation.</span></div></div>",

Today had been a pretty good day. He had finally been able to get away from the stress of his job, and the worries that had been brought on by the shenanigans earlier with Athena. He had also gotten a lot more used to being in Juniper's body during the day, although he still assumed he'd probably fail if he needed to imitate her in front of people she knew. He actually wouldn't mind doing this again some time, if his job got a little too stressful, provided Juniper was okay with it, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now, it was time to get back to his own body. Juniper had called him a couple minutes ago to tell him that she and Athena had finished investigating for the day. Athena had apparently left to walk Trucy home, since Mr. Wright was currently off in Kurain, before heading home herself, while \"Apollo\" had been left to close up the office. He almost laughed at how typical it was that he had been the one left to finish up work, but right now he was glad about it, because it meant he and Juniper could swap back and go over the details from the case without any interruptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the bus came, practically empty at this time of day, and Apollo rode back into town. From there, it was just a small walk to the office. He knocked on the door, before opening it up and stepping inside.</span></div></div>",

Along with Juniper, who was still in his body, Athena was also there. Apollo could only guess that she had returned to the office after walking Trucy home. He didn't know for what reason she had returned, but that didn't matter. What mattered was that she was here, and that created complications for him and Juniper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Junie? What are you doing here?\" she asked, noticing Apollo standing at the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um...\" Apollo stumbled over his words, struggling to think of an excuse that wouldn't arouse suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Juniper managed to come to his rescue before Athena could notice anything. \"Oh, Juniper,\" she said, walking towards the door, holding a bag in her hand. \"You left this here this morning, I thought you might want it back.\" On closer inspection, Apollo recognised it as the bag Juniper had used to bring him the food this morning. He also noticed that Juniper seemed much more confident than she had been when he left this morning. Either she was just a very good actress, or being in his body was having that sort of effect on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been given a way out, Apollo decided to simply play along for the time being. \"Oh, thank you. I was actually here to get that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you could have just stopped by in the morning. We normally close the office around this time of night,\" Athena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right. I probably should have thought of that.\" The smile on Athena's face didn't go unnoticed by Apollo. He guessed he was probably doing a better job at imitating Juniper this time. Although he was ready to swap back now, he was at least glad he wasn't making Athena worry anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper handed him the bag, but as he did so, he saw her mouth the word \"Sorry.\" Since he was facing towards the office, he wouldn't really be able to mouth anything back without Athena seeing, so Apollo merely responded with a small nod. She seemed to get the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I should get going,\" Apollo said, turning to leave the office again, unfortunately still in Juniper's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye,\" Juniper said, still playing the role of \"Apollo\", and playing it well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya!\" Athena shout, waving goodbye as she was none the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside, Apollo pulled out Juniper's phone again, and began typing up a text message as he walked. It read, \"Meet up at my place, we can talk and swap back there. My address is in my wallet.\" Sending the message to his own phone number, Apollo continued walking back to his apartment, hoping Athena wouldn't keep Juniper back too long.</span></div></div>",

His face contorted into a frown - he was pretty sure he knew who this was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well! It's probably nothing,\" he said loudly as he sauntered over to that side of the room and sat down on the box. The box began to shake more, but Apollo didn't budge. Eventually, he could hear grunting as the figure underneath the box began to cry out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off!\" A distinctly female voice shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Apollo shouted sarcastically as he got up. \"I'm sorry about that Myriam - didn't notice you there at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of <i>course</i> you didn't,\" Myriam declared as she got up, box still covering her torso. \"Not with my new box! TVs are always in demand, no one would consider such a box out of place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo just gave an exasperated sigh. \"What are you doing here Myriam? You don't need a lawyer, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'm here investigating,\" she announced. \"I want to know all about the new Wright Law office! Mr. Wright is a bit of a legend among attorneys; his return to the field with the UR-1 case is big news. I'd be a fool to ignore the chance to get a scoop on the new Wright Law Office!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo just stared at her blankly. \"You already had the connection via Juniper, you could have just asked for an interview.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyriam was quiet for a moment. That thought hadn't occurred to her apparently. \"...can I get an interview with Mr. Wright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Apollo responded, \"he's not in right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what about Ms. Cykes!\" she asked again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still no,\" Apollo answered, \"she's also out at the moment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what about you, Mr. Justice!\" she asked. \"You're Mr. Wright's protege, that's like, pretty close to getting an interview with him. Pleeeeeease?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo stopped and thought about it. <i>Well... she's sort of an arbitrary choice,</i> Apollo realized as he fiddled the device around in his hand. <i>I suppose that means there's no consequence if it doesn't work atleast.</i> Apollo turned his attention back to Myriam and asked \"how about something more than an interview. What would you say if I could give you a true, in-depth, undercover look at the office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyriam became so excited she threw her box into the air, briefly revealing her face. \"<i>Really</i>?!\" she shouted, her voice clear for a moment before the box fell back over her body. \"You would do that for me?!\" She didn't even seem to notice the box's little adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, just hold still,\" he said as he lifted the remote and clicked one of the buttons.</span></div></div>",

How did you even do this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter how,\" Apollo responded, putting his hands on his hips, \"the point is it worked,\" He was rather glad she seemed to forget about the device for the moment.\"Anyways, you enjoy your journalism. I'm going to take the day off,\" Apollo told her as he walked towards the door in her body. \"I'll be back by 6! Don't worry, most of the paperwork is done. Just try to relax.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyriam looked like a deer in headlights as Apollo left the office. He couldn't believe he just did that, but he had to admit, it was fun getting back at a troublesome witness like that. Once he was outside, he realized he was still wearing her ridiculous box, which he threw off quickly... a number of pens, notebooks, and the like tumbling out immediately. \"Atleast she didn't put her laptop in it,\" he noted. The remote was still in his hands, and he realized she didn't have pockets with her uniform. \"Why can't she just carry a purse like a normal girl? Ugh. Well, I'm going to need to stash the remote SOMEWHERE.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his watch, Apollo reasoned that Themis would still be open for a bit, since extracurriculars were always underway there. Myriam probably had a locker or a safe spot to put the device in the journalism clubroom. She was the only member, so it wasn't like anyone would steal it. Alternatively, Apollo figured he could trust it to someone he knew. Having Trucy or Athena aware of the situation, while a bit embarrassing, would at least give him someone to keep an eye on Myriam in his body. He sure as hell wasn't going to wear that box all around town was all he knew. </span></div></div>",

Yah, life was going great for the young prosecuting rock star. However he was having one major problem. He wrote up a new song for the Gavinners, however it just didn't feel like it fit him. The song's lyrics felt like such a huge contrast from his voice and singing style. Sure his fans would most likely enjoy it, but he also wanted to be satisfied with it. He didn't think he could preform it. He didn't want to scrap the song either, he was proud of it. This was a major dilemma for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought about what to do he noticed the package left by his door. Probably a gift from some adoring fangirl. He put the package on his table and bean to open it up, wouldn't want to disappoint a fan after all. He found the remote inside and read the instructions throughly. Oh, thank gott for fans. This was the answer to his problem! He had no doubt this remote would work, after all, why would a fan send him some junk? He could use the remote to change his voice for the sake of preforming his song! It would be simple. Do an unaware swap with someone he sees often, preform a concert with that persons body, and swap back next time he sees them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the most important part of the plan, who to swap with. There was that Fraulein detective Ema, Klavier smirked at the mere image of her body doing a concert. One of his other choices would be Herr Forehead, as cringing as it was to imagine having his hairstyle, his 'Cord of Steel' voice would be a change. Another choice would be that magic Fraulein that was always around Herr forehead, her childishly innocent voice would certainly be a huge contrast with his normal voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some careful thinking Klavier decided on swapping with...</span></div></div>",

He was a lot shorter than usual, His hair was not as long, And of course the biggest shift, his gender and clothes. He felt a lot colder now, Trucy's magician outfit didn't cover his sleeves and the fact that most of his legs were exposed didn't help with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlavier looked over to where his body was and saw something he never wanted to see again. His body was acting just like Trucy. \"C'mon daddy! If we don't eat fast we'll keep Polly waiting!\" Trucy said as she hugged Phoenix. Klavier couldn't stand watching his body act like that and decided to leave before he puked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlavier made his way to his car and pulled out a hand mirror that he brought with him everywhere just in case he got dirty. To his amazement in the mirror he saw Trucy's reflection. He had her, well, he had her everything. He took off the heavy magician's hat and drove back to his home, he had some practicing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got home he went to his recording studio, grabbed his guitar and began to practice for the concert in three days. After a few hours of rehearsing, rewriting, and reworking the melody of his new song he thought he was ready. Klavier went to a full body mirror he kept around his home at all times and began to talk to himself in it \"We rocked Fraulein! If I just practice this a few hours a day for the next few days I should have it down.\" He said to himself. While standing at the mirror he had a chance to take his body and clothes into account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurcy's magician outfit was not fit for a rockstar to wear, Klavier needed to change. He headed to his closet and found to his shock that all his clothes had been replaced with clothes that Trucy would normally wear, mostly magician's clothing. This was probably a side-effect of the swap. Klavier began to think, he could easily buy some clothes that could make his current body more rockin', but the more he thought about it changing the little Fraulein's image felt like a breech of her privacy, even if it wasn't her image or clothing right now.

For one thing he didn't feel like he was a good enough boyfriend for Maggey, she was great and deserved a man who could actually afford a relationship. Another thing that led to his depressed state was that Mr. Edgeworth has had less and less work to give him nowadays, sure there was some things he had to do, but that wasn't nearly enough. Gumshoe didn't have the techniques that Edgeworth's other assistants did. Kay had the replication thingy, Ema had that stuff to see blood, and Judge Courtney was just as smart as him. All Gumshoe had was a metal detector and his trusty fishing pole. Gumshoe pouted and went to sit on Edgeworth's couch. He looked around at all the things Edgeworth had, man he must be rich. All Gumshoe could afford was ramen, and yet his closest friend/co-worker/idol was loaded and living comfortably. Gumshoe decided to look around the office and at Edgeworth's stuff, Surely Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't mind as long as nothing was broken! Gumshoe saw an unopened package laying by the door, he must have not seen it when he came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.....\" Gumshoe let out as he thought about opening it. \"Packages arrive in the mornin' and It's almost noon now, So if Mr. Edgeworth didn't open it already, that must mean he doesn't want it!\" He exclaimed as he took the package and ripped it open. \"Ooooh! A T.V remote! Man, Mr. Edgeworth has everything!\" He said, not even bothering to look at the instruction booklet. Gumshoe looked around for a T.V. Thankfully he found a tiny emergency one in a cabinet. Gumshoe turned it on and it was on a news station. \"Time to see how this baby works!\" Gumshoe said and pressed a button without looking at what it was. Nothing Happened. He tried again, nothing. and again, and again, and again. After about twenty tries he gave up \"What's the matter with this thing?\" He said scratching his head. He looked at the buttons, one said aware and the other said unaware. \"What, are these some kind of channel names?\" He asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty more minutes of trying to figure out how to change the channel with the remote Gumshoe decided to read the instructions. To his amazement it was a body swap remote. Gumshoe fantasized at the possibilities, he could become closer to Edgeworth by swapping with one of his other partners! He could swap himself with Edgeworth and enjoy the life of a rich man! He could even become a better man for Maggey! Gumshoe was practically hopping with excitement!</span></div></div>",

But then, he supposed it wasn't <i>his</i> salary at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly breaking away from the investigation, Gumshoe made his way back to his little 'vantage point' between some trees a bit off the trail. He was lucky the investigation was at Gourd Lake - otherwise there may have been fewer places to hide. What he found was rather surprising - his own body was unconscious! Poor Ema must have fainted from the shock. Gumshoe noticed the device was just a foot away, and decided to quickly pick it up and put it in the pocket of his new lab coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh,\" Gumshoe mumbled. How was he going to get her... or him, up? \"Wait! I ought to have something, I'm Ema Skye after all,\" he realized with some satisfaction. Reaching into Ema's purse, Gumshoe found a number of tools and items until he found what he was looking for: smelling salts! He put them up to Ema's nose, and her eyes slowly opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh lord, what an awful dream...\" she mumbled before her eyes bugged out. A hand shot to her throat. \"Was that- Ah! It's not a dream!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah woah! Calm down pal!\" Gumshoe exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" she shouted again, realizing her own body was talking to her. \"This- this isn't scientific at all! Who are you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ema, its me - Gumshoe!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of explaining, Ema finally calmed down a bit. The... unscientific nature of it all still bothered her, but she found a way to suspend her disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing is still bothering me though, Detective,\" she said. \"Why would you swap with me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well,\" Gumshoe stalled a moment. Upon reflection, his motives were a bit desperate, but he didn't want to back away now. \"You're always talking about how you want to be a detective, right!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be a forensic investigator, Detective!\" She responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, being a detective is close!\" Gumshoe said, hands on his hips. \"It's all investigation after all, and its still law enforcement. I figured you would like the chance to work law enforcement first hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma's eyes seemed to light up from Gumshoe's body. \"Really? You'd let me do that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Not a lot of kids are as dedicated to justice as you. You deserve it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Thanks Detective Gumshoe!\" She bought the excuse hook, line, and sinker it seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now follow me.

An important museum piece was taken late last night, and a vehicle that was seen leaving the premises was found abandoned at the lake.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma nodded, having already gotten the details prior; Gumshoe-as-Ema was pretty grateful for the refresher, on the other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The license plate was removed and at first it seemed like no evidence was left in the vehicle, but with Ema's help, the other investigators and I managed to acquire some fingerprints,\" he continued. \"I'm going to need you to take these to the precinct and find a match. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" Ema as Gumshoe exclaimed with a smile and a thumbs up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth raised and eyebrow but brushed it aside. \"Excellent. I am going to return to the museum. Once you find a match, come back as quickly as possible.\" He handed the envelope with the evidence over to \"Gumshoe\", who quickly left the scene to head to the precinct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they parted ways with Ema, Edgeworth addressed his young assistant. \"I won't ask you to accompany me further , as a criminal case might be dangerous, but you have been very helpful Ema. If you wish to continue investigating with me, I will give no objections.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe smiled brightly at this. \"Of course I'll go with you!\" The two of them then got into Edgeworth's car and drove to the crime scene to continue their investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The case was almost over before Ema came back with before unseen blood samples that managed to finally incriminate the thief and successfully put him behind bars. Gumshoe was kind of miffed he didn't think of it himself; to think that he was shown up by someone using his own body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two did excellently,\" Edgeworth suddenly said, turning to his two assistants. Both Gumshoe and Ema, still in each other's bodies, beamed at the compliment. \"You did especially well, Gumshoe. I admit I did not expect you to pull through as well as you did,\" he continued, patting Ema-as-Gumshoe on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Well, I suppose Ema atleast won me some points with Edgeworth,'</i> Gumshoe noted.<i>'That'll be good when I get back to normal.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group disbanded, Gumshoe approached Ema. \"So kid, how was it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was awesome!\" Ema proclaimed. \"Being an old guy - no offense - was weird, but having access to all of that stuff at the police department and having authority was great! I even got to save the case!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it,\" Gumshoe responded, a bit crestfallen at the 'old' comment. \"You ready to turn back now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma seemed a bit hesitant to respond. she began to rub the back of her head for a moment before speaking. \"Actually, I wanted to ask a favor. Could we stay like this, just for another day a or two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe was shocked. \"What - why?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because working at the station was really interesting, and you're the only person who'd be cool enough to let me do something like this. I doubt anyone else would let me use their body to work at the station like you did. So please, what do you say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe pondered it for a second. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to stay this way for another day? After all, Edgeworth took well to it. What does he do?</span></div></div>",

You won't regret it Detective!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWit that, the two of them parted ways. As Ema explained, she was staying with relatives in the states over the summer, so he went to the address she gave him on a slip of paper. Thankfully, her family members seemed quiet, and gave Gumshoe little trouble as he made his way to his new room. He doubted his ability to really imitate Ema in front of people who knew her well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow alone in her room, Gumshoe pondered his next move. He fished through Ema's purse and reproduced the remote he had stashed there earlier. \"Atleast I still have you. Now what to do...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly occurred to Gumshoe that he was in a much younger body, and suddenly female. He searched the room, eventually finding a mirror. \"Got so wrapped up in the investigation I almost forgot about the body...\" He realized that Ema was a slight bit older than he gave her credit for; she was probably around 19 or so now that he looked closely. Still, she was much younger than he was. She also DRESSED much differently, wearing a skirt and labcoat, most notably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at his reflection with a blank face, trying to avoid the awkward reality that he'd have to change her clothes or bathe EVENTUALLY. He lifted the coat and smelled it; \"I am a bit grimy after the lake...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe took the coat off and draped it over a chair for the moment. He was unsure of how to proceed, and his new reflection in the mirror was stressing him out about it. He had to admit, he was curious to look further at his body, but it just felt awfully rude. Ema was younger than he was, and it all just seemed ungentlemanly. She was the one who wanted to stay this way however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe considered his options. He could just get over it, and go about cleaning his body off, or he could use the remote again. There was an unaware swap function - he could possibly grab a more comfortable body and just use that until the time being that he could swap back to his own. What did he do? </span></div></div>",

Well, it'd be irresponsible to do it a SECOND time.\" <i>'At least Ema sorta gave permission after the fact.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was barely even 9:00, but Gumshoe didn't really know what to do in his current situation. He wanted to put off showering, but he lacked any clue as to what Ema did in her free time. Did she have friends? Did she work out? There were a plethora of books scattered around, all science related, and Gumshoe felt they would just hurt his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else really coming to mind, Gumshoe decided to just go to sleep. He realized, with some relief, that Ema wouldn't have school as it was summer. And since he was in her body, he wouldn't have to go to work either. \"I'll just use this as an opportunity to sleep-in,\" Gumshoe decides as he undid Ema's hair, letting it fall loose to his new shoulders. He wasn't exactly in sleeping attire, but he decided it was okay to just sleep in what Ema was wearing for tonight. He'd worry about changing tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight shone in one Gumshoe's face as he slowly pulled himself out of bed. He let out a long yawn before giving a startled jump at his high-pitched voice. He threw the covers off and looked down, suddenly remembering his exchange with Ema. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This was a crazy thing to do!\" He exclaimed. \"Could've sworn it was all just a dream... too late to regret it now I guess.\" He pulled himself out of bed and looked at the clock. 11:37 a.m. \"Suppose I got a good night's sleep out of it for what it's worth. Lets hope Ema is doing okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe once again went over to Ema's full-body mirror, and looked at his reflection. Now Ema seemed like a mess. Her clothes (a button up shirt and a blue skirt) were all messy and wrinkled, her hair was wild and skewed, and the smell of the lake was beginning to catch up with him. He stared begrudgingly for a second before cracking. \"<i>Fine</i>! I'll clean myself off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe searched through Ema's drawers and found a new set of clothes - his face red by the time he was done. Fortunately, he managed to find a  n outfit that he felt comfortable with. A simple pair of black pants and a white button up shirt. He also found an extra towel, which he wrapped around his face to act as a sort of blindfold as he undertook the task of showering. Undressing was still immensely strange to him, however, and the ... feeling of the water was strange as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully I won't need to do this a second time,\" Gumshoe muttered as he eventually exited the shower, wrapping a second towel around Ema's body. Dressing with the makeshift blindfold was, in itself, a chore too. Ema's clothes were very foreign too him (why would he ever need a bra!?) so it took quite some effort to finally get it all together. By the time he was done and ready to throw off the blindfold, he felt he had learned far too much by touch alone, and that the blindfold probably amplified the whole nonsense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoroughly uncomfortable, he turned to the mirror. \"Hmm, something out of place,\" he wondered what it was for a moment, \"ah! The hair. I guess I'll tie it for her.\" Gumshoe then found the hair tie from last night and bound her hair up, but it still seemed wrong to him. Then it struck him, \"The lab coat! That's it!\" Searching Ema's closet, he eventually found a line of white coats, donning one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hair is still a bit scruffy, but otherwise I reckon I did a decent job of it,\" Gumshoe noted, as he looked himself over. Seeing the complete picture, he was vaguely proud of his work, almost forgetting the embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he had to figure out what to do with the rest of the day, however. He could go to the station and track down Ema, to make sure she was doing okay, or he could just take the day off and go elsewhere. What did young people do these days? It might be a nice experience to just cut back and enjoy an afternoon as someone else, even if it was a young girl. </span></div></div>",

Just a day to get outside and relax! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked the device off Ema's desk. He didn't intend to lose it, but felt it best to keep hold of it.

Smiling, Gumshoe stopped rowing for a moment, and took the chance to lean back, looking up at the clouds. It had been a long time since he had the chance to just relax down like this. \"I suppose switching with Ema <i>was</i> worth it,\" he noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe closed his eyes, and decided to take a little nap out on the lake like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit later, Gumshoe began to row back to the shore. It was about 4:00 by that point. He walked over to the cabin that rented out the boats and gave the oars back to the manager. Mr.... Burtz? Gumshoe could've sworn he met the guy once, but he doubted it was important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe sighed as he walked away. \"I suppose I should go check on Ema now,\" he grumbled. Despite being Ema, he was beginning to enjoy the swap - it was kind of a let down to think it would come to an end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pulled out Ema's cell phone, however, he noticed someone out in the distance. It was Edgeworth's other assistant, Kay Faraday, apparently out for a walk. <i>'Nice to see she doesn't actually go out on heists on days off,'</i> he thought to himself. Gumshoe's eyes perked up as he realized this might be another opportunity, though. Kay was a nice girl, but she always sorta treated himlike he was an old man or something. Gumshoe bet she'd lighten up if he was in this body though. Maybe they'd have fun and he'd get to know her better. <i>'It'd just be two teens hanging out, after all!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as fun as it might be to go get Kay's attention, it'd be irresponsible to not check in on Ema at all.

He thought to himself, getting a bit sad as he did. He shook his head. This was his day off and he shouldn't get sad over anything. He looked over and saw that Kay had saw him. She was waving at him and seemed to be calling him over<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to Kay. He waved as he walked over to her. \"Hey Kay, What are you up to?\" He said friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Ema! I'm just looking around for trees to climb and hide in. The great Yatgarasu must be able to disappear into thin air!\" She said with her hand raised into air. \"Watch this!\" She said as she ran to a nearby tree and climbed up it pretty fast, sitting down on a branch after a little bit  \"So, what are you up to?\" She asked, not climbing down from the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe looked up at Kay in the tree, he wished he could get up there as as well, but his body was too bulky. Then he perked up a bit, he wouldn't be able to climb up there if he was himself, he could probably climb up there in Ema's body. He climbed up there like Kay did, although slower than she did and slipped a little. He sat down on a branch close to the one Kay was on \"I came here to relax and fish\" Gumshoe finally answered Kay's question as, but then he remembered he was supposed to act like Ema \"Uh, I was catching them for a, uh, science experiment.\" He said, trying to sound like Ema<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're always thinking about all your science gizmos! Don't you ever do anything un-sciency?\" Kay joked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, you're always talking your stealing stuff!\" He said back, getting a laugh from Kay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because being the Yatagarasu is my career\" Kay said as she rubbed her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well science is Em- I mean my life! I'm going to be a scientific investigator one day.\" Gumshoe said, doing the best Ema impression that he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought crossed Gumshoe's mind though.

He needed a friend to have fun with him! \"Yeah! Like a funny monkey sidekick!\" Larry said aloud in Von Karma's voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pearl was skipping down the hallway like the cute little girl she was Larry pointed the remote toward her and pressed the button. In and instant Pearl went from skipping to being face first on the ground, ouch. \"Okay, don't switch people sitting with people moving.\" Larry said to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl's body began to get up off the ground, as she did she noticed her hands. She yelled in horror, jumped to her feet and began to feel around her body.

Having a bit of fun with the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix stopped thinking about his new body to think about what was going on, it didn't take him long to figure it out. \"Larry?!\" He gasped. This meant that Maya WAS in Larry's body earlier! Oh man, Phoenix wished he hadn't kicked who he thought was Larry out of the office earlier. \"What's going on?!\" He asked, not expecting what to here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got this super cool remote thingy!\" Larry said, showing it to Phoenix. \"It swaps bodies around!\" Larry said as he put it away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Phoenix could ask any of the many questions he had. Not the least of them being why Larry put him in Pearls body or why Larry was in Von Karma's body, Larry grabbed Phoenix's new, smaller, hand and began dragging him down the hallway. \"Let's go!\" Larry said excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where?!\" Phoenix said confused. So many things were happening so fast that his mind couldn't keep up. He was wondering about so many things. Where was Maya in Larry's body? Was Von Karma in Maya's body? How was Pearl reacting to being in his body, If only he could get back to his office and check on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry was silent for a few moments before finally answering Nick's question \"I have no idea! But, You need a vacation, so we are going to go and have fun! I'm an attractive women and you're an adorable little girl, there must be somewhere we can go to have fun!\" He joyfully announced as they got on the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix wanted to leave Larry and go check on Pearl, but two things stopped him from doing that. The first was the fact that Larry was holding his hand like a little girl and he couldn't break free. The second was the swapping remote. Larry had already done three swaps, perhaps more! Phoenix needed to make sure that he didn't swap anyone else, of all people to get the ability to swap bodies around, it had to be Larry. \"If something smells it's gotta be the Butz\" Phoenix sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry and Phoenix went into Von Karma's now dent up car, which now had a parking ticket, and headed toward.</span></div></div>",

Swapping remote, yadda yadda, aware swap, blah blah, unaware swap, there's too many big words here!\" He said and threw the instructions back in the box. From what he understood the remote could swap bodies around. This could be his chance! He could become a more dependable person with this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paced back and forth in his living room thinking about who to swap with. The first person to come to mind was Edgeworth, Edgeworth was easily the greatest prosecutor the Sebastian knew, but what would Edgeworth do if he switched with him, he'd probably get very mad. Maybe swapping with one of Edgeworth's assistants would be better, he could be close to Edgeworth all the time and learn directly from him how to be dependable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person to come to mind was Justine Courtney. She was always helping him and when he made mistakes she corrected him. Plus, she was a judge, if he became her he wouldn't have to worry about people judging his mistakes because he would be judging them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough those two were the first to come to mind, there were probably other people he could swap with if he thought about it.</span></div></div>",

Grossberg didn't fully understand how the remote worked and if he pressed the wrong buttons then he may unintentionally break White out of prison. Breaking him out would be a horrible thing and he wanted to avoid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chose Ms. May because she was relatively harmless compared to White, sure she had a mental breakdown in the courtroom, but she never killed anyone at the very least. He made his way to the courthouse and requested a visit with Ms. May. In the visiting room there was a sheet of glass between him in Ms. May, probably for the best. Strangely, despite being in prison April was still wearing her usual pink outfit. She probably got special treatment from the guards because of her...feminine wiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, uh, what are you doing here?

Her father, Phoenix Wright, was currently at home, preparing for his trip to Kurain, while the office's other two employees, Apollo and Athena, were out investigating a case. She had the office all to herself, which she was taking advantage of to practice her magic tricks. She used to just practice whenever she wanted, but with there now being three lawyers in the office compared to just one of her, she felt a bit outnumbered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could move on to her next trick, she heard a knock at the door. \"Hm, I wonder who that is,\" she wondered aloud, heading over to the front door to find out, weaving her way through all the things she used for her magic tricks strewn around the office. She opened the door, half expected it to be a client, but to her surprise, all that was there was a small package. It seemed to be unlabeled, which made it difficult to tell who it was actually for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they wouldn't mind if I just took a peek inside,\" Trucy said to herself, and she picked up the package and took it back inside the office. She snatched a pair of scissors off her dad's desk, sit down of the office couch, and set about opening up the package. Inside, there was a small device, like a TV remote, and an instruction manual. Trucy was now even less sure who in the office this belonged too. She supposed the best way to find out right now was to read through the manual and figure out what the remote actually controlled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, the remote wasn't for any sort of electronic device, but rather it was supposedly able to swap people's bodies around. Trucy mind raced as she imagined all the things she could do with this thing. She'd almost certainly have to incorporate it into one of her magic shows somehow. It's not like anyone else here at the office would have ordered this thing, right? The only question was what to do with it. What would be the best way to work it into a magic trick? She figured she should probably test out how it worked first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, someone came to the office just as she was thinking that. But who was it?</span></div></div>",

Being in each other's bodies would probably distract them a lot and possibly throw them off during while they were doing their job. But They were great lawyers though, they could probably handle anything that could happen to them and still get their client the right verdict, Trucy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was just one question left. What should she do with the remote now? She could just wait till her magic show to use it again, but her show at the wonder bar wasn't til later tonight. Plus, she only used the remote once, she should probably go and get a feel for swapping people before she uses it in one of her shows. Maybe she should go around town for a little while now and swap some people she knew for a while?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, if she switched other people too much people would begin to put together that she was doing it and she wanted to keep the remote a secret, at least until her show tonight. 'The Amazing Body Switch' trick wouldn't have as much pizzazz if there were already plenty of people around town who were switched up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy thought about it for awhile, both options had their advantages and both had their disadvantages.

Honestly, if he could switch with anyone, then there really wouldn't be such a thing as consequence anymore.

He didn't expect the trial to last very long, he had already confessed to it. This may as well have been a paperwork filling session. He put the remote in his pocket and left with the guards<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was brought into court and guided to the defendant's lobby he saw that Apollo Justice was his defense attorney. \"My, my. Isn't this a surprise. Have a change of heart about me Mr. Justice?\" He said with a flip of his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo gritted his teeth. \"No, I still think you're one of the most cold hearted people on the planet. Vera wasn't that far off when she called you 'The Devil'\" Apollo said in anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wound me, Justice.\" Kristoph said, looking down on Apollo. \"So, just why are you here then. Are you going to purposely lose, just to give me a guilty verdict?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo shook his head. \"No, you're a horrible person, but you're still a person. You deserve a fair trial. Don't expect a Not Guilty verdict, but I'll do what a defense attorney is supposed to do.\" Apollo said, as soon as he said that both he and Kristoph were called into court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristoph laughed to himself about Apollo's whole 'fair trial' speech. What nonsense. As he entered the courtroom and stood at the defendant's stand, he looked around, it was as if he was called into a Reunion. Not only was Apollo his attorney, but Mr. Wright's daughter was with him assisting. On the prosecution's side he saw his own brother, Klavier. He wasn't surprised to see that traitor going against him. He looked around the courtroom some more. The detective in charge of this case was that detective Skye girl who he had seen working with his brother a few times before. It also seemed that Vera Misham was brought to the courtroom as a witness against him, no surprise there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked as he thought about all the people in the room. Each person would be good to swap with, each one of their bodies could be used as either a means of revenge or a way to start over his law career.

It was during her trial that not only was he revealed as the one who had ruined Phoenix Wright's career, but it was also the trial in which his own brother had betrayed him. Switching with her would be a delightful bit of irony. The forger girl who just got a Not Guilty verdict would be put in jail in the body of the man who had tried to kill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed the button and in an instant he was standing on the other side of the court room. He felt completely different. He was now definitely female, there was a large sketchbook in his hand, and Bits of dark blue hair fell into his face. It was clear that the swapped had worked and he was now in the body of Vera Misham. An evil grin appeared on his, or rather, Vera's face as he looked over to where he was standing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis old body seemed absolutely horrified, but it wasn't screaming or saying anything. It seemed to be in too much shock about the situation, that added to the fact that Vera wasn't a very talkative person in the first place made it seem like his old body was acting like any person would if they were being charged with murder. One of the bailiffs had noticed the remote and confiscated it from his body, he would need to retrieve that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trial wasn't very long, it wasn't as if anyone had actually planned to draw it out. It was obvious that Kristoph was guilty. As the judge handed down the verdict, Vera in Kristoph's body had broken down into tears. As the court bailiffs were escorting Vera in his body over to the police Kristoph walked over to them. \"Excuse me, but I left a remote by the defendants stand earlier and I need it back.\" He lied. As the bailiff handed the remote to him, Kristoph looked at Vera, who was in shock at seeing her own body. \"No one will ever believe you, so don't talk about it.\" He told her and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pocketed the remote and began to head out of the courthouse. He wondered where to head. He doubted he could go back to his home for now, that would be suspicious. He supposed he could head for Vera's home for the time being, it wasn't as if she would ever be using it again.</span></div></div>",

Looking around, he eventually came across the room of Drew Misham, one of his victims. Figuring no one would enter this room for a while, he found a small lockbox to hide the device in, so that he could be secure in his position. There was something devious about coming into his home now, having stolen his daughter's life. Kristoph couldn't help but feel satisfied at it all. Vera's breakdown couldn't have been more well timed - everyone would just think she was a mad criminal at the end of their rope. Kristoph himself had seen many criminals have similar meltdowns in court - he himself had been privy to one that he wasn't very fond of remembering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis old life was behind him now, though. Finding Vera's room, he stared over his new reflection. Vera was a very unassuming girl; she'd make a great cover for his revenge, and when he was done with her body he'd move on to a new one. There was no rush now, however. He didn't have the limitations of a prison cell or the looming threat of death row to hold him back anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave his new face a smile. \"Well Vera, it seems you'll help me get revenge again.\" Without any particular respect for Vera's privacy, Kristoph disrobed and dressed Vera's body in a long nightgown. It was an odd feeling, being young and female, but he welcomed the change. He kept his composure until his trial, but he hadn't slept in quite a while since his breakdown at the jury. Finally free of the consequences of their foolish decision, he felt alleviated. \"Nothing can be done without a good night's sleep,\" he reasoned. \"I'll rest, and begin my new path tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Kristoph slowly woke up. He was a bit confused at first, but everything came back to him once he saw himself in the mirror. \"It wasn't a dream then! Excellent.\" He lifted himself out of bed with a long stretch and yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking things over, he decided he had two options laid out before him. No one would suspect Vera of anything criminal - especially after she just got acquitted for a murder - so he was beyond suspicion for most any crime he committed. However, it'd likely do him good to get into character before carrying out any plots. Maybe he could spend some time acclimating to his new body/life before he used it for crime? Either way, if things went South he could make an easy escape with the device. </span></div></div>",

It was the weekend, so she didn't have to go to school, but she was leaving early anyway to catch the train into the city. She was planning to visit her friends over at the Wright Anything Agency. Mystic Maya was unfortunately unable to come today, but she had a letter from her in her backpack to give to Mr. Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could leave, though, she noticed there was a package on her doorstep addressed to her. Curious as she was about it, and wondering who might have sent it, Pearl knew she didn't have time to check it out. She was running a little late as it was, and she didn't want to miss the train. So instead, she grabbed the package and put it in her backpack, before running down to the train station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was safely on the train and on her way to the city, making it on just before it left, Pearl pulled the package out of her backpack and started to open it up. Inside was some sort of remote that Pearl was unable to recognise. She was much more familiar with modern technology now than she had been when she was a kid, but she still didn't know what this was. The closest thing she could think of was a TV remote or something, but this one only had two buttons, one labeled \"aware\" and the other labeled \"unaware\". There was also some kind of instruction manual in the box, so Pearl decided to read through it and try to figure out what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after reading it, though, Pearl still found it a little hard to believe. The remote could apparently swap two people's bodies. It seemed almost like spirit channeling, except instead of channeling the spirit of a dead person, it swapped the spirits of two alive people, and instead of relying on a spirit medium, it used this little remote thing. Could a machine really do something like that? Pearl really wanted to try it out, but it seemed kind of irresponsible to go testing it out on random people. She thought about where the best place to use it would be. Ideally, she would have liked to show Mystic Maya, but she was already on the train heading away from Kurain Village, and Maya was busy today anyway. Perhaps Mr. Nick and her friends at the Wright Anything Agency would be interested in trying out. She was planning on visiting them today anyway, and she still had to deliver Mystic Maya's letter. Then again, they were usually busy with all their legal work, and Pearl didn't really want to interrupt with something like this. But where else could she go? It took her a while to think of it, but eventually she thought about visiting Shipshape Aquarium. She had been there on a school field trip before and made some friends after accidentally getting lost and helping with Mr. Nick's investigation for a case. However, she may have found her way behind the scenes of the aquarium before, but with them open for business, she might not be able to do so again and see the employees she'd made friends with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the train pulled up at the station, Pearl got off, putting the remote and manual in her backpack, and the box it came in in the trash can, and headed off towards...</span></div></div>",
