Unless it was her future self, in which case she\u2019d have an endless barrage of questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now being a Princess felt second nature to her. At first, she had been embarrassed at the stares and crowds she had attracted, now she almost basked in it. She used to hesitate to receive the special favors offered to her, or even mention her position, now she embraced it. A lot of those favors were instant service or even free food at restaurants, which she was shy about accepting at first, but now eagerly devoured. Twilight had a modest appetite as a unicorn, but as an alicorn it grew every day, which had worried her at first but now she enjoyed it. She was sure she was getting bigger, and a growing pony needed her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was currently laid out on her study floor, reading a thick spellbook while nibbling at another bowl of sweets Pinkie pie had prepared for her after a visit to Sugar Cube Corner. She reached over for another bite, only to find the bowl empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSPIIKKEEE!\u201d Twilight shouted, louder than she had intended, but all the same the young dragon ran in frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it thi- I mean what do you need?\u201d He asked nervously. Twilight didn\u2019t understand why Spike or her friends had been so nervous around her as of late, though she preferred this to Spike\u2019s old lippyness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe levitated the bowl into his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother refill please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight away!\u201d He ran off without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight didn\u2019t think much of this until she stood to leave the room</span></div></div>",

For now it was only a small gain, yet it was defffinitly noticeable, filling out her curves and overall giving a \"Fuller\" look. Her flanks had filled out as two inticing purple orbs sporting her slightly larger cutie marks, her face was the least affected but you could see some padding was added to her cheeks, her legs where a tad thicker and if you looked very closely a bit taller as well, and lastly was her biggest change, her tummy. It visibly hung from her body and would sway just a teensy bit when she walked, now two inches of flab protruding outwards from when it had been trim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to really regret keeping a privet collection of books in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on her hooves, Twilight walked over to her staircase and ascended to her bedroom to retrieve a book she wanted to read. Reaching her room Twilight opened the door and went to walk in only to be stopped by something gripping her sides unexpectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOF! What the-?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight had gotten stuck in the doorframe by her stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind her the best she could Twilight called out to Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up here Spike, and I could use some help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next ten minutes where spent grunting, pulling, shoving, and applying butter until Twilight popped out with a heavy thud as she landed on the floor, Spike walking in behind her and cleaning his hands of excess butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh..thanks, Spike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no problem...hey Twilight, there's something I'd like to ask you, just don't take it the worng way, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up again Twilight looked at her little assistant questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Spike?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...don't you think you're getting a little on the...heavy side? I mean, you DID just get stuck in a door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight paused and thought about Spike's question for a moment before replying-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: \"Don't be silly Spike, it's getting close to winter so the door just shrunk is all!\" (Oblivious path)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: \"I'm growing into my role as Princess, if the door can't handle my alicorn growth spurt then we'll just have to get it widened to accommodate me.\" (Self-indulgent path)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: Something Else</span></div></div>",

How could someone so smart say something so stupid? He rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwilight you know the door frame hasn\u2019t shrunken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked uncomfortable for a second, but stood steadfastly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally Spike it's nothing, things often shrivel up in the cold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Spike\u2019s disgust, Twilight was levitating or slurping up the leftover butter while she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the door frame Spike held out his claws. Even with his arms outstretched to their fullest he still had room to walk through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? I can easily get through the door frame and with a whole bunch of room left over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah but you\u2019re a lot smaller than me. And I\u2019ve grown lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wider you mean.</i> Spike thought though he dared not speak it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCelestia could get through this door! Though I guess she\u2019d have to duck cause her horn would scrape the top but.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you I\u2019m a lot bigger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike couldn\u2019t stay calm anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not as tall as Celestia! You\u2019re f-.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight whirled around and stamped a hoof, crushing part of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m what?!\u201d She glared at him and snorted like a bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike backed away and held up his palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Twilight walked away and headed down the stairs, each one creeking and groaning from the impact of her body. After only a few steps she decided she couldn\u2019t be bothered anymore and disappeared in a purple flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike was confused, she had come up here for something right? Then why had she just left all the sudden? Oh no... the confrontation must have put her in a bad mood, and lately whenever she was in a bad mood she would eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike heard a loud thud as she materialized, presumably in the kitchen. Then he heard the familiar sound of cupboards being flung open and crunching, as Twilight presumably ate everything in sight. He listened with a mixture of dread and fascination. Twilight had acted this way before but her denial was getting more aggressive and her eating sessions were getting longer. Twilight was probably going to force him to do another food run tomorrow and he didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be able to carry everything she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity, Twilight teleported back into her room, the floor shaking as she appeared. Surrounding her in the usual purple fog were several bowls of candy and various pastry boxes, now seemingly in a better mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are those?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust some light snacks.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNow where was I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike couldn\u2019t stand to watch any more of this and walked away. He thought about writing a letter to Celestia, but he was scared of how Twilight might react and Celestia was away from Canterlot on an important diplomatic mission. Still, with Twilight this deep in denial how bad would things get before she would be willing to listen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Twilight feeling a combination of obligation as Princess, appreciation for the kind offer, and plus Ponyvillians cooking just being plain good, took every offer given to her.

She hadn't been sure how Ponyville would react, but she really wasn\u2019t prepared for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight groaned as another knock came to her door. She had been prepared to tackle any duty required of her as a princess, but she never thought she\u2019d have to face anything like this. Reluctantly she approached the door and forced a smile on her face.  At the door stood another group of ponies holding up another pastry basket. At the sight of Twilight, they bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Princess Twilight! We bring you an offering!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I figure- Uh, I mean thanks, your offering is appreciated.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grasped the bundle of food and levitated it over with the others, having already accumulated a pile as high as Twilight herself and considerably wider. Her fake smile still on her face, Twilight waved at them as they left then closed the door. Spike was sitting nearby, watching the whole ordeal with bemusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother one huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...ever since I\u2019ve become Princess ponies keep bringing them here. Apparently, it\u2019s good luck to make an offering to a Princess and the easiest thing to offer a Princess is food.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighed with exasperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd one of the duties of being a Princess is keeping up my public image. Though I have no idea who came up with the whole offering thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing Celestia, there were probably times she visited Ponyville and it was a convenient way of scoring free food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cynical, but I guess it makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>So</i>, what are you going to do with all of your \u201cofferings\u201d.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike actually made air quotes as he said that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive them away maybe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight checked the windows. As per usual crowds of ponies were gathered outside each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I\u2019m under constant surveillance, so I don\u2019t think I could do that or get rid of them any other way. I\u2019m sure its bad luck for me to get rid of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr knowing Celestia share any of them...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighed again, then took a deep breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m a Princess and I have a duty to do however bizarre\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe levitated a bib from the kitchen, tied it around her neck, then walked towards the pile of baskets with a determined look on her face.</span></div></div>",

But then how did she manage to remain so thin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had put away an impossible amount of food, an amount she was sure was several times her own body mass, she had not managed to keep her thin figure, some of it going to her face, giving her, large, round cheeks, most of it going everywhere else, especially to her stomach making her much larger overall.

Spike wondered if she was about to have a breakdown, but the smile on her face seemed genuine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess its time for seconds!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer horn shone, and a purple glow filled the hall as the new offerings came to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight  what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I got this!\"</span></div></div>",

This year the vendors would be setting up permanent shop in Ponyville, the small town being their best hot spot for selling treats, but more importantly was home of their <i>best</i> customer, Pinkie Pie. While they of course do their best to attract as many customers as they can, they focus especially on the poor pink pony as she seemed to have a bottomless bag of bits only matched by her hunger for phenomenons. Though reality eventually does in fact set in and Pinkie runs out of bits, but the sisters are far from done with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn lieu of bits they start offering the already fattened partier \"deals', she does things for them and she gets free phenomenons. At first simple things such as advertising for them, standing in front of their stand with a sign, and such other things, but as Pinkie gets bigger and her addiction deepens, the sisters demands become more explicit and demeaning. Dressing in enticing uniforms to lure in horny stallions, doing embarrassing promotional stunts like swimming in mud, and even having her perform very special \"personal favors\" for them all while she gets fatter. Through all if though Pinkie is content so long as she gets her fix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill there ever be an end to the sisters depravity or Pinkie's weight?</span></div></div>",

The biggest change is that she no longer wanted to outright banish or otherwise harm her sister. The time they had spent together after her defeat by the Elements of Harmony had shown her that Celestia truly cared for her and it's not her fault how ponies view the night, but unfortunately if Luna wanted to rule the kingdom as she wanted that meant she still had to take her out of power. This is how she had come to her newest plan, fattening her sister until she's too big to properly do her duties. In her mind, it would be the least egregious way to claim sole rule while making sure her sister wasn't harmed, plus she could be more subtle this time. Encourage her to take that extra slice of cake, what harm could it do? An extra large meal after a long day of work made sense right? All of this supplemented by simple spells used on Celestia's food to increase her appetite while retaining every bit of fat in her food means that Luna's plan would be going great as Celestia poofed out. A few lies to assure her that she wasn't getting fat, rigging her mirrors to show her still thin, cracking down on anypony trying to tell Celestia she's getting big meant Luna's usurpation was guaranteed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a complex set of spells but it was worth being able to walk around looking thin as ever while actually being three-hundred pounds, though now the time was coming for the truth to be revealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all because she forgot to use a spell she had been using on a routine for over a thousand years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow caught out in public with all her fluffy body for full display, how will Equestria react?</span></div></div>",
