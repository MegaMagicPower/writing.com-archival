Something feels a little different, but you can't quite place your finger on it yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you jump to your feet, ready to get your day started. As you do, though, you hear a loud ripping sound. Turning around, you look to see that your pajama pants have split up the back. Also, you notice that your shirt seems to be much tighter, exposing your stomach. \"What the--?\" you exclaim out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning across the hall to the bathroom, you flick the light on and look into the mirror, and as you do, a huge smile crosses your face. Some how, some way, something had happened to cause you to grow over a foot and a half taller overnight. You now stood nearly six feet tall, the same height as your father! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA million thoughts ran through your head, but you decided to just play it cool for now and see what the rest of the day brings. All your clothes are way too small, but you put on a formerly loose-fitting t-shirt and a pair of mesh shorts, both of which now are practically form-fitting, and head to the kitchen for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth your mom and dad stare at you dumbfounded the moment you enter the kitchen, your mom dropping a dish onto the floor and shattering it. \"Son!\" your dad exclaims, setting down the paper he was reading, \"what happened to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, continuing to smile. \"Beats me. Isn't it great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour parents remain speechless as you sit down at the table, looking your dad square in the eye without having to tilt your head up or anything. Slowly, they resume what they were doing before, keeping an eye on you, trying to figure out just how something like this could have happened.</span></div></div>",

Even just in the time it took to get to the doctor's office, you had grown a few more inches, and your shirt is beginning to be unable to cover your stomach fur. The eyes of all the patients in the waiting room are fixed upon you, but you don't mind. The feeling of being so big is incredible; it makes you feel -- well, you don't quite understand what you're feeling, but you know you like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the examination room, you sit down on the table and begin to swing your feet back and forth, noticing that they are brushing against the cool linoleum floor, something they had never come close to doing before. When the doctor, a rather tall, skinny weasel, steps in, he doesn't say anything at first, looking back and forth between you and the chart in his hands for almost a minute. Your mom, sitting in a chair against the wall, is clearly nervous and agitated, but remains silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Tommy,\" the doctor finally speaks up, \"it looks like you've gone through a number of changes since the last time I saw you. How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" you exclaim without hesitation, and it's the truth. You have more energy bubbling inside you than ever before. You feel like you could take on the world. \"Never felt better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor turns to your mom. \"And I understand this all happened within the past twenty-four hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom nods vigorously. \"Yes, doctor. He just woke up this morning like this. Please let me know what's going on with him! It's all so bizarre!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor starts to perform your examination, instructing you to strip to your underwear. It takes some effort to peel off your shirt and pants, as they have gotten extremely tight since putting them on earlier. The normal procedures are followed - checking pulse, blood pressure, and temperature, along with him listening to you breathe and cough. When it comes time to take a blood sample for testing, you instinctively wince at the sight of the needle, but you barely feel the prick it makes in your arm. It's barely a bug bite to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the tests are finished, the doctor leaves, saying he'll be right back. It takes him over an hour before he steps back into the room, and he has a worried look on his face when he does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Tommy, I have some good news for you.\" He pushes the glasses up his nose as he forces a weak smile. \"All your bloodwork and testing has come back without anything to worry about. Other than your size, your numbers are all within a healthy, normal range for a boy your age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, your mom stands up, clearly flustered. \"Then what's happening with him? You can't exactly call this healthy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am,\" the doctor places a paw upon her shoulder, trying to reassure her, \"I understand how confused and frustrated you must feel. We're as confused as you are. There's some more extensive DNA tests we're going to run, but even at a greatly rushed pace, they will still take at least a day before we'll have any results. Go ahead and take Tommy home today and we'll schedule an appointment for tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough hesitant at first, your mom eventually agrees to this, and after making the necessary arrangements for tomorrow, you head home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth continues at a steady process through the rest of the day, and by the time night rolls around, you're nearly seven feet tall. You look at yourself in the mirror before you head to bed, still amazed with what you see. Though still slender and youthful, your body is incredibly impressive and imposing to practically anybody else. You crawl into bed, your paws sticking out over the edge, and close your eyes, full of anticipation for what the next day will bring. </span></div></div>",

And the stupid thing takes your money with no sprite.  Feeling frustrated you shake the vending machine aggressively.  \"Give me my sprite you bitch!\" you said as you kick the vending machine with all your might.  Suddenly the vending machine drops the soda, but it's not the one you wanted.  Picking it up it says Scum Soda and when you look at the vending options it doesn't exist as an option.  You eventually decide to open the drink and see if it tastes good.  Hesitantly you place it to your lips and its the most delicious soda ever and you guzzle.

Your stomach gurgles and makes you moan.  \"Oh man what was I thinking!  Why did drink a soda that said scum on it!  Stupid!\"  The pain hurts so much that you fall onto your knees in the middle of the sidewalk.  Suddenly a wolf furson walks up to you and says, \"Excuse me sir, are you all right?\"  You look up at the gray wolf and belch so hard that you launch him ten feet in the air and 30 feet away.  \"Excuse me, *hic*\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your pants start to tighten around your package which strangely feel really good.

The strain was to much for your pants and penis grows outward and hardens reaching past your belly button and almost to your diaphragm.  Your penis is definitely bigger than you remember and people look at your overgrown sex with envy, fear, and lust.  Your body is twice as big as them while sitting down and your still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rip off the rags that use to be your clothes as you finished growing.

So you two girls are going have clean up this mess with your tongues, but not you Sarah.\"  You say leaning forward and grabbing Sarah from your chest and lifting her up to eye level, to you she's a 12inch tall barbie.  You admire her tiny nude body those DD breast and that lovely little tush, it would make you hard again soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looks at you with your breath blowing into her face, looking both scared and excited.  \"I want to reward you for pleasing and please you with my tongue,\" you lick your lips looking at Sarah's tiny pussy.  Then an idea popped in your head, you look down at the two other catgirls Amy and Miranda, \"And if you two don't finish licking all this cum off of my crotch before Sarah cums, then I'll have to eat you.\" Your stomach starts growling right on que, and grin evily at the girls reaction.  \"And I don't mean like eating you like I'm eating Sarah.\" Amy and Miranda got really scared at your declaration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Sarah she doesn't look as excited before but scared.  \"So if you want to save your friends, you're going to have not cum for as long as you can, because if you-\" You stopped talking as you felt the two girls start licking the cum off of your crotch immediately.  You thought that was a little rude to start before you finish, but whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I 'cum' Sarah,\" you say to her as your fingers spread her legs and your foot long tongue rubs across her 5 1/2 foot body.  She looks down thinking of safety her friends but starts to moan as your pillow sized, to her, tongue tickles here nipples and breasts.  The game has started, you can feel Sarah's body stiff across your meaty tongue, feeling stressed about life of her friends is in her hands.  If she cums, this monstrous, hunk of a beast will devour her friends.  You can feel the heartbeat of her body pounding in her chest.  You can feel the Amy and Miranda desperately rubbing the rough cat tongues on your 3 foot flaccid monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis game goes on for at least 15 mins, you tongue switching between her tits and pussy, but now its the home stretch and stomach growls at you angrily.  Your not sure if you were serious before, but now you might actually eat them, since you've skipped lunch today, you might eat them even if they win.  Hell you might even accidentally Sarah if you don't control your self, as you feel both of her legs slip down your throat without you paying attention and she shrieks.  You've never inhaled as big as a whole foot hot dog long before, maybe this new body gave you more than size and a buffer body.  It would be nice to feel at least one of these girls slip down your throat and feel them pound at the walls of inside your stomach, begging for help.  The sadistic thought gives your erection back.  Giving Miranda and Amy more surface area to clean on your 6 foot erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't take it anymore, you want to eat them and finish this sadistic game, but not before you make this stubborn bitch cum first.  Besides you don't want to eat Sarah yet or at all, her pussy tastes to good.  But her friends are forfeit and want to end this now.  You shove your tongue as far up Sarah's pussy will allow, your teeth clench maybe a little to hard on Sarah's breasts, causing her to kick her legs at the back of your throat causing you to gag a little.  But it seemed to work and she climax's on your tongue and your body goes limp in your mouth.  You cough a little and release her from your mouth and put her on top of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to recover from Sarah's kick that you maybe deserved in the back of your throat for biting on her tits.  Leaning forward you inspect Miranda and Amy's work.  There's still cum on your pubic fur and you didn't specify to clean off of your balls, but they did clean your penis like asked.  So do your honor their victory or not.  Your definitely hungrier now than when you started, and your in the mood to try voring to see if you can.  It would be a really \"dick\" heh, move to eat them after promising you wouldn't.  There are lots of other bystanders that you could eat instead.  They should know better than to watch and live stream with their phones with one hand and rubbing their crotches with the other.  Some may have been voraphiles and probably want to be eaten after hearing me say I would and didn't run away.  Who am I to deny such an offering and it's their own fault for not running.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm... should I</span></div></div>",

As wonderful as that would be, it was hardly clear as to whether they were even possible, even with his current stature taken into account. It was supposed to be impossible, yet it was. He defied countless laws of physics and biology by merely existing. From the Square-Cube law to the question of how his heart could even pump blood around his massive body were of no concern to him. By that standard alone, some could proclaim him a god already. God was simply Dog reversed after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin plastered across his muzzle, he cast his gaze down over his muscular body, taking stock of the land beneath his mighty paws, squatting down as he braced his paws on his powerful thighs as his visage engulfed the sky for those below...</span></div></div>",

Looking down, you see what you are: a naked wolf, with a sheath and balls, your entire body covered in grey fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you observe, the objects at your feet are...tiny? Like toys, little forklifts, crates, ladders, and various tables covered in tools too small for you to make out. Then it hits you like a brick: the hunger. Your stomach growls, hurting with emptiness. It's obvious you need something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to the left of you, and notice something: a tiny glass window right at the height of your face. And...you might be going crazy...there's tiny people inside! They chatter to one another, seemingly in a panic. You try honing your canine senses in on their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It  wasn't supposed to wake up! And the general isn't here! We could be discharged or worse for tampering with the test subject!!\" \"Relax, the thing will go back to sleep before everyone comes back in the morning.\" \"How do you know that?! It could easily do something awful to EVERYONE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what they're talking about exactly, but what you do know is that you're tired of these shackles. You struggle hard, grunting as the metal breaks under your mighty strength, and you are finally free, stepping on the tiny objects below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention to the glass, from which you can hear more panicking. In a second, you punch right through it, shattering it to pieces. Your giant furry hand searches the tiny room, picking up three tiny people: two humans and one fur, all shaking in your glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look at them, trembling in your wake, you are reminded of your hunger, as though a little voice were telling you: \"do it\". As though it was natural to you, you raise them up to your maw, opening the cavern wide and dropping them right onto your tongue, your jaw shutting with a snap. They panic on your tongue, only making you enjoy their exotic taste that seems all too familiar. You move them around your mouth, all the while rubbing your balls just a little. You enjoy this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon though, they lose their taste, and you tilt your head back, putting a hand on your throat as you feel the bulge of their tiny bodies slide down. It felt amazing. You need more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, realizing the entire wall is a door. Reaching into the tiny room, you push all the buttons haphazardly with a giant finger, and somehow the door opens. The world is revealed to you, ready for the taking...</span></div></div>",

A highway snakes through the metropolis, going directly through the downtown area, as though it is a ribbon of red and white wrapping right around the urban sprawl. The night is penetrated by the glow of the buildings, as though it were a heavenly beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You know that's the place to get food. Hopefully they taste as good as those scientists you just sent into your stomach, which unfortunately only satisfied your stomach for about a minute before you found yourself as painfully hungry as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, you step into the night, heading towards the highway, since it'll take you downtown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You squash trees easily under your paws, and it strangely feels quite good too. You reach the highway, stepping onto the asphalt. As you swing your other paw over, you accidentally squish the cars underneath you, and you'd been afraid it'd hurt. But in fact, the feeling of metal crumpling underneath your feet feels incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now not afraid of stepping on the vehicles, you walk right down the freeway, stepping on as many automobiles as you can, even making a game out of catching the ones that try to swerve out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The activity makes you aroused, and soon your pulsing cock, knot and all, is swaying beneath you with every step, almost taunting the humans and furs beneath it before you crush them underneath your almighty paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Buildings begin to rise around you on the sides of the freeway, some windows with lights, some even with people that gape at you. You'd have to come back for all these people later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon you can tell you're downtown, with so many wonderful cars to step on filling up the highway, and the skyscrapers that are the only things taller than you. You climb down an off ramp, landing on a sidewalk full of people and squishing some underneath your feet, and it feels even better than the cars, making you growl in a slight pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The people that haven't been stepped on try to run away, and you sit down, folding your legs and trying to push as many of them as you can into the furry corral that you've formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Some frantically try to climb your leg, but fail. Others stare paralyzed with fear, either at your hungry eyes or throbbing wolf cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You reach down into the mass between your legs, grabbing a handful and lifting them up to your face. You sniff, getting a whiff of their delicious fear as they struggle in your grip. You decide to make eating them fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You open your mouth, letting your tongue snake into your fist, slurping up some of them and bringing them into your maw. You roll some of your victims in your saliva, taking delight in their taste. You curl your tongue around each one, enjoying each individual struggle before you swallow them down into the dark depths of your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon, the last one is gone, and you're left with a full stomach and a huge erection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You lick your lips slowly bringing a paw through the building, then you plunge your jaws into the rubble devouring any hopeless survivors buried within.

Laughing you snuff out the humans with each step, crunching is heard from your ears as you smile sadistic and slightly lustfull. The police are gone without even a fight, now you focus back on the town. Slowly you look around at the display before your paws: people running, and screaming, cars crashing and screeching to a halt, and generally just all around pandemonium.

The bottom of your tail was yellow and went from the tip to your crotch. Your large hands and feet had black tipped claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretched out your muscles from the sleep deprived state. Throwing your toned arms behind your head, you bounced your pecs and flexed your eight pack abs. On top of your head were small white horns and folded at your back were red and yellow wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only clothing you wore was a small black loincloth above your thick thighs. It struggled to contain your large package and ran up between your large firm butt cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name was Fen, a mighty dragon who fell asleep many years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes again, you looked down at the forest. The trees only went above your ankles. Just stepping out you had already flattened a few under your scaly sole. Your attention soon fell on a moving speck near your toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending down, your picked the dot up with your thumb and finger. Bringing the item in front of your golden eyes you saw an organic being in some clothes with short hair and pale skin. The creature had a look of fear as the two giant appendages gently squeezed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah a human.\", your deep voice boomed out. \"It's been awhile since ive seen one of you specks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human began yelling out it's squeaks, all you could hear were \"please!\", \"sorry!\", and \"go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk graced your snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm your cute, I'm gonna keep you~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human stood silent as you opened up your mouth, exposing your warm maw. Placing the human on your purple tounge, you closed your mouth, cutting off the human's yell. You wrapped the purple muscle around the speck and tasted the the sweet flavor and felt it's struggles. A purr escaped your throat before deciding to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting your red back, you gulped down the human. You placed two clawed fingers on your throat and felt the struggling bump pass and lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human would calm down eventually. Didn't they know that dragons can get rid of thier stomach acids?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting your abs, you hummed in delight as the human arrived in your vast stomach. You and them could have some \"fun\" later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfolding your wings, you did a few test flaps before soaring into the air. The trees were blasted back with the gust from your wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sight appeared in the distance. What did the humans call it? Oh yeah, a city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what were you planning on doing to the city?</span></div></div>",

She could simply look down over her capital city ans watch her subjects go about their business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need to stand on a hill or mountain to do this; she WAS a mountain. A living one, of golden and black scales; wide bat-like wings, and claws that could rip the armor off a battleship. Queen Kathrine, monarch of the land once ruled by a rather stupid and cowardly king, was a dragon. She'd grown tired of always having a stream of would-be warriors trodding into her lair with their silly little guns and knives making hopeless attempts to kill her, and was getting bored of having to eat them again and again. So, she'd flown to the kingdom who'd been sending all the 'champions' (the information gleamed from some rather tasty mercenaries) and demanded to see the ruling monarch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he'd try to run away rather than face her like a true king, Kathrine had simply sat on his castle, crushing it, the king, and all others within under her scaly rump. She'd then proclaimed herself the new Queen, promising to not eat the humans if they didn't rebel and accepted her rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Kathrine had her own kingdom of cute little humans! Plenty of food offered as tribute, taxes provided a nice stream of treasure, and it was always nice ordering her court around on its daily business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been reigning for twenty years since....but what sort of ruler was the Dragon Queen?</span></div></div>",

She had heard of how the previous king was a horrible tyrant and her taking over was seen as a blessing. Since she couldn't fit in any castle her minuscule subjects provided her with, she chose to rule from her cave and had used her flame breath to melt part of her dragon horde into a massive bejeweled throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, she was about to receive news regarding the fate of her kingdom as a messenger was coming forward. \"Your majesty!\" he yelled. \"Queen Katherine!\" Katherine at that time was looking down at the messenger as several of her servants were painting her massive toenails. \"You don't have to shout,\" says the dragon queen. \"I am not deaf. I can hear your voice just fine. What is it.\" The dragon queen lowered her hand to the messenger who could see his reflection in her scaly black hand as his queen lifted him up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine's visage was intimidating but stern and fair. The messenger gazed into his queen's bright red eyes and saw his reflection in her ruby tiara before he spoke. \"The Queen of Threadbeer is due to arrive at noon.\" Katherine nodded her head. \"I understand. The peace treaty. I just hope this time I can read the darned thing. You short lives write too small. But I guess it can't be helped.\" \"But Queen Katherine, the queen of Threadbeer isn't a short live, er... a human. She's as large as you.. uh, not that you're....\" Katherine scratches her chin. \"Is that so. Then it is <i>very</i> imperative that the treaty is signed. Can't have a war with a kingdom that has another giant as their ruler. For all I know, she could be a fellow dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine laid the messenger down as she was getting ready to meet with the Queen of Threadbeer. That kingdom had been enemies of her kingdom since the days of the hated previous king. It was one of the few kingdoms that would dare make war with hers. Most neighboring countries minded themselves after a group of barbarians invaded. Katherine crushed the invaders under her massive scaly feet. She left one of them to live and warn the rest that nobody had better mess with Katherine's people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine knew she had to look presentable to meet with the other queen. After all, being a 1000ft dragon was no excuse to meet a visitor naked. Katherine normally was content with wearing nothing but a tiara but for this occasion, she had a grand Elizabethan style dress made. It was black and red so as not to contrast with its wearer. Katherine didn't like to wear it unless she had to but she had to. First she put on the corset, the one thing she hated to do the most because dragons were usually heavily built and she was no exception. Next she put on the large skirt and the sleeves with the high collar. Finally, Katherine put on a bustle, not that she needed it though given the size of her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Katherine was dressed, she picked up one of her handmaidens to apply her makeup. \"I hope you know what you're doing Your Majesty.\" The maid said. \"That makes two of us. I have no idea what manner of beast I'm meeting with, so nothing can go wrong.\" Once the dragon queen was ready, she walked out of her cave towards the center of her kingdom, villagers clearly the way so as not to be accidentally trampled by their gargantuan ruler. As Katherine stood there waiting, she heard tremors and everyone at her feet begun to panic. \"Everyone get behind me at once,\" said the dragoness. \"She's here.\" Katherine heard trumpets and saw the ruler of the Threadbeer kingdom coming forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine was caught by surprise because the visiting queen was a 1000ft tall...</span></div></div>",

Many varieties of compounds were tested on the beast, but often with little or no effect, of course, until now.  The last serum changed his body drastically, increasing his muscle mass and height, as well as giving him a more human form, and what's more, it made him hungry.  So hungry, in fact, that he ate his keepers.  And that was a good thing, he thought, since he discovered that as he ate, he grew.  More muscle, more power, more height, more masculinity.  And Roland Liked more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More\", in fact, was the exact thought on Roland's mind as he stomped toward the crowd, making a slight effort to crush anything in his path with his massive round feet.  The crowd watched in terror, and partially awe, as the pachyderm's leg muscles danced and twitched about as he made his way toward them.  Screams and panic ensued as he approached, before he stopped, looming powerfully over the crowd and greeting them with a final sight of his rippling torso.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoland reached down and carelessly grabbed a large bushel of five or six squirming people, accidentally crushing two others in the process.  Casually tossing them into his mouth and chewing, he finally gulped them down, turning his eyes back to the crowd in front of him.  He alone decided their fate, and that fact excited him greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally decided to...</span></div></div>",

A place where anyone from the camera-happy tourist to the historian could come and have the time of their lives, and grab some first-class food along the way. A city between Europe and the Middle East, standing proud above the Mediterainian for thousands of years...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hid underground, just off the coast, Tina thought it was almost a shame she was going to smash it to rubble. <i>Almost.</i> It was a nice place and all, but it was only a human city. Not much besides a fancy ant colony, really. Still, it was nice to look at. Tina decided she'd take her time destroying the place; enjoy the sights before it was reduced to rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina was a rhinoceros anthro with white skin, blue eyes and horn, and clad in a bright blue bikini. She stood an impressive 4000 feet tall for just turning 18, and she was on the chubby side, giving her an impressive girth to go along with her height. Her belly and rump were nicely pronounced, but not massively so--she was what other anthros would call \"Pleasantly Plump\": not obese, just big in a cute, attractive way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch beauty was lost on smaller races, though. Tina had an odd hobby: find a way onto planets inhabited by \"lesser races\", as she called them, and smash the places to rubble. Sometimes she only showed up once and wrecked a city or two, other times she'd smashed everything to bits, until nothing was left standing on the entire planet....and then she'd hunt down survivors, crushing the tinies or even eating them. This time, though, wold be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to take over this little world! <i>Queen Tina</i> had a nice ring to it, after all. Plus, she was kind of getting bored with always smashing these little bugs. Why not see if they could be useful, right? Right! Besides, a girl had to have a posse of admirers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina giggled as she got ready to emerge. These humans barely had any space travel, this would be a cakewalk! They didn't have anything that could hurt her, and they'd never met a real off-world being before...they'd be bowing before their new Queen in no time! Tina could hardly wait; she imagined swallowing entire crowds of humans whole, smashing their little armies under her feet--and her rear, hence the bikini. She liked to feel the survivors wiggle around--and all the other things she did when rampaging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina giggled again, like a little schoolgirl--too exited to feel embarrassed at that. \"Let's get started! Look out, Humans! You new Queen has arrived!!\" With a loud roar, one she'd been praticing for weeks, Tina ERUPTED out of the ground and to the surface, sending massive chunks of crust flying in all directions, almost like meteors. Seawater frothed about her, turning to foam from the sheer force of her emergence as it fountained into the sky, taking unfortunate boats with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few tiny fishing trawlers, their crews somehow suriving the titaness's emergence and being thrown into the sky, were reclaimed by gravity and plummeted down towards Tina, who waited with her mouth open and her head tilted back. The last thing the poor crews saw was a cavernous maw, and a feminine eye winking at them before the jaw snapped closed, and Tina swallowed them whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina laughed, giving her prodigious rear a wiggle as she stood up to her full height. Now, the fun could begin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully, these Humans could make a crown big enough for her when this was all done....</span></div></div>",

With each step, she grew further and further above the tide as she laughed wickedly. She even picked up a handful of whales and swallowed them whole as she came in land. Tina spotted Mt. Vesuvius in the distance and decided to walk towards it. She stepped up a few feet to climb the massive volcano and licked her lips. \"I was getting a bit thirsty.\" Tina rips out a chunk of the island to use as a cup before taking several cups full of the lava. For some reason the intense heat of the magma didn't affect her as she guzzled it like water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Tina had finished, Vesuvius was bone dry. She let out a belch and breathed out bright fire before smiling wickedly. \"Now to take this to civilization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral fishermen on the docks spotted her and gasped. \"By Jupiter,\" said one of them. \"What is that!\" \"It's a titan!\" \"Titan?\" asked Tina with a smirk. \"How quaint, they already see me as a god.\" The rhino spotted the humans trying to run and with her mighty foot coming down, she stomped the docks into nothing, crushing and/or drowning the small humans trying to run. She spotted several cars moving down the road and the rhino giantess breathed out fire to melt the road. The cars caught on fire and as the passengers and drivers tried to get out, the car drools melted and sealed shut. Tina then bent down to the level of her prey and giggled. \"Oh,\" she says. \"Don't worry. There's room enough in my big old belly for you all.\" The people in their cars screamed as Tina brought down her massive tongue to lick the ground, scooping up and devouring them and their cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina stomped into the city and shook her massive hips to smash several buildings as civilians near her feet were running away in fear. \"There's nowhere to run,\" said the rhinoceros titaness. \"Surrender and worship your new queen.\" Tina stomped on several humans to give them the message, turning the soles of her feet bright red. As Tina was laughing to herself, she spotted the Arch of Constantine. \"Hmm,\" said the rhinoceros. \"I wonder if this would make a suitable throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina brought down her large rear on the arch and it broke like an egg under her massive weight. \"Oopsie,\" said the rhinoceros in a mocking tone. \"Guess not.\" That's when she spotted the colosseum and got another idea. \"But this,\" she said as she walked forward. \"Is perfect for my crown.\" Tina lifted up the colosseum and placed it atop her head as she laughed wickedly. Now she was ready to conquer the world, starting with Rome.</span></div></div>",

Sleepy in suspended animation for 3000 years. This creature was bigger than the Nile itself and unfortunately, that something was about to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day there was a large Earthquake startling humans and animals around the area. Nomads mostly. But the quake had a different effect. A thousand miles under the Earth, there was some form of tomb with a stone casket covered in magic symbols. The Earthquake dislodged some stalactites that came down and one of them him the stone coffin, causing it to crack, the cracks damaged the seals keeping the beast inside sealed it. Inside the dark coffin, something was awakening. Something with bright glowing red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove ground, the sands were sinking and several nomads were running away from the chasm. One young man fell into the widening gyre of quicksand and screamed as he was pulled in. Several cattle were dragged down as well as the sand kept sinking in. There was a huge crevasse opening bigger than the grand canyon and out of the crack came something massive. Out of the crack came Tarmorra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTarmorra was a titan, standing in at <b>5000</b> feet tall. She resembled a massive hippopotamus with bright hot pink skin covered in yellow magical markings. She had long rose colored hair and from her body shape, she would weigh as much as an elephant had she been normal sized. She was wearing a crystal tiara with scarab shaped earrings and a short feathered skirt. She looked like an Egyptian queen and the hippo giantess was looking down at the desert area with her glowing red eyes. She grinned down at the tiny humans below as she showed fangs large enough to be mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been 3000 years since I last saw the surface. This shall be a glorious return of Tarmorra the Titaness. But first...\" Tarmorra smiled down at the humans looking up in fear at her. The nomads scream and try to run but Tarmora bends over and drives her large snout into the sand with open jaws. She scoops up the nomads and tilts her head back up as they and their livestock plummeted down her massive throat. The hippo giantess swallowed her prey and let out an evil laugh. \"Time to see the rest of the world.\" She said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn't their fault they were so small - or was it you who was huge? Either way, while the humans were capable of defending themselves as a whole, cities were vulnerable to attack from less than moral anthros due to the response time of the human soldiers. Thus, you had made it your job to protect any humans you could from other, more aggressive anthros. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost human cities had anywhere from a couple to several anthros protecting them - it seemed one major advantage humanity had was that humans were so cute! Of course, with that cuteness came vulnerability, but that was offset by the humans' weapons and the aid of more civilised anthros like yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow tall were you in those human measurement systems? You never could remember correctly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up and letting your feet sink into the sand, you begin to compare your height with that of the various buildings in the human city.

That was why anthros like you - a titanic great white shark with a pair of monster mammaries and a sunny, kind demeanour - and some not like you, volunteered to protect humans and human cities from other anthros. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans are cute.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Male Coyote it is. Let's get some backstory in here. You weren't always a giant but rather it was a gradual build up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly a month before the rampage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were woken up again by the coughs in the next room over. Sounds like your roommates were awake again. It didn't bother you at all, you knew the younger of the two was always sick, she was born that way. You walked over to the door and decided to check on them like you always did when you heard them awake. You knock at their door and wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt creaks open and standing with a tired expression plastered to his face was your best friend since childhood. He was lion with a blue mane and significantly well built. \"How's...\" you began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just her cough again.\" He responds as he rubs his tired eyes. The lion looks back to see his sister had fallen asleep once again. He steps out into the hallway with you and shakes his head as he closes the door. \"Darean, you know we can't keep going like this. Without proper medical care, Lissa's only going to get worse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently pat your friend's shoulder. \"Korumu, you need to relax. I got something tomorrow, might just pay off. If I'm accepted, we get fifty grand for just getting accepted. And if everything goes well, another fifty grand when everything's done.\" You say trying to put your friend at ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you had left early to the research lab. The doctor was reviewing your application as his nurse gave you a physical. \"Male coyote, about a C for his muscle index. Teeth in excellent shape. Fur color is sandy brown with silver on his head. Starting weight is one twenty-five (125) pounds, starting height is five feet five inches (5'05\").\" The nurses said as she finished your physical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor turned to you and set your application to the side. \"Physically you're average. Which is just what we were looking for.\" He explains. He gestures to the nurse. \"Make sure his check is ready after this appointment.\" She nods before leaving the room. You look at the doctor and wait. \"Mister Darean, you've read the testing guidelines and what all we will be doing to you, correct?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You reply. With that you see the doctor pull out a bag and withdraw a syringe. He finds a vien and pokes the needle in before emptying the contents into your vien. You wince as he withdraws the needle and patches up your arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the office and pick up your check. Over the next few weeks you returned to the office for regular check ups and saw other creatures. Many were larger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day before the rampage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sitting at the dinner table with Korumu and his younger sister, Lissa. The three of you were having your once a week \"family dinner\", tonight was chicken and dumplings. You noticed Lissa kept staring at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Lissa?\" You asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotten taller, like way taller.\" She comments as she looks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorumu looks you over. \"And you've bulked up. Side effects of whatever that application was for?\" He asks concerned about your wellbeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor was saying he was testing a new drug that would help increase mass and hopefully help with patients that have lost mass due to medical complications.\" You replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay of the rampage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Lissa had gone out for a walk while Korumu was at work. The two of you stopped at a park bench for her to rest. You smiled as she had been showing signs of health improvement since you used the money you were getting to pay for treatments for her. In the distance the two of heard the sounds on gunfire and buildings being destroyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa flinched, burying her face into your shirt. You held her close but raised an eyebrow as you glanced down. She felt smaller. No. You were experiencing a rapid and sudden growth. Wincing slightly, you pulled away from her not wanting to accidentally crush her. Other folks in the park were pointing and screaming as your size shot up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darean?!\" Lissa was taken back as you grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a slight growl as your body grew to an impressive size. When you finally stopped growing, you were a colossal sixty feet in height. Your ears twitched as you looked around, you spotted Lissa near your left foot, she was shaking in fear. \"Lissa? Hey, it's ok.\" You say softly as you gently reach down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently pick her up in your padded left paw and brought her up to eye level. She was still shaking, more so in surprise now than fear. \"Darean, what's happened?\" She asked as she sat on your palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you thought for a moment. \"Probably that serum they were testing.\" As you finish, you felt a sudden pain in your left thigh causing you let out a howl. Glancing to look you see bullets being shot at you. While they didn't cause any harm, they cause irritation. You heard the officers reporting \"another one being lose\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully close your hand around Lissa before running off. Unfortunately you ran right into the downtown district of the city. All around was destruction as other giant furries and scalies were destroying everything. You recognized them from the appointments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around finding an out of the way alleyway. Careful you set Lissa down. \"Stay here and stay safe. If something happens, yell out for me.\" You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you---\" she begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's people who need help. Someone's gotta help.\" You interrupt before running off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quickly you rush over and manage to stop it from collapsing. You here various rescue workers and first responders in the streets doing what they can to rescue citizens caught in the middle of the rampage. Slowly and carefully you tilt the building a little, lining up a side of windows with your right hand. \"Hop on, it's going to be ok.\" You say as you giving the furs trapped inside a warm smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as they slowly begin climbing out of the windows and land on your open hand. Once you had everyone out, you gently set them on the streets and ease the building to the side. You let out a faint sigh in relief before rushing off. This time there was the monorail tracks needing saving. You leap onto the bridge it goes across, and where half the rail is out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing down the intact tracks you see the coming monorail. You deepen your stance and catch the speeding transport, slowing it down. You're pushed back a little as you slow the monorail. Soon it comes to a stop, causing you relief. \"Everyone alright?\" You ask as you look over the passengers, they nod as they begin cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back to the city as see tanks armed with freeze cannons taking aim at the other giant furs. Some become frozen others avoid being hit. You rush to alleyway and find Lissa is still safe. She smiles up at you as you pick her up. \"You alright?\" You ask as you look her over. She nods as she sits on your palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over and hear something that made your stomach lurch. A giant puma was devouring smaller furs. You feel Lissa flinch at the sounds. Then it catches your attention. You see your best friend in the puma's grip. Not even thinking, you rush the puma and claw him with your free hand. He flinches slightly and turns his attention to you. You see Korumu struggling in his grip and know it's up to you to save your best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pushing back the pain, you kept fighting until you had managed to sink your fangs into the puma's throat. He froze as you ripped his throat open and tore a chunk of flesh from him. Blood stained your muzzle as you dropped the chunk of puma meat from your jaws. He collapsed, a bloodied gurgle was the only sound he made as the life faded from his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the puma dead, you quickly break the claw open and gently pick up Korumu. \"You alright?\" You ask as you check the lion over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think so.\" Korumu replies as he tries to calm himself. You held him and Lissa on the same paw and watched at the younger lioness hugged her brother tightly. Korumu held Lissa close, trying his best to reassure her that he was ok. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile slightly before looking about. There were no further attacks ongoing which caused you to breath a sigh of relief. Carefully you set the two lions on the sidewalk. Several officers had you and your friends surround, guns pointed at you. You nervously put your hands up, not wanting to make the situation worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drop your weapons. That young man saved our lives.\" A well dressed rhino stated as he approached. You recognized him from all the mayoral campaign adds. He was the current mayor of the city and was a well known businessman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officers compiled with the order as they looked to the mayor. He trotted up to you and smiled. \"Thank you for defending our city. What's your name good sir?\" The mayor asked as he looked you up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darean.\" You replied drily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darean. Well met, Darean. How---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can answer that, mayor. But first I need to run further tests upon our coyote friend.\" The tiger from the research facility stated as he walked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Rathmorse...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems the serum works albeit a bit too well.\" The tiger said as he looks at you. \"Darean, if you would, meet me at the research facility. You can bring your friends if you'd like. They might want to know all the side effects of that drug.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as you watch the doctor head out. Soon everyone disperses, leaving you, Korumu and Lissa. With a sigh you look to your friends. \"You guys want to come?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it'd be nice to know what's happening to you.\" Korumu replies. Lissa gives a simple nod. You lower your right hand and let them climb up before heading out. </span></div></div>",

He must have seen the look on Korumu's face, causing him to clear his throat and continue. \"I'll cut to the chase. The serum was still very experimental, as such we actually have no idea what might happen to you. Most of the others showed increased aggression, and decreases in their cognitive functions. Some actually ate others within the community. While other did some... less appropriate things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying, my friend could randomly snap and go berserk?! That he might suddenly become aggressive and harm others?!\" You could hear the outrage in Korumu's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Korumu,\" you paused as he looked up at you. You give him a reassuring smile. \"it's going to be alright. I mean, I'm still me after all.\" You say before gently putting your friend's head with your index finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Rathmorse clears his throat again. \"While that is the case for the time being, I would like to get some blood samples so that we can study what all this might do. I'd also like to get a MRI, CT and other tests to get a baseline on you at your size.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree and soon regret it. Korumu and Lissa were escorted outside and off the property. That was a last you saw of them. Dr. Rathmorse said they were welcomed to visit any time they wished. Days turned to weeks. Weeks into months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocked away in a large holding cell, you rarely got to leave it. Only when it was time for new tests and blood work. When you asked, the doctor always told you that it was for your safety and everyone else's as there was no knowing when you might go feral. You would claw small tics into the wall, keeping track of the days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonth 5, day 25...<br>\r\nYou thought about breaking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonth 7, day 4...<br>\r\nYou had tracked the comings and goings of everyone at the facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonth 9, day 10...<br>\r\nDo you jailbreak?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can only watch in horror as the people make a small lump in the wolf\u2019s throat as they descend into his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people that are trapped have been screaming the entire time, but their voices are growing faint.  You doubt that is because they have just stopped screaming.  The number of people the wolf is stuffing into his greedy maw are becoming fewer in number.

Then again, at his size he may still have some room left in his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe furry wall that makes up your prison lifts as the wolf gets up.  You do not move to escape immediately though.  If the wolf saw you your life expectancy would be drastically reduced.  You wait until you hear the wolf stomping off before emerging from your hiding place.  The street is still blocked off in one direction and you are forced to take the only other way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down the street.  It is amazing to see that the wolf is so heavy that his paw prints have been left in the concrete.  When you reach the corner and look to your left the way is clear.

You thought you had gone unnoticed by the wolf.  Then you think you probably had.  Not only did the blocked off street prevent the escape of his previous meal; it forced anyone who had been hiding during the feast to come straight to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately start to run.  A fur covered finger casual flicks you and sends you flying through the air.  The pain is incredible and your vision grows dark for a few seconds as you hit the ground face down.  You hear the sound of its paws thumping toward you.  As you look around you see that its paws are placed on both sides of you.  When you look up you have a hard time seeing his face around his rock hard member.

Kantar being cautious has sent two robots through the portal, and both have returned with promising news. The planet on the other side of the portal is not only habitable, but is defenseless too. There appears to be only one dominate species of creature on that world, and they appear to be much smaller and more primitive than his own people are. The dominate creature called humans resembles a small hairless ape, and both the males and females appear to be extremely attractive, worthy of study. Kantar thought of many uses for these creatures, but first Kantar must capture a few for study before the giant would commit to a full-scale invasion of their world. Kantar does have a large army at its disposal. Kantar grabs a bag with a lot of equipment in, and enters the portal, eager to get live humans for study, and pleasure. Kantar\u2019s equipment includes, but is not limited to a portable translator, a cloaking device, specimen jars, robots, and other things.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile, on present day Earth, thirty five year old Amber Williams and her husband thirty six year old David Williams are swimming in their backyard, above ground swimming pool. As the attractive middle age couple playful swims together, we see that David is dressed in a blue men's swimsuit, while Amber is dressed in a skimpy pink bikini. Both of these lovebirds have the body for it, being extremely physically fit, and they both have well-toned bodies. Amber has curvy hips, a slender body, smooth fair skin, medium length blond hair, and large, natural breasts. David is muscular, with no facial hair, a smooth chest, and he has lightly tanned skin, with short lit-brown hair. They have been married for over seventeen years now with three attractive kids, two pretty girls and a cut boy all between 8 to 14 years old. They live on the edge of a large town, in a nice two-story house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the attractive human couple splashes and kisses each other, Amber swims over to her hubby, wraps her arms and legs around David, and passionately kisses him in the pool. As they kiss each other, a huge orange colored portal opens up less than a quarter of a mile away. The portal naturally catches the couple\u2019s eyes and they watch as a huge, monstrous creature emerges from the portal. Kantar is currently standing amongst some tall, but from the giant\u2019s point of view short trees, and Kantar sees several dollhouses very close by. Kantar also sees a small town that is close by as well. Kantar gives an evil smile as the giant sees two-doll size, pink skin creatures cowering in a bowel of water nearby. Kantar\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Note, I mentioned they have kids, but you do not have to use them. They are just there if you want too. In addition, the humans depending on their gender and age are around five inches tall to Kantar and the giant\u2019s people. The humans are the size of small dolls to them. Kantar can still easily eat the both of them together, but Kantar hates clothes and the giant prefers his slaves to be naked, and humiliated. Kantar also likes the food to be living and naked as well. Kantar is bisexual. </span></div></div>",

As the pools warm water comes up to their hips, Amber playfully smiles at her husband, looks around, and undoes her bikini top revealing her perky breasts for all to see. While David lustfully grins at his wife, Amber just pulls her husband\u2019s swimsuit down to his bare feet and off his muscular body. While her top and his swimsuit float away, Amber unties the sides of her bikini bottoms, quickly tossing them away. Her husband just looks at his gorgeous nude wife, and his balls begin to throb while his cock becomes rock hard. Amber playfully sits down on his crotch, looks him in the eyes, and passionately begins to kiss him. While they kiss and embrace each other, David\u2019s rock hard cock begins to enter Amber hungry wet pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The buck-naked couple is enjoying their hot lovemaking, when they notice a strange bright light a mile or so away. The couple is enjoying their lovemaking too much to stop, as they turn their heads, watching the strange light in the sky. Amber continues to moan as she pumps her husband\u2019s cock in the female dominate position, when they notice something huge exiting the light. The creature resembles a werewolf, but its walking on two legs, and its wearing clothes. The shocked couple gaze at it in fear, and they are about to detach and make a run for it, when David holds his wife close to him and whispers, \u201cDon\u2019t move, only move very slowly. If we remain still this monster may not see us and leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While the nude couple remains as still as possible in the pool, they see that three big floating robots are accompanying the giant werewolf. They watch as the werewolf and its robot servants begin capturing people, placing them in various containers. They watch the wolf rips apart a house and captures a tiny nude woman or girl that just finished a shower. At the same time, and for some strange reason, Amber felt an urge to slowly move her hips around, stimulating David\u2019s rock hard cock that is still inside her. The thrill-seeking couple slowly begins to hump each other, as the giant gets closer to them. They both moan as they see the giant werewolf creature looking at them, licking its lips. They are still holding each other, and still humping away as the giant reaches down, gently grabbing them both. It lifts them up to his face and looks the horny couple over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Next\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Feel free to add. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This is your fourth month volunteering as a janitor at the White Cliffs Research Lab. It's a rather thankless job, basically amounting to little more than custodial work at this point: cleaning up after experiments, keeping tabs of materials and ingredients to make sure they didn't run out, and occasionally transcribing the barely-legible scribblings of the researchers into a computer database. Rather mindless, really, and you had been thinking about quitting since basically the time you started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until today - the day Pyrhus came along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou happen to be working an overnight shift, mopping the floors, when a loud alarm starts blaring throughout the labs, and yellow lights start flashing all around. It startles you at first, but as the barebones team that's there with you starts running around in a half-panic, you quickly discover that the military has arrived. From what you understand, it's unheard of for this to happen; you certainly haven't seen any military presence in the four months you've worked there, and by the disheveled, rushed appearance of Dr. Harolds, the chief researcher of the lab, there was no warning that they were coming until the huge truck hack pulled into the warehouse at the front of the lab complex. Whatever's happening, it's big. Really big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the rest of the staff watch from the perimeter of the room as dozens, if not hundreds, of soldiers pour out from the large truck in the center as well as the four smaller vehicles surrounding it. They're all decked out in combat gear, each holding a semi-automatic rifle. The one that appears to be the leader steps forward, examining everyone with a stern expression on his face. \"Would whoever's in charge of this facility please step forward and identify yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Harolds complies, nervously shaking. \"I'm Dr. Harolds,\" he says, his voice cracking, \"the chief researcher of White Cliffs Research Lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier looks square at him. \"Dr. Harolds, I am Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Lakarta of the United States Marine Corps, Special Operations 1st Battalion. Per the Military Research and Development Act of 1952, I am hereby taking command of this facility effective immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops, stunned. You knew that the labs had been designed for emergency military use, but there hadn't been a need for anything like that since before anyone still there could remember. Dr. Harolds, likewise, is perplexed. \"Taking - control? Um, but sir, we currently have several projects in development and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Harolds!\" Lt Col Lakarta raises his voice only slightly, but speaks with enough power to immediately stop your boss in his tracks. It's nice to see Dr. Harolds under pressure for a change, especially after all the times he had berated you for making a tiny mistake in your daily rounds. \"As I'm sure you're aware,\" Lakarta goes on, \"these labs were paid for and are being maintained from the military budget with the express purpose of handling emergency situations like the one we're facing today. If you are unable to comply with this, I can find someone who will. Do I make myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a puppy being scolded for making a mess, Dr. Harolds looks down and answers meekly, \"Yes, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now I expect Room A is clear and ready for immediate use, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn audible gasp goes up from several of the staff members to your left and right. Room A is a gigantic, cavernous section of the lab buried deep within the cliffside, stretching at least two hundred feet tall and nearly six hundred feet long. Other than maintenance and cleaning, no one is allowed in there, and even for those reasons, any access was strictly monitored and documented. No one had a clue what the room was supposed to be for; you had heard a rumor that it was built in the fifties in case an Area-51 type incident were to happen on the east coast, but the only thing anyone knew for certain was that it had remained vacant for decades. If the military needs to use it now\u2026 something truly out of this world is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Room A?\" Dr. Harolds seems as shocked as the rest of the staff, but quickly regains his composure. \"Yes, sir. Room A is ready for your immediate use. There's an access tunnel at the far end of this room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Lakarta nods. \"Then my men will go with the vehicle. I want all of your men to make their way to that room to assist in any way needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo fifteen minutes later, you find yourself in another large, empty room, this one twice as big as the first, with the back of the large military truck backing into place. Forty soldiers stand around the back of the truck, weapons aimed at it, while several research staff members stand around a control panel, trying furiously to get something to work properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, men,\" Lakarta calls out, \"On my orders, we will open the door and begin to transport the cargo. Keep in mind, he's been sedated, but there's no telling how long that will last or what he'll be like when he wakes up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe? you think to yourself. What in the world could be in the back of that vehicle that could ever be referred to as a \"he\"? You gulp, bracing yourself for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, men. Open on three. One. Two. Three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back of the truck begins to slide open, moving much quicker than you expected, and in less than ten seconds, you begin to make out a figure. At first, you don't believe your eyes. The figure is huge, bigger than anything you've ever seen before in your life! Quickly, though, you see more detail, and begin to make out what it is that you're staring it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You let out a slight gasp as you come to realize what the figure is.  Sprawled unconscious on his side is a ferret.  A huge ferret.  An absolutely gigantic ferret.  Stark naked, he had a slim physique similar to that of an Olympic sprinter, though at his current stature, it would only take a few strides to complete a hundred-meter dash.  You suppose he could be considered quite handsome, in a gigantic, ferrety kind of way.  His enormous face looks serene, but you can\u2019t help but get the feeling that there is something just plain dangerous brewing behind that black fur \u201cmask.\u201d  A shock of short, unruly black hair graces his head.  He appears to be around your age, maybe 18 or 19.  How had he gotten to be so gigantic?  You\u2019d heard vague, scattered reports of furs growing to enormous sizes and wreaking havoc, but you\u2019d never given the stories too much credence.  It had seemed too ridiculous to be true, and besides, you\u2019d had papers to file.  But now, the huge, naked truth is slumbering right before your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou,\u201d you gape slightly as you see the lieutenant colonel pointing directly at you. \u201cWe need to wake him up so we can transport him into the holding chamber.  Wake him up,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d you mumble. \u201cBut--but that\u2019s dangerous!  Why don\u2019t you just drag him in or something like that?  Or get one of your men to do it?  I\u2019m just an intern,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need him conscious because he needs to move of his own volition,\u201d the lieutenant colonel replies shortly. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can transport him otherwise.  And my men are too valuable,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exchange wary glances with Dr. Harolds, who nods nervously, urging you do follow directions.  Casting one final look in the doctor\u2019s direction, you warily take the cattle prod-like device offered to you and make your way towards the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your heart racing at a million miles a second, the walk up towards the massive ferret\u2019s face seems to take a thousand years.  Why had you taken this internship?  Why had you not quit already?  Was this grounds to sue?  Too late now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding right next to the black-footed ferret\u2019s face, he seems even larger than before.  A faint breeze escaping from his nostrils as he breaths, blowing your hair around.  Cursing yourself silently, you reach out with the cattle prod and, charging it up, stab the giant in the lower lip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous eye opens.  You freeze in place as it focuses on you.  Why can\u2019t you run?  Why won\u2019t your legs work?  All you can do is stare transfixed.  You become vaguely aware of long, slim fingers wrapping around your torso, lifting you off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferret shifts into a sitting position (or as close to one as he can manage), lifting you up towards his face.  His grip is firm, but not uncomfortable.  As he opens his mouth to speak, you can\u2019t help but notice his rather large teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, they sent me a morsel to whet my appetite,\u201d the ferret speaks, his tone almost bored.  The voice seems immense and powerful, but silky at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s the last thing you can handle.  You can\u2019t take it anymore, and vomit, getting your lunch all over the middle knuckle of the ferret\u2019s index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot very good at first impressions, are we,\u201d the ferret muses, wiping it off with a finger from his other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... don't eat me,\" you manage to mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferret rolls his eyes, turning his attention towards the military me, all of whom have guns pointed at him. \"You're lucky I'm still feeling groggy from whatever you knocked me out with.  Otherwise half of you'd be dead by now,\" he murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the crap,\" Lakarta snaps. \"Follow my men and don't try anything.  If you do anything... funny, you'll be dead quicker'n you can swish your tail.  I don't even know why you're allowed to live, after everything you've done,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferret coughs slightly. \"Whatever.  But I'm keeping the human,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou protest loudly, trying to get a response from Lakarta, but he refuses to make eye contact.  Grunting slightly, he motions for his men to lead the giant down the tunnel.  The ferret shifts into a crawling position, making his way through the room and into the rough-hewn tunnel beyond.  Military men surround him, pointing guns up at him as he makes the journey.  At the far end of the hall is the heavy steel door to Room A.  You'd seen the positively massive door before, with its innumerable locking mechanisms and security features, and wondered what on earth it was there for.  Perhaps now you had an answer.  A technician at the control panel presses a few final keys and the door swung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In!\" urges Lakarta, and the ferret silently complied.  You crane your neck back to see the door closing heavily behind you.  Someone will come back for you, right?  Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you see that Room A is...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How nice. They made the bed for me.\" The ferret slowly pans his eyes across the room, a slight melancholy seeming to come over him. You glance around and are surprised to see that the room seems to be furnished with giant, albeit primitive, looking furniture. A rigid-looking chair looks to be bolted against one wall beside a firm square-shaped table. A long bed with one circus-tent-sized, coarse-looking blanket juts off of the adjacent wall, appearing only slightly more comfortable than the chair. Above the bed is a shelf with two rather dusty-looking books stacked on it, and at the far end of the room you see what seems to be a huge toilet (the thought of having to clean something like that instantly made you shudder). Everything has a sleek white gleam to it, like something straight out of a bad seventies sci-fi movie. It looks cavernous to you, but as you look up and notice that the ferret's hair brushes against the ceiling as he stands up, you realize that to him, it must be no bigger than a small bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d you say as you take a deep breath, mustering up the courage to start a conversation with your captor, \u201cwhat happens now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow?\u201d The ferret scoffs, turning his head down towards you with a bemused expression. \u201cNow they 'observe' me in here for the next few months while they try to figure out what the hell to do with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFew months?\u201d you gulp. For some reason, the thought of being long-term cellmates with a mustelid that could stuff you in between his toes wasn't too appealing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a sigh escape from his lips as he sits down in the chair, resting his fist, with you in it, on the table surface. \u201cDon't worry,\u201d he says as he rolls his eyes, \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna stay in here forever with me. They probably need you to mix some chemicals or charge the electrons or whatever it is you lab geeks do.\u201d He loosens his grip, allowing you to slip through his fingers. \u201cGo on, get out of here. I'm sure they\u2019ll let you through the door if you knock and ask nicely.\u201d As your feet hit the table surface, you quickly scamper a safe distance away from the ferret's hand, glad to not be constricted anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as you turn to look back at the massive fur sitting there, his shoulders slumping slightly as he sits, you can't help but start to feel slightly sorry for him. You're not sure why; for all you know, he could be an evil genius who enlarged himself to massive proportions so he could wreck havoc and kill countless thousands of people. But he doesn't seem like that kind of guy. Sure, he may have been a little snarky with the marines a few minutes ago, but nothing about him appeared overly vicious (well, other than those sharp-as-ever, three-foot-long teeth). It seems like a crazy idea, but you feel like you have to find out more.</span></div></div>",

And I\u2019m sure there are some buildings left more or less intact,\u201d Pyrrhus shrugged. \u201cHot damn, was that fun.  And sexy.  I\u2019m getting a boner just thinking about it,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for sharing,\u201d you groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.

Wait, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus just about drops you back to the surface of the table, his eyes moistening. \u201cFuck, I\u2019m terrible.  You\u2019re right.  It\u2019s just, so many terrible things had been happening to me.  My life sucked.  So when I got huge, well, I decided to do terrible things.  Terrible things I regret now.

So I'm stuck here, and you're offering to stay even though you want to be here even less than I do.\" He leaned back, his head tilting against the back of his chair and staring at the ceiling. \"The last thing I need is a little guy here guilt tripping me this entire time. I have enough problems on my own. So just scurry away, or whatever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I offered to stay because I know what you're going through.\" He seemed to pause for a moment, before his head moved back down, an eyebrow raised as he looked at you. He gave a small chuckle, and you grunted as you shook your head. \"Fine, not the whole 'giant trashing a city' thing. But seeing as this lab's under military control, and I'm not exactly in the best position, myself. Even if I tried to walk out now, they'd probably send me back in here the moment they want something from you. So you can trust me when I say I know things are a mess. I figure... We might as well make the most of this. And I'd rather just get to know you and talk with you and stuff... And from the sounds of it, you... You probably could use someone to talk to as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... So you actually want to stay? Of your free will and all? You're not scared or anything?\" His head leaned in a little closer to you as he turned in his chair, making you freeze up as you see him approach you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? I've got a giant ferret next to me, and a full army waiting outside and keeping their eyes on me, and I'm offering to make this a full-time thing. Right now, I'm terrified out of my mind.\" You swallow a little as you see his eyes close, and take a slow step closer. \"B-but... you're just as scared right now, aren't you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there in silence for a moment, not knowing what to expect. Neither of you set a word, and as the seconds ticked by, you were starting to worry that he would lose it, or break down, or something. You quietly sat on the table as he kept still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after a minute, you saw his eyes open again. He simply gave a small nod before speaking again. \"Yeah... I am. This whole thing is crazy...\" His hand pressed down on the table next to you, and you nearly rolled back to avoid it reflexively. \"I mean, look at me. One minute I'm getting lunch, and the next thing I know, my head was bursting through the building. After that...\" He gave a small grunt as he lifted his hand up, a slight impression left on the table. \"Building was in pieces around me.\" He seemed to be smiling a bit again, and you weren't eager to let him continue on his train of thought. \"Felt weird at first, but by the time I got my balance aga-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point is...\" You quietly interrupted, and though he still had his grin, his eyes were looking at you again. \"Things are weird all around right now. But you... You don't really seem like a bad guy. So... Yeah, I'd like to stay with you... If you're okay with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're better than I expected from some lab geek.\" He spoke rather quietly, his voice speaking with a slight tone of annoyance. \"Thanks for the offer.\" He closed his eyes for a moment, looking like he was uncertain as well. However, it didn't take long before you heard him speak again. </span></div></div>",

Perhaps, you think, the two of you have made some sort of connection. \"Just don't forget, Ridge,\" Pyrrhus continues, pointing a long black finger in your face, \"if you start to do any kind of experimenting on me in here, I can always use you as a Q-tip or something.\" So much for a connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think you'll have to worry about that,\" you say, your voice cracking slightly. \"Don't tell my boss, but in Science I'm a C student, at best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus chuckles slightly, then stands back up to his full height and starts to pace around the room, leaving you eye level with his waist and giving you a full view of his body for the first time since the two of you were in the back of the truck. Nowhere near as nervous now, you find yourself more able to examine and appreciate the ferret's slender build. His legs are long and toned, and his chest and stomach muscles look tight and firm - he definitely takes good care of himself. If the situation were slightly different...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do we do this?\" His sudden question interrupts your thoughts. \"I mean, I doubt the guys out there will let me stomp on over to your house, rip out your bedroom, and carry it back on over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, probably not.\" You think for a moment. \"I suppose I could ask them to let me bring in a mattress or a cot and some blankets. I think that's all I'll need, really. I could sleep right here on this table.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Pyrrhus bends over to look at you closer. \"How will you get up and down here every day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" That thought didn't occur to you. You peer over the edge, noticing for the first time the forty foot drop. \"Well, I suppose you could pick me up and place me down each time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus frowns, his large eyes narrowing, as he brings his muzzle closer to you. \"What, so is that all I am to you? A talking ferrety elevator?\" You worry for a moment that you've offended him, but then his face suddenly changes to a wide grin, and he exhales deeply, the force of his breath pushing you backward, nearly knocking you over. \"I'm just kidding, Ridge. I'm not that easily offended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, relieved to still be in the ferret's good graces. \"Yeah, I knew that,\" you lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, are you sure you don't want to set up on the floor?\" He points to the corner of the room opposite the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider this for a moment, then shake your head. \"I don't think that would be a good idea. No offense, but I don't want to be squished underfoot by a groggy ferret who has just gotten out of bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken,\" Pyrrhus says, nodding. \"Fine. You go out and see if you can get what you need. I'll\u2026 wait here, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picks you up, holding you a little gentler than before, and sets you back down on the floor by where you came in. It is at this moment that both you and Pyrrhus simultaneously realize your problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" you wonder aloud, staring at the massive door in front of you that is closed and looks to stay that way for the foreseeable future, \"how exactly am I gonna get out of here?\"</span></div></div>",

You shook your head quietly as he leaned in, the sudden movement startling you a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to him, and try to shout at him. \"Just trying to figure out how-\" He gave his hand a bit of a wave as you shouted, shaking his head a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to yell... Can hear you just fine if you talk. You were muttering, that's all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little surprised that he could hear you speaking from that distance, but gave a small nod at him. \"Yeah... Just wondering how I can get out... I mean, I don't think I'm going to be using your door...\" You glance around nearby, your eyes pausing as you see a small section cut out next to it, another smaller door nearby. \"Wait... Think there's another door here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... I guess they've got a door for you little ones. Makes sense... I doubt my hand would even fit through that...\" He seemed to pause a little bit as he glanced to it, before his eyes moved back to you. You started to walk, but his stare unnerved you a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not running away, if that's what you're thinking... I said I'd stay.\" You tried to speak, but he only gave a noncommittal nod in response. You could hear him moving and climbing back into the bed, grunting a bit as he leaned onto one of his hands. However, though you weren't watching, you couldn't help feel Pyrrhus's eyes watching you quietly as you moved. It wasn't like there was anything else for him to do, but it still made you feel a little disconcerted knowing the giant was keeping his eyes on you. And, with the size of the room, it took you longer than you'd like to move to the door. You couldn't help but feel a little relieved when you heard him shifting in his bed, hoping he had turned over and wasn't staring at you anymore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused for a moment when you arrived at the solid steel door ahead of you. It didn't look like it had a knob or latch, or any way of opening it from this side. You tried to give it a knock, but only managed to make a soft \"thunk\" when your hand made contact. You waited for a second, but it was clear that it didn't really manage to make a sound. You grunt before trying to give it a firm kick, the sound ringing out a bit more this time. You swallow as you wait there for a second, before you see the door open a crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprised you're still in one piece.\" You hear an unfamiliar voice from beyond the door, and spot an eye peeking through the crack. \"There was a pot going around the place, and some had put money down for the ferret swallowing you before the hour's up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wha... You're all...\" You clench your first a bit, but shake your head and give a small grunt as you try to keep your mind clear. You try to keep calm, trying to figure out exactly what you should say. They certainly weren't listening to what you wanted, but they at least seemed to want to keep Pyrrhus in passable condition for the moment. \"Whatever... Look. I... I think that I'm going to be... That he wants me to stay with him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the warning, but we already knew that. I'm not going to be the one to argue with him, and the lieutenant says to let him do whatever as long as he stays put in his room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not asking for a rescue or anything right now.\" You see the main raise an eyebrow, but give your head a quick shake. \"Look. Can I just... You know. Get a few sheets or something for when I sleep? We have some laying around in the place, right? I think that we should have some in storage, at least...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna sleep with that thing watching? Your call, I suppose.\u201d The man shook his head quietly, rolling his eyes a bit. \u201cHang on a second...\" You hear a momentary bit of static, and notice the man pulling back and raise his arm up. You hear him speaking into what you assume is a radio, and hear a muffled response. \"Someone will bring it over later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...  Thanks... Hope that they get here sometime today...\" You try to look around, the lighting in the labs making it difficult for you to figure out what the time Is. As you do, you hear a laugh from beyond the door.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't count on it. Most of us are busy enough preparing for our big guest, here. \" The man seemed to pause, shaking his head a bit. \"And that's not counting the number of people they're using as guards. You should just be glad that you're still in one piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to speak, but close it before you say a word. You certainly didn't feel like Pyrrhus would be a danger to you, but you weren't in a place to speak. He had just admitted to a rather massive bit of destruction, and though he seemed calm now, you weren't quite sure exactly how he might react. \"Fine... I'd just... appreciate it if I could get it before night or something.\" You start to turn away, but stop as something registers in your mind. \"Wait a minute... What do you mean, 'Preparing for him?' \" You couldn't help getting an ominous feeling at those words, but the man laughed again before speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry. We were given orders to keep him alive. If the higher-ups wanted him dead, you'd know. We're quite ready to put him down if he acts out too much, but we brought him here alive for a reason. We're not going to be put his life in danger. Not unless we have a good reason to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow a bit, but manage to speak out softly. \"W-well, then... What do you need to prepare for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy? You think it's even possible to suddenly drag a hundred-foot beast in without some preparation? The lab might be set up for someone like him to suddenly drop in, but nobody really keeps everything ready for a giant to drop in at any moment. There are still some other things that need to get done. And right now,\" He quietly stated, his eyes turned from the door and his back facing you as he spoke, \"we need to get a few more things done quickly. After all...\"</span></div></div>",

Sitting down on the cold sheets, you lean back against his thigh, which is significantly warmer in comparison. \"Okay, I think I'm as comfy as I'm gonna get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Here goes nothing.\" He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, then begins. \"So about a month or so ago, I was more or less like you, probably. I mean, I still had my ferrety good looks and all, and I didn't intern at a crazy research lab or anything, but in other respects, I was a typical teenage fur. I wasn't super popular or anything, but I had friends, I had a normal life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, trying to picture Pyrrhus as anything but the one-hundred foot tall giant that he is now. The more you considered it, though, the more you felt that he might have fit in with you and your circle of friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues, \"That all came to a crashing halt, though, the day of the accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen a little. \"Accident? What kind of accident?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you with a slight sense of sadness in his eyes. \"The kind that explodes in your face and causes you to be doused head to toe in radioactive beams during a field trip to a local nuclear plant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's-- that's horrible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was,\" Pyrrhus nods. \"Half the class and nearly all the plant workers who were in the room where the explosion happened died within a few hours of the accident from massive radiation poisoning, if they didn't die immediately at the scene from the blast. But a few of us escaped with seemingly no injuries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilt your head to the side in puzzlement. \"How is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferret shrugs, scoffing as he does so. \"Beats me. When the doctors examined us, they found no trace of radiation in our bodies at all, even though the room was (and still is) flooded with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" you think for a few moments, \"it's almost as if the radiation just bounced off of your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Hell if I know.\" Pyrrhus rolls on his side towards the wall, causing the bed to shift for a moment and knocking you over. You jump to your feet and move a bit closer to the edge of the bed, afraid of what would happen if he suddenly rolls the other way.\u00a0\u201cBut anyways, the doctors kept a close eye on me after the accident, taking blood samples and measurements and stuff twice a day. Nothing seemed to change until about a week after the accident, when I suddenly grew about six inches overnight. The next day, I woke up about ten feet tall, and the day after that I was about the size I am now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, it happened that quickly?\u201d Something about the idea of Pyrrhus growing big so fast seems...

A fox dressed in a smart military uniform steps onto a platform that you hadn't noticed before, clearing his throat.  Getting up from the bed, Pyrrhus crossed the room in a few strides.

He quickly shakes his head around to try to clear it out, then turns to look at you. You can see his uncertain, and you aren't in a position to give him any advice. However, it certainly felt like it wouldn't be good for him to try anything. If he was actually going to remain safe, then there wasn't much for you to consider. If he was going to remain inside and keep thinking on breaking out, or if he got hungry... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force yourself to nod before your worries fill your thoughts.

The fox didn't say a word, but you can see his posture change and relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good... There are men outside to escort you. Provided you don't resist, you'll be able to go outside and... stretch your legs a little beforehand.\" The fox turned to walk out, but paused as he watched Pyrrhus return to pick you up. \"What are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm taking this guy with me. He's mine now, after all. I assume you don't have any complaints?\" Pyrrhus talked as if it were a statement, and not a question. His hand moved down for you, grabbing you a bit tighter than you would've liked. \"I doubt he'll get in the way... He'd barely be a blip on anything big enough to measure me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox keeps quiet for a moment, as if to consider it. It takes a few seconds before he responds. </span></div></div>",

No funny business,\" he instructs sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant ferret casts one final scathing glance at the fox before striding through the door.  The hallway is poorly lit, snaking through the facility to the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pyrrhus, what the hell is going on with you?\" you finally ask, more than a bit irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant lifts you up to his face, stopping in his tracks as he does so. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shift uncomfortably in the ferret's fist. \"I thought you felt bad.  But now you, here you are, threatening to eat everyone and carrying me around like some kind of action figure.  And I'm NOT your property,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus hesitates a moment. \"Look, I'm sorry.  But I was just trying to stay in charge of the situation.

You are about to express the doubt you have that Pyrrhus's strategy is one that will work in the long run when the giant's fist carrying you drops down by his hip once again, leaving your stomach somewhere near his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the hall is a large open courtyard.  Walls twice as tall as Pyrrhus ring an open space with a small table and several devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" the fox says, stepping out on a small balcony by the door. \"Time...</span></div></div>",

I'm already exposed enough as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax,\u201d the fox says. \u201cThe entire procedure is done with advanced equipment, mostly using lasers. You\u2019ll never even feel a thing. Just sit down by the table and take a few deep breaths.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Pyrrhus follows the instructions, sitting down on a makeshift chair which you soon realize is made of several large metal crates stacked together. At first, Pyrrhus holds you on his lap, but after a few moments the fox clears his throat. \u201cUm, I'm sorry, but in order for us to get the correct measurements, you can\u2019t be... carrying... someone, like that,\u201d he says, motioning in your direction. \u201cCan you please set him down on the table?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus rolls his eyes but complies, and the fox quietly leaves the room. As you are freed from the giant ferret\u2019s fingers, you gasp, taking in as much fresh air as you can. You don\u2019t mind being around the big ferret and keeping him company, but the sudden movement of being lifted up and down fifty or seventy-five feet in the air at a time is beginning to make you queasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, you become aware of a gradual humming building from the equipment that\u2019s sitting on the table. There are several large machines, looking a little something like what you imagine old military supercomputers should look like, with lots of blinking lights and whirring dials that start coming to life. \u201cDidn\u2019t they say this was \u2019advanced\u2019 equipment?\u201d you say to Pyrrhus as a wry smile begins to creep across your face. \u201cIt looks like something that belongs in the fifties!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus chuckles, shaking his head. \u201cHey, your taxpayer dollars at work, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the room grows silent once again. \u201cIs that it?\u201d you ask aloud, assuming the fox (or whoever is running the tests) can hear through embedded microphones or something. \u201cAre we done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the fox\u2019s voice responds through a loudspeaker attached to the wall. \u201cYes, we\u2019re done for tonight. The two of you may return to your room. A doctor will stop in tomorrow morning to ask some follow-up questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally,\u201d Pyrrhus says as he sighs in relief, standing up and scooping you back into his paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head back through the halls to the room, Pyrrhus brings you up closer to his face, and you can tell he's uncomfortable about something. \u201cHey Ridge?\u201d he asks, his voice much lower than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Thanks.\u201d He looks down away, running his other paw through his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor putting up with me. For not running away when you had the chance.\u201d He stops walking and closes his eyes for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ve never really had a good friend before, and I kinda figured that being a mega-sized freak meant that ship would have sailed, but...\u201d As he opens his eyes again, you see what you swear is tears starting to form in them. \u201c...I\u2019m glad I met you, Ridge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re taken aback a bit by his words and his sudden shift in demeanor. Maybe he was telling the truth earlier, and the whole \u201cscary monster\u201d act really was just for show. And you can't deny that he does stir up certain feelings in you, ones that you aren\u2019t quite sure about yet but think you may like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wrestle with these conflicting thoughts and emotions, you can feel his big wet eyes staring at you, waiting for a reply.

And when you think about how he normally acts compared to how he's acting now, you're not eager to have him slip back into using it. A bit of you wants to brush him off, to let him know how it feels dealing with someone who won't cooperate. But a part of you just knows that things will be better if you just talk openly with him. Pyrrhus is already doing more than enough acting for the two of you, and it feels like it's up to you to try to keep things clear between the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Pyrrhus... I'm glad I met you, too. I mean... This has been a weird day for the two of us, huh? But... But I can think of things that would be a whole lot worse.\" You give an awkward chuckle, moving your hand down to try to hold his the best you can manage. \"I... I'm still honestly not sure what I can do for you, but... But, I'm here if you need to talk. I can still manage that much, huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus wipes his eyes a little bit as he laughs weakly. \u201cReally, it's... It's more than what I'm used to. I don't think I've talked to anybody this much in a long time. So... Thanks for listening.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime, Pyrrhus. I don't know about what everybody else here thinks of you, but I think you're a good guy. At least, when you're not threatening to bite my head off or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus has a small smile on his face as he crawls and creeps through the tunnels, returning to his room. \u201cDon't worry. I'm pretty sure you're too small to even be a snack now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just shake your head a few times, trying to ignore the comment as the two of you arrive back into the room. You heard the sound of metal moving as the door closes and locks behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, though, Pyrrhus...\u201d You speak quietly as you see him shifting, using the opportunity to stretch out a bit. \u201cI kind of wish we had met before all of this crazy stuff happened. Before you ended up as a giant and got arrested, I mean. It... It probably would've been nice to be friends then. And... Um... Well, maybe...\u201d You swallow again as your eyes pass over his body again, watching him move and shift onto his bed. You have to shake your head a little to keep from staring as you watch his legs spreading, his firm stomach loosening... Even as he lays down and stretches out, he keeps you secure in his hand this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... Yeah, it would've been nice to meet you before, and to just hang out with you.\u201d Pyrrhus's eyes are looking at the wall, his gaze a little unfocused. You're a little worried that your comment's gone too far, but his response tells you otherwise. \u201cWell... Too late for that now.\u201d With a slight sigh, he releases you, letting you sit on his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we can't exactly head out for pizza together or something. But I'm sure we can still figure out something to do. Like...\u201d You shift a little awkwardly as you look back at Pyrrhus from your spot on his chest. \u201cErm... Well, I guess I know you a little better now. Is there anything you'd want to ask me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus's eyes close for a moment, but they open again. He gives a small nod, your seat shaking a little when his chest moves in response. \u201cActually, yeah. I've been wondering...\u201d You hold on tight to a few strands of fur as you feel him leaning up a little bit. His voice is a little awkward, but he's got an odd look on his face as he asks...</span></div></div>",

No.  Let's just calm down a second.  Really, we only just met.  This is kinda crazy.  Too fast.

Can you just put me on the night table?  I see they've moved in some things so I can live here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferret sights sullenly and plucks you up, moving you across to the stand, where a small makeshift \"room\" has been set up for you.

Sadness, lust, compassion, fear, understanding -- if you had a checklist of every emotion possible, you're probably experiencing something close to each one right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling back over towards Pyrrhus, you see that the ferret has sat back down on his bed, his chin resting against his palm with a sullen look on his face, staring at the wall. There\u2019s no way you\u2019ll be able to go to bed with this hanging over your head; you realize you need to make this right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, Pyrrhus,\u201d you begin.

I\u2019m not going to say this very well, so just let me bumble through it, okay?\u201d Pyrrhus turns his head slightly towards you, a glint of curiosity in his eyes and his ears perking up as you continue. \u201cI-- I fucked up, okay? I know you\u2019re probably just as confused and unsure as I am right now -- more, probably. I just -- I don\u2019t want us to rush things and ruin something that could be good. You know what I'm saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSort of,\u201d Pyrrhus shrugs as he turns on his side. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve got a lot of... stress and stuff built up inside of me. I just thought it would be good to, you know, have some fun and let it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\" You feel a little better now that you've gotten that out, though a question pops into your mind. \"Is that what Chicago was about?\u201d you ask with a wry smile. \u201cVenting out frustration?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore or less,\u201d Pyrrhus returns your grin. \u201cI guess there were probably healthier ways to satisfy my urges, but that seemed like the... I don't know, most fun?\u201d He stops for a moment as he rolls on his back and stares up at the ceiling. \u201cBut you know something? I didn't really have all that much fun doing that. Oh, sure, there was a thrill of dominating over so many and destroying in a few seconds what it took years to build up, and there was of course release of a... sexual nature...\u201d Your heart skips a beat at this, the picture in your mind of the massive ferret having his way with an entire city frightening but more than a little exciting. \u201cHowever,\u201d he continues, \u201cit was sort of...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHollow?\u201d you suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus considers this word before nodding. \u201cYeah.

Maybe I can help you...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice trails off, but you\u2019ve definitely piqued Pyrrhus\u2019s interest. He stands up again and walks over towards your side of the room. His hips are level with the table surface, and you can clearly see that all this talk has gotten him aroused. His sheath hangs seemingly right in front of your face, already nearly twice as long as you are tall and not yet fully erect. Your mind races with what you could do with all that ferret-ness as Pyrrhus\u2019s strong, slightly spicy-yet-sweet musk fills your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d he asks, a suggestive smile looming down at you from high overhead. Even though you're fully clothed, you can tell right away that Pyrrhus knows you're just as excited as he is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... Um...

His grip is firm but not uncomfortable as he bears you back towards the bed.  You can practically feel his excitement, something you more than share.  Yet mingling with your surge of anticipation is a dose of nerves.  What are you supposed to do?  <i>How</i> are you even supposed to do it?  What if Pyrrhus accidentally crushes you in the throes of his passion?  You try to brush aside your nervousness.  Pyrrhus won't hurt you.  Nothing bad will happen.  Never mind the fact that he destroyed--no.  That was in the past.  That was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach lurches as you are lifted upward again, and Pyrrhus is kissing you, caressing you with his tongue and lips.  You do your best to return the favor, stroking his upper lip with a hand and trying to kiss back.  You giggle as the giant tears away your shirt with his front teeth, spitting it aside somewhere onto the bed he's sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off your clothes,\" he murmurs, his silky voice reverberating through your body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a daze, you comply, depositing your shoes, socks, pants, and underwear in a pile next to you.  Suddenly self-conscious, you sit down in the center of Pyrrhus' palm, hugging your knees to your chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you're <i>cute</i>,\" Pyrrhus grins, lying back on the bed.  You blush even more deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is barely any time to think as you are dropped somewhat unceremoniously down by Pyrrhus' navel.  A vast ferrety landscape is all around you, but you know exactly where you're supposed to go.  Every step through the Pyrrhus' warm, dense fur brings you closer to his fully-erect ferrethood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant bucks slightly as you reach out and touch his arousal.  You nearly fall over, but manage to regain your balance.  Encouraged by his appreciative rumble, you start to massage him with your hands.  Getting more into it, you pull yourself close to Pyrrhus' cock, rubbing it with your arms and legs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus snorts with mild derision as you try and fail to shimmy up his ferrethood.  You shoot him a dirty look over your shoulder as you make a third failed attempt.  Apparently deeming you too inept to properly please him, you suddenly find yourself mashed between Pyrrhus' cock and his hand.  You gasp as he begins to rub you up and down along his length.  Between the friction and the ever-increasing throbbing of Pyrrhus' ferrethood, you can barely stand it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Pyrrhus can't either.   There is a sharp jerk and Pyrrhus releases his grip, dropping you to the base of his cock as he bellows out his orgasm.  You find yourself drenched in the ferret's warm, sticky cum as you lay there winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus' fingers pluck you up, lifting you towards his face.  His rough wet tongue is dragged along your body, cleaning you off.  Then his tongue returns to your waist, lapping insistently.  You yelp in surprise and delight as he holds you against his muzzle.  It doesn't take you that long to come, and when you do, it feels sublime.  You collapse limply against the gigantic ferret's lips.  Pyrrhus moves you gently to his collar, cradling you against his body.  You rub your hand through his fur, smiling contentedly to yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean we're boyfriends or something?\" Pyrrhus whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" you giggle softly in reply. \"I love you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Pyrrhus' face to see that his eyes are damp and he is beaming.  You pat him on the collarbone, smiling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Uh...\" You awkwardly mumble, and you can see Pyrrhus turning away a little suddenly. \"I mean... One step at a time and all... I can try to cuddle in with you or something for now, if we can figure out how we can do that...\" Pyrrhus still looks a little bit down, but he's at least managing a genuine smile as he reaches over, his hand moving towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Uh... That sounds good to me...\" He carefully lifts you, almost immediately pulling you in tight against his body. \"I'll be honest, though... Even if I'm just holding you, there's no way I'm gonna keep this monster down...\" He flashes you a grin, his free hand giving his length a quick squeeze to indicate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle a little and awkwardly shift in his hand, your pants awkwardly rubbing in against yourself as you do. \"Yeah, I can't blame you for that. I mean, you really are something to look at...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like this?\" Pyrrhus lets off a playful growl, stomping a bit as he walks back to his bed. In the empty room, the sound of his footsteps echoed clearly, almost making you worry as you felt your body dragged along at a quick pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't overdo it... I don't think they'll have a bigger room for you if you damage this one!\" You're almost laughing as you watch him stomping around, his body moving easily, his shifting movements a lot more graceful than what you expected from a hundred-foot giant. You're almost staring as he makes his way back to the bed, a sudden sweeping feeling filling you as he just lays back, your body almost bouncing against him. He grins and chuckles a little at the thought, his hand still pressing your body in firmly against his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They might need it. If I'm not done growing, then this place won't keep me. I'll be able to just grow right out of it. That'll be a sight to see...\" His eyes move, gazing down along his arm as he looks over himself. You see his shaft jump a little more at the idea, and you can't help but laugh as his tail thumps eagerly against the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, easy, now. It's already hard enough thinking about how we can manage this! Forget holding me in your hand, I'll barely fit in a finger if this keeps up!\" You do your best to pat his chest a few times, your hands having trouble making it through his fur, your full attention going into trying to push against his body. You awkwardly shift a little bit, uncertain if he's even feeling it. But his gaze slowly moves back to you, a slight blush on his face. \"Um... Pyrrhus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I'm just... Amazed. I mean... I've stomped on more than enough things and barely felt an itch, but... But right now... I can feel it. I mean... It's gentle, but I can feel you.\" He almost has a nervous look in his eyes, but you can only smile as you look back at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad.\" You only manage to mumble a little as you rest your head in against his fur. \"Means that we can still do something like this together.\" You try to turn a little, your arms resting against Pyrrhus's hand while you look down and over his body. \"Too bad we can't... You know. Really have a date like this. I'm pretty sure we'd need to head to every restaurant in the city before we got enough food for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we could always try for a trek across the state or something.\" Pyrrhus chuckles a little, his shaft still incessantly shifting in front of your eyes. \"That wouldn't be too bad, come to think of it. If I'm this big, I might as well give you an experience you couldn't imagine otherwise...\" He gives a small, playful growl as he pushes you a little more firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wouldn't be too bad. Just... You know. Don't drop me or something while you walk.\" You mumble a little awkwardly, but Pyrrhus just laughs and shakes it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'm not clumsy or anything. I only broke a few things because I wanted to.\" He grins a little before shaking his head. \"Was quite a sight... And if I get any bigger...\" As he mentions it again, you just give a small nod, your eyes just staring into his chest, watching it rise and fall with his steady breaths as you think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not even sure what you feel about the idea of Pyrrhus getting bigger. It's already difficult enough for you to try to talk to him or have him hold you. The room that he remained in was big, but it's hardly built for anything bigger than Pyrrhus already is. And if he ever felt violent, you didn't even know if the country would still be in one piece after. But the idea of getting a better view of the massive ferret, of letting his footsteps sink into the ground, of having his soft, warm fingers pushing you into his endless sea of fur... You had to admit that the idea of it made your heart race. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're silent for a little too long, and Pyrrhus fidgets a little under you as he waits for you to respond. You awkwardly blurt out, \"Hey, just don't forget us little people if you end up bigger.\" You try to laugh it off, but your eyes can't help but watch his as his gaze turns from his body down to you. You're not sure what to expect, but you can feel a finger gently cradling your body in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I won't. There's no way I'll forget about you.\" You feel a finger pushing in against your back, Pyrrhus chuckling as your entire body seems to shift up and along his body with the motion. \"I mean... Even if we don't go any further... You've made me feel a lot better than I have in a long while. And besides, even if we can't manage something together... Well, you've given me something to look at, at least.\" Pyrrhus gives you an awkward wink, his shaft's scent still constantly filling the air as he speaks. You're not sure how much you're blushing, but your face feels warmer than it's ever been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awkwardly move against his chest, your eyes closing as you think. If Pyrrhus did get bigger, then any physical thing with him would probably go from difficult to impossible. But you didn't want to rush this. You didn't want to ruin whatever relationship you had growing with a careless attempt at sex. But as you think, you realize there's something that you felt comfortable doing for him. \"Hey, Pyrrhus? Get your head down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? What is it?\" Pyrrhus awkwardly moves and shifts, trying to bed his head down to his chest. You scootch up a little bit, barely shifting in his hand as you move. Eventually, you manage to reach closer to his face. You press in as close as you can before planting the biggest kiss you can manage onto his lip. His eyes widen as he feels it, and his hand pushes your body in a little closer as his mouth returns it, the feeling of his lips moving against your entire body more intense than anything you've imagined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe. I know it's not quite what you wanted tonight, but... I hope you feel better, Pyrrhus.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Yeah, I do.\" Pyrrhus has a wide smile on his face as he pulls his head back, his eyes never leaving you for a moment.  </span></div></div>",

Being around Pyrrhus fills you with a sense of exhilaration so great you feel as if you could take on the world.  He's better than caffeine or one of those disgusting energy drinks you'd come to rely on for survival in classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if he'd read your mind, Pyrrhus shifts slightly under you. \"You're not tired, are you?\" he asks.  \"I mean, it's no trouble if you are, but I'm not at all sleepy,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not!\" you reply hastily. \"I just kissed a ferret twenty times my size.  I'm on top of the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thrumming of his chest shakes you gently as the massive ferret chuckles.  His hand comes swooping out of nowhere, bearing you up towards his face.  His enormous rough tongue licks you playfully. \"Glad you enjoyed it.  Gods know I did,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant shifts into a sitting position, leaning against the wall with his knees hugged against his chest.  He sets you gently on his right kneecap so you're at eye-level with him, his enormous nose a few feet away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might as well get to know the boy I just made out with,\" Pyrrhus smiles thinly. \"Tell me about yourself,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hours fly by in a blur of conversation.  You'd known you liked Pyrrhus, but it wasn't until now that he'd really opened up to you.  Chatting away the hours, you discover that the ferret was warm, friendly, and actually quite funny.  You just wish he wasn't quite so large.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blaring of the morning alarm scared the shit out of me, and evidently Pyrrhus too, as he jerked violently.  You let out a shout as you feel yourself slipping off his knee.  Pyrrhus's hand comes out of nowhere, catching you gently before you fall too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?  I'm so sorry!\" Pyrrhus gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.  Thanks for the catch, man,\" you reply, slightly winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus looks around to see the vulpine general from the day before standing once again on the platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it now?\" he asks impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one thing, I wanted to let you know your breakfast will be a bit late today.  Things are running a bit behind in the mess hall,\" the fox replies, his tone measured. \"But more importantly, I wanted to let you know that...\"</span></div></div>",

We'd put her in a different room, but seeing as we only have this one, looks like you're going to have a room-mate.  We couldn't anticipate an epidemic of giganticism, if you will,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a further word, the fox turns on his heels and leaves.  Pyrrhus lifts you up to his face, just as puzzled as you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you were alone,\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was!\" Pyrrhus replies. \"I have no idea what's going on right now,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my.  Aren't we a looker?\" came a silky voice from the doorway Pyrrhus had come through the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraped across the doorway was a ferretess just as large as Pyrrhus.  She was certainly attractive, with a sleek svelte body just as lithe in build as Pyrrhus (come to think of it, you can't recall ever meeting an overweight ferret).  Her body was just as naked as Pyrrhus's, with silky brown and black fur and hair.  She seemed supremely casual about her situation, but something seemed off.  While Pyrrhus somehow managed to come across approachable despite his stature, she seemed... dangerous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" was all Pyrrhus managed to reply.  You are more than a little irritated to see that he is suddenly rendered slack-jawed, taken aback by the newcomer's good looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My.  Two giant ferrets and only one bed to share.  Pity,\" the ferretess murmured, gliding across the room towards Pyrrhus. \"Name's Sabrina, by the way,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Pyrrhus.  Trust me.  Everyone knows your name by now.  All over the news.  Gotta admire what you were doing, though.  Kinky stuff,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was wrong.  What I did,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.  One night in the pokey and you're already going soft.  No.  What you did was amazing.  You were right: show those insignificant little people how little they mean to us.  We're <i>better</i> than them, Pyr,\" Sabrina breathed in Pyrrhus' ear.  Though he continued to try to hold out, you can't help but notice his body starting to betray his attraction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of little, who the fuck is this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but squeak slightly as Sabrina plucks you off Pyrrhus's palm between her thumb and forefinger.  She studies you closely, her warm breath washing over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my friend.  Ridge.  That's his name,\" Pyrrhus stammers. \"He's our room-mate,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Sabrina doesn't seem to approve. \"Well.  Guess Ridge will have to just watch himself.

After a bit he finally spoke. \"I snatched him up when they were dragging me into this room. I was going to eat him or keep him as a slave, but I kinda felt sorry for the little guy when those military guys just joked about how long he'd last. Plus he's kinda cute so I figured I'd keep him as a pet.\" Sabrina nodded in response as you looked a little bit annoyed with that description. \"Pe-?!\" Before you could complain, Phyrrhus shifted a finger over your mouth to silence you. <br>\r\n\"I guess he is kinda cute.\" Sabrina admitted \"And they really don't care that you're keeping him?\" Your captor shook his head \"Like I said, they didn't really care what happened to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw what he was doing. As demeaning as it felt, he was probably drawing enough pity to save your skin from any impulse acts of superiority from your new roommate. Still you really didn't like being called his pet. Maybe you should speak up and get them both to respect you as a person. Though she didn't really seem to respect people in general earlier.  And based on a few things you secretly imagined last night as things heated up, being his pet Was probably far from a bad scenario for you. Still that could be a slippery slope.

You feel the giant's hand curling around you once again and you prepare yourself for yet another trip.  The preparedness comes to nought as a voice cuts over the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pyrrhus alone.  Ridge is not allowed to accompany,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus curses loudly at the intercom.  \"Try and stop me!  Ridge goes where I go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, listen, big guy.  You might want to go along with them.  We don't want to piss somebody off and get you in more trouble than you already are,\" you suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus growls inwardly, but complies, placing you back on the side table none too gently.  You can't help but smile to yourself as you watch the massive ferret's svelte frame glide through the opening door, his tail swishing irritably back and forth.  Perhaps sleeping with him the night before would have been a good idea, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes crawl by at an excruciating pace and you have to entertain yourself by alternating between staring at a wall of your choice and pacing back and forth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive bellow startles you out of your reverie, announcing the return of Pyrrhus.  The ten-story ferret hurtles into the room in a blur of brown, black, and white and launches himself onto his bed.  He lays there in a heap, shaking slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Pyrr?\" you offer tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is silence from the giant's end of the room.  At length Pyrrhus looks over at you. \"They want to make me a monster,\" he mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They hauled me into that stupid room and told me they finally found a use for me.  They want me to be some sort of weapon for them.  The War is stagnating, and I'm just the hundred-foot super weapon they've been waiting for,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  That's completely insane,\" you breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you could explain that to them, that would be great.  But all I am to them is a gigantic, virtually invincible ferret with a 'penchant for destruction', as they called it,\" Pyrrhus fumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gods.  Pyrr, I'm so sorry,\" you reply, not sure what else to say.  Almost haphazardly, you add, \"Come over here.  I want to kiss you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus can't help but smile thinly.  \"At this point, only sex will make me feel better,\" he teases, but obliges, crossing the room and kneels down so his face is level with you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to town with his lower lip, but it only makes him giggle.  The giant gives you an affectionate lick, scooping you up in his hand.  \"Thanks, Ridge.  I really appreciate you trying to help.  It's just... I don't want to , you know, die or whatever.  I'm so scared,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you don't mean you're going?  That's insane!\" you reply as he carries you back towards the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't exactly have a choice in the matter.  When I refused, they told me that I could be executed for what I did in Chicago.  So basically, I either get to murder countless innocents and cause untold destruction, or get put to death for murdering countless innocents and causing untold destruction earlier.  Irony is a beautiful thing,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pat the ferret's hand reassuringly.

Cargo is strewn everywhere, and people are bustling about, loading boxes and moving things around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our new home,\" Pyrrhus replies, shaking his head.  \"But look.  We'd better get you hidden before someone finds you and ruins the fun,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch involuntarily, bracing to be stuffed back into the giant ferret's mouth, but instead Pyrrhus leans over, grabbing up a smallish cargo container.  He peels back the side, tipping the hand you're on into it.  You slide in, coming to a rest on the edge of the corrugated surface.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just chill there for awhile.  I'll let you know when it's all clear,\" Pyrrhus says, peering in the opening.  \"Besides,\" he adds with a grin as you let out a jaw-cracking yawn, \"Looks like you could do with some shut-eye anyway,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus has a point; you had no idea just how exhausted you were until that exact moment.  It had been a long day or so, and quite a lot had happened.  As the gigantic ferret closes the container, you curl up on the floor, drifting off into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden concussion shakes you awake.  You feel something large and warm lifting you up and panic for a moment before realizing it's just Pyrrhus.  The ferret holds you up to his face in a cupped palm, smiling thinly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good sleep?  Been awhile,\" he snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  How long?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better part of the day,\" he shrugs, glancing over at the sun, which is starting to get low in the sky.  You lean over the side of Pyrrhus' hand, trying to find any sight of shore around.  \"Oh, we're way out to sea,\" he comments, noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod numbly.  All of a sudden, it hits you just how much your life is changing.  You're hanging around with a hundred-foot-tall teenage ferret boy, and as if that isn't enough, you're being taken off gods know where to some place across the ocean.  It's all too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferret lowers you to the deck, getting to his feet.  His shadow casts much of the surface of the aircraft carrier into darkness.  \"While you were asleep, I managed to get basically the whole deck to myself,\" he comments, hands on hips.  \"We won't need to worry about being bothered,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at him, taking a step back to try and get a better look at his face.  Suddenly, the giant takes several steps back and makes a dash for the edge of the carrier.  You yelp and just about fall over as he launches himself off the edge, diving gracefully into the water.  He surfaces and begins to swim through the ocean, powerful strokes propelling him along at an alarming rate.  You think for a moment that he's just going to keep going, but he dives again, resurfacing much closer to the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing you standing near the side of the ship, Pyrrhus grins and strokes over, resting his chin on his forearms on the edge of the deck.  You are just about drenched with water streaming off the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hop in!  The water's warm!\" he laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass,\" you reply.  \"I didn't know you could swim so well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus shrugs.  \"I was on the swim team before I got super-sized.  I don't think they'd let me compete anymore.  Probably cheating to be nearly as big as the pool, though,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it's a good idea to be swimming around, though?  Don't you think you might get in trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrhus hauls up onto the deck, sending water everywhere.  He sits on the edge, legs dangling over into the water.  \"Do you think I really give a damn about what they think?  And do you think they could really do anything about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seemed pretty scared of them earlier,\" you sigh, approaching Pyrrhus' hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still am.  But I don't care.  I'm not going to do what they tell me.  I'm not going to do...those things,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  I know,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to escape.

Pyrrhus sighs, \"If we try to do anything, we should just wait until land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah man, way to be shafted,\" he agrees flatly, his face suddenly lights up, \"I just thought of a couple ways to get back at them, wanna hear?\" Pyrrhus mentions giddily.

He dives back into the water again. This time you have to run away from the coming tide of water splashing back into the dock. It wades around you and eventually diverts itself back into the openness of the ocean. While your gigantic ferret friend is under the water, it crosses your mind that the military doesn't know you're here. He resurfaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what will we do if they see me?\" You ask him worriedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess either the crate...\" he says slowly, opening his mouth wide, \"or here,\" he points, you gulp, \"but it's almost nighttime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" You exclaim, but you immediately retract your statement, \"Never mind, I forget, it's the military we're talking about,\" you moan angrily, Pyrrhus tilts his head and you motion behind you, \"lights. They're not just gonna let an ambush happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft- don't pay them any mind, they didn't care what I did the whole day. I guarantee you that won't change for tonight either...\" he says. Whilst you had your back turned, Pyrrhus folded his arms on the dock and placed his head on his limbs, he looks at you and smiles in thought. Turning around you find him in this position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but blush, \"What're you starin' at?\" You ask, breaking into a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to make you feel weird... but...\" he says shyly, an unexpected demeanor change, \"you kinda tasted good... in my mouth...\" he mumbles, stuffing his nose into his crossed arms.

Sure, you got in an altercation with the army, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I found myself suddenly this big, what I did was... was <i>evil</i>,\" Pyrrhus spins to face you, his piercing eyes boring into you. \"Did I pick up the nearest police car and ask what the fuck to do?  No.  I picked up the nearest handful of panicking people and ate them.  I <i>ate them</i>.  Then... I just went crazy.  I don't want to talk about it.  But I enjoyed it.  I had fun.

And upon being so close to the gaint you saw that he was in a wolf, not just any type of wolf though. The huge figure was in fact an arctic wolf who had snow white fur that covered his entire body. And with that light fur color you could see that the wolf looked to be well muscled....or at least he would have been if he had been at a normal height. But since he was so big compared to you all of his muscles looked massive. And when you looked up towards his face you saw the wolf appeared to be in late 30's maybe early 40's. Even so that didn't change the fact that he didn't seem scarey, in fact he seemed pretty calm. But as you continued to look up at his refined facial features you saw one of the wolf's open shoot open as he looked to be staring right at you as he began to sit up while he asked, \"What in the world is going on here? How did I end up so large and in this odd looking facility?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had spoken those words though you found your face become a light shade of pink as you didn't expect his voice to sound as deep and refined as it did. Of course it also didn't help that since he was no sitting up that gave you very good view of his large white furred balls and sheath. But while you were string you heard the general's voice as he countered back with, \"I'm afraid that information is none of your concern. All you need to know is that you're here to be observed by us until we can figure out how you got to this size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that had been spoken though you saw the wolf's eyebrow's narrow slightly while he replied, \"I see. Well I'm sorry to inform you good sir. But I am the head of a very important company. So I'm afraid I can't stay here that long...even if I am now a giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again that is no longer your concern since your company has been informed that you will be \"taking a vacation\" for a few months or so.\" Lakarta stated, before he turned and began talking to his men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he did this you couldn't help be feel kind of bad for the massive wolf. He went from being the head or probably the owner of a company to a giant who was taken by the military for who knows what reasons. And so you decided to slowly make your way towards the wolf. When you did this you saw one of the wolf's ice blue eyes look down at you, and with a warm smile on his face he greeted you with, \"Well hello there, young man. My name is Pythus, and I assure you I won't harm you in anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight when you were going to reply to the white furred wolf you heard Lakarta's voice once more as he ordered, \"Alright, since you seem to be awake. You will now go to Room A. Is that understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise/shock you were quickly grabbed by the wolf and as he hand enclosed around you he told Lakarta, \"Very well, lead the way.\" You felt the giant wolf's hand shake as he began to stand up to full height and started walk. While this was going on however, you heard the wolf's voice gain as he continued in a whisper, \"Sorry for just grabbing you like that, son. But I don't exactly trust these men. So I think you'll be much safer with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just let out a heavy sigh before you said to yourself, \"Well, I guess this'll be better then dealing with those army guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you said this however, you what sounded like a huge metal door open, and then close just as quickly. Once that had been you felt the hand were in move upward a bit before you felt yourself falling out of it and onto one of the wolfs massive pecs. When this happened you quickly realized that Pythus was laying down on the biggest bed you've ever seen. You than felt one of his large fingers hover above you before you felt it gently rub against the top of your head a few times as you looked up at the wolf's smiling face as he asked, \"So young man since it seems we'll be here for a while was there anything you wanted to ask me?\"</span></div></div>",

This is not the only thing that has you preoccupied. for you notice the wolf is staring down at you past a deep red canine cock easily larger than you are tall. The beast extends from his groin fully erect and bobbing slightly with the pulse of blood and his boulder sized balls sway slightly as the wolf crouches over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently he is thoroughly enjoying this, perhaps a bit more than you would like as you stare back nervously. Seeming to notice you aren't going anywhere. The giant grey furred wolf leans back and sits on the ground with a resounding thud before shifting his giant legs to enclose around you Indian style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his legs enclose around you trapping you. you find yourself once again admiring the grey furred physique of the lightly muscled anthro and the varying thickness of his fur. one area in particular is slightly fluffier and muskier than the rest of his body.

Both the size of small boulders and covered in fuzzy fur they are an enticing site as they rest on the grassy ground. Equally enticing is his giant cock which now looms close above allowing you a better view of the bulging beast as heat and (more) musk flows down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait? Thinking to yourself, \"did I just say enticing?!\" You then begin to realize you really did find your current situation somewhat...

Her bulk still filled most of the door frame, but the weasel was able to squirm his way in regardless. He did so, doing his best to ignore the way she wrinkled her nose at his passing. He was nervous. His musk was always strong when he was nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it didn't hurt to be as cordial as possible. \"Thank you so much Mrs. Grimes. It's truly a pleasure to be in your wonderful home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Grimes snorted as she shut the door. \"Not so much at the moment. Please excuse the mess. Ever since we found out Victor's diagnosis, things have been a little hectic.\" She shuffled forward past him, nearly pushing him against the wall. She looked tired, but she was doing her best not to show it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to apologize, Mrs. Grimes. I get the feeling that your home on a bad day is still so much cleaner than my apartment on its best.\" He looked at the living room before following her towards the back of the house. It was a cluttered place, a room that had obviously been lived in for quite some time, but it had been kept painstakingly clean. It smelled strongly of industrial cleaner, though Will could catch a whiff of the family that lived her underneath all that. He chuckled to himself. She had taken great care to tidy up before he arrived, despite what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big bear chuckled and looked down at him over her shoulder. \"You're too kind,\" she purred. She lead him to the kitchen, which she filled almost entirely by herself. Will couldn't imagine what it must have been like for the whole family here. Though she was the smallest, she still towered over him at seven feet. Her son and husband were much bigger, bulkier. It must have been all they could do not to trip over each other all the time. \"Please, call me Barbara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck out her hand and he took it. He didn't have to bend to kiss it, but he bowed after he did anyway. She chuckled and put her free hand to her muzzle, doing her best to look demure. Will smiled broadly. It was nice to know he still had it. \"All right, Barbara,\" he said. \"I don't want to take up much more of your time. I figured I'd just get to meet Victor for right now, talk for maybe fifteen minutes before heading home. We'll set up our interview schedule so it's not too much a strain on any of you, but I have to insist on at least three times a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara nodded, then looked out the back door behind her. Will could just make out movement over her shoulder. \"Oh, of course,\" she said, then smoothed her immense hands on her apron. \"I don't think Victor's going to go back to college this semester until we can figure all of this out, so he'll have plenty of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill smiled, rows of small sharp teeth suddenly visible. \"You mean he's not going to get a job this summer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara chuckled, but her face fell slightly. \"I don't think there's a place that'll take him now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill winced inwardly. \"You'd be surprised. Most guys are a shoe-in for construction work once they're diagnosed. Plenty of 'em are leading quite productive lives now that...well, now that we know this isn't going away. We're doing our best to make sure those first few instances don't set the reputation for everyone with the disease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara's smile returned, though it wasn't as bright as it was before. \"I know, Mr. Bauer. I can't thank you enough for the work you're doing here. It means the world to me and Mikhail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and nodded, setting down his briefcase and plucking out a notepad. \"It's my job, ma'am. I'd hate to think that we'd shun certain people just when they needed us the most to make sense of what was happening to them. By the way, call me William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel walked out of the kitchen door to the Grimes' expansive back yard. Barbara had done quite a bit of work on it -- a line of fruit trees dominated the back fence, and there were small islands of herbs, rosebushes, grapevines and other flowers laid about, like mines of color and fragrance. Of course, that only caught the eye for a moment. What really grabbed your attention was the reason that Will was here in the first place -- the giant bear sitting against the big apple tree at the edge of the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictor had been diagnosed with chronic hyper-gigantia two weeks ago, and in that span of time he had doubled in size from eight feet (just under the tallest bear ever recorded) to nearly sixteen feet. He hadn't finished growing yet, of course, and the latest reports seemed to indicate that he would start growing in random, but potent spurts. No one knew just how tall he was going to get. Of the couple thousand hyper-gigantic cases that had sprung up in the past year, not one of them ever seemed to truly finish growing. Fenn Richards, the wolf who was the first recorded case, was nearing 600 feet tall at last report. According to the authorities up in Massachusetts, detaining him was getting to be impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear in the backyard had nothing to do with that, of course, except for sharing the same condition. But Fenn's actions had put the fear of these \"macros\" -- that's what the media called them -- quite clearly in the public's mind. And once that first impression had set, it would be awfully hard to shake. That's why William's work was so important. He had to prove, scientifically and beyond the shadow of a doubt, that hyper-gigantia didn't cause dementia, aggression or any of the other mental traumas it had come to be associated with. While growing to the size of a skyscraper had to do crazy things to your psychology, it didn't necessarily make you a bloodthirsty monster. Or so he hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam smiled as he approached the bear. Victor smiled back, and didn't bother getting up. Even sitting the young bear towered over the weasel, and standing would only make the size difference that much more pronounced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Victor. I'm Dr. William Bauer.\" He smiled and offered his paw. \"I'm here to ask you a few questions...\" </span></div></div>",

His body was thick with musculature, although there was that ever present bear fat that just made them all the bulkier. His fur was thick as well; in fact, everything about bears seemed to be designed to make them seem as big as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyper-gigantia had only helped in that department. At sixteen feet, he was now twice the average adult bear height, and now bigger than any recorded bear before the outbreak of this... disease? Mutation? Evolution? Each word held a connotation that someone would disagree with, and none quite fit whatever was going on. It wasn't a disease, as there was no truly negative impact on the body. It wasn't a mutation, since most of the cases had never been in the same place before, and no radiation beyond normal levels were present in any of the macros. It wasn't evolution, at least as far as he could tell, because he'd never heard of a species suddenly growing to a hundred times their previous height before. Whatever the proper term might be, that kind of speculation would wait for later. After all, this was his first time actually meeting someone with the... condition. Yes, that would be an acceptable word for now, the weasel thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had studied cases like these for months, learning all that was known about hyper-gigantia. He knew the average growth rate for various progressions of the condition, he knew the more famous cases, he knew that there was no difference in the way males and females were affected, though males seemed to be more likely to become macros, at a rate of nearly four boys to one girl. His mathematical proficiency came in great handy, calculating size differences, heights, weights, and comparisons to objects in real life in order to accurately assess needs and statistics of macros. He'd been a valuable resource for those working in the field, and now he was finally getting his own turn. The news had come in just a couple days ago, and he had fervently studied: copying all his research notes and studies to flash drives to bring with him, printing off charts of how Victor's growth would likely develop, making arrangements with food suppliers in the area, and even bringing along a program he'd designed that rendered two 3-D models of different heights, so he could make visual comparisons without needing to be in person. And yet, despite all that preparation, nothing prepared him for the enormous bear shaking his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt two and a half times his size, Victor's hand engulfed his, swallowing it in a mass of soft yet leathery pads and coarse yet smooth and comfortable dark brown fur. William looked down and saw only Victor's hand in a ball, his own hand vanished from sight within the macro's grip. He could almost feel the delicacy of the grip that he was applying, so incredibly powerful and yet being gentle enough to just hold the weasel's hand. And yet, in that instant, William could sense the strength that this macro held, at only twice his original height. He shivered slightly, a little more nervous than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you, Dr. Bauer, sir. I'll do my best to answer your questions,\" the giant said, nodding his head as he spoke. His voice, like the rest of him, was in the final stages of growing up but still amplified. It was deep, loud, and definitively masculine. His eyes, crystalline and green, held sadness with a trace of fear, as expected from someone who wakes up to find themselves turning into a giant. His titanic body was bare except for a modestly placed blanket across his lap; the custom designed clothes would arrive in a day, and in the meanwhile Victor would have to make do with makeshift loincloths. William took the moment to look him over, noting the impressive musculature and thick fur all over the grizzly body. Even if he wasn't a giant, the 21-year-old would have still been built like a tank and an incredible sight to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel tried not to think about how unbelievably attractive Victor was and turned to his pad, his nervous musk thick in the air as he cleared his throat and started asking the basic questions. Did you eat anything odd? Do you feel sick or anything during the growth spurts? How many growth spurts have you experienced so far? Did you ever have contact with this man, Fenn Richards? They all seemed silly questions, little more than far reaches that had been used for the first hundred cases or so and now were basically meaningless. Still, protocol was protocol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictor seemed like a nice guy. He spoke politely, never interrupted, always answered directly and explained when necessary. There was a distinctly sad tone to his voice; a few friends had decided to leave him alone, and he was isolated from a lot of people because of his condition. It was clear that he considered himself a freak and just wanted to get back to normal again. A common opinion, but William hoped he'd be able to change the bear's mind eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, William folded his pad and clicked his pen shut, nodding thoughtfully as he tapped the paper. \"Alright, well, I don't want to keep you too long for these first couple of sessions. We'll ease into longer and longer sessions together as your hyper-gigantia develops. Now, I want you to know that although I am here to observe and assist, you should consider me more as a friend than a caretaker. I have to go for now, but I suggest looking for work at a construction or demolition company. People with your condition are highly valued, and you're the only case for a few hundred miles in any direction, so you'll be considered very important by them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother returned and the three of them spoke for a while, eventually settling on having William come back in a couple of days to have another session with Victor. \"You have a nice day, ma'am,\" he said, kissing her hand again and bowing. Then he turned back to the giant and smiled. His lips parted to speak, and then he noticed for the first time a growing musk in the air besides his own. He looked ever so slightly down and saw the large bulge in the blanket on the bear's lap; his cheeks flustered and he hesitated for a moment before speaking. \"Victor, I know it may seem bad right now, but your condition is what you make it to be. I'll see you in a couple of days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear nodded, the slightest hint of a blush on his cheeks as he shifted his legs a little. \"See you later, Dr. Bauer, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me William.\"</span></div></div>",

At least you were almost home. At six thirty PM. The traffic on the way home had not been kind to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this is what I get for going out and doing the shopping instead of ordering it online...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of constant rain and a barrage of curses, you arrive at your home, pulling into the driveway. Thankfully, the rain has lightened considerably, allowing you to bring your shopping inside without getting too wet. After lockin the car, you enter your house, closing the door behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you deposit the shopping on the counter in th kitchen. You could put everything away later - most of it was non-perishable stuff like pasta. Walking into the living room, you all but collapse onto the sofa, your head pushing into a pillow. You were ready to drop off right there and then, but a voice stopped you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Master...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, you get rearrange the positions of your limbs until you are sitting, Angel sitting down next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Master, what do you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Angel can finish her question, you engulf the anthro husky in a tight hug, leaning into her soft white fur. Unbeknownst to you, Angel is somewhat surprised by your reaction, the husky figuring you'd ask her how she transformed her body before petting and hugging her. Shrugging slightly, the anthro leans into the hug, wrapping her thick arms around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure why, but you liked the height difference between the two of you. When you had bought Angel six years ago she had been short and scrawny, often getting picked on by the other few anthros that were at the pet store - anthros of any species were often very hard to come by, so the pet store usually only had up to five or four of any popular species at a time. Seeing how miserable Angel was, coupled with the fact that you wanted a pet, spurred you to buy the snow-white furry husky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Angel had shown no real signs of improving from the poor little thin that got picked on by the other few anthro dogs. However, as time passed by, and she grew more familiar with you, closer to you, she began to grow, and grow, and grow. At her fastest she had grown at a rate of almost an inch a week, the loyal canine eventually matching your height of six foot even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Angel was merely six feet tall, she began to \"thank you properly for all you've done\", as she put it. This translated to nuzzling, licking, and lavishing her affections on you whenever she got the chance. After she reached six feet tall, Angel's body began to develop in ways other simply growing larger - not that she stopped her constant growth, of course. Her breasts billowed outwards, her hips and ass flared larger, and her muscles rippled bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Amazonian Angel continued to grow, she grew fond of hugs; while she had always been affectionate, now she compounded that affection with long cuddling sessions. You didn't mind at all; most anthro pets were over-affectionate, according to what you'd seen on TV and the Internet. Another round of development earlier in the year had seen Angel's already large breasts positively flowing outwards, dominating her chest. Her steely abs hardened further, the muscles growing stronger as her biceps bulged larger, and her ass expanded outwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Angel was eight feet tall, exactly. She was also currently hugging your comparitively small body to hers, her furry breasts pushing into you as the sofa creaked slightly from her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelivering one long, loving lick to your face, Angel pauses, looking you in the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happens next?</i></span></div></div>",

I can't see anything different about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel's muzzle quickly creases up in confusion. Standing up rather suddenly, Angel gestures at her entire body. \"My new body, master?\" You bite your lip. \"Angel, have you somehow forgotten that you were an anthro?\" Angel's mouth hangs open slightly. \"I haven't always been an anthro, though! I changed myself into one a few hours ago, and now your memory is changing as I grow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel shudders involuntarily, quietly moaning. Looking down, you see Angel's huge paws covering a good portion of your feet. Looking up at the eleven foot husky, whose ears are brushing against the specially raised ceiling, you can't help but feel a little intimidated. Angel didn't mean to be intimidating - she was as kind and gentle as could be - but her twelve foot height was both utterly intimidating, and the reason you'd bought her in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, she hadn't been thirteen feet tall when you'd bought her. She'd been around five feet tall, then. But you needed a guard dog due to the roughness of your neighberhood, and Angel was as good as any. Shortly after you'd bought Angel, both her growth and affection had gone into overdrive. As crime rates worsened, you had become more and more dependent on your 'guardian Angel' as you often called her - she seemed to like the title. And as you became more and more dependent on Angel, she had grown and grown. The twenty foot guard husky was currently moaning loudly, laying on her back and squishing your tiny form into her humongous breasts. Angel could get a bit rough when playing with you every now and then, but you had confidence that the twenty five foot tall husky would never hurt you intentionally or accidentally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angel, were we just... Ah, it's probably nothing.\" Snuggling into Angel's warm fur, you feel as if something were not quite right. Something to do with Angel? And... her height? It was probably nothing. Probably just you being tired. After all, it was pitch black outside. Normally you'd already be asleep by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angel, I'm gonna sleep now. Night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling in between Angel's rather large mammaries and quickly drifting off to sleep, you can feel Angel shudder slightly, and begin to quietly moan...</span></div></div>",

Not having quite dozed off yet, you focus on the sound of Angel. She was quietly moaning, that much you noticed, and her thirty-seven foot tall body seemed to shudder in a sort-of rhythmic pattern. But it just served to help you fall asleep faster, the motions helping you relax. You'd ask her what she meant by her 'what do you think of the new me' comment tomorrow, but for now, you felt completely at easy with your forty foot tall Husky, and smiled, finally falling into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you, Angel was struggling to contain her moans as she grew, her body expanding outwards in all directions faster then she'd anticipated. Looking down at your prone form, resting on her as if this was completely normal, she frowns. She hadn't anticipated you to accept her changes without question; she expected you to be quite shocked, really. And yet, here you were, resting in between the tits of a gigantic anthro husky as if this was something that was completely normal, when it was anything but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house and world around her seemed to shift with her, too. She was already fifty feet tall, and the house grew and grew with her, becoming a large estate with an incredibly sized living room, with a gigantic arch, allowing her to leave and enter a lavish garden. What was up with these reality changes, anyway? She changed herself into an anthro a few mere hours ago, expecting to surprise you, but reality itself seemed to adjust to whatever change she made. Including the growth she started, which she realized she had difficulty stopping, or even slowing down, although she didn't really want to. She just wondered what would happen if she hit a hundred feet tall, then a thousand feet tall...if this didn't stop, what would their new reality be like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, however, Angel began to realize how tired she was, despite the pleasurable growing sensation, and yawned, looking down towards your prone form. You really looked quite peaceful, resting on her like a gigantic furry bed. Maybe this new reality wasn't so bad? I mean, if this kind of interacting was considered normal, then maybe it was for the best...but as she fell asleep, she could only wonder what things would be like in the morning, continuing to moan quietly in her sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel's eyes flickered open, the golden rays of the sun sliding into view over the horizon. With a powerful yawn, the husky opened her eyes, and it took her a few moments to process what she was seeing. Then, a familiar pleasurable sensation filled every fiber of being, followed by a shudder, and she outwardly moaned, not quite as quiet as last night, the intensity of the feeling seemingly much stronger. <i>Now</i> she remembered what had happened last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, so as to not disturb you, she realized that she was no longer in a house that had adjusted to fit her; she was in a large, unrecognizable green clearing, that had been placed smack-dab in the middle of your neighborhood. Confused, she looked around, noting that your home was near the edge of the clearing, and it was surrounded by tall fences (that she dwarfed, however). In this reality, in order to create room for her to exist, a large section of the city itself had actually been removed, leaving the large field she found herself contained in. Or maybe it just no longer had existed in the first place. It didn't make a difference either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, looking down towards her body (and noticing that her curves were now pronounced even further) she noticed you still sleeping, and let out a gasp.

Okay, a <i>LOT</i> on the tall side. Like most large horses, he is put to work on a farm, helping to pull heavy equipment among other things. One day, Maximus awakes to find himself in a new body, and a massive one at that!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You live a quiet life just outside a quiet little town. A couple years ago, you decided you would like some company and so had gone to the pet store. There many animals, but the one that caught your eye was a female dog that had apparently just come in that day. Right there and then you knew that you didn't want to leave without her. Thankfully, you didn't have to as they sold her to you without any problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got home, you decided to name her. Molly seemed a good fit. Over time, you started...noticing things every so often. Like how your dictionary and other books would be pulled out of their space on the bookshelf and end up near Molly's bed lying open. One day you actually caught her in the act, even staring at the open pages. There were also times when you had her with you when you were using your laptop and she seemed...oddly intent on what was on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wishing Molly good night, you go promptly to sleep. In the morning, however, you feel something nudging you awake, as well as something staring at you intently. Groggily, you say, \"Alright, Molly...I'm getting up. I'm getting up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat snaps you out of your grogginess is what came after saying that: a female voice responding happily, \"Good! Can't have you lying there like a lump, can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes wide, close to rub the sleep out of them, then open them again to see the source of the voice. It's Molly, but wildly different from how you remember you beloved border collie last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had always been a beautiful dog, but now she's humanoid. As you get up, and your vision comes into focus, you note her feet are still very much dog paws, her tail wagging behind her, and her head still being that of a dog's. She's still covered from head to toe in soft brown and white fur. The teats on her belly are gone, replaced by an enormous pair of fur covered breasts on her chest. Her hips flare out perfectly from her waist, and her round ass could overflow your lap if she sat on you, were she average woman size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's the final thing you notice as you stand to your full height. Molly is huge. You can hardly help but to stare at her breasts - they're about eye level to you. Her ears barely brush the ceiling, which puts her at 8 and a half feet tall at least! Molly giggles and says, \"Well? Are you going to get dressed and have breakfast, or are you going to just stare at me all day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately you break your gaze from Molly and ask her to leave while you get dressed. Once finished, you head downstairs to the kitchen to fix yourself breakfast. As you get the coffee machine going and start some toast, you spot Molly sitting at the table with a book in her slender (for her size) hand. \"So...that's what you've been doing with my books, dragging them to your bed and such.\" you say coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that...I've long been trying to read. I know you've seen me a few times -\" Molly starts, but you say, \"What? How did you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My nose is like a million times better than yours, good sir, I could smell you there. Your toast's burning, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush over to the toaster just in time to see your toast become unsalvageable. Blasted machine either barely warmed the bread or burnt it to a blackened crisp. It's due for the scrap heap. You consider offering the charred toast to Molly, but she shakes her head. \"Uh-uh. Burnt toast tastes worse than book covers, and those are terrible.\" shrugging, you toss it into the garbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll just have coffee this time.\" you mutter, and then ask, \"Same deal with staring into my laptop screen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly answers, nodding, \"Yep. I admit, while most dogs don't care about what their human masters do when it doesn't involve them, but I've always wanted to be able to emulate that. Do what they can do. Eheh...I guess now I got what I've wanted, didn't I?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While you try to enjoy your coffee, Molly's ears perk up. Yet she remains quiet, possibly really into the book she's reading. Usually when her ears do that a bark or two isn't far away. Then the doorbell rings. Shrugging, you go to the door to see who it is. No sooner do you unlock the door does it nearly slam into your face with the person on the other side opening it so quickly. \"Hey, buddy! Thought I'd drop in! ...You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris. It had to be Kris. She's just a few inches shorter than you at 5'10\", and almost constantly full of energy. She's really quite pretty. \"I'm...fine, Kris. Er, how many times have I asked you to wait for me to open the door instead of flinging it open yourself?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops. Sorry. I'll try to remember for next time.\" Kris replies sheepishly, then asks, \"Say...don't you have a dog here? Molly, wasn't it? Where is she? Doesn't she like greeting people? ...You didn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't sold Molly, and I haven't put her down. I'm guessing you want to see her?\" you answer, slightly worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah. Why wouldn't I? She's such a nice dog, and sooo soft and fluffy!\" Kris replies excitedly at the thought. Sometimes you wonder if her brain was still that of a 10 year old rather than the 24 year old she is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were afraid of this. You have no idea how Molly became...how she is, much less explain it to someone else. Kris is sensible...most of the time, and you've never kept a secret from her, so why start now? \"Alright, fine. Give me a sec.\" you tell her, then go back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris crouches down in anticipation of Molly running into her open arms to greet her...but gets a surprise when she sees a pair of dog paws that make a great dane's look like a chihuahua's. Heck, they're bigger than anyone's feet she's ever met. Kris' mouth opens agape as she looks up...and up...and <i>up</i>. \"Hiya, Kris! Er, you don't need to be crouching down like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Molly?! You...you can <i>talk</i>?! What happened to you, girl?\" Kris stammers in disbelief, further compounded by the fact Molly still towers way over her even after standing up again. As everything sinks in, Kris begins to take in Molly's other features. She herself has a modest C cup and an hourglass figure she's proud to show off when she can, but Molly makes her seem utterly flat as a board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a question I'd like to know myself.\" you admit from behind Molly. \"I go to bed last night with her as a perfectly normal dog, and I wake up to...well, this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eheh...guess that makes three of us...\" Molly answers sheepishly with a hand behind her head. \"I don't know <i>what</i> happened to me last night, only that I woke up like this. But I like it! It's like a dream come true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's always wanted to be capable of doing the things humans can do, apparently.\" you explain before Kris asks, and then offer, \"Um, how about some coffee? It might be a tad cold now, but there's still some left in the pot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris quickly nods in agreement and follows you to the kitchen. Molly closes the door and then returns to her book, tail wagging behind her. You pour a cup of coffee for your friend as pitch black as her hair and give it to her. You then get a glass and fill it with water for Molly to sip on, trusting her not to spill it all over the book. It still feels very weird to be doing this for what's been your pet for the past few years, but it's something you're just going to have to get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which...<i>can</i> Molly even be considered your pet anymore? She easily seems as sentient...sapient...whatever as you, Kris, and any other human around. And your love for her hasn't changed, thus you want what's best for her... Finally, you settle on friend. It seems to fit nicely. ...You start realizing a lot of your decisions come down to 'seeming to fit nicely'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kris sips at her coffee, looking at Molly with a mix of jealousy over having a superior figure than her and admiration. You know the kind of weird stuff your friend is into, including women of far greater than normal size. You don't question it, and occasionally enjoy a picture or story that she shares via email. In fact, it was one of those emails that Molly had been staring at on your laptop that time. \"...Um, what is that smell? Did something burn?\" she asks, sniffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His toast burnt in the toaster. Any longer and I swear it would've tripped the smoke alarm.\" Molly answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, are you <i>still</i> using that hunk of crap?! It belongs in a museum it's so old!\" Kris says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been meaning to replace it...\" you respond weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris' response:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well let's go do that!\" and with that Kris begins to quickly drag you by the arm towards the door excitedly. This isn't new to you, she's been doing this since kindergarten. And not just to her childhood friend, either. (you never did subscribe to the idea that girls had 'cooties') She may not appear muscular, but she's stronger than one might think, especially when she has momentum on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and her come to a screeching halt, however, once Molly grabs Kris by the arm. Most others that have tried only end up going along for the ride, barely slowing her down, but the 8'6\" Molly has far more mass both overall and in her muscles to completely break Kris' forward momentum without so much as budging. Note to self: don't make Molly angry. \"Hold up! We can go once he finishes his coffee. And you don't need to drag him!\" she says with slight worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris is rather surprised at this, but concedes and lets you go before Molly does the same to her. You finish your coffee while Kris finishes hers, meanwhile wondering just how the hell Molly is even going to fit in your car. You're 6 feet tall, and your head cuts it pretty close with the roof. Molly's head is going to be mashed up into it, and her long legs are certain to not have enough room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the three of you are out the door. Naturally, Molly has to duck to get through the door frame. Kris takes her car while you and Molly take yours. She seems very uncomfortably cramped in the passenger seat, but at the same time she seems...happy. \"Don't stick your head out the window. I didn't allow it when you were still just a dog, I'm not allowing it now.\" you remark offhandedly as you start the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry... I might <i>snap</i> my neck if I tried to do that now. Kind of squished in here...\" Molly answers back as the car starts to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well humans don't exactly build these things for someone of your stature in mind. You could probably stare the tallest person in history in the face without having to look up.\" you say, and you're on your way to town. You don't mention it, but you suspect that Molly's weight may play havoc with your car's fuel economy. You learned in high school that mentioning a girl's weight to her is generally a very bad idea, getting you dumped and a high chance of things being thrown at your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you make it in town just fine, and Kris' car isn't far behind. You're slightly concerned about people's opinions towards Molly, but now is as good a time as any. You turn off your car and get out, then head over to the passenger side to help Molly out. As you approach the entrance, she stops cold. \"No pets allowed...\" she reads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they don't want dogs or cats in the store making a mess.\" you explain and then add, \"I don't think you count as much of a pet anymore do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly smiles and shakes her head, then heads inside with you and Kris. Inside, she's easily distracted by nearly everything around, having never been inside any store other than that pet store you got her from a few years ago, and even then she hadn't been in there long. The other people in the store just stare, mostly in shock. Some women mutter envy at her figure. Some men try to steal glances at her before their wives notice. Others ponder just what the heck this feminine fur covered giant is. You suspect many of the people attracted to females here may be fighting the urge to try and make passionate love with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Kris comes running back to you with a toaster...one that has way more features than you'd ever care to use. \"How about this one? This one's cool!\" she exclaims excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want it you can buy it, but when am I going to need a toaster that has a built in TV and tells me the weather forecast for the next week when all I really want it to do is toast stuff without burning it to a crisp?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spoil sport.\" Kris says and proceeds to take it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight nudge, you remind Molly of your reason for being here. \"We can come back another time. Let's get what we came here for an be on our way.\" you tell her, to which she nods and puts the multipurpose flashlight down gently. You and her follow Kris' trail and soon catch up with your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to the checkout, Molly accidentally bumps into a middle aged man, causing him to fall to the floor and his basket of stuff to go in various directions. \" Oh! I'm so sorry! Let me help you pick up your stuff...\" she apologizes as she bends down to begin helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! A f-f-furry! Don't hurt me! I've got a family to go home to!\" the man yelps in fear, causing Molly to tilt her head in confusion. Admittedly, she rather likes the term, but the fearful reaction confuses her. Still, she picks up all the spilled items and places them back in the basket, then firmly grabs the man and gently helps him back to his feet before returning the basket to him. Rather than thank her, he bolts off as though Death itself was after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was his problem...\" Molly mutters, still partly confused and saddened by the reaction, as shown by her drooped ears and tail.</span></div></div>",

Am I getting this right?\" you ask Molly as you, her, and Kris exit the store. You had seen what had happened, you're just trying to recollect it all in the hopes of making sense of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess? I don't know what he thought I was going to do to him... Though I kind of like the sound of the term furry.\" Molly replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuckoo...\" Kris adds, circling her finger around her ear as the universal sign of crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou however are not so sure the man is crazy. You were basically right there when it happened, and the guy seemed perfectly sane up until that point. There has to be some rational explanation for such behavior. However, your thoughts are interrupted by an angry growl as your stomach reminds you it's unhappy about this morning. \"Heh. Sounds like it's food time and someone's stomach isn't taking no for an answer.\" Molly giggles slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap. Kind of forgot I've been running on empty. Well, I'm supposed to meet Ryan for lunch a little ways from here...I don't think he'll mind a couple others joining.\" you mention, figuring a meal may help with the mystery. It's not worth driving there, so you walk to the meeting place with them. Molly does her best to keep your relatively slower pace thanks to her longer stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, the place is a pizzeria. You find out when you arrive that Ryan has reserved a table outside, and are led to it. Again, there's some stares in Molly's direction, but many are busy with their meals at the moment. The three of you take your seats and order drinks while you wait for him to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before Ryan shows up and greets you with, \"Hi, bud! Glad you could make it!\" he then turns his attention to Kris, \"And Kris! Haven't seen you in months! And...\" finally he notices Molly, and his reaction is completely unexpected, being that of obvious fear. \"O-oh...um...h-hi Ms. furry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what is going on here?\" Kris asks bluntly, \"That guy at the store was one thing, but you too? What's so scary here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly has no idea why she's scared Ryan, but it's starting to irk her. Just as the wind shifts, she catches the scents of many of the customers. Some wearing perfume, others not. One scent though gets her attention: someone wearing a simple robe with the hood over their head. This one is different from the rest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so scary? These furries have been causing nothing but destruction everywhere they go, casually hurting innocent people they come across. Your 'friend' here will tear your heads from your bodies the moment she gets bored!\" Ryan accuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've done nothing but try to be nice and helpful all day. I'd never even <i>think</i> about harming so much as a hair on the man who's given me a loving home for over three years now or Kris! Or anyone for that matter!\" Molly angrily barks at Ryan in retaliation. Seems to you that the very thought of being accused as a monster disgusts her greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...you...you're Molly...\" Ryan realizes from the three years comment. He's met her as a dog several times, enjoying getting to play ball with her. Finally he sits down and stops making a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's me, Ryan.\" Molly responds happily, though internally she's curious. Who or what are these other furries, and <i>why</i> do they seek to cause such misery? These thoughts are put to the side as the pizza is brought to the table in all its cheesy, topping loaded glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan usually ordered an extra large pizza when he came here, foolishly thinking he'd eat the rest the next day or so only to toss it when it was too moldy to possibly consider edible a month or so later. You've a very distinct feeling that there isn't going to be anything leftover today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly would have loved to just dive right in...but she restrains herself and watches how you, Kris, and Ryan handle the pizza so she can do that herself. In the end, she winds up eating nearly half of the pizza herself after everyone else has taken all they want. Finally, the bill comes and everyone at the table helps to pay it except for Molly due to not having any means to do so. The four of you stand, and Ryan gets his first glimpse at just how big Molly really is. He's slightly taller and more muscular than you, but pales in comparison to her 8'6\" frame. You're certain that either her sheer size has caused him to pee his pants a little, or her amazing figure has caused him to cum in there. You don't want to know which.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly notices the odd robed figure rise from his seat and approach. \"A furry out in the open with humans no less...\" he speaks lowly, surprising her with how neutrally he said the term. \"Follow me if you wish to know more. The choice is yours, but your friends are welcome to join if they want...\" he continues and then quietly takes his leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swear for just a second that you see something move behind him beneath his robe, but he's gone before you can take another glance. \"If we're going to follow that guy, we should, y'know, get a move on and do it before he vanishes like a freaking ninja?\" Kris suggests somewhat helpfully.</span></div></div>",

We could be walking right into it.\" Ryan counters, \"I'm just saying maybe we shouldn't be trusting guys who don't reveal their faces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly shakes her head and replies, \"He's not interested in you, he's interested in me. And if he wanted to trap me for some reason, why would he invite you guys too and make the job harder? I wouldn't worry about losing him, I've still got his scent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's got a point there, Ryan. Besides, no one's forcing you to come.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you all agree to follow the mysterious robed figure. You can't see him anywhere, but Molly leads the way and you trust her. The path leads to a more run-down part of town, and less people are around. When Molly slows and stops, you're right in front of a surprisingly well maintained yet seemingly abandoned building. If you hadn't been led here, you would have passed it by without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, so this is like a secret hideout isn't it?\" Kris asks with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you so sure it is?\" Ryan questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, the lady here is close to the truth.\" A voice says quietly, causing everyone to turn around and see the robed figure from earlier. \"Please, come inside. I must apologize, Molly, but this facility is ill prepared for the comfort of one of your stature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting used to being kind of tall for places.\" Molly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you enter the building with Molly ducking through the doorway, and the robed figure closes the door behind you. Inside is surprisingly well lit and the walls seem like a lot of care has been done to restore them, albeit patchy in spots. You can see some eyes in the shadows, as though unsure about the presence of strangers. Then with a sigh, the robed figure reaches up and lowers his hood, revealing his face for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy...you're a furry, too!\" Ryan states the obvious. The robed furry continues to remove the robe and gloves, fully revealing himself as a white tiger furry. His limbs appear to ripple with fluid power not unlike a non-humanoid tiger would. Surprisingly, he's almost fully clothed aside from his feet, though they're ripped and torn in places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I am. As is everyone else in this facility aside from yourselves. My name is Tiberius, and this is a sanctuary for my kind.\" Tiberius acknowledges and then announces, \"It's alright, everyone, these humans are with the dog furry named Molly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe watchful furries come into view. A female bat waves friendlily and says, \"Hi! Wow, you're huge! Cool!\" She's maybe 5'7\" and kind of cute, even wearing a smiley face t-shirt and a short skirt. A bull gives a respectful nod. There are others, but the one that catches your attention is a very tall and busty white mare with eyes as blue as the ocean who says to Molly, \"Hello! My name's Breeze. It's a pleasure to meet you, and if I may add, a slight relief to know I'm not the tallest one around here that's still friendly. I'm sure my master would love to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze is...magnificent, though about a foot shorter than Molly. Maybe a bit bustier, but Kris would likely kill you if you tried to confirm that. \"As you can see, we're not all what you think of us. You, Ryan, believe us all destructive monsters.\" Tiberius begins, only for the bat to shout, \"That's not true! Humans are cool! Even like this I don't know how any of us could make these buildings and stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiberius growls slightly at her and she sheepishly quiets down. \"Mizuru can be quite vocal when it comes to certain subjects, though I fear this trait may get her killed if she isn't careful. The truth is, many of us wish only to coexist with humans peacefully and not harm them unless forced to defend ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if you're all supposed to be so friendly, how do you explain that guy who got impaled with a horn while being pulverized into the foundation of a building recently?\" Ryan says with some confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull replies, \"I knew him. Carl was a good man, said he'd introduce me to his little girl. Ol' Alex would've given her the most epic ride in her five year old life...though I'm sure Breeze could beat the pants off me for rides. You look at her and tell me she's anything less than purebred. But that rhino didn't care at all... There's some like him that force us to hide because of the mistrust they cause.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why haven't you guys tried to clear your names? Why not confront the ones that do this and tell them to stop?\" Molly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, humans aren't easily trusting of any perceived threat. I believe your friend here has demonstrated this quite clearly.\" Tiberius responds looking in Ryan's direction, who blushes heavily with embarrassment. You figure it to be because of Breeze and Mizuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze adds, \"As for why we don't tell them to cease, these furries are incredibly violent even to their own kind. If there is an intelligence behind their barbarism, it's buried well and is uninterested in listening to reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Lovely</i>...\" you mutter sarcastically.</span></div></div>",

Tiberius brings a hand up to gently pinch the bridge of his muzzle in front of his eyes muttering, \"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Cowardly</i>? You think us <i>cowardly</i>?!\" Alex yells, standing up to Molly. \"Well?! Do you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis towering 6'5\" size and horns would be enough to make near anyone mess themselves in terror in this circumstance, but he still doesn't come up to the base of Molly's neck. So his display doesn't appear to phase her in the least as she answers with her hands on her hips, \"I've yet to see or hear of anything to suggest otherwise, so why don't you disprove it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My human friends would call me many things. Cowardly isn't one of them. Those violent guys don't listen to reason, and when faced with one that's like at least 15 or 20 feet tall when they get going, all we can do is try to get people and ourselves out of their way before anyone gets hurt.\" Mizuru explains, \"Alex wasn't able to get Carl to safety in time. He tried to buy as much time for him as he could, but that rhino just tossed him aside like a toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite our efforts, however, people rarely remember us trying to help them, only the ones that attacked.\" Tiberius adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, maybe we should head home before anyone does something they'll regret, if they haven't already...\" you suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, that sounds like a wonderful idea. Though maybe someone should go with you to ensure you reach your destinations safely?\" Breeze says, hoping the situation defuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Mizuru and I shall escort you.\" Tiberius says, and then you head outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out, Kris leads the way back into the main part of town with everyone else following. If you had known just how far away from your car you were going to end up, you'd have moved it closer. \"Is anyone else getting a bad feeling about this?\" Ryan asks nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, walking around town with an anthro? Didn't you learn anything at the sanctuary?\" Mizuru teases slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, more like we shouldn't be out here...\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to tell him he's making a fuss over nothing when a massive humanoid rhino smashes his way into view. \"Don't tell me...not a friendly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Kris yelps, barely avoiding the rhinos' huge fist trying to flatten her. Everyone in the area is soon either transfixed on the 20 foot behemoth or panicking as he indiscriminately attacks anything around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of here, NOW!\" Tiberius yells desperately to the bystanders as he tries to halt the rhino, but fails to even slow him down. Mizuru joins in pulling at the beast's bulky leg, but only makes the slightest difference. You, Ryan, and Kris try to get everyone away from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this keeps up...someone's bound to get killed. I've gotta try something...\" Molly mutters to herself and then calls to the rhino, \"Hey! UGLY! Over here!\" he turns his attention towards her...but only for a moment before returning to his path of destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...guess I don't have a choice.\" she says and then begins concentrating. As she does, her perspective shifts upward as she grows larger and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and watch in amazement as Molly reaches 20 feet herself and then surpasses it without slowing down. \"Holy crap...\" is all you can manage to say. The others too see her expanding frame until she stops at around 35 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly walks up to the rhino and taps him on the shoulder. \"Hey. Your destructive antics aren't sitting well with me or my friends. Beat it now, and I won't kick your sorry butt into next year!\" she tells him threateningly, grinding a fist into her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she successfully has the rhino's full attention. However, he swings a huge fist straight into Molly's gut. She winces, then grabs his arm and uses it to throw him to the ground with some effort. \"Seems your violence wasn't overblown... And would you look at what you made me do? You've made me have to break the road a bit!\" she says angrily, adrenaline pumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rhino gets up without care and lowers his head to charge. Thinking quickly, Molly sidesteps him then leaps and slams him in the back with a kick, sending him sprawling to the ground. As he attempts to get up again, she steps on his back and shoves him back down. \"Uh-uh. Stay down. Now, let's talk. Why the HELL are you attacking people and their homes? Ruining the anthros NOT AT ALL like you's chances of getting along with humans peacefully? What have ANY of them done to you?\" she yells with rather painful volume at the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the rhino begins to shrink and...seemingly vanishes, and Molly's foot stomps down into the ground from the sudden lack of support beneath it. \"What the...where did he go?\" she asks aloud much more quietly. She then quickly looks around, taking extra care directly beneath her and asks, \"More importantly...is everyone alright? Please tell me I didn't step on someone by mistake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, everyone's fine, Molly...\" you answer back in both fear and awe. Kris is just in awe. Just as you start worrying about how she's going to stay anywhere at that size, Molly quickly shrinks down until she's back at her normal height of 8'6\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew...thank goodness.\" Molly replies, breathing a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you DO that? Why didn't you say you could do that?\" Kris asks almost uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one asked, and I didn't really think it that important until now...\" Molly admits.</span></div></div>",

The people around aren't exactly applauding Molly's efforts, but they're certainly talking about the fight. \"That was totally awesome!\" Mizuru exclaims happily and adds, \"I gotta share that with my friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eheh...I was kind of awesome back there, wasn't I?\" Molly responds with a grin, enjoying the praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the group reaches the pizzeria from earlier. It's less busy outside than it was when you left, but there's still a few people there. \"Well, I'm parked here so that means this is my stop.\" Ryan announces, and then asks, \"Er, by the way...are all of you capable of what Molly did back there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiberius shakes his head and replies, \"No. If it is natural for our kind to be able to, it may be extremely rare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...think this isn't natural?\" Molly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say. I can't even say if we're natural, period. I've been like this for perhaps a little over a year now, but I remember the change being overnight. And we're comprised of many animal species native to many different environments. Breeze, for example, was born a domesticated horse. Doesn't sound very natural, does it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't.\" Ryan concludes, and then says, \"Question is then, what's causing this and why. Rhino-boy wasn't exactly talkative while you guys are happy to strike up a conversation. Might be something there.\" he scribbles something down on a piece of paper and hands it to Mizuru. \"My address, if anyone wants it. Catch you guys later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat anthro turns the paper over in her hand as Ryan left and asks puzzled, \"Did...did he just hit on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does this almost all the time.\" Kris informs her, \"Still, it's handy to have in case you need to get in touch with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, that's not a bad idea. We know where you guys can usually be found at, it's only fair you know where to find us.\" you state, and then add, \"And Molly, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kris give Mizuru your addresses for the sake of the whole group, and then you continue a bit farther to the store parking lot. Thankfully, the cars haven't been towed away. \"So here we are. We'll be heading home.\" you say as you get to your car, \"Take care!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unlock the door and enter your car. Molly crams herself into the passenger seat and you head for home. Soon enough, you arrive, and you once again help Molly get out of your car. \"A convertible would be really nice...much more head room and all.\" she suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you've got a few tens of thousands of dollars to drop on one, be my guest.\" you counter as you unlock your front door to go inside with your new toaster and Molly falls silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you enter, you almost immediately unbox the new toaster and replace the old one with it. You sort through the mail, but find only bills or junk mail waiting. Then you stick a couple pieces of bread into the toaster to try it out. \"Hungry for toast?\" Molly asks, looking over your shoulder. Not that it's hard for her to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta make sure this thing works. If not, then it's gotta go back.\" you reply. Sure enough, it works and a pair of golden brown toast pops up...and Molly steals one of the slices and gulps it down before you can do anything. Sighing, you butter the remaining slice and eat it before she considers taking that one too. Afterward, you work on a website for a client while she dives back into her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, you make dinner for both of you, then turn in for the night. A part of you wouldn't mind Molly sleeping with you, but your value for the ability to breathe should she roll over you wins out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morning comes, and you groggily wake up. You get up and head for the bathroom in the automatic preparation to take Molly outside, almost expecting her leash in her mouth. However, you find to your still-tired mind's surprise that the bathroom door is locked. \"That's strange...\" you mutter. A few moments later, you hear the door unlock as the doorknob turns and the door opens revealing a...bat-human hybrid creature? You let out a scream of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Ow! Volume down, fella! Sheesh...\" the bat-girl replies while covering her ears. Quickly you stop and start instead blushing slightly as your brain finally snaps out of its stupor and remembers all the events of yesterday. Including the fact that Molly had little need for that leash and could just hand it to you with her own hands. You had met this bat yesterday; her name was Mizuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh. God I feel like an idiot. Sorry, Mizuru.\" you apologize. It's then you notice the 5'7\" anthro is clad in nothing more than a bath towel, and that her fur was clinging closely to her body. It appears she had just gotten out of the shower. \"Um, what <i>are</i> you doing here anyway, other than using my bathroom?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to check up on you guys after yesterday. I've been in this place since...I wanna say 6:00 in the morning? It was only around then that Molly actually let me in.\" Mizuru responds almost uncomfortably nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly!\" you yell, causing Mizuru to cover her ears again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA somewhat loud thumping can be heard as Molly comes partly up the stairs and she responds tiredly, \"I tried to make her wait for a more reasonable time before I'd let her in...but I couldn't bring myself to leave her there for more than an hour. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Do you even <i>sleep</i>?\" you ask Mizuru, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do! It's kinda erratic, but I sleep!\" she answers, then looks down at the bath towel she's wearing and asks, \"Um, I suppose I shouldn't be using one of your towels, should I? But my clothes are still in the dryer...\" finally, she says, \"Well I guess I don't mind going around without anything on for a little while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, d-don't do that. You can keep the towel, I've got others.\" you inform her hastily. Her figure, while not nearly to the same level as Molly or Breeze's, is still what you'd consider well above average. However, you want to avoid the temptation of doing something stupid as much as you can. Better to leave that to Ryan and let him get subsequently beat up by a pissed-off bat anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thanks! I'll be sure to treasure it!\" Mizuru exclaims happily and squeezes you into a bear hug, surprising you with her strength despite the lack of muscle definition on her smooth, slender arms. You also notice that her chest is...definitely firm through the bath towel as your slightly struggling lungs will attest. Finally she lets go and you rush into the bathroom to relieve your bladder before you end up wetting your pajama bottoms and subsequently making a fool of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get dressed and head downstairs to make some breakfast. On that thought, it's clear to you that you should offer some for Mizuru, yet you've no idea what she likes to eat. Does she eat bugs like most bats do? Drink blood? As you enter the kitchen, you notice the distinct lack of Molly at the table reading a book like yesterday. A quick poke into the living room reveals her sprawled on the entire couch, feet hanging well off the one arm of it while her head rests on the other, fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting the sleeping giant dog anthro beauty lie, you ask Mizuru, \"Um...what exactly is it that you eat? Insects? Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizuru chuckles and finishes your question with, \"Blood? What do I look like, a vampire? ...don't answer that.\" she then replies more seriously, \"No, I don't drink that stuff. It's hard enough for us just to get the stuff we have without adding something like that to the list. I'm partial to fruit, but I can generally eat anything humans would...though I'd rather not eat bugs if I'm honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. Bacon and eggs it is!\" You announce and get started. A loud creak is heard as Molly shifts in her sleep on the couch in the living room. As you cook, you note with increasing annoyance the dark brown towel clad anthro girl hovering over your shoulder as much as she could until finally you say, \"I don't mean to sound rude, but do you mind? I could hurt you or get hurt myself like this, and I'd prefer to do neither.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Mizuru apologizes and backs off. A good thing too, as you're about to start the bacon. Once it's underway, the couch in the other room creaks loudly as Molly sits up and lets out a yawn. She stretches her arms, dangerously close to punching holes in the ceiling, and then she stands up, carefully stretching the rest of her body. Finally, she comes into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. I knew the smell of frying bacon would get your attention. Some things never change.\" you say teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except that I'm not going to have to beg for some of that...right?\" she responds back smartly and you point to the extra plate set right where she had been seated yesterday.</span></div></div>",

But then again, since yesterday your previous sense of normalcy has been thrown out the window... \"Hey, Tom?\" Molly asks, using your name to get your attention, \"How about we go for that walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and answer, \"Sure. I'd get your leash, but...I don't think you need it. Not to mention it probably doesn't fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come along?\" Mizuru asks, practically pleading with her green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but not like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I meant once my clothes are done in the dryer, which should be right about...\" the dryer buzzer goes off and Mizuru finishes with a grin, \"...Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizuru rushes to the laundry room and retrieves her clothes from the dryer. When the bat anthro returns, she's decked out in the same outfit of a dark grey smiley face t-shirt and pink short skirt she was wearing yesterday. \"Ah... So cozy warm when they come out!\" she remarks contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you head out the door and you lock it on the way. At first Molly easily takes a commanding lead with her roughly yard long walking strides, but she gives a pause to let you and Mizuru catch up. \"So, how are things going over at the sanctuary? I hope Alex isn't still angry over what I said yesterday...\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Breeze got him to cool down after you left. At least, that's what she told me when Tiberius and I returned. She's got a way with becalming nearly anyone, I think.\" Mizuru responds, \"As for everything else...call me crazy, but the return trip we got a lot more stares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, these weren't fearful stares, but more along the lines of curiosity. I had a few people actually greeting me and asking my name when I went to see my friends later. I think your fight actually really helped to get it into their heads that we're not all out to harm them. Of course, a gigantic, utterly hot anthro yelling about a group not at all like that rhino is bound to stick in their heads.\" Mizuru explains, the last remark you swear makes Molly blush under the fur on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk, you find yourself curious about Mizuru and the origin of her name. \"Say...where did you come up with your name?\" you ask, completely expecting something like, 'oh, I thought it sounded nice.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she sighs and answers, \"It was given to me while I was still just a bat. I had gotten injured somehow, I don't really remember what exactly, and I ended up nearly starving because of it. Just as I was sure I was going to die, a girl found me and took me to her home. She nursed me back to health. Eventually she started calling me Mizuru and telling me about her day when she returned from school. Her family had moved here from Japan recently, so she didn't have many friends even though she was fluent in English...mostly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened?\" Molly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...her parents discovered she was keeping me without their permission. They released me while she was still in school, calling me a filthy beast. I had little choice but to leave. I found a nice little spot to roost, then I went for some food around sunset. Oddly, I felt very tired soon after, and the next day I woke up to a face full of dirt. I had become, well, like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't you in the slightest bit embarrassed about being naked?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no. Why should I have been?\" Mizuru replies casually, earning a snicker from Molly. Now that you think about it, of course they wouldn't be concerned about something that human society ingrains into itself from an early age. \"Anyway, I wandered around until I met Tiberius. I've made quite a few friends since then, but...I've never tried to go back to see Rika. For all I know, her family may have moved back to Japan. I probably should at least try, just haven't found time to.\" she finishes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You hadn't quite expected to get quite the story you did from Mizuru about her name. It was touching, really, if perhaps a little sad. You've never heard of this Rika girl before, but surely she'd like to know what became of the bat she took care of at the very least. Looking for a name would be like searching for a needle in a very large haystack, unless you had something else to narrow it down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...this Rika girl... What's her last name? Do you remember the address?\" you ask your bat anthro friend of less than 24 hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...Niwatori? Hitotsumori? Wannahuckaloogie? No, those aren't it...\" Mizuru replies, trying to remember, then answers the other question with, \"I don't exactly remember the address, but I do remember it being on a huge lot with a fancy gate out front. The house was pretty big looking too, much larger than yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't there some Japanese guy donating a big check to a charity event in the news the other day?\" Molly asks, her blue eyes staring down at you, \"Or were you too busy looking at giantess stories from Kris again to pay attention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. She had been reading those too before her transformation, or at least had some idea what it was that your childhood friend often emailed you. \"I-I never <i>ask</i> her to send me those, she just does... But yeah, I remember that story. Kousei Narumi, president of a large business company in town that came in from its branch in Japan apparently. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you ask that, Mizuru's eyes widen and she shouts, \"That's it! Narumi! Rika Narumi!\" she then adds, \"So if her dad's this big businessman that was seen recently, then she might still be here after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, if he's her father, then how come you didn't know that by now with him being in the news?\" Molly asks, tilting her head slightly in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...eheh...we don't have a TV at the sanctuary...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now your feet are getting tired, so you stop and sit down on a bench near a bus stop. And almost immediately, a large shadow looms overhead as Molly parks herself directly behind you, placing her white furry hands just behind and to either side of your neck. Neither the 8'6\" busty dog anthro nor the 5'7\" bat anthro seem all that tired at all, but Mizuru takes a seat beside you regardless. The passersby give stares of intrigue at the sight, and some of the men give slightly jealous glances at you. Staring up Molly's arms past where the white changes to reddish brown just before her elbows and past her huge chest (a tricky task in more than one way) into the underside of her jaw, you ask, \"Well? What do you think Molly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down towards you and responds, \"It's worth a try to get our friend to meet this girl again. I don't know how we're going to do it though. I mean, I guess I could break the gate down with my bare hands if need be, but that wouldn't leave a good impression.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thanks guys! I'm glad to have such nice friends!\" Mizuru exclaims happily, bringing both you and Molly into a tight embrace, which also squishes you into the latter's breasts somewhat. Thankfully, Molly doesn't seem to mind. Mizuru then asks her, \"As for the gate, couldn't you just grow large enough to just simply walk over it and carry us over to the other side?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could, but then we would be trespassing. That's a really bad thing.\" you remind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right...just when our public image is seemingly starting to shift for the better. Tiberius would be <i>pissed</i> if one of us ruined it.\" Mizuru acknowledges sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't there anyone who could help? Anthro or human?\" Molly asks curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...we could try asking for Breeze to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, you know, we could just ask if we could meet with Kousei at his estate. He might be interested.\" you suggest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's quickly decided that the best option was to get in contact with the Narumi family and try to arrange a meeting. Fortunately, Kris had a friend that works for the business company Kousei ran so you at least had a foot in the proverbial door. You need only get in touch with your childhood friend to pass the message down. Unfortunately, you had forgotten your phone at home and thus it has to wait until you get back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw shoot. Forgot my phone back at the house. Well, let's head back. Yes you can come too, Mizuru.\" you say, answering what you suspect would have been asked by the bat anthro before she can even ask it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up off the bench and begin heading back. Mizuru happily follows, while Molly briefly sighs with disappointment at the walk being over so soon before easily catching up thanks to her much longer strides. The walk back is mostly uneventful aside from the few stares that your companions draw. Especially Molly with her 8'6\" height and more than generous curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back at your place, the three of you head inside and you pick up the phone to call Kris. \"Hello, Kris? It's Tom. Can you get your friend to try to arrange me a meeting with Kousei Narumi? ...I'm totally serious. It's for Mizuru. Alright, I'll hang on.\" you say over the phone. Kris puts you on hold for a few minutes, and then when she picks up again... \"Well thanks anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that's a no?\" Molly asks judging from what you had just said over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's off today, and has specific instructions to not be contacted unless for a very good reason. Someone wanting to meet him doesn't count as such.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if we can't arrange for a meeting, then...how am I going to meet Rika again?\" Mizuru questions and then says sadly, \"I guess it's not going to happen. Thanks for at least wanting to help, guys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea strikes you. A crazy one, but what choice did you have at this time? \"Hold on. There's nothing against going over to ask.\" you suggest, which makes the bat anthro's green eyes light up once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you take the car to go out. \"I call shotgun!\" Mizuru says with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I kind of won't fit in the back. At all. Sorry.\" Molly counters as she takes the front passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh. Never mind then, I'll take the back...\" she replies quietly and takes the back seat behind you. Soon enough, you're on your way into town. \"Hey...what's this thing?\" you hear Mizuru ask, holding up the bundled up old toaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That? Junk of the kind I wouldn't wish on even my worst enemy. Was going to just throw it out.\" you answer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip takes a little longer than yesterday, but you pull up by the gate to the Narumi estate. You arrive just in time for a large, black limousine to come driving out. It stops and the rear window rolls down for the occupant to say, \"If you're seeking business with me, I'm afraid it's going to have to wait. My daughter has run away from home and I need to find her before something bad happens to her.\" the window rolls back up and the limo drives off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run away? But why? We've got to help find her. She could be in danger for all we know!\" Mizuru says with great worry. You nod and head for the sanctuary. The eyes and ears of Tiberius and the others would surely be invaluable for this task, and this could help further improve the public image of this group of anthros.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course, the Narumi estate and the sanctuary were quite a fair distance apart from one another. Not quite opposite ends of town far, but a trip that is made less pleasant by the situation as it stands...and Molly starting to show her discomfort in being crammed into a space that was never meant for an 8'6\" tall humanoid to be in, attractive or no. To make matters worse, the street where the fight took place yesterday against that rhino anthro was closed due to construction, thus requiring an alternate path to your destination. It also had the effect of raising tensions and fears within the car. Every second wasted could mean this Rika girl was that much more likely of being lost forever, or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reach the sanctuary building. You park your car within one of the limited amount of spaces provided, not that any of them are occupied, and then exit the vehicle with your passengers. Molly comes ever so close to just breaking the passenger side door clear off its hinges in her effort to escape what surely must feel almost like a sardine can to her and then proceeds to arch and stretch her back as far as she could go, muzzle (and to a slightly lesser extent, breasts) pointed to the sky. Mizuru just gets out pretty normally by comparison, though her smile is missing due to her worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the door and Mizuru attempts to open it, only to find the door locked. \"Weird... Usually it's unlocked.\" she calls out, \"Hey, Tiberius! Anyone! Open the door! We've got something serious to deal with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiberius opens the door, his white visage actually fairly comforting, and says as he steps out, \"Indeed? Is it another attack? You've found another anthro like us? Otherwise, I fear we're already in the midst of handling a situation...\" a girl's cry can be heard from inside, \"...albeit poorly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why are you guys keeping a girl here against her will?\" Molly asks as she approaches the door and Tiberius allows the whole group inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've little choice at this time. We found her wandering the streets alone and apparently lost. We're keeping her here for her own safety until we can find out where she lives at which point we'll return her to her parents. As well as being relatively easy to keep track of her until then.\" the white tiger anthro replied, clearly unhappy about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the common room and see Alex watching a young Japanese girl with crossed arms. \"Aw, come on... You think <i>I'm</i> enjoying this? And stop staring at me like you'd like to turn me into a pile of steak!\" he said to her. By your estimate, she's about 5'2\" in height and roughly 14 or 15 years old. If her clothes with their high-end designer labels were anything to go by, this girl generally had a fair bit of money at her disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl at first glared more intensely at the bull, then went wide-eyed as Molly entered the room. \"Holy cow...\" she managed as Molly straightened up, her ears naturally brushing the ceiling. \"She's...\" the girl starts. While there's a clear hint of a Japanese accent in her voice, her English is virtually flawless. So far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex turned his head a little and nodded, saying, \"...Big? Yeah, I'm sure she gets that a lot. Hey, Molly. And...uh...you never did introduce yourself the other day did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Tom.\" you inform Alex and then ask the girl, \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell if you let me go...like anyone cares who I am anyway...\" is her rather pessimistic response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizuru listens from behind you, Molly, and Alex, out of sight. Just as you're about to ask why the girl thinks that way, the bat anthro says from behind, \"You've still never really made any friends over here, have you...Rika Narumi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl perks up at the name, almost involuntarily. There was no mistaking it: this <i>was</i> Rika Narumi, the daughter of Kousei Narumi, and the very person you and Molly had been hoping to help Mizuru reunite with after hearing her story. \"...No, I haven't. But who's asking? How did you even know my name?\" she admits and asks, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's at this time that Mizuru steps out into the open and says with some caution, \"A friend of sorts from a few months ago. That's both who and how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika takes a moment to think about the reply she's received. Finally it begins to dawn on her... \"No. Way. M-Mizuru?! Is...is that really you?!\" she asks, wide-eyed. When Mizuru responds with a smile and a nod, Rika responds with a very surprised, \"...Holy CRAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer next response takes you and the anthros in the room by surprise.</span></div></div>",

Miz...Mizuru...crushing...ribs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He he...oops. Sorry. Gotta be more careful about that...\" Mizuru apologizes sheepishly as she relents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is pretty strong when you consider her arms don't even look <i>toned</i> much less muscular. I'd hate to arm wrestle with her...\" you comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about me? Would you care to arm wrestle with me?\" Molly asks with an amused giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...hell no. Even if I had a chance at beating you fair and square you'd totally cheat!\" you answer back teasingly. Of course you have no idea if she actually would cheat by any means, but considering she's 2 and a half feet taller than you and most definitely outweighs you by a startling margin, Molly would have your arm pinned to the table almost immediately after 'Three!' without really trying. To be honest, you'd rather not arm wrestle with any anthro here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well! Seems like you've got some use after all, Mizuru! And here I thought we'd have to send for Breeze to break the girl!\" Alex says with a joking grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wha? Break me? I thought that cat said you guys wouldn't do that! The liar!\" Rika responds, a little upset. \"I guess this Breeze guy is some elephant that would grind my bones for fun, then. Rather ironic name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually...Alex meant get info out of you.\" Mizuru corrects, \"Ti is pretty serious about not harming humans unless out of absolute necessity, and our rep is only just now starting to turn positive. Also...Breeze is possibly the prettiest mare you'd lay eyes on, and as gentle as her name implies. You know, now that I think about it I've never visited her before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, after being given the rundown of them vs. the violent anthros like the rhino Molly fought by Tiberius, Rika is enthusiastically becoming acquainted with the others, including Alex, while also taking a tour of the sanctuary. Given what little you know about her, she seems happy to be making so many friends even if they aren't human. Commendable, really. You notice that she appears to be making it a point to keep away from Molly. Was she scared of her because of her size? Or was there something else? Maybe she just didn't like dogs... \"Um, excuse me, but...is there some reason you're avoiding Molly here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh! Er...no. I was just wanting to save her for last. Well, second last I guess.\" Rika replies but then adds, \"...Ugh. Total <i>baka</i> moment here...I just realized how dumb that sounds when more could be out there even now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baka?\" you ask in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Idiot'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just call me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I meant 'idiot' is what baka means in Japanese!\" she hastily corrects, \"Anyway...um, Molly was it? Could you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kneel down for you? Just a guess.\" Molly answers as she gets into said kneeling position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I uh...yeah. That's much better now that I'm not practically staring at either your hips or under your boobs...\" Rika admits, blushing slightly. \"It's nice to meet you, Molly. I saw you in the news yesterday, and I gotta say that was really cool how you got huge and totally Rider Kicked that brutish rhino guy! ...Also, I don't know if anyone's told this to you, but...you're really beautiful.\" she holds out her hand and asks, \"Um, can I pet you? I understand if you're beyond such a thing, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you, Rika! Someone has told me that now. And of course you may!\" Molly replies happily, and bends down a bit more to let Rika reach her head easier. The girl reaches up and pets Molly on the head, then proceeds to scratch just behind her ears. Molly groans softly with content until Rika stops, who seems utterly delighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...um...I guess we should be getting you back to your dad, then. He's gone out looking for you...\" Mizuru says somewhat sadly. \"I think he's genuinely worried sick about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika seems a bit hesitant, then replies, \"Yeah, I guess you're right. Anyone mind if I get my father to come here?\" when no one objected, she sends a text message with her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, there's a knock at the door in some sort of pattern. You approach and open the door to find a rather displeased Kosei Narumi on the other side. \"Explain what you have done with my daughter before I have you arrested. Why was I asked to come to this abandoned building. Where is my Rika?\" he asks coldly. For a man roughly the same height as Mizuru, he's certainly imposing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure what to say, you lead him inside. Rika smiles and waves at her father, who is instantly relieved to see her. \"Afternoon, father! You're alone, like I instructed?\" she says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sent that message yourself?!\" Kosei answers, turning to shock at what she's done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't want police involvement. I found Mizuru, father! Remember the bat I was nursing back to health that mother had tossed out a few months ago? I found her - or should I say, she found me?\" Rika explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice, dear, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am...a bit different from how you're remembering me, I'm sure.\" Mizuru replies as she comes to stand beside Rika happily. \"There's more of my kind here that Rika's befriended as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKosei is stunned at the sight of Mizuru as she takes and shakes his hand, remembering to not squeeze too hard. \"Y-your kind?\" he manages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Our kind. Anthros.\" Alex says as he and Tiberius enter with a few others. \"...Uh, maybe you ought to sit down before you fall down and hurt yourself, sir. This is our sanctuary. It's not very much, but we've come this far with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, for something that will blow your socks off, father! I'd like you to meet a very big friend of mine and Tom's, the man I <i>hope</i> you didn't threaten at the door because of me. And Mizuru's as well, of course.\" Rika announces, and Kosei's eyes widen at the sight of Molly as she approaches. \"I <i>did</i> mention she's very big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly waves her hand and says, \"Hello! I'm Molly! Yes, this is my normal height, all eight feet six inches of it. Yes, <i>these</i>,\" she points to her massive breasts. \"Are real. Your daughter has an expert hand for right where a girl likes it...behind the ears, of course.\"</span></div></div>",

He had heard rumors of creatures that looked like humanoid animals, and that they were hostile, but he thought nothing of it. Then the breaking news yesterday made him believe that the news station was unscrupulously trying to cash in on the rumors in order to boost their ratings. Now, he has very... <i>irrefutable</i> evidence that these anthros are very much real and that Molly especially is real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's also the matter of his daughter, Rika. Since they moved from Japan, she's been incredibly lonely. She learned English very quickly and fluently, which he expected no less from her, (not that it didn't make him feel like a proud father just the same) but hadn't made any friends over here. She's always liked animals, contrary to her mother, and has befriended this group of anthros. Including Mizuru, the bat she had been nursing back to health. She certainly looks more than healthy now, and both you and Kosei had a hunch that Rika and Mizuru are effectively inseparable now - they would remain best friends whether her father approved or not. But he did in fact approve of them, for he's happy for his daughter to finally have friends, and be willing to give them a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-incredible... Pleased to meet you.. <i>all</i> of you.\" Shakily, he offers his hand, and Molly takes it in her own to give a firm yet gentle handshake. Tiberius is next, and then Alex with some hesitation. Finally, Mizuru accepts the handshake, remembering to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father, they need our help.\" Rika says a few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do?\" Tiberius asks, the first time you've heard him sound so uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you do, kitty cat. You've no computers, thus no internet access. No TV. No newspaper or radio. No media connection to the outside world at all. We're not expecting the latest and greatest toys that a geek would drool over here, just <i>something</i> to be able to keep up with what's going on in the world we're all sharing. And do you even really want to have to rely on hand-me-outs, or would you like to be able to earn what you want and need for yourselves?\" Rika informs him bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... no.\" Tiberius admits finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what my daughter is getting at. I may be able to call in a few favors to assist in the matter. If you're willing, I can offer employment for some of you as well.\" Kosei says in response as he thinks it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While they may be lacking in the usual qualifiers for hiring... I think they're more than willing to try and learn on the job.\" you comment, which several of the anthros in the room nod in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes, Tiberius brings Rika's father up to speed on their history and what they've faced. Kosei listens intently, considering where some of the best spots for their employment may be for PR purposes that could benefit the anthros as well as his company. He was also surprised and shocked to find out they had no idea how or why they had turned into humanoid beings. You confirmed that you woke up to find Molly as the towering, busty, and very intelligent anthro she is just yesterday morning. \"What does it matter that they don't know how they came to be this way?\" Rika asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually... it would be kind of nice to have some of these answers. Like, if there's something out there that turns animals into anthros, how did we all become exposed to it? And how come Molly is so huge, and able to grow and return to her normal size at will?\" Mizuru replies thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few DNA samples can potentially offer some insight as to what has changed. I'm particularly interested in Ms. Molly here for this.\" Kosei comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Why me, though?\" Molly questions in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you were a pet dog before your... transformation, I assume the vet you've frequented in the past may have something more direct to compare to. Another anthro of a domesticated animal could be beneficial as well, like a horse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did you say a horse? I think that can be easily arranged tomorrow! ...uh, sir.\" Mizuru says enthusiastically. \"Rika is more than welcome to come along, if that's alright with you.\"</span></div></div>",

He could certainly use his daughter Rika's help, and is hesitant to let her go... but on the other hand she's rarely gone out anywhere since they moved here. Ultimately, he answers Mizuru with, \"I... guess that is fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika cheers at the news. Sure, she's nervous about going, but she was going with her friend Mizuru, and that excites her almost to no end. Soon though it was time for her to say goodbye, and the Narumis left for home. \"Nice girl, that Rika. She really is.\" Molly comments, rising to her full height. \"Perhaps your friends might like to take the trip as well?\" she then suggests to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's a great idea!\" Mizuru says happily, and then adds, \"...Er, provided Ryan doesn't do anything weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see. You can feel free to correct him if he gets on your nerves, he could use the ass kicking.\" you say casually. You don't think Ryan would cause trouble, but even you can't predict what he's going to do all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright...\" the bat anthro replies with obvious hesitance in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you and Molly head for home in order to prepare for this trip. First though is a side trip to the store for a much larger welcome mat for those muddier days so Molly can at least wipe her paws off before tracking stuff that really shouldn't be tracked through the house. The old one was about worn out anyway, bringing to light that they simply didn't make them like they used to anymore. You replace the mat as soon as you get home, and you get the feeling any anthro that visits may approve of the new welcome mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that afternoon, after having called both Kris and Ryan to see if they were busy tomorrow and if they wanted to go on a trip Mizuru was planning, you and Molly were watching TV. Before, she'd lie in your lap watching the screen while you pet her, but now... that wasn't really an option. Still, you feel your arm being gently lifted to behind her head so you could scratch behind her ears. You're slightly surprised to feel her head feeling much different than you remember. It feels almost like human hair. Sure enough, with her sitting down next to you, you can see some of the fur around her head extending further and noticeably more red than the rest did around it, curling a bit above her shoulders. Now that you think about it, Mizuru had almost black hair extending down behind her head as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the doorbell rings. \"I'll get it.\" Molly offers, getting up off the couch to head for the door. You turned the volume down just a bit so you could hear what was being said. \"Can I help you, sir? ...H-hang on...\" you hear, and then, \"Tom! Come here for a minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up off the couch, you make your way to the door and find a very well dressed man... looking very startled. \"I beg your pardon, sir, but I was instructed by my master to offer you and your... large lady friend a formal invite to his estate. I've also been instructed to give these to Ms. Molly, though they seem absurdly large...\" he says politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm</i> absurdly large.\" Molly responds pointedly as she reaches for the material the man is holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When are we to be there, should we accept?\" you ask as Molly slips off to check out what she's been given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, as soon as you're able. He's arranged for your pick up, along with Ms... Misuri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mizuru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ms. Mizuru! My master's daughter was especially adamant about her invitation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think it over carefully before finally saying, \"Give us a few minutes to get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sir.\" the man answers politely and you leave to gather a few things. Namely your phone and laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back to the door, you're confronted by Molly wearing a simple outfit of a sleeveless shirt and a pair of shorts that somehow allow her tail to fit through the back. \"This is actually quite comfortable! I can't wait to show Mizuru how I look in this!\" she says happily as you walk together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you head outside and the limo driver opens the back doors to allow you and the man you assume to be the Narumi estate's butler inside. Once inside, you spot Mizuru also aboard. \"Hey Tom! Hey Molly!\" she greets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told them where we live, didn't you?\" Molly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. When I got the invitation, since Ti mentioned you guys having already gone home, I told them where they could find you when they asked. ...Was that wrong of me to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's fine. By the way, how do you like this outfit I just got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It fits you to a T, Molly!\" Mizuru replies genuinely with a smile.</span></div></div>",

The butler seems to be the most uncomfortable one in the vehicle, which you assume is only because this is his first time around anthros. \"Come now, sir, neither of us are gonna reach over and bite ya... Your master wouldn't put you in danger, would he?\" Mizuru says, trying to calm the man down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I suppose not, m-miss...\" he admits somewhat hesitantly, even as the limo pulls into the opened gates of the Narumi estate. Past the gates, while still quite an expansive place compared to yours, it's much more modest than ones you've seen on TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the car comes to a stop, the driver opens the door to allow its passengers out. The butler opens the door and allows you, Mizuru, and Molly inside. You're quickly taken aback at how clean everything is as you're lead to a room. \"Sir, the guests you had requested to be invited are here.\" the butler says to the room's current occupants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, thank you, Ronald. Megumi is requesting your services when you have a moment.\" Kosei says, and then turns to you and the anthros to say, \"Glad that you could make it. Consider this in part an apology for my... earlier behavior. It also gives us a chance to get things organized for tomorrow and concerning the anthros, if you don't mind of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course not, Mr. Narumi!\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a bit of a tour, Molly? You too, Mizuru!\" Rika offers them, to which they agree and the three leave. You follow, figuring no one would mind if you tagged along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tour progresses, Mizuru is practically enthralled by nearly everything she sees. \"Didn't you live here before?\" Molly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just in Rika's room, and my eyesight wasn't nearly as good back then. Not to mention not getting a good glimpse of much when I got thrown out and called a filthy beast.\" Mizuru answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\" Rika says as the tour continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the tour culminates with the kitchen, where Ronald and an older Japanese woman you assume is Kosei's wife Megumi are preparing dinner. \"Ah, Rika! I was about to ask you what we should have for our guests, and...\" Megumi says before noticing the two anthro ladies entering the room behind Rika and yourself. \"What are these filthy <i>things</i> doing here?\" she asks with confusion and clear revulsion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? We're guests here, ma'am. And I am not a filthy beast! My name is Mizuru.\" the bat anthro answers angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly steps forward and picks up the 5'5\" woman with little effort, making her turn very pale with fear. \"We were invited here at the behest of your husband. I expect Mizuru will be coming here often, so I'd suggest getting used to her and the rest of our kind. Are we good?\" she says and asks. When Megumi nods, Molly gently lowers her back down to the floor and replies smiling, \"Good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Megumi quickly excused herself, Rika shook her head saying, \"Again, I'm sorry about this. I was hoping she wouldn't be so rude, but she still stubbornly hates anything 'unclean', which in her mind includes animals. And seemingly anthros. Maybe the scare will bring some sense to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... see. Well, I guess I should get to helping your father with organizing tomorrow, then.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem. I've already got my outfit for tomorrow picked out, something mother won't kill me for getting dirty, and I know father appreciates the help you can offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, most of tomorrow's plans have been made. The plans for integrating the anthros into Kosei's company's workforce are also well underway. Then dinner time comes and everyone beholds a feast befit a king. \"Um... wow. That... that's a lot of food...\" Rika remarks, giving the idea this isn't normal for the family. Both Molly and Mizuru closely watch everyone else start on the meal before digging in themselves, quickly picking up the proper etiquette for the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew... I'm the biggest one here, and I don't think I could stuff any more down...\" Molly sighs contentedly after the meal was finished. There's still a fair amount of food left over. By the late evening, Ronald leads you and Molly to a guest bedroom to spend the night while Mizuru goes to sleep with Rika at the girl's insistence.</span></div></div>",

Five more minutes, Molly...\" you groan in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Molly's large, fuzzy hand reaches down and pulls your eyelids open. \"Oh no. You're getting up now, mister! We wouldn't want to give Mr. Narumi the impression that you're a lazy-bones, would we?\" she responds, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I hate you.\" you grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't.\" Molly replies back, smile widening even further as you sigh with defeat. You get up and stretch, then try to straighten your hair before heading out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little ways down the hall, Rika says, \"Well good morning! I trust the beds were comfy enough? Father's already gone to work, in case you were wondering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like sleeping on a cloud.\" you respond as Molly steps out of the guest bedroom. \"Um, where's Mizuru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's in my room, trying out my Wii U. I think I created a monster...\" Rika responds, looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come ON! Stupid flying lizard!\" you hear Mizuru scream from a ways down the hall as she comes out. \"Just wait... once I actually learn what I'm doing, that Charizard's done for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Did I mention the game was Super Smash Bros. for Wii U?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, you and the three girls head into the kitchen for perhaps the grandest breakfast you've experienced in your up until a few days ago painfully average life. Once done, you're escorted to the limo in order to be taken to where Breeze lives. \"Anyone know her address, by any chance?\" Molly asks inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... well... I think she mentioned a horse farm just outside town. Does that help?\" Mizuru replies hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe that may be of some use, miss.\" the driver says politely as the limo pulls out onto the road. You're not sure exactly how such seemingly vague information can be of help to locate where Breeze calls home, but if the driver thought it good enough... who are you to say anything against this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe better part of an hour later, the limo comes to a stop a short distance from a house, with a large stable close by. You and the others get out and walk to the house. You knock on the door before a voice calls out from inside, \"Give me a minute! I'll be right with you!\" Soon the door opens and a fairly average looking man with straw colored hair opens the door. \"I help you, sir? I'm afraid I don't have any horses for sale at the moment for the girl, if that's what you're here for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here to see a certain mare, actually. You're Peter, right?\" Mizuru states, bringing attention to herself and Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am. And you must be Mizuru and... crap... uh... Molly. Breeze is in the stables with the other horses.\" Peter answers, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter leads the group towards the stables, pushing the door open. There's four horses of varying colors poking their heads out of the openings in their respective stables. \"Maximus, Phaedra, Billy, Biscuit, Breeze.\" Molly reads the nameplates of each as she passes, having to crouch a little to avoid hitting the ceiling. Rika reaches out to pet one of the horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze's head poked out of her stable at the sound of all the commotion and looks around before asking in her sweet, English accented voice, \"Master, you surely aren't thinking of selling any of your horses, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! Mizuru and Molly are here to visit you. And stop calling me 'master'! I've told you to call me Peter!\" Peter responds flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, everyone heads outside while Peter lets the horses out into the enclosure. It is then that Rika gets to behold the snow white anthro mare in all her glory. \"Oh wow, you really weren't kidding about her, Mizuru... She's beautiful!\" she remarks in slight awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comment doesn't go unnoticed, however, as Breeze turns her ears then her head and finally the rest of her body towards Rika before looking down. \"Oh, um, thank you! Can I ask you your name?\" Breeze asks, kneeling down and causing her barely-adequate top to protest against the huge furred globes behind them... not to mention her tight shorts that hid next to nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Rika Narumi. I took care of Mizuru before she became... well, what she is today.\" Rika answers happily.</span></div></div>",

As in <i>the</i> Narumi family that made that large charity donation a few days ago?!\" Peter asks, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's my father. We're currently looking into incorporating anthros into my father's company's workforce, even if that kitty cat Tiberius wasn't so convinced that they needed assistance initially.\" Rika responds, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well! Th-that's certainly an honorable goal... but surely you haven't come all this way j-just to see Breeze, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're hoping that a DNA sample along with her past medical records might help solve the mystery of why we've become like this.\" Molly answers and then adds, \"I've been asked for the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To see what's changed in us, correct? I think it sounds reasonable...\" Breeze muses while allowing Rika to pet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the surroundings fall deathly quiet. Birds fly away from the trees, as though something has disturbed them. Then the sound of something big lumbering towards the farm can be heard. \"I've got a bad feeling we're not alone out here...\" you say nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mizuru is about to respond, a large anthro shark bursts out from the woods, heading towards the group... albeit not as smoothly as the rhino from the other day had been moving. One thing was very clear aside from the size - this anthro was female. Perhaps she was having trouble due to being out of the water? As this apparently violent shark gets closer, she appears to be homing in on... Rika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay away from her!\" Mizuru yells, attempting to get in the way of the 25 foot tall anthro. For her troubles, the shark swats her aside almost effortlessly, yet still seems to stumble a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shark lunges to try and devour the teenage Japanese girl, Molly grabs the shark's jaws with her hands. \"I'm going to have to deal with you, aren't I? Why are you after a friend of mine?\" she asks, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark grunts, and tries to get rid of Molly, only to find her getting larger and larger by the second. Soon she's thrown back and now faces a 35 foot tall Molly. The shark now lunges for the larger dog anthro but receives a punch to the mouth instead. She takes a moment to spit out a number of broken teeth, which vanish as they presumably shrink down to their normal size. \"Oh my...\" Breeze remarks in alarm, the busty mare doing her best to get Rika and Mizuru out of harm's way. You and Peter are both well out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, the rhino was a better fighter than you!\" Molly taunts, and then notices her clothes haven't torn off her and still fit just fine. \"Huh... Sweet.\" she remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment's distraction is all that's needed for the shark to headbutt Molly and knock her to the ground. Fortunately, the border collie anthro is thoughtful enough to keep herself from accidentally crushing anything beneath her, especially the horses. The shark moves in apparently for the kill... but stops just short of trying to crush her prey's windpipe. Why you don't know, but it's enough time for Molly to deliver a kick to the abdomen and get back up. She then charges in and gives a swift uppercut to the shark's jaw, knocking her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... let's go over this again. Why are you after Rika Narumi?\" Molly demands, pinning the shark to the ground. When the shark begins to shrink down, Molly accidentally hits her in the head as she follows suit. It's not long before the border collie is back to her usual 8'6\" self, albeit incredibly muddy, but the shark continues until about 6'2\" in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... that was scary, but so totally awesome!\" Rika says as she and the others come out of hiding and then remarks, \"Though you're seriously going to need to get cleaned up before you go anywhere, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding... Strange though. That shark had me there for a moment. She could have killed me no problem, and yet she... I don't know... froze. I distinctly remember the rhino not doing that.\" Molly answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did one of those violent ones get here though? Especially one that's like a great white. The ocean's miles away!\" Peter wonders aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe having her ass handed to her will make our fishy girl more more talkative?\" Mizuru suggests, and everyone turns their attention to where the shark was last spotted. Luckily, she still seems to be there and is just now coming to.</span></div></div>",

I think it's starting to come back to me... The human girl! I didn't...\" the shark anthro says, looking around desperately. You've no idea what's going on, but she's acting completely different than before. For starters, she's showing emotions, something she wasn't earlier. And seems to be rather nervous. Then again, facing someone who towers over two feet over you could do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here, sharkie. Angry you failed to kill me?\" Rika speaks up, unsure whether this is an act or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Actually, I'm happy I didn't. That would make the ones behind the violent ones very happy, and I don't want the bastards to have their way, especially now that they're not controlling me like a puppet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis information catches everyone's attention. \"S-so the reason the violent ones don't listen to reason... is because they can't?\" Breeze asks, bringing her hand to her muzzle in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, the shark stands up and nods, replying, \"Essentially, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, everyone begins to slowly normalize. Molly has gotten herself all cleaned up, and while most are still... apprehensive around the shark anthro, she's done nothing to hurt her case. Breeze offers her a few apples, which she accepts with some hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, um... do you have a name we can call you by?\" Mizuru asks carefully, taking a seat next to the one who just half an hour earlier swatted her aside as though she wasn't worth bothering with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't give names to their puppets/weapons... I guess it makes us easier to control if we don't have any sense of individuality. Nothing to cling onto. However... I remember being called Kayla some point before all of this, and I kind of like it, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Kayla is a wonderful name!\" Breeze beams, smiling wide before embracing Kayla in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long, however, before the shark is attempting to break free of the suffocation from having her head stuck in Breeze's cleavage. \"G-gee, thanks, Breeze... But, um, I could use a little warning before you hug me again...\" Kayla says carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sorry!\" Breeze responds, letting Kayla's head out of her considerable chest. The mare completely fails to notice you or Peter doing your best to look away from the admittedly arousing scene, for whatever reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, you arrange to pick up Molly's records from the vet while Peter gets Breeze's in order. The more difficult part is getting blood from the anthros now. As it turns out, their skin is very puncture resistant. Eventually, samples are taken from both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, should I be worried about my father possibly being attacked?\" Rika asks as preparations are being made to head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know for sure, but I don't think they would today anyway. They'll want to analyze their major loss, as they're not going to be happy to lose me or failed to turn your father against anthros by killing you, and try to ensure they don't lose another puppet before going forward with another attack.\" Kayla answers with some thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why though?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they <i>fear</i> humans and anthros working together.\" Kayla suggests, and then asks, \"Um, if it isn't too much to ask... Could I go back with you guys? I don't really have anywhere to go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Tiberius probably won't object, so why not? Besides, I'm sure he's going to find what you know very interesting.\" Mizuru answers, shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know as much as I'd like to be able to share, but I'll be sure to tell what I can.\" Kayla replies with a happy, toothy smile. For the first time in her life as an anthro, she's in control of herself. At least, as far as you know. This could all still be some elaborate trap, but somehow you doubt it. Still, it begs the question: who <i>are</i> the ones in control of the violent ones?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few minutes later, and pulling Kayla away from the horses as the anthro shark tries to pet them, everyone is ready to leave. Kayla seems quite visibly excited - and enthralled at the sight of the limousine. \"Wow, so that's your method of transportation... Cool!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, though I've also got a bicycle. And it's actually the family's limo.\" Rika responds as she gets inside followed by yourself and the anthro ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... bicycle. That's a two wheeled vehicle that you pedal, right?\" Kayla asks with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is.\" Rika answers, not sure why the shark was asking such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride continues like this until the limo arrives at the sanctuary a little while later, with Kayla's apparent enthusiasm only increasing. Outside are a few trucks that Alex and Tiberius are helping to unload. The humans apparently delivering the goods are clearly nervous around them, but are grateful for the assistance. Everyone steps out of the limo for the moment at least, where one of the workers comes up and says, \"Ah! Ms. Narumi! Th-this is the correct address for this stuff, is it not? If I'm honest, these... <i>creatures</i> give me the creeps. Especially the tiger-like one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is the right address, and you've absolutely nothing to fear from Tiberius. He may look like a fierce tiger, but he's really just a big kitten.\" Rika responds reassuringly, then adds, \"Oh, and they're called anthros, not creatures. Wouldn't want to insult future employees of my father's company, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... n-no, Ms. Narumi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. My father and I are convinced they deserve the chance to live the kinds of lives we take for granted. Part of that is respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nods in understanding, and then looks up towards the source of the looming shadow, that of course being Molly. She gives him a polite smile and a friendly wave hello, but it does little to ease his fears towards the towering, buxom anthro dog. \"Alright, what's left to bring in? I may have had a knock-down drag-em-out earlier, but I'm still in good enough shape to help out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we just brought in the last of it. Sorry!\" Alex answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fight? Is everyone alright?\" Tiberius asks upon hearing of the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Breeze saw to it everyone was safe. The shark nearly had me, though...\" Molly replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... shark anthro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Her, in fact. Kayla, this is Tiberius. Tiberius, Kayla.\" Molly answers, and then pulls Kayla into view, keeping a hold of her wrist so that the 6'2\" shark anthro can't try to flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... h-hi there...\" Kayla says nervously, waving her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should carry this conversation on inside...\" Tiberius suggests, feeling it might put the delivery men at greater ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, nearly everyone is inside to continue the conversation. \"So, explain yourself. Please.\" Tiberius asks, sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well, I was being controlled to kill Rika in order to try and turn her dad against us anthros and Molly stopped me. I don't remember exactly what she did, apart from knocking a bunch of my teeth out, but somehow they've lost control over me.\" Kayla answers, clearly very nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then even the rhino we've encountered a few times has been merely a puppet for an unseen force?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess? We're denied a lot of things you and humans enjoy... identities... social interactions... anything that can even charitably be described as food... They want to control our bodies, but our minds are worthless to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiberius' face flips from looks of horror, to disgust, and even held back rage begging for release before his white and black striped face returns to its usual calm composure as he says, \"My god... I... I'm not sure what to say about this other than how much I'm really disliking this... entity or entities that are behind all of this.\" the tiger pauses for a few seconds before asking, \"Could someone bring Rika in here for a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it.\" Molly answers, ducking outside to avoid bumping her head on the door frame. It's not very long before she returns, closely followed by the Japanese girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to see me, kitty-cat?\" Rika asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a hidden foe that's using my kind as weapons, tools for destruction. I believe that it is our duty to inform your father of this, make him aware of the dangers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to worry him, but I agree that he needs to know. Perhaps we can spin this in our favor? I've also been thinking about Kayla... She could provide some insight as to how these terrorists control their puppets - and more importantly, how we can cut the strings before things get too costly both with property damage and potential lives lost.\" Rika answers, looking towards the surprised shark anthro. \"And we'll get you something nice to wear as well.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kayla slowly nods and says shakily, \"I-if you think it'll help, then I'll go through with it. But, um... when are we going to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika answers, turning to look into the shark's amber eyes, \"Very shortly. Just got to help get these guys all set up.\" and with that, the girl gets to work. Admittedly, some of the new things she and her father had brought in are nicer than the stuff you have at home. You're... not quite sure how to feel about that, but you help out showing how everything works. Most of the anthros are enthralled by the demonstrations, hanging on to every word said. Soon enough, they're given the chance to try out the new computers and TV, which they seem to get the hang of very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more than half an hour later, Mizuru turns from watching Tiberius surf the internet and asks curiously, \"I suppose you guys are off for those tests? ...Where exactly are you going, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to my father's company building. There's a R&amp;D lab inside that we'll be using for this.\" Rika answers to her anthro bat friend, and then adds, \"Though there's a couple matters to take care of before that. Like getting Molly's medical records.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The vet's kind of out of the way... I know! How about you three,\" Molly starts, gesturing towards Rika, Mizuru, and Kayla, \"take care of what else you need to while Tom and I get my records? If you tell me what to look for, we can meet you at your dad's building. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the large grey building near the center of town. Hard to miss. We should be there in a few hours from now if everything goes smoothly.\" Rika informs, stifling a giggle before she, Mizuru, and Kayla leave for the limo which drives off soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Molly go outside, you yell up into her face, \"What were you THINKING?! We're miles from the vet and home! Walking the whole way will take forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly narrows her icy blue eyes and smirks right back. \"No it won't. Who said anything about you walking?\" she remarks and then slowly begins to grow bigger. You back up and attempt to run, but Molly picks up the pace and takes two growing steps forward before lifting you off the ground in one hand. \"Hey don't be running off... Hang on to my neck!\" she tells you as she lifts you up to her neck, still growing. Seeing little choice, you cling to her neck for dear life as she starts running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n50 feet of gorgeous, anthropomorphic dog barrels through the city, being very careful where she places each step while somehow not losing any speed. Cars have little time to avoid each gigantic paw that comes down in front of them, but is gone before any can crash into them. \"Excuse me! Sorry! In a hurry here! Eyes on the road, not at me!\" she shouts to the traffic below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Molly reaches the vet clinic, lets you down, and then resumes her normal size. You think about berating her over her actions, but think better of it as you both go inside and take a seat. The doctor himself comes out in a minute and motions for you to come inside his office. \"Ah, Tom! Here for Molly's medical records, right? ...Er, your friend there can take off the costume.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a costume, doc. And I'm doing very well, thank you!\" Molly replies, almost enjoying the wide-eyed look she receives in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need the records to help us figure how this happened to her... and others like her.\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vet gives her a few basic tests like her blood pressure and weight (\"479 lbs! I <i>am</i> a big girl...\") before handing the records over. \"I... I guess this is goodbye, doc. I hate to admit it, but I'm gonna miss coming here. Thanks... for everything.\" Molly says, sniffing and wiping a tear away before you and she exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even know you <i>could</i> cry.\" you remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it. I'm sentimental. Now let's get going...\" she responds curtly, before adding with her tongue sticking out, \"...unless you'd like to walk the whole way there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly once again grows to the terrifying size of 50 feet and lifts you to her neck. Once she feels you clinging on, she walks through the busier downtown area, maneuvering herself between the buildings as best as her curvy form allows. \"Pardon me! Watch out! Yes, staring at my big boobs is <i>so</i> going to help you stay out of my way...\" she shouts to those in her path, occasionally pausing to nudge a person or vehicle out of her way with her incoming paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arrival, Molly rests her gigantic self against the side of the building, careful not to damage it, and taps the top floor and waves hello while she waits. Half an hour later, the Narumi family's limo pulls into the parking lot and the three passengers step out. \"Welcome to NaruTech, guys!\" Rika announces as Molly sets you down and returns to her normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three more of them, huh? The other one's waiting just outside R&amp;D lab 4.\" the receptionist says, trying to not appear frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Father should be pleased she came, especially since... I totally forgot to invite her.\" the teen admits and then leads the group onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter more twists and turns than you can hope to keep track of, the group arrives before a huge metal door with a 4 printed on it. Breeze is sitting nearby patiently, seemingly oblivious to the stares she gets from many male employees. \"Peter and I were in town to get some lumber when we remembered you needed my records, so I came over to deliver them.\" the mare explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Kosei Narumi appears out of the nearby elevator. \"Welcome! You must be the one Mizuru referred to the other day. I'm Kosei Narumi.\" he introduces himself, giving a bow and holding out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Breeze. Pleasure to meet you!\" Breeze replies as she stands up to return the shake and bow, unintentionally giving him a view of her cavernous cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKosei blushes and clears his throat before finding a distraction in Kayla, asking, \"Oh? And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika informs her father of everything that transpired today, and her thoughts that Kayla might provide some needed insight. Kayla herself looks on nervously, fiddling with the shoulder straps of her green top. \"I'm willing to do what it takes to help stop these guys, s-sir.\" she says finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm angered that you tried to hurt my Rika... but at the same time, I recognize that you're not at fault, and greatly appreciate your cooperation.\" he responds and adds, \"Very well, let us be underway with the tests. Hopefully, we can find some answers.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The huge metal doors of the lab open and Kosei enters followed by Rika and Mizuru, then Breeze, yourself, Molly, and finally Kayla. The shark anthro's tail is barely past the doorway before it quickly slides shut behind her, causing her to practically jump ten feet in the air with a surprised yelp. \"My apologies, the timing of the door will need adjusting to account for tails in the near future.\" Kosei says apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no problem...\" Kayla replies, looking as though she's starting to have second thoughts about agreeing to all this. She gulps and attempts to look braver. You guess that she feels if she were to bail out now, she'd never be trusted, which probably isn't far from the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I took samples from you earlier, Breeze, Molly, but we'd like to take another if that's alright.\" Rika asks, withdrawing a syringe from the desk. Both nod and hold out their arm to let her draw some blood, again with some difficulty from their skin. Kayla visibly shakes as she seems to perceive something none of the others do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine... just a little hungry all of the sudden.\" Kayla states, and then adds defensively in regard to the stares, \"I'm a shark, okay? I get hungry when I smell blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have something to eat after we finish the tests. The doctor I hired to perform the tests should be here momentarily.\" Kosei informs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the door slides open and a man of about 30 enters the room wearing a lab coat and gloves. \"Alright, what is it I'm to be working... on...\" the man trails off as he notices the quartet of anthros in the room. \"...Oh. Oh my...\" Almost unconsciously, he messes with his tie and tries to seem as professional as possible without wetting himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you trying to straighten out your tie and coat?\" Kayla asks him inquisitively, causing him to snap out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um... no reason...\" he answers, backing away a bit from the slightly taller anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just running some tests on the blood samples of the taller two, Molly and Breeze.\" Kosei says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it? I don't think that will take too long, just let the machine do most of the work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...\" Kayla gulps, again trying to swallow her nerves, \"some more advanced tests on me. Something in me might provide valuable insight, and we'd like to know what it is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got Molly and Breeze's medical records for a comparison.\" you add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, very well then. Forgive me if I'm stumbling on myself here, this is the first time I've had to deal with these... anthros.\" the man immediately gets to work, taking the samples and placing them in a special machine he brought with him. He examines a bit of the blood through a provided microscope. \"There seems to be an awful lot of white blood cells here... They seem normal enough though.\" he notes. Soon enough, the DNA tests are ready and he takes his time to study them. \"Okay, this is interesting... and weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Mizuru asks, her green eyes clearly trying to read the results herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their DNA is downright alien. It's like something removed sequences responsible for certain traits, and put superhuman-like ones in their place. This can't possibly be natural. DNA doesn't suddenly radically change like this, and certainly not so consistently across very different animal species.\" the doctor explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something out there created us deliberately. But why? How?\" Breeze finishes for him, taking a moment to brush her mane of white hair out of her eyes as she looks down in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea... At any rate, I guess you're up... um, what's your name?\" he asks Kayla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kayla. Is this going to hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope not, but I can't guarantee it'll be painless.\" he says, and then turns to everyone else. \"I'm sorry, but it would be better if you step outside for this. I'll let you know when it's safe to come back in and we can discuss whatever I find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and everyone else comply and exit the lab, the metal doors sliding closed after. It's nerve-wracking, but what else can be done? Kosei guides you, Molly, Breeze, and Mizuru to the side wall before Rika pushes a button near the wall. The once seemingly opaque wall suddenly becomes clear and you can see and hear the procedure going on. \"Alright, Kayla, just lie down on the table as best as you can. This... hm, this mask won't do. I'm sorry, but I'll have to give you an injection instead... Kayla?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon laying on her back, Kayla seems to... almost zone out. It's the most peaceful you've seen the shark anthro. \"...Yes? That's fine, but will it leave me paralyzed for a bit?\" she asks, and the doctor nods. \"Good... then there's no way I can possibly hurt you.\" she remarks with a grin as he injects her with a sedative, after some difficulty getting the needle in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Kayla's amber eyes close, the doctor gets to work cutting into her head. \"There seems to be indications of blunt force trauma to the back of her head... Skull appears to be bone rather than cartilage, and something has cut into the cranial cavity some time ago.\" he notes, dabbing away a bit of her blood. Taking a tiny saw-like tool, he gradually cuts into her skull until he can remove it carefully. \"The anthro's brain appears to have a highly developed cerebral cortex, not unlike a human's. Fascinating. Should the opportunity arise, I'll see about studying a deceased individual...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might be waiting awhile...\" Mizuru mutters upon hearing the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hence the 'should the opportunity arise' part, miss.\" the doctor replies over the two-way speaker, then moves on to the back of Kayla's head. \"What the... what is this thing doing around the cerebellum?\" he asks as he removes something from her head and proceeds to close her head back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, the all clear is given and everyone reenters the lab. \"So, what did you find? Will she be alright?\" you ask curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kayla will make a full recovery. The paralysis should leave her system soon. I found this device in her head. It appears to be designed to control voluntary muscle movement, possibly blocking neural signals it doesn't send itself. It's damaged, and appeared to be connected to something I couldn't get to in her head, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that working in her head... she'd be effectively unable to control herself. Like a puppet on a string.\" Molly remarks with realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can still hear you guys over there...\" you hear Kayla speak. Turning your head, you see the silvery blue haired shark getting up off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor thing!\" Breeze cries out with sympathy, and unable to help herself, runs over and binds Kayla in a tight embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... for the sympathy, B-Breeze... Didn't we... agree on... a warning for this?\" Kayla says, struggling for breath between the air being squeezed out of her like some squeaky toy and the face full of barely-contained boobage.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After letting it be for a minute or so, Molly loudly clears her throat to get Breeze's attention, and the mare releases Kayla before she potentially unintentionally suffocates the shark. Upon her freedom, Kayla greedily gulps down air for half a minute as though it were the most wonderful thing in the world. You're still not quite certain how it is she breathes, but you assume one such human-like trait she has is having lungs instead of gills. \"Whew... Well then, if that's everything needed from me... I'd... I'd like what was promised me. This lab reeks of blood, a good part of it my own, and now my stomach's convinced I'm starving...\" Kayla says, her timidness returning almost in full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think there's anything else at this time, aside from maybe an X-ray or two which I don't have the equipment here to do anyhow.\" the doctor admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, doctor. I'll be sure my secretary sends the money to your account right away.\" Kosei informs him, and then calls his secretary. \"Kris, can you make sure Dr. Waters receives the money we had agreed upon?\" Wait - <i>Kris</i>? \"This device may yield some vital information, but I feel it would be best to examine it after the lab has been decontaminated so we have as much of a controlled environment as possible.\" he mentions after as everyone exits the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if it was inside my head, then I don't think the current mess will affect-\" Kayla starts before Rika places her hand over the shark anthro's mouth to silence her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we make this just a little more clear... The device can wait until tomorrow, and the lab needs to be cleaned and decontaminated for safety reasons anyway. Are we clear?\" Rika tells Kayla. The shark places her hand over the teen's and easily lifts it away just a bit, then nods her understanding. \"Good. Now, let's get some dinner.\" she smiles and lets her hand down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Good idea! Anyone mind me coming along?\" an all-to-familiar voice asks. You turn around to see Kris... more dressed up than you've seen her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. One last thing, however. Can you place this device somewhere safe? I fear it would be unwise to leave it out in the open, especially with the decontamination crew coming in.\" Kosei asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem.\" Kris responds, and then puts on a pair of latex gloves before gently picking up the device from Kayla's head and walking away out of sight. She returns empty handed about a minute later, taking the gloves off and washing her hands. \"Oh, and Dr. Waters? The money Mr. Narumi had agreed to pay for your services should show up in your account within the next 24 hours.\" she informs the doctor on his way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, arrangements of who is to travel with who to the restaurant are made. The Narumis, Mizuru, and Kayla take the limo while you, Breeze, Molly, and Kris take her truck. \"Are you certain you wish for me to travel with you?\" Breeze asks with uncertainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I could just walk there myself...\" Molly adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris pauses for a moment, no doubt thinking about how Molly would get there, and then replies, \"Molly, it's getting dark. Please, both of you just get in my truck. There's enough room for both of you. Molly's getting shotgun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside, Molly has little choice but to concede on Kris' point. The four of you reach Kris' blue truck where she unlocks the doors. Molly gets in the front passenger seat while you and Breeze occupy the back seats. The mare's long legs are pressed up somewhat uncomfortably behind the driver's seat, yet not a peep of complaint comes out of her mouth. Kris gets in and starts the truck, driving it out of the back parking lot for employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, since when were you the secretary?\" you ask along the way, never thinking your childhood friend would be able to sit long enough for the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude. I've had the job for weeks now! My friend had it before me, but she left when it just wasn't working out for her. She recommended me for it and I took the job.\" Kris responds, and then adds, \"I see though that you've gotten Mr. Narumi acquainted with Mizuru. That's awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Kris pulls in to the restaurant's parking lot and finds a spot for her truck. Molly exits and happily stretches, as evidenced from her raised tail. Breeze gets out and rubs her knees and shins that had been pressed against the back of the driver seat. Still, the busty, almost ghostly in the low light of the evening mare appears to be pleased to be here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entry, the person who seats the customers approaches your group and automatically takes you to where the others are seated. There's a ton of stares from people towards both the non-humans already seated at the table and especially the ones just joining. And somehow every last stare of attraction, envy, and/or jealousy towards Breeze goes completely over the white mare's head. Molly on the other hand notices the stares in her direction and tries to just ignore it, though is far less successful than Breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, everyone makes their meal selections, with Kayla taking the longest to decide aside from steering clear of the choice of shark fin soup. (\"People actually cut off shark fins... and put them into <i>soup</i>? That's... barbaric!\") Breeze orders herself a salad and replies to the questioning stares at the table, \"I don't particularly care for meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meals come some time later, and everyone begins to dig in. At first, Kayla seems to do so a little <i>too</i> enthusiastically, but then quickly catches Rika and Mizuru's disapproving stares. \"Sorry...\" she apologizes meekly with a reddish tint to her grey cheeks strongly hinting at her blushing, and rapidly begins to get the hang of using a knife and fork. By the time everyone finishes, you could hardly tell that the shark anthro had never used them before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bills come a few minutes later, and you look at yours with wide eyes. The price is a lot higher than you're used to paying to eat out, and while you could have let either Kosei or Kris pay, you didn't want to burden them when you can pay for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone is outside, Kayla says, \"That was the best thing I've ever eaten at least since I became an anthro! Thank you, both for the meal and... eheh... putting up with my poor manners earlier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone returns to the vehicles they took to the restaurant and begin heading home. It takes the better part of half an hour, but soon you're returned to your house and both you and Molly exit Kris' truck. \"I've got the day off tomorrow, so I'll probably be over at the sanctuary. Breeze will stay with me tonight, and I'll call this Peter fellow to let him know.\" Kris tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, shouldn't I just be taken home?\" Breeze asks worriedly as she gets out to seat herself in the front passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about it! I don't mind having you over for the night, really!\" Kris insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay then...\" is the mare's still unsure reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Molly enter your house just as they leave. Tiredly, you say goodnight to her and get ready for bed, falling asleep as soon as your head hits the pillow.</span></div></div>",

Then, a fuzzy hand brushes against your feet... before everything suddenly starts feeling cold. Startled, you open your eyes and find Molly having pulled off the bed sheets, it still hanging from her hand. \"Good almost afternoon, sleepyhead! I trust I don't need to do anything else to convince you to get up?\" the 8'6\" anthro says, wearing a huge grin on her face and wagging her bushy tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumpy, you comply and get out of bed. \"Fine. Now unless you intend to take complete advantage of me while I get dressed, I'd like a little privacy.\" you tell her... though having sex with her <i>does</i> sound rather appealing. However, the busty dog shakes her head and ducks out the door... still carrying your bed sheets off with her. Ever the clever bitch, in the nicest way of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce showered and dressed, you head into the kitchen for some breakfast. The clock on the wall has its hour hand between 11 and 12, while the minute hand is currently hovering over the 6... Better call it brunch, then. Quickly, you whip up some brunch and then devour it to quell your grumbling stomach. Since Molly didn't join or even poke her not-so-little head in, you assume she's already had something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly left breathless when Molly's large, toned arms wrap around your torso and pull you against the back of your chair. Once she lets go, you turn and ask, \"What was that for? Could have nearly choked me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. I was barely squeezing you! And that was for everything! What, I'm not allowed to show some affection and gratitude?\" Molly answers, waiving your concern. She then leans down to your ear with narrowed eyes and adds with a smirk, \"Or would you rather that in bed? Don't think that's healthy, good sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to realize she's probably going to have fun tormenting you on what you had said earlier... \"N-no, this is good just as is... I don't think I'm ready to have a 479 lb girl grinding my pelvic bones to jello...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither. As in, I don't think you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little awkward, you decide to just drop it entirely. You turn your computer on and check your email. A few pieces of spam, and a message from Ryan. \"Hey man. Heard from Kris the anthros will be starting work at NaruTech today. Not all just yet, supposedly they want to slowly introduce them and see if they make a good fit, but that's kind of cool. I think I'll be swinging by the Sanctuary today to say hi to whoever is still there. P.S. say hi to Molly for me, and a scratch behind the ears. You know she deserves it, putting up with you.:p\" Interesting, though there's still that device that came out of Kayla's head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You read the man. Now, where's my ear scratch?\" Molly says with delight over your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFigures she'd be reading your email over your shoulder. You're not even going to protest at this point. \"Soon as you crouch down, girl. I'm not breaking out the step-ladder to reach 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall, busty dog anthro crouches down almost immediately. Her icy blue eyes close with content as you scratch just behind her reddish brown ears, your hand pushing aside her red hair as you do. For as much as she can make herself... more than a handful these days, you can hardly imagine life without this amazon in it, whatever the reason she and others like her exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you stop, your hand starting to cramp slightly, and Molly opens her eyes. \"That felt so nice... So, shall we pay the Sanctuary a visit? I'm kind of curious to find out how Breeze fared last night with Kris. God I hope she didn't corrupt the poor mare's mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about the tall, busty white mare named Breeze. A walking wet dream of a body with a fine coat that hides very little of her ample curves, yet seems so utterly oblivious to the stares she receives. Or is she really that oblivious to the effect she has, and simply doesn't care that much? \"I think she's safe. Actually, I'm a bit more worried about Kayla being influenced by Ryan.\" you voice your opinions, and then say in response to the Sanctuary, \"Sure. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your keys, you and Molly head outside. You head for your car, but Molly says, \"Seriously? You want to take your cramped car, when you and I both know what I can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. And you worry about Breeze's mind being corrupted, when I have to wonder if <i>you</i> haven't let this go straight to your head...\" you say teasingly as you put your keys away and wait for Molly to get up to size. It still amazes you how she can do this, and so fluidly. Soon, her head is level with the roof, and still she keeps adding mass to herself. She reaches her previous biggest size of 50 feet and stops at it, though you have your doubts that she has even approached her limit yet. You climb into her enormous, outstretched hand, and then she begins to make her way to the Sanctuary through the city as carefully as she can.</span></div></div>",

At least it would be worth it when you got to the stables. Breeze always seemed to make your day better, no matter what had fortune may have befallen you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling as you finally arrive at the stable, you unlock the door and step inside, stamping to clear the mud off your boots. Closing the door behind you, you walk through the stable. Several year ago, you'd owned quite a few horses, but you couldn't afford to keep them all, and had been forced to sell them, one by one, until only Breeze remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't going to sell Breeze. Not now, not ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had been the names of your other horses? Ah, yes: Maximus, Phaedra, Billy, and Biscuit. You only hoped that they were being treated well by their masters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping outside Breeze's door, you flick the light switch for her stable, and hear the pure white mare shuffle about inside as the lights come on. Smiling, you push the door open, and see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze. But not as you recognised her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze's formerly equine body had been twisted and reshaped into an approximation of a human's body, but she had kept her horse head, her tail, and her legs still ended in hooves. A pair of massive breasts adorned her chest, the two furred globes reaching down to her smooth stomach. Her wide hips obscured a perfectly round ass that would easily spill over the sides of your lap if she sat on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, last but not least, was her height. You yourself were average height at six foot even, but Breeze loomed far above you at a whopping seven foot and a half, her head a mere six inches from the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that you had been staring at Breeze's magnificent body, you turn your gaze downward as the equine takes a tentative step forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happens next?</i></span></div></div>",

You stare at her in shock, and she stares back at you. Neither of you say a word for some time. You're just both looking into each others eyes...until...your eyes begin to drift downwards towards her unnaturally large mammaries. It was a bit strange for her to have them, considering she's a horse, after all, but she shouldn't be able to talk, either, so it balances out...you guess. You stare at them for more time then you'd like to admit...and you realize that Breeze was watching you stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head away quickly in embarresment, face turning a bright red. \"You don't have to be ashamed of staring, master.

Thankfully, it doesn't seem to hurt her - if anything, it's pleasurable, as evidenced by the growing mare's quiet groaning and panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze slowly rises higher and higher, her moans growing increasingly louder as she expands. Sitting flat on her arse, Breeze was chin height to you - then your height - and then taller than you! And she was still sitting down! Gulping, you back away slightly from the growing mare, though you do not stop looking at her beautiful body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her growth spurt slows and ceases, you can see that Breeze's cheeks were tinged a slight red. Blushing, Breeze looks down at you, before inspecting the room from her new height. Still sitting down, Breeze attracts your attention with a gentle tap on your shoulder with an index finger over twice the length and thickness of yours. God, she was huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I like the inside of my stable, master, I think it's a bit...\" Breeze carefully and slowly rises to her hooves, but is unable to stand upright. In fact, she's almost bent over double! Emphasising her height by placing her hands palm up on the ceiling, Breeze finishes her sentence. \"...cramped. I think it's going to be a bit hard for me to get outside, master...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing yourself to momentarily ignore the wobbling spheres the protruded from Breeze's chest, you try to come up with a solution that doesn't involve damaging the stable, which has held so many memories over they years. Unfortunately, you find none. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you sink to your knees, trying to cope with the insanity of the situation you find yourself in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breeze, what are we going to do?\" Her attention is instantly focused on you, a worried look on her muzzle. As huge as she was, she was still the mare you'd known for years. \"Master?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't hear her, too absorbed within your thought process. \"I mean, how did this even happen? You, transforming into a furry, then growing, speaking, and then growing even larger... God, what are we going to do? I don't know if I'll be able to feed you if you're this big, and you'll have to sleep outside in the cold, and- and-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly find a fair portion of your mouth covered by one of Breeze's large, slender fingers. Looking up into Breeze's huge blue eyes, you can't help but feel truly small. She was at least twice as tall as you, and most likely had a fair bit of size on top of that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping her finger on your mouth, Breeze slowly resumes sitting, her large rear squishing against the stable floor. \"It'll be okay, master.\" Even as she reassures you, you can't help but feel more doubts bubble up from inside you. \"But what if-\" you begin, but you are once again cut off by Breeze. \"It'll be okay, master.\" She repeats, this time more confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shoulders slump slightly. \"I... I guess it might...\" Looking up at the 12.5 foot tall mare, who is currently seated, you find yourself unsure of what to do next. Breeze, however, seems to know what she wants to do, at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master?\" Breeze spreads her arms wide, making sure not to hit the walls of the room. \"Hug?\" You're obliging her request before you know it, leaning into the huge plush globes that erupted from her chest. Two monstrous hands gently caress your back, gently pushing you further into the hug. Try as you might, you just can't link up your hands behind Breeze's back - her torso has grown so large, and her breasts have enlargened so much that you can't manage it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look tired, master... Do you want to sleep in here, like that one night?\" Several years ago, when you and Breeze had both been a fair bit younger, you had decided, on a whim, to spend the night with Breeze in her stable. At that point you had other horses, and had done the same with them at various points. Despite your valiant efforts at staying awake, you had fallen asleep some time after midnight, and had awoken to find yourself draped across Breeze's sleeping form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to, Breeze, but I don't have a blanket...\" Breeze grins, pushing you right up against her humongous tits. \"Aren't I warm enough for you, master?\" She was more than warm enough. You find yourself not wanting to leave Breeze's embrace, but are forced to as she repositions herself, lying on her side and taking up most of the floor in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying down next to her, you nestle your body in against hers, feeling her powerful heart beat as you position your head just shy of her breasts. \"It's been a stressful morning for you, hasn't it, master? Don't worry, you'll feel better when you wake up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmotional exhaustion quickly catches up to you. Despite the fact that you had awoken only an hour or two earlier, you find yourself easily slipping back into sleep as Breeze's thick arms gently squeeze you against her fluffy, white furred form...</span></div></div>",

'Funny how things turn out' you think to yourself, as you finally lose consciousness, Breeze pulling you even closer as she fell asleep, herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few, short hours, you're awoken by the sound of thunder. Great. More rain. Just what you needed to start the day. You opened your eyes, expecting yourself to be facing the ceiling, but instead, your vision is completely covered in something white and fluffy. Your...blanket? Raising your arms to your head to try and lift it off of you, you brush up against the tip of something on the outside of the 'blanket', and you feel the furred suface around you suddenly shiver. Blankets didn't do that...and they weren't this heavy, either, as it weighed quite a few pounds.

Finally, with a cartoonish POP, you feel yourself fall out of the breasts and down onto the stable floor, staring up at Breeze's large form. This was all the confirmation you needed. You definitely didn't dream all this up. Unless you were insane, that is. She was a sight to behold. So large. So...buxom. And, although you'd always considered her a pretty horse...you'd never thought of it like this. And yet, here you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up and gazing at Breeze's sleeping form, you realize that she seemed...taller. You try and compare yourself to her by lying on your side next to her, and you sorta...approximate how many of you's she is tall. Yesterday she was a little more than twice your size. Now, although the difference was much smaller in comparison to the rest of her, she had, infact, grown an entire foot in height, leaving her at an impressive 13.5 feet tall. And remembering the growth spirt from yesterday...odds are she'd have an even bigger one soon. It was only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you gazed upon her peaceful, sleeping form, listening to the sound of rain pitter patter on the stable walls, you thought about your options...</span></div></div>",

Quietly shuffling over to the sleeping behemoth, you position yourself against her stomach, a fair bit farther from Breeze's breasts than last time. Breeze shifts in her sleep, and an arm thicker than your leg and covered in pristine white fur is draped over you. A deep, rumbling hum emerges from Breeze's throat as the sleeping mare gently pushes you into the warm fur of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes and doing your best to ignore the booming thunder and pounding rainfall, you find yourself slowly drifting off to sleep, after being interrupted several times by especially loud thunderclaps.

With closed eyes, you could still feel fur around you, or under you in this case, indiciating that you were, once again, on Breeze...not that you or her minded, but still. But where were you? Your head was in an oddly comfortable position, resting between 2 pillows which you'd presumed to be her breasts, like last time, but breasts weren't so...stationary. And they didn't have a tail flicking about between them, brushing uo against your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing brightly, you quickly open your eyes and try to get off of Breeze, and manage to hit the ground of the stable with a THUD. Dusting yourself off and getting up, feeling very well rested, you look up to see Breeze lying down on her front, propping her head up with her arms as she turns her head around, smiling at you. \"Sleep well, master?\" she says, a hint of cheerfulness in her voice. Well, you guess you'd be cheerful if you'd been an animal all your life and suddenly became almost-human... \"Breeze? Why did you...\" you begin, thinking about bringing up the spot Breeze let you sleep on, but you decided against it. ...partially because you wouldn't mind doing it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you notice something different about Breeze, today. You lie down next to her for comparison, thinking about your current height and how many of 'you' she was tall...she was atleast 15 feet tall. She'd grown even more! Yet...much smaller, compared to the large growthspurt from the other day. 4 feet tall, all at once...you were surprised that all the rest of the growth had been tame. As nice as it was, it was only a matter of time until your luck ran out, and the stable was conpletely filled with Breeze... not that you'd mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master?\" Breeze asks concernedly, having seen you stand there, lost in thought. \"Oh! Nothing, Breeze, just thinking.\" Suddenly, you notice Breeze shiver, and her body begin to shake lightly. \"Uh oh, Breeze...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Breeze shudders ever so slightly, seemingly relishing the short growth spurt. It's over in just a few seconds, though, as the spurt was faster than the other two. The now sixteen foot Breeze is beginning to run out of room in the stables. Another large spurt and her back could be pressing into the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was still a good deal of room left. When you had sold the last of the other horses, you'd removed the stalls in favour of one large room for Breeze to live in, and made a little bit of money selling off the wood used for the stalls. That decision was paying off now, as evidenced by Breeze's use of the space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraining your ears, you realise that you can no longer hear the sound of rainfall. Making your way to Breeze's front end, you press your ear against the wall as she watches, slightly bemused. Confirming that the rainfall has finally ceased, you turn to Breeze's massive form. \"Well, it looks like the rain has finally stopped, but... I don't think there's a way to get you out of here without heavily damaging the building...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of you wanted to damage the stables. They contained a lot of memories. But both of you recognised that there was no way for both of to get out unless a large portion of the building was missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to face Breeze. God, her muzzle must be larger than your entire upper body! \"Yes, Breeze?\" you ask. Breeze shifts slightly, fully lengthening her legs, to the point that her hooves are a few feet shy of the opposite wall. Breeze begins to talk, an air of resignation in her voice. \"Master, should I bust out now? Or do you want to spend a few more minutes in her with me?\"</span></div></div>",

You to finally get out of the stable where you'd been sorta cuddling with Breeze for the past few hours, and for Breeze to finally stretch her legs, and probably stand frighteningly high over you. It'd be far more comfortable for her than keeping her in here, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, Breeze, we should...talk for a bit.\" you say, and she breathes a sigh of relief, moving her legs away from the wall; for now. You, yourself, had slumped up against the wall of the barn, and nearly yelled when the wall creaked and bent outward. The stables were probably water damaged from the many years you've owned them; and the many years your father owned them, before. It'll be a shame to watch Breeze put a giant, unsightly hole in it, but you suppose that's not up for debate. Breeze is going to need to get out of here soon before she got any bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over towards Breeze, who was now staring at you curiously, she asked \"What is it you wanted to talk about, master?\". And you stopped. What did you want to talk about? You wanted to talk about everything; why Breeze was growing, why she was able to talk and had human level intelligence, why she had this form, and why she...so clearly didn't care for the sexual tension she'd put you in when carelessly putting you in 'specific' locations on her body. Although the last part, you realize, is because she's probably new to the concept...or maybe she knows and doesn't care. You'll ask her about that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing your throat, you tried to find your voice, staring at the frighteningly large muzzle of your favorite horse. \"Uh...Breeze, how long have you...looked like this?\" you ask, and she tilts her head. \"I grew this tall a couple minutes ago, master. You watched.\" You shook your head. \"No, I mean, uh...human. Why do you look so human?\". Breeze squinted. \"I...this was just how I found myself, this morning, master. I just woke up like this.\" Huh. So this just...happened, and Breeze didn't know about it? Strange. \"Alright, well, why are you growing? Do you know?\" you ask, and Breeze sighs, the force of the sigh ruffling your hair. \"No, master. All these things are new. They're a little scary, but I think...\" she trails off, looking down at herself and back up at you, \"...I think I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe...liked it? I mean, I guess...it was a nice change of pace from being a completely normal horse, sure, but did she honestly prefer this over it? A strange, humanoid form that will undoubtedly cause mass hysteria later down the line, along with the fact that it was growing seemingly uncontrollably, with no visible upward limit? It's been fun, you admit, but this...this was going to cause problems you'd have to deal with. Atleast it was a nice change of pace from normality, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master!\" Breeze says suddenly, causing you to focus on her. \"I...I feel it again, I...\" she trails off, her body now shaking powerfully. Or maybe that was just a shiver, and at this size you couldn't tell the difference. Either way, after a few moments of pause, with Breeze biting her lip in anticipation, she began growing again. The already sixteen-foot tall mare's bones began to make audible crackles as her body expanded in all directions, which, you realized, meant towards you aswell; and her Muzzle was already a few feet from your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only watch, however, as Breeze extended to 17 feet tall, 18 feet, 19 feet, Breeze's behind finally hitting and straining against the ceiling of the stables, causing it to creak. Fortunately, Breeze stopped growing at 20 feet tall, and as you surveyed the damage, you notice Breeze's muzzle was now, alone, atleast two-thirds the size of your body. Your eyes met hers, and her eyes met yours, and you both paused for a moment as you stared at each other. It was obvious that the stables would not last much longer at this rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think it's about time for me to get out of here, Master.\"</span></div></div>",

Breeze concentrates, obviously trying to think of a way to make a hole larger enough for herself to fit through without bringing the stable down on top of you. Breeze draws her right leg in, the muscles tensing and intending experimentally. \"Ready, master?\" Breeze asks. \"Yeah, I'm ready, Breeze. Go for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze lets her leg fly backwards into the wall, the rock-hard hoof attached to it blowing a large section of the rain-damaged wall away. Breeze kicks a few more times, widening and lengthening the gap until she feels she can fit through. Still looking at the hole, Breeze begins to slide her hooves through, then her legs, beginning the laborious process of removing herself from the stables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself worrying.

What's wrong?\" you ask, and Breeze looks towards you with concern. \"My...ah...hooves...are hitting something. And I don't want to break it. Could you go check it out?\" You nod, and head outside, circling the stable until you reach the side Breeze was sticking out of, and stop to examine the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking towards the stable walls, Breeze's unnaturally large rear and legs were jutting out of the massive hole in the wall, her tail swishing to and fro.

You're going to need to kick down a few trees, probably, but...I don't know. Kicking down random trees is illegal, I think.\" You sit down on the stable floor, looking up towards Breeze. \"I could get permission from the city to cut some down, but then someone might have to come out here, and yeah. And it'd take too long.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what do you propose, master?\" asks Breeze, finally having found a comfortable position to sit while sticking out of the stables halfway. \"What if we... no, that won't work. We could... no, bad idea.\" You racked your brain for a few minutes, trying your best to think of something. Breeze looked at you expectantly. You knew she wanted out. This was probably getting pretty uncomfortable, not to mention what would happen if she grew again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up, having finally narrowed your decision down to two choices; leave through the hole you already created, or ignore the trees and leave the stables on the opposite side.</span></div></div>",

It was weakened as it was, and you were certain Breeze also wished that this building of sentimental value remain standing. \"You think you're strong enough to clear a path with your hooves, Breeze?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze tried to get a look at what you were asking her to do, but the 20 foot tall anthropomorphic mare couldn't quite position herself to do so, especially with the massive breasts providing an obstruction she never asked for. Not that she could recall asking for any of this, but she was far from upset about it. She gave a careful sigh and said, \"I'm not sure, master. But for you and getting out of here, I shall certainly try my best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smartly got out of the stables and out of the way while Breeze watched as best she could. Once she was absolutely positively certain you weren't in the danger zone, she planted her hands firmly on the ground and kicked with both legs as hard as she could muster. Then again. And again. She had always been a pretty strong horse, and the added size only helped. After she no long felt any resistance against her hooves when she kicked, she called out, \"Master? Have I cleared away a path like you asked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a few moments to close your jaw from the sight of Breeze's hoof-work. She had managed to snap every tree she had kicked, seemingly almost like you would a twig. You were greatly thankful she had never been anything but kind and gentle, for she could easily break your bones if not outright kill you with one of those kicks. Finally, you answer, \"Er, y-yes, Breeze, I think you're clear to exit the stables now...\" And in your head, you thought about just how much wood you were going to need to clear later. Maybe some of it could be used to repair the stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze tried once again to carefully crawl out of the hole in the stables she had made. Again, her enormous, voluptuous curves any woman would kill for hindered her progress somewhat, but eventually she was out. The white mare had never been happier to be outside of the stables, though her mood was still somewhat dampened by the big hole in the wall she was forced to create. Breeze got up and stretched...and stretched...and <i>stretched</i>. With the roof of the stables only coming up to just above her crotch, both you and her finally realized just <i>how</i> cramped she had been in there. Naturally, she made little effort to hide any part of her body though her fur did a reasonable job of covering her private areas. Finally, she used her slender hands to dust herself off. \"It feels incredible to be out in the open, master!\" she cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were happy for Breeze, but you also knew there was no way you could hide her. She was simply much too big, and growing bigger in spurts that came and went seemingly as they pleased. Even if you could find someplace large enough to hide her, it wouldn't last. Still...there was something oddly pleasing seeing your beloved mare like this, and you simply were never going to find a human woman that looked as beautiful as Breeze did. Even if she was 20 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master?\" Breeze asked politely. It was starting to feel a tad awkward having a being far larger than you call you that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you responded.</span></div></div>",

Breeze fell to her knees as she began to moan and pant with pleasure while her body started adding more mass to itself. You couldn't look away as you heard her bones crack and grind audibly in order to support the additional size she was gaining. Her magnificent, growing body was just so mesmerizing, especially those incredibly huge orbs on her chest. Each of them surely must weigh enough to crush any person unlucky (or lucky, depending) enough to be caught underneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you wanted to be crushed by your beloved white mare, or that she would ever be careless or cruel enough to wish you harm by any means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her growth continued, you found yourself amazed that Breeze was able to maintain as much self-control over the pleasurable sensation that seemed to be going through her as she was currently to not shout out and make herself heard for at least a mile or so in all directions. Probably a good thing too, because it would likely be very bad if people heard her and came to investigate. Despite all that had been happening to her since yesterday, you still felt responsible for her safety and well-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still don't have any idea how you were going to continue to take care of the now giant, humanoid horse that you had been caring for almost since she was born on this very farm...yet, her words to you saying \"It'll be okay, master\" managed to keep from running around like a chicken with its head cut off in panic. Perhaps it was because you wanted to trust her that you felt that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Breeze's current growth spurt came to an end, as does her moans. Her panting lasted just a few seconds longer before it too ceased. \"I...I am so sorry, master. I really shouldn't make such an unsightly display like that.\" she said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped your attention as far away from her breasts as your neck would allow, which was becoming harder to do the bigger she got. \"You're apologizing for something that's entirely natural, and in your situation has to be incredibly hard to do anything about.\" you said with a pause and then added, \"We can't all be perfect. Not even me. Now, can you please stop calling me master? It's getting a tad awkward now. My real name is Peter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, master - I mean, Peter.\" Breeze answered, slipping briefly. She carefully stood up to her full height so both of you could see just how much her last spurt had added to her. You guessed she had grown about 5 feet taller, bringing her to a total of 25 feet tall, but a confirmation would still be nice to have.</span></div></div>",

And if Breeze wanted to wander, at her increased - and most likely, soon to be increasing - size, you'd have one hell of a job trying to catch up to her if you stayed on foot. Really, your mind was already made up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, Breeze just...

You had a a feeling she had leaned in slightly, to make sure there was a lower chance of her missing some important detail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze begins to straighten up from the hunched over stance she had been in just a few seconds ago, never letting her eyes off you as she lifts you up.

Rising up, she stretches her big body, and surveys the surrounding land she towers over, the damaged shell of the barn below reaching just above her nether regions. Sighing happily, Breeze makes sure you're secure in her cleavage, and begins to walk, massive breasts jiggling and swaying as she does so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hooves, almost covered in thick and full fetlock fur, rise and fall as she walks, crashing down to earth with a thunderous boom as she places them one in front of the other, reveling in the feeling of walking on two legs, as opposed to four. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun high above beats down on the land, a far cry from the torrential rain you had experienced earlier. The dried-out mud cracks and buckles under Breeze's immense hooffalls, quaking ever so slightly as she turns her head this way and that, trying to drink in as much of the scenery as she can. The small forest near the ruined stable looked rather nice; Breeze makes a mental note to have a look at it sometime, even if her hooves alone are, by this point, potential rivals to the trees in terms of height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance, beyond small fields of crops, Breeze can see something strange. It's almost like her stable, but bigger. <br>\r\n\"What is that, Master?\" she asks, pointing towards it. Squinting, your eyes widen slightly, and you breathe a sigh of relief. For a second, you'd thought that the massive mare had found something dangerous in some way. <br>\r\n\"It's my house, Breeze. It's where I live, kind of like your stables. Well, like your stables used to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze approaches the house, about a full head taller than it - if not a bit more. She kneels down, angling her great muzzle so she can see through the windows, and lets out a short huff. <br>\r\n\"Oh, Master, it's so cute! I- ooh... Ooohhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze puffs and pants, beginning to moan in pleasure, and you know what's about to happen. Since there's no way to stop or even slow the mare's growth, you figure you'll try to enjoy it to the best of your abilities. <br>\r\nBreeze's body shudders, stretching out just a bit taller, prompting a low moan from the mare, as she shivers taller and taller...</span></div></div>",

Relaxing, you lean back into the soft embrace of her breasts as you tried to figure out what could be causing this strange transformation. Was Breeze the only one?

At a drastically reduced price they offered just about everything farming/animal/pet-related. And you had bought it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now you were sitting comfortably in the inflated chest of the formerly-normal farm horse that's not only humanoid... but grown to giant size in the few days following said purchases. There had to be a connection. There-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought was interrupted by Breeze's lips and tongue descending upon you, giving you massive kisses and licks. It snapped you back to the present and the panting horse whose cleavage you were resting in.

You gulp - cliche as it was, it could be nothing other than footsteps. It seemed that Breeze wasn't alone in her transformation or gigantism...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mega-mare begins to rise from her seated position, keeping one arm wrapped around her impressive bust in order to keep you from falling out - or perhaps too far inside her cleavage. As she stands, every inch of flesh that can jiggles from her movement, doughy, shapely rumpcheeks loudly slapping together as her tail happily swishes about; oversized boobs wobbling even as her arm just about keeps them constrained, only barely able to reach around her own impressive bust. Looking upwards, you can see Breeze's tongue poking out of her mouth just a little, the very tip of the pink muscle exposed in an oddly adorable display - it seems that her earlier comment about it 'feeling good' was very much true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze heaves herself into a standing position, chest and ass impossibly perky considering their intimidating sizes. Breathing out, she turns around, preparing herself for whatever she's about to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA field of fuzzy, white material, engulfing both your and Breeze's fields of view. Attracting her gaze downwards with a gentle rub, you ask Breeze to move backwards a bit, sure that this is some kind of immense anthro - and indeed, your hypothesis is proven correct as more and more of its body becomes visible! Surely twice as tall as Breeze, at a minimum, the anthro towers into the sky, cloven hooves consuming the ground below - but for the moment, it seems content to simply stand there as Breeze backs up, gasping as she realises what kind of animal the anthro is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was... a ewe! A massive, <i>massive</i> one at that! Over double Breeze's size, and with breasts that utterly obscured her own face from the ground - nowhere near as bigas Breeze's proportionally, but still big enough to block all view of her head until, almost without warning, she crouches, revealing her head. Her head and limbs were black in contrast to her dirty-white wool - as were her nipples, which, you noted with a tiny shudder, were so long and fat that they poked out of the layer of wool covering the ewe's mammaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a mischevious smile on the ewe's face as both you and Breeze took in her features - and as you did so, you realised why! A gigantic tag was clipped through each of her black, fluffy ears - one with a four-digit number, but on the other was her name, and your name!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashleigh,\" you breathe out, realising that the sheep was yours.

The mega-sheep quivers as her eyelids gently slide shut, for a moment, as if savouring the very idea of what she was about to do - and then, she begins to lean backwards. The land is bathed in her shadow, before her back plunges down into the ground, rocking the landscape with her impact as what must have been hundreds of feet of farmland were suddenly engulfed in ultra-fluffy, pristine wool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplaying out, Ashleigh lids her eyes halfway, holding you and Breeze in front of her chest, as if taking in just how large her bust was - before you're moving again, the hand you're on carrying you over the ewe's body as a sinking feeling begins, deep in your stomach. You look over to Breeze, gripped in an iron-like, though still gentle grasp, the mare blushing heavily and struggling to move even an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand you're on stops moving, suddenly, almost throwing you to your knees - but the sight you behld is enough to floor you anyway. A pair of massive, massively-thick thighs - and between them, an exposed, rosy-coloured cunt, softly weeping a small river of sexual lubricant. Another shudder, more powerful this time - and the hand you're on begins to slowly move towards the exposed opening, the ewe's fingers delicately brushing her wool out of the way, and angling so that you begin to slide down into it, despite your attempts to scrabble away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that hits you is the smell. It wasn't exactly rosy, but it wasn't unpleasant either - it smelled almost of raw lust, but the intensity of it, amplified by Ashleigh's sheer size, as almost enough to knock you flat. Then, as you continue to slide - a blasting wave of sexual heat, as the vaginal walls tremble, throbbing audibly as you helplessly slide in, Ashleigh's fingers angled just so to put you deep inside of her. The ewe was sopping wet, there was no doubt about it - her pink walls constantly tremoring, as if on already on the very edge - you're splashed by another small wave of lubricant, soaking your clothes all the way through and leaving the smell of Ashleigh's musk on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Breeze joins you - and not by choice. Gripped tight by Ashleigh's two-fingered hand, the mare is pushed in even as she struggles, producing the strongest shudder yet. But Breeze is simply too weak compared to Ashleigh, and with a shove, she's all the way in, the very end of her muzzle landing just a few feet away from you. The mare breathes in deep, getting her breath back, and her puils dilate wide, her hand magnetically drawn to her crotch for a single moment before she shakes her head, refocusing. Worried beyond all belief, she doesn't even ask to pick you up, as she gently scoops you into her grip, turning towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, a leathery palm slams over the only exit you two have, and - from the wild vibrations that start up almost immediately afterwards - it seems that Ashleigh is using her other hand to tease her pleasure button, writhing in bliss as she 'milks' away on it.  Breeze holds you close to her chest as she runs towards the exit - but it only excites Ashley even more, each pounding step of her hooves producing a tremoring shockwave that nearly throws her from her feet. And Ashleigh isn't the only one that's aroused, as Breeze begins to pant, the ewe's scent doing the best it can to drive her wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, not the best situation, even if it was sexy - but there's something that'sabout to happen that makes it even worse...</span></div></div>",

Breeze?\" you asked, but could tell she was fixated upon that thought. The anthro-horse picked you up from her cream-covered cleavage. \"Breeze... what are you doing?\" you asked, though deep down you had a pretty good idea what she intended to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed and licked you lovingly as she held you there. \"I love you Master.\"<br>\r\n\"I love you too Breeze.\" you respond, bracing yourself for whatever she had in mind.

Her breathing grew louder and louder - though coming in shorter breaths and gasps, her movements becoming... quicker; jerkier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze came with an animalistic moan that sounded like rolling thunder, her muscles all contracting in the throes of orgasm.

There was another figure near Ashleigh, though, that attracted your attention: one that was so 'small' as to be just visible near her hooves as she bounced up and down, curves jiggling wildly - it seemed that she'd seen the tiny figure, as well, and was crouching down low to take a proper look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the mega-ewe could have her 'fun' with the figure, however, Breeze picked them up with a finger and a thumb, depositing them a few meters away from you. You blink as you look them up and down: another anthro horse, with a mane and fur as black as midnight, powerful muscles rippling all over their body. And not just an anthro horse, but the first male anthro you'd seen, as evidenced by the massive sheath dangling from between his legs as he stood, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his big, brown eyes focused on you, you swallowed. This horse looked very familiar indeed, despite being blown up to... around twenty feet in height, you guessed. \"Master?\" he said in a deep, rumbling voice that you could feel vibrating in your bones.

Mmmm...\" Maximus sighs, and you blush deeply as you feel the stallion's sheath - which he had inadvertently placing you against - start to shift, as the flesh within twitches, and pulses, audibly throbbing as he sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, Master... Master!\" he all but shouts. You scramble off of his sheath as a pink, fleshy bulge emerges from the end, his stallionhood soon visible in its gargantuan glory.

Breeze finally stopped at about 225ft! Hands on her hips she smirked down at the now midget-sized (to her) Ashleigh. If the Ewe was supposed to be scared, she didn't look it... in fact she looked incredibly turned on! Giggling with glee the big sheep glommed onto one of Breeze's legs, moaning with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still growing...\" you sigh, uneasiness beginning to make your stomach churn as you looked up at Heidi. \"Has this been effecting every one of the animals?\" you asked. Heidi was about to reply when she too began to vibrate, her size inflating further and further. Her expansive cleavage grew and grew around you like fuzzy water-balloons. From your limited field of vision you could also see Ashleigh experiencing similar changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it was all said and done, Heidi was now 190ft in height, and Ashleigh just above 210ft. Before anyone could say anything, The massive Ewe glomped onto Heidi, clearly finding this whole experience to be almost orgasmic. The lovely sheep began to nuzzle into the dog, licking her chest (and by extension you) before a shadow overtook the two of them and Breeze joined in on the massive cuddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit, this was given you quite the 'excitment'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your new vantage point, you could definitely see...</span></div></div>",

Lots of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heidi.\" you said aloud, knowing your faithful canine could probably hear you at any height. \"What's that over there?\" you asked. Dislodging herself from the other two, the massive shetland turned towards the direction you asked. Kinda hard not to quickly realize where you meant, as there was a small group of anthropomorphic females in the distance. Of various different sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the creatures you recognized, such as the Husky who was lovingly licking her owners as she hugged them... despite being bigger than a house. They didn't seem to be in too much distress, and you seriously doubted she'd hurt them. Her name was Luna if you remembered correctly, she was always playful and affectionate whenever you met her (and her owner, Alan) when visiting town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tabby-colored cat (clocking in at about 50 feet or so) whose color scheme you recognized, but never quite knew the name of... if she even had one, as she played with the sheriff's car like it were a mouse or toy. Was hard to see from your current vantage point, but you couldn't see if the Sheriff was anywhere in the car. You hoped he was alright as the cat-fem chewed on the tires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were other former pets you recognized, dogs... cats.... even the snake that lived in the local bar had been effected. You never knew it was a female, you seriously doubted the barkeep knew it was a female before this. You did NOW, as she sported some definite jugs and a curvy figure to go along with her 175 foot height (or was it length?). The snake-fem also stood out because it was more like a naga... or lamia, no legs having formed in this process. You saw her owner, clinging to her neck as she slithered along the streets. Hopefully she wasn't saving him for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also wild animals running about. A giant, heavily endowed, squirrel (if you had to guess she was between 75 and 120ft from this vantage point) was foraging in the nearby grocery store. The roof had been peeled off as she was shoving handfuls of food into her mouth. Her large rear-end bouncing like two water balloons on a truck dashboard as she didn't seem to take much notice of the screaming pedestrians. Though some were clearly hypnotized by her assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant (50ft) field mouse was busy digging in a field, clearly trying to find food she had stashed there earlier... not quite understanding that she was WAY too big for it now. An opossum (looking to be 100ft or so) was playing dead, having crashed ontop of a nearby school in the process, her body currently swelling in size... overtaking the thankfully closed school (it WAS a weekend thank god). A deer (35ft in height) was seemingly oblivious to it all as she grazed on the outskirts. Though she looked pretty funny bent over on her knees as she munched large portions of grass... and mud. A vixen (about 80ft) was stalking amongst some abandoned school buses, eyeing them with a kind of hunger that spoke of possible arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive SQUEEEE could be heard behind you as Ashleigh finally took notice of this situation too. Without a word she bounded off towards town to meet some new playmates as Breeze joined you and Heidi in watching the events unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea what is causing this master?\" asked the Sheepdog, looking up at Breeze as she took a knee next to them. You had no idea what to say, it was so... surreal. Though part of you wondered if it only effected female animals or not. Breeze held her hand out to the dog, who deposited you onto the horse's massive hand-hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do?\" asked the mega horse as she brought you in close.<br>\r\n\"We should probably follow Ashleigh... and make sure she doesn't get into any trouble... or makes some things worse.\" you replied. You didn't think Ashleigh would do anything intentionally malicious, but with her current size and mental state.... there's no telling what could happen. You were about to say something else (about trying to find out any information about their situation and how far this... bizarreness has spread) but before you could say anything...</span></div></div>",

Been Better. But Anna's been taking care of me. Especially with some of the more wild animals about.\" he replied, stroking the scales of his mutated pet. This seemed to really please Anna, as she lifted her head up in response, her tongue flicking out excitedly. \"Everything's going crazy.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know.\" you answer. \"Any idea how far it's gone?\" lovingly petting Breeze's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost... almost the entire Midwest... and the South.

Took me a while to realize it until she outgrew her glass cage. Luckily for me she was quite affectionate towards me as she tried to help out around the Bar... but then she kept on growing.

An entire pack of wolves - five already visible, with surely more on the way - were crouched 'low' to the ground some miles away, near to the small forest that was some distance outside of the village's limits. Easily visible despite the distance between them and you, the smallest of them had to be pushing a hundred feet in height, if not a hundred and fifty! All five - all of them female, as were all of the anthro animals you'd seen so far - sported much the same physique as the other enlarged animals you'd seen so far, with some minor alterations: Despite having breasts that were, at the minimum, relatively large, the wolves' bodies had packed on far more muscle than any other anthro you'd seen thus far during their transformations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer amount of heaving, pumping muscle on display was almost ludicrous - every inch of fur contorted by muscles rippling obscenely underneath, slowly swelling ever larger even as you watched on! The largest wolfess, whom you gest to be the groups alpha - surely two hundred feet tall at the shoulder, putting her squarely in the position of largest anthro you'd seen so far - shivered, seeming to almost vibrate as her insane muscle-mass only increased, and increased - the rock-hard six-pack that had taken up her impossibly toned, washboard-flat tummy shifted and warped as more and more muscle was packed on and on, rapidly becoming an eight-pack... then a ten-pack... then a twelve-pack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Heidi, as impossibly musclebound as the gigantic Shetland was, couldn't hold a candle to the sheer, growing, animalistic strength on display. Speaking of Heidi, the faithful canine was following your gaze, looking off into the distance and slowly, bit by bit, settling into a more aggressive stance, teeth subtly bared. The long silence was broken as the sheepdog spoke: \"Breeze?\" she asked, directing the mega-mare's gaze to the wolf pack in the distance by pointing. \"I think I'd like to take Master for now, to keep him safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up into Breeze's sparkling blue eyes, already seeming to water a little at the thought of you getting hurt, or... worse... \"O-okay, Heidi,\" Breeze agrees, reulctance more than plain for all to see. \"Just... keep Master safe, okay?\" The sheepdog takes you into a paw-padded hand as Breeze deposits you into the canine's grip with more care and delicateness than should be possible at any size - and, blushing bright red for a brief moment, the mare bends to engulf your entire body in a kiss, plush and puffed-up lips surrounding your entire body for a brief, heavenly moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, however, the wolves in the distance begin to move, stalking towards the town as best they can at such vast sizes. Many of the anthros were preoccupied with their own activities, however - lavishing affection on humans, tending to 'personal needs', or even just minding their own business, it mattered not, for only a fraction of the massive animals saw the threat quite literally looming overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed, however, that the wolves' limbs were all quivering and and twitching oddly, as if they could only hold their owners up through the most extreme levels of concentration possible, despite the impossible levels of strength that they wielded. As Breeze, Heidi, and Anna begin to slowly move towards the pack, with Ashleigh curiously nowhere to be seen, the reason for the odd muscle spasms becomes clear very quickly...</span></div></div>",

The bizarre phenomenon that has gripped most of the nation, the giant anthroid animals, has taken an even more dire turn today as reports of a large pack of female wolves have come to our attention. Vastly larger than most of the mutant animals so far, this pack... numbering in roughly a dozen, have swept through the Southern/Midwestern States, and are currently headed off towards California. Eyewitness testimony states that these females are quite voracious in their appetites. Both in terms of food, and sexual desires. This drive, this lust has left whole towns, and even some cities pummeled to dust in the wake of this pack's march. And wherever they go, their activities just seem to feed their growth. Last report clocks their height in at about 650 feet, roughly 200 meters, but that was almost two hours ago. The tallest of these, labeled White Paw, seems to be the unquestionable alpha. For reasons unknown she has been spotted carrying a small human captive tucked away in her... ahem... bountiful chest region. Said captive, after a while of research, has been identified as a simple farmer known as Dillon... wait... what's that? You... you serious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLadies and gentlemen, it has come to my attention that at least two members of this.... pack... have been spotted approaching our city at a fast pace. They've already overtaken the neighboring town... and... oh my... the entire jetliner? THERE?! Oh... oh dear. L- Ladies and gentlemen, please evacuate in a calm and orderly manner. If evacuation is out of the question, then please... PLEASE seek shelter wherever you can find it. And don't... oh god... was that shaking? Oh god... our building's round cylindrical shape... oh no....EVACUATE THE BUILDING!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera falls over as loud moaning is heard, accompanied by screaming and breaking glass.

Heidi and Breeze both started at the noise, curves jiggling wildly - as did you, Anna, and Joe; you gulped, recognising that voice easily - \"Oh, no,\" you murmured, as the sound faded, and the ground began to rumble underneath Breeze's hooves, the vibrations so potent that you could feel them travfelling up the mare and into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of you could react, Ashleigh's all-too-familiar form boomed larger, becoming visible in an eruption of growth, the horny ewe's woll fluffing out as one hand groped her immense breasts, the other buried almost knuckle-deep inside her sopping went cunt, which was flooding the shrinking streets with wave after wave of heavily-scented sexual fluids. You, Joe, and the small collection of anthros around you - and indeed, seemingly every anthro within the town - stood ramrod straight as Ashleigh squealed in raptorous pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready 200 feet tall, the ever-horny ewe was growing fast. 220 feet... 250... 280, 320 feet! Up and up she pumped, never stopping her (admittedly adorable) squeals and snorts and screams. Building after building vanished into her impossibly fluffy and soft wool as she expanded - 400 feet, 450 feet, 500! Towering high over the entire town, Ashleigh stood, heaving her impossible top-heavy body to its feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unfortunately for everyone that wasn't Ashleigh, she wasn't done yet, not by a long shot! \"<b>HAAAAAH</b>,\" she breathed out, spluttering another 20 feet bigger on the spot, then another 20 after that! The flood of ejaculate from her sweltering vent had only escalated as she grew, now more like a vast deluge threatening to swamp the entire area. \"<b>B-B...BI- BII...</b>\" Ashleigh stammered, eyes glossed over as she continued her ministrations on herself. Only just visible against the rosy-red, puffed-out folds of her cunt was the vixen you had briefly seen mere moments earlier, hanging on and rubbing, rubbing, rubbing for all she was worth, milking up and down on Ashleigh's exposed, pulsating clit - which had begun to grow disproportionately, the ewe's pleasure button surely two or three times as large and sensitive as it should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshleigh sucks in air, the act seemingly inflating her chest - and then, she cries out: \"<b>BBBIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRR!!!!!</b>\" Within moments, she's pumping, swelling, inflating larger, and larger, and larger, and LARGER! 600, 700, 800 feet - then the ewe hiccups, and suddenly DOUBLES in size, body flaring out massively as her massive tail wags in pleasure atop her mountainous rump, as she cries out again, and doubles even that stupendous size, and again, exploding out to over a mile in size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 miles... 4 miles... 7 miles... Ashleigh's growth continues on and on as the ewe's body steadily consumes the sky, blocking out all sunlight without any effort. She surges and pumps past 8 miles, then 9 - and as her growth finally begins to slow from its terrifying, dizzying speeds, she hiccups again! Instantly, she BOOMS up to 18 miles in height, and just as quickly her proportions grow from insane to idiotic! Her breasts, already impossible perky and gigantic, grow down well past her belly button as her hips flare out to lengths that had to be relative meters in width, her behind engorging to beanbag-sized proportions!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woolly goddess puffs and pants, refilling her lungs after such a violent and furious growth spurt, all down below in the town she now almost outsizes, gawp in utter amazement at the giga-scale ewe, the very largest of the 'tiny' anthros no taller than 200 feet or so. And then, with one last, unexpected hiccup, Ashleigh explodes out to 36 miles in height, doubling her already impossible size with seemingly no effort!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel Breeze's hand below you begin to subtly tremble, as a fleshy gurgle starts up within Ashleigh's body, the ewe heaving a monolithic breast up and latching onto her own nipple, the sounds of lapping and licking and thousands of gallons of milk pouring down her throat echoing for mile upon mile upon mile. \"Oh my god,\" you whisper to yourself - was there any way that Ashleigh could be stopped now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out...</span></div></div>",

The entirety of your field of view is filled to the brim with Ashleigh, and whichever way youturn, you can see her. The ewe sat with her legs on either side of the village that she now dwarfed utterly, cloven hoof-like toes wiggling happily as she sits atop her beanbag-like rump. As the ewe's nipple leaves her mouth, a booming 'pop' is made audible to everyone that can see the ewe - and most likely everyone in the country!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, trying to think of some way that you could beat Ashleigh or force her to stop growing - but you knew that if you tried to get Breeze to get that big, the ewe would jsut get horny all over again. In fact, she still seemed to be horny, as if her explosive growgasm hadn't done a thing to the fires raging within her. The mountainous breast Ashleigh was suckling on falls in a heavy arc, jiggling and bouncing and rippling all over, heaving megatonnes of breastflesh swinging down, then up, then down again, a 'thin' line of drool connecting to the ewe's thick, full and plush lips wobbling and snapping under its own weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlainly visible for all to see, the sheep's eyes are still glazed over in a lust haze, tongue slowly bobbing in and out of her mouth as she pants and huffs, stirring the atmosphere and causing her impossibly gigantic chest to rise and fall. Those gleaming, sparkling eyes seem to light up as Ashleigh turns them to look at the teeny-tiny village you're in, and you fully grasp the scale of her immensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vast wall of wool took up the entirety of the horizon. No matter how far to the left or right you looked, you couldn't see anything past it. So vast was the overgrown ewe that you could barely comprehend the scale of her breasts, which wobbled and jiggled at the slightest motion. Miles and miles directly overhead was her face, and those immense eyes - charcoal-black skin and lip, but skin that was as soft and plush as could possibly be, lips plumped out and eyes shining brighter than the Sun. On either side of the town was a solid wall of black flesh that rose up and up and up into the sky - Ashleigh's legs, uncovered by wool for the most part, and extending so far back that if she wished, the giga-ewe could simply lock them together and cut off any and all escape routes in a single motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>MMMM,</b>\" Ashleigh booms, the sound somehow not shaking you apart - it doesn't even hurt your ears, let alone Breeze's or Heidi's or Anna's. \"<b>LOOK AT YOUR ASHLEIGH NOW, MASTER... S-SO BIIIG...</b>\" Unable to help herself, she raises a black-skinned, three-fingered hand, groping and pawing at one of her ludicrously gigantic breasts. \"<b>OHH, YOU'RE SO CUTE, MASTER... SO SMALL...\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, and as you do, Breeze begins to shift. The hand underneath you slowly closes, and the mega-mare moves it to her chest, protectively holding you against it as the vibrations of her bus-sized heart rumble through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of you didn't even want to think of what Ashleigh was going to do, with the village - and in deed, the world - at her mercy in such a manner; but the other half of you was more than willing to find out. As it turned out...</span></div></div>",

Though her eyes are half-lidded, and engulfed by a lusty haze, they still shine brightly as she looks down at you - at everything, massively plush lips curving into a happy smile. Ashleigh briefly lifts herself up a little - the act causing the wind to rush into the few miles of space created, nearly knocking Breeze and the other animals down - before scooting forwards a 'tiny' bit and plopping back down again, shaking the entire country with such a simple act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshleigh was almost directly overhead now, and it was almost literally impossible to describe her immensity. White, white, white, on and on and on, far past the layer of clouds that submissively shrunk back against the lowest parts of the sloping contours of her impossibly disproportionate rear. \"<b>HEE~,</b>\" she chirps, licking thosep lush lips hungrily as she gazes down at everything and everyone she's so thoroughly outsized - though you in particular, of course. \"<b>LOOK AT YOUR ASHLEIGH NOW, MASTER,</b>\" she squeal-booms, her voice easily whisking away the cloud layer almost in its entirety. \"<b>Y-YOUR ASHLIEGH'S...

YESSS...\"</b> She huffs lowly, wriggling about as her multi mile-long, stubby 'little' tail wags left and right happily. \"<b>P-PLEASURE ME!</b>\" she all but barks, a little apprehension in her tone in spite of her size as she lowers one hoof-like hand to her wool-covered snatch, fingers spreading the lips to a degree that while being perfectly comfortable to her, means that the gaping cavern softly drooling juices is literally miles wide. Her spherical, perfectly smooth clit throbs overhead, surely as wide across as one of her fingers - it throbs and throbs, so happy at the prospect of reciving worship from the tinies below that you can practically see the little hearts circling around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, what do yo do?</span></div></div>",

The power has went straight to her head! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, on the other side... she had some right to her saying - she were utterly collosal, even the biggest anthros in the village were like an mites to her, and you... lesser than a particle of dust. All of this time you think how to beat her, how to stop her, and the only idea you have is to convince Breeze to grow to her size, and that plan has 2 big flaws:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. There is no guarantee that Breeze will grow at least to her titanic size<br>\r\n2. And even if... then 2 country-sized macros will do much more mayhem than one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the alternative wasn't perfect, but something has to be done - so you say out loud:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brezee, Heidi... We need to do what she's saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Are you crazy?!\" Both girls almost yell on their master, and Heidi continues:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we will allow her, if we will even help her with that... she will not stop there! We can't-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heidi, if we won't do that, then she will push us straight there! Look at her... she could squash us with her one hoove! Drown us with her one drop! What chance do we stand against her?\" You interrupt the Heidi, who first looks at her, and her face changes, from anger to resignation. You continue:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, she's clearly out of her mind, and we have to calm her down! Maybe her growth is only temporary, and once when she'll come down to her senses, she'll shrink down?\" You pet your sheepdog, trying to give her some hope. \"Or, who knows, you'll get even bigger than her, hehe\" You add jokingly, and on Heidi's face appears a glint of smile, and her tail wag a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you know how to cheer up a girl, master.\" She says, and stands up, looking at the clitoris of the giant ewe, causing slight tremors with every twitch. The air has already become really humid and warm, filled with the scent of goddess sex, so much that everyone in the area were becoming aroused. Then, Breeze said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let's go there unti-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer talk was brutally interrupted by the booming voice of ewe, getting a little impatient:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>WELL, HOW LONG DO I SUPPOSE TO WAIT? MAYBE YOU NEED A LITTLE HELP FROM ME, A LITTLE PUSH~</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she scoofed herself for a little bit... a little bit in her standards, of course. The gust of wind has pushed smaller macros far away, and caused two girls to hold tight to the floor. Nearby buildings cracked with the force of push, water pipes has ripped open, pavement has cracked so much that even a tank couldn't ride that road... Now, bpth girls know that there is no time to waste, and after the wind calms down, they start to sprint to the ewe's pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>OOH, WHO DO I SEE THERE, HEIDI, BREEZE! YOU ARE SOO ITTY BITTY TINY, HIHI!</b>\" She booms again, giggling, somehow noticing familiar faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrrrr... Listen here, you... I am doing that only to stop you!\" Heidi yells angrily. It seems that it fell on deaf ears - maybe because ewe didn't hear that, or maybe... she just didn't care. Now, both girls start to massage massive walls of warm, wet flesh of their new 'goddess'. They both would surely lied if they said that it wasn't pleasant - not only because of the aroma, which were quite pleasant in itself, even addicting to some level - but also from the situation itself. Even angry Heidi and reluctant Breeze has found out some pleasure in worshipping Ashleigh... And now, you wonder if you also should give in.</span></div></div>",

Why did looking up at Ashleigh, so... large... and... and dominant fill her with joy and... lust than fear or awe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer life before all this happened had become so... fuzzy... as if her brain was having a hard time processing at such a higher level than before. But she did remember the days when she was a normal dog... or at least bits and pieces of it. She used to guard and corral the sheep for Dillon... she remembered Ashleigh before they were both towering giants... why did the thought of being under the sheep's control fill her with such strange feelings? Why did she enjoy said feelings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you and Breeze were too busy trying to figure out what to do about this new development... to notice that Heidi starting to expand in size... rapidly. Her lust fueled this spurt, whether it was an unrealized desire to 'play' with Ashleigh, or the sexual 'side effects' of whatever was effecting these animals... but the sheepdog grew and grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your loving horse didn't realize something was up until Ashleigh noticed it. \"OOH!!! HEIDI!!! YOU'RE GETTING SO BIG!!!\" giggled and chirped the massive busty ewe, snapping you out of your thoughts to finally notice that Heidi was almost half of Ashleigh's size, your dog moaning and whimpering as she began to rub herself. So much stimulation that it made her fall to her knees, her legs now spread out above you and Breeze, her immense snatch looming over everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she wasn't slowing down... if anything, this only seemed to put her growth into overdrive and soon even Ashleigh was getting concerned... once the previously tiny sheepdog was almost towering over her... and she was still on her knees!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... Ashleigh!!!\" moaned and mewled Heidi as she leaned forward and cuddled the startled sheep. By now the monolithic canine's fluids were raining down upon the demolished town... drenching it almost like a flood. Breeze backed away, cradling you closely in her cleavage, trying to put as much space as she could between her compatriots and herself. The other anthro giants, now even larger than they had been previously, cleared out... trying to evacuate as Heidi began to kiss and fondle Ashleigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do?!\" asked a startled Breeze, a bit rattled by the sudden shift in the status quo. You tried to think of what to do... as the ground shook and quaked with the loud moaning of the two mega giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You have to grow too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze, for a short time, were shocked by your request, but after a while, she agreed with you in her mind, looking around her - two titans were making a rain of love juice down on them, destroying half of the state and drowning poor, little city under them. In that rate, she and master will be drowning too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to... you know... rub yourself, or...\" Dillion's face has flushed red, trying to awkwardly continue his monologue, until he realised something - she could use him as an living dildo! Apparently, Breeze tought the same, judging by the look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have better idea, master~ I think... you will really love this\" She grabs you, lifting you on your eye level, and starts to undress you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that you don't mind this, master...\" Breeze says, reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no... I don't mind it at all... Just be careful, please\" You smile warmly to your new lover, feeling the intimacy between both of you, despite the overall situation...

Neverthless, Breeze were awestruck by your looks - she couldn't take her eyes away from your fat, twitching cock, like some primal instincts kicked in in her mind... Her heart started to beat much faster, and after a short while of staring, she blurted:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i love you... Hang tight, master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with swift move, she lowered you right in front of her vagina. For you, it was gigantic - not so big as Ashleigh, of course, but still larger than you by a big margin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breeze, i think- mMMFffF!!\" Your talk were suddenly cut out by your lover, who pushed you unceremoniously onto her wet, warm lips, sinking you deeper between them... That action met with a loud, moan-like neigh from the Breeze, and another push. This time, your whole body was pushed straight to your lover, and she weren't stopping - she were going deeper and deeper, with each push she were moaning and moaning louder and louder, trembling harder and harder... Her pussy were clenching around you, but you felt fine, in fact you were feeling like you didn't even need any air, or anything... You were only feeling awfully large arousal and need to hump her, lick her, nuzzle to her, so you've give into your desires. You've started to thrust your cock straight into soft flesh of your lover, rubbing whole body against it, holding yourself onto it, and by the fierce torrents of fluids leaking from her, she reaaally loved that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-aahh... I loove you... Breezee!\" You scream, feeling your first orgasm in the womb of your lover, and just after that, like she could hear your voice, Breeze yelled: \"I LOVE YOOOUUuUAAH!\" The sudden torrent of fem juices would surely push you out of gigantic mare pussy, but thankfully she were pinning you down and massaging herself with you. Her orgasm were like a force of nature, like a sudden tsunami, multiplied in intensity with every second... You knew that she were growing now, her pussy were hotter than sun, her body were trembling like after the impact of the nuke, and her pussy were clenching on you with unbelieveable force... But you still weren't feeling any pain, or even slightly uncomfortable! Is it possible... that her fem juices were haveing some effect on you?</span></div></div>",

Many of them thought that the end of times has come, seeing the wall looming closer and closer, taking more and more of the city, until the wool has enveloped them in it's warm embrace. Cries of despair were changing to the cries of worship, as city after city were overtaken by divine rump of an ewe, somehow not harming anyone at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi were really confused by her feelings - at the one hand she wanted to stop the horny ewe and finish all of that madness, but on the other hand... The look of the ewe, how round and sexy she looked, how ridiculously big were all of her curves, and at the same time, so appealing... How she smalled, how her voice sounded like, how she giggled, how... powerful she were becoming... And when Ashleigh grew, when her breasts pushed itself onto sheepdog snout, then Heidi instantly abandoned any plans to stop her, and instead she started to lick and nuzzle on ewe erect nipples, lapping on the trickles of milk coming out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshleigh huffed and moaned, as she grew, to 40 miles, 60 miles, 90 miles, still bigger and bigger... She hugged Heidi, grinning at her, pushing her deeper into her breasts, until she squirted again, and doubled in size... 260 miles of sheep were towering high above the mountains, clouds, anything... Real queen of the world. She stands up, her movement disturbs the wather around half of states, her body can be seen across half of the country, and her breasts smashes few sattelites on the low orbit. She looks on the horizon, seeing the curvature of the earth, smiling widely, and then she looks down, on the small dog, so excited by her goddess growth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEHE, I TOLD YOU~ I AM REALLY THE GREATEST, MFF~ I FEEL EVEN NOW HOW BREEZE AND MASTER WORSHIP ME, SQUEEZED IN MY PUSSY...\" She grins wideely. \"THAT MEANS... THAT I AM THE MASTER... HUFFF... MASTER... OF ALL! AND MASTER...

She thought that she were on top of the world, as the lone ruler and goddess of it, but... slowly, she notices some positives in that situation - they were still absolutely massive, the one of their kind, and looks like Heidi really likes the ewe, despite how she acted in previous lives. To be honest, she also liked her caretaker, despite that she were so mischievious and disobedient - she just wanted to have some fun! And now when they are both  so gigantic... Then maybe it's time to allievate that relationship even further? Now, when Ashleigh thinks about it all that way, it makes a lot of sense for her, to still have some fun, and loving gropes and mewls of sheepdog only reinforces her feelings for Heidi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi, startled by sudden yelling of the ewe, turns around and look up... and up... and up! From the hooves, smothering small mountain under them like it were a pile of dirt, through gigantic udders, hanging heavily, constantly dripping milk on the land below, making new lakes and rivers, through hips, so wide that if she were normal sized then they would be the width of wooden barrel of beer, through even bigger breasts, the size of beanbags each, and to cute, female face of anthor cow - there was Bessy, an cow from Dillion's farm. Heidi just squealed, seeing another massive, familiar anthro, and instanly, in her mind appeared some lewd images of her, being under the hooves of ewe and cow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Sassy... you had to be really horny to grow that much~\" Ashleigh says, winking to massive cow, at least 1,5 times bigger than ewe or sheepdog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\nA: \"Horny? Grow?\" - Sassy didn't grew by arousal - she grew just from whatever grew every animal, and her first arousal growth just awaits her... who knows how strong it will be?<br>\r\nB: \"Heh, you bet, sugarcube~\" - Sassy grew from arousal, and who knows if she is the only one who grew, or is there some anthro who grew with her?<br>\r\nC: Something else?</span></div></div>",

Her large tail wagged, knocking over trees, cars, and lightpoles as she grew, ballooning up to a size of 65ft. Though Luna was seemingly getting more and more... stimulated as she grew. You recognized the body language... having seen a similar look and behavior from Ashleigh and Breeze during this growth outbreak. You wondered how much longer before the Husky would try to act on these growing urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tabby Cat meowed and purred as she grew, dropping the Sheriff's car before clocking in now at 70+ft. Seeking release she began to rub herself on the destroyed vehicle in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant snake cuddled her owner closer to her, coiling the two of them up into a semi-ball as she grew... exploding to 245+ft. Part of you wondered what the two were doing, if this \"euphoric arousal\" thing was a common occurrence amongst those effected. If it did, the bar keep.... Joe was in for a hell of an experience. That is... if she wasn't devouring him. Couldn't tell from your vantage point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squirrel's breasts inflated to blimp sizes as she doubled in height. She didn't seem to really notice as she sat there chewing on a handful of junkfood in her paws. Some of her 'audience' got stuck under her growing body, near her tailhole and crotch. Was probably only a matter of time before she too got hit by the 'itch'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Field Mouse seemed to be panicking now, trying to find her stashed food, as the ground (to her) shrank further and further away from her as she hit 75ft. Now almost the entire lot was a dirt field due to her digging. The Opposum's prone body seemed to expand before your eyes, like someone had hit the 'Magnify' or 'Zoom' option on a computer program. Her fuzzy, curvy body now completely enveloping the school. She was starting to stir now too. The Deer still didn't seem to give a shit as she now hit 60+ feet in height, grazing on trees and bushes now. This could change as you saw Ashleigh running towards the bent-over Deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vixen, on the other hand, had finally found the right-sized bus to please herself... but soon found it too was even lacking as she hit 100+ feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting more and more out of hand.\" said Heidi as she watched from your vantage point. Breeze held you closer to her massive chest.<br>\r\n\"I'm getting so worried Master.\" she said, her heart pumping fast.<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" you reply, stroking her hand-hoof as you watched the scene unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we do?\" asked Heidi, glancing up at you.<br>\r\n\"First order of business is to try and reign in Ashleigh before she gets too out of control.\" you announce, scanning the horizon from your viewpoint. You could see some definite activity in and around the neighboring town a mile or so away. You got this feeling that this is obviously going well beyond your town... maybe even the whole country.... perhaps the whole WORLD! You wondered if this only effected female animals... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were lost in thought, you failed to notice...</span></div></div>",

The curly tail, the snout, and the cute little ears. It was female too, the predominant breasts were a dead giveaway. She looked almost like an overly sexualized parody of 'Ms. Piggy'. Though she looked a bit... 'shortstacked' (that was the term for it, right? if your net slang was up to date), like a paradoxical 'dwarf' almost despite being giant-sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were very few pigs on your farm... and only one female. So you had a pretty good idea as to who this was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Pepper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portly giant pig was sniffing the air, looking about... searching for something. When she picked up on Breeze's scent she turned towards you two. Pepper's ears perked up and her face brightened as she scurried over towards the giant horse. \"Hi there Breeze!\" she said happily as she glomped onto the massive mare. Breeze smiled and returned the hug. Pepper's height currently/barely reached the horse's chest. <br>\r\n\"H- Hi there Pepper.\" she replied, giggling. <br>\r\n\"Good to see I'm not the only giant around here!\" spoke up Pepper, showing that intelligence Pigs are supposed to be renowned for. \"Have you seen the master?\" she asked, clearly not noticing you right there beside Breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze simply motioned towards you down on the ground. Pepper finally saw you, and it seemed to really (finally) hit her by the size discrepancy as you waved up at her. Solemnly the pig kneeled down and got a better look at you. \"Is that really you Dillon?\" she asked, asking a silly question. You quietly nodded, quite amazed that she knew your real name besides 'Master'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dillon? Who's Dillon?\" asked Breeze, her tail swishing.<br>\r\n\"That's... that's the Master's name.\" replied Pepper. The horse cocked her head to the side. The master had another name? Why hadn't she ever known? As Breeze pondered these mental quandaries, the pig picked you up in her cute little hoof hands.<br>\r\n\"Wow... so used to you being the taller one.\" she chuckled, nuzzling her cheek into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked her if she had seen any of the others. Sassy the cow? Dahlia the alpaca? Heidi the Sheepdog? Ashleigh the sheep? Absynthe the cat? Freddy the Bull? Pepper seemed to be spacing out as she held you in her hand.

You had known her almost your entire life, she was a friendly creature and quite fond of you. She loved to, when you were younger, lick the top of your head as you squeezed milk from her. She liked your company... or at least... you always thought so... kinda hard to read animals. As you saw her approach, you realized she had gotten HUGE... and then some. You had been meaning to milk her today, but obviously got caught up in other events... and it truly showed. Her Breasts and Udder were clearly swollen, and starting to leak milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she get so big?\" you asked yourself.<br>\r\n\"Sassy?\" asked Ashleigh, perking up as she watched her fellow farm animal walk towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" asked the cow, crunching on some tree bark as she looked down at the Ewe. She was used to be taller than Ashleigh, so that didn't bother her too much. But it was the sheep's new form that puzzled her. \"What happened to you Ashleigh?\" she asked, swallowing the greenery as she leaned down to get a better look. It was then that the big Cow noticed the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so small Breeze?\" asked the puzzled Sassy as she seemed to be a bit oblivious to her current situation.<br>\r\n\"I'm not small Sassy...\" replied the horse, stepping forward a bit. \"you're just really big! We all are.\" This seemed to fly over the mature cow's head.<br>\r\n\"But I'm always been pretty big.\" she said, confused as she tried to find the farm. She needed milking... but couldn't recognize the surrounding terrain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now you're even BIGGER!\" said Ashleigh with a delightful squeal hopping happily. Sassy tilted her head to the side, clearly not understanding. She had awoken to this current situation... so it didn't quite click yet.<br>\r\n\"Well I do feel alot more heavier... and these new... THINGS are quite cumbersome.\" replied the cow as she jiggled the massive breasts that hung from her chest, sloshing the milk that filled them.... and squirting a little unintentionally. \"Where's the master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshleigh smirked as she lifted Breeze up. You suddenly felt what could best be described as the feeling one gets in some elevators as they come to a complete stop... that bizarre feeling of motion meeting deceleration. The Ewe lifted the horse up as far as she could. \"Here he is! He's in Breeze's chest!\" Sassy cocked an eyebrow, now even more befuddled than before. Carefully, she leaned down even further, milk splurting out of her breasts as she did, getting a closer look at the tiny Horse. Her eyes widened upon beholding your current (to them) small stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.. what happened?\" she asked, jerking back up in surprise, sending more jets of milks about.... some hitting Ashleigh and Breeze.

It surprised you that she knew your name, but seeing as how long she's been in your family... it wasn't too shocking to discover. Obligingly you carefully slipped out onto her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dillon? Who's Dillon?\" asked Ashleigh.

I don't know.\" you replied, not having any more of a clue than the massive female humanoids you were amongst. \"All I know was that I went to go tend to Breeze... and.... well this all started.\" feeling safe with Sassy, her motherly tone putting you at ease. Her breasts were sloshing with milk, looking like they were getting more and more filled as you talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You doing okay?\" you ask, rubbing her cheek. She smiles, and her ear flicks happily.<br>\r\n\"I... I need milking sweetie. Bout to Burst!\" replied Sassy, panting as her chest and udder weight increased. She really shouldn't have eaten those trees on the way. You blushed, not knowing what to do for your old cow. She was too big for a bucket... and too big for a water tower....<br>\r\n\"I'll.... I'll think of something.\" you sputter out, unsure of how you were going to follow through on that. Sassy giggled and gave you a super-gentle lick with her long tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... you've never let me down sugar.\" she said, a massive smile on her face.

The break off from the make-out session sent you tumbling down between the combined breasts of both girls. It felt like a 'bounce castle', a warm... heaving bounce castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSassy smirked, lust in her mind as she pushed the equine down upon the improvised dildo, this brought forth a shocked ecstasy-filled scream from Breeze. Her pelvic muscles tensed up, and a loud noise of the silo being crushed further could be heard. Her gasping moans were cut off by the return of Sassy's lips as the two mountainous macros fondled and caressed each other, with interruptions by Breeze's moist pumping of the silo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs things grew even more heated...</span></div></div>",

The white mare gasps and says, \"Oh my!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell crap. Now you had to explain this to your brother when he comes to. And...just how big was Breeze now? Judging from the bulge in the roof, she would break through it on her next growth spurt unless she were to completely ball up, and even then that probably wouldn't buy much more time and she would be extremely uncomfortable. You can't do that to her, not to the horse you loved for as long as you had her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze gently picks up your brother with one hand, and says sadly, \"I'm sorry, master...but I must get out now.\" and with that, she pushes her way through the front of the stables, unavoidably demolishing much of the wall beyond recognition. Yet once she was out, the stables remain barely standing somehow. She stretched her body, having been cramped in there for so long, and then carefully lowered your brother back down to the ground. \"Will he be alright, master?\" she asks, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he'll be fine. We, however, are going to have to explain...you to him.\" you reply. You partially wonder how on Earth you are going to be able to feed Breeze at this size, let alone later down the road when she's even bigger. For now though, you take your brother back to your house, which isn't far from the stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours pass, which you occupied with making yourself some breakfast and getting Breeze an entire bale of hay for hers back where you left her, your brother finally comes to. \"Ah. You're awake, brother. Can I get you some tea? Water?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe replies, \"Ugh...I think something a little stronger is in order. Like a beer...or two. Maybe what I saw would make more sense if I was drunk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What was it?\" you ask, trying to play dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother narrows his eyes and answers, \"...You know damn well what the hell I saw! Some giant white horse-woman in your stables! She had to be at least 25 feet tall! What, did you trade your horses in for that...that <i>thing</i>?! I thought at least Breeze meant more to you than that, brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're certain he's finished his rant you saw coming, you say calmly trying not to explode with anger, \"That thing out there <i>is</i> Breeze. I had to sell off my other horses one by one to make ends meet. It pained me to let go of Maximus. Phaedra. Billy. And Biscuit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So you put Breeze through some mad scientist's experiment since you can't get a girl to save your life and to get some cash?\" he says less angrily and more confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up. She was like that when I found her yesterday. Don't believe me? I'll let you hear it straight from the horse's mouth - literally.\" you say, and then take your brother by the arm to head outside. There's no way to make him forget about Breeze, but perhaps you can convince him to keep quiet about her...even though you know that if her growth continues her presence will inevitably become known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside and at the stables, your brother comments with regard to the hole where the front used to be, \"Damn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Breeze, you can show yourself.\" you call out, and heavy steps follow before Breeze appears in the open. It seems like she's grown a bit again since you last saw her - she seems a solid 30 feet tall now. The stables don't even come halfway up to her thighs now. You note your brother's wide eye expression and say, \"Did I mention she's growing every now and again? Sometimes just a few inches, sometimes a couple feet. Probably should have mentioned that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze recognizes your brother from the incident earlier and greets him with, \"Oh! Hello! I remember you.

Are you mad?! No one else can know about her!\" you exclaim while also trying to keep your voice down. Mostly so Breeze doesn't worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've done the math, brother. She's three times bigger than she was yesterday morning. And if I remember correctly, you said she's still growing. Tell me, brother, what's gonna happen to your not-so-little pony girl when she's <i>too damn big to hide anymore</i>? People will start noticing a giant monster, and that's all they're gonna see. They'll call in the military, and...well, they're not exactly going to bother asking questions when they come to leave her as nothing but a smoking crater. There won't be enough of her to fill a matchbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know you love Breeze, and she is such a sweet thing, ...not to mention absolutely smoking hot as a 'furry'. That's why I'm telling you the people need to be exposed to her. They come to know her as anything but a monster, win their hearts and minds, and the military may not try to put her down.\" he explains at length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" you start, not entirely convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, if I may, master?\" Breeze asks from where she was standing, \"I don't want to be seen by humans as a monster, no matter how large I may end up. I think that we should take our chances with letting them get to know me now. I'm sure it'll be okay, master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Breeze agrees with me.\" your brother says, and you swear he's trying to impress her, if subconsciously. With a body as beautiful as hers, it's kind of hard not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, master, if we want to fix the stables...we need the materials for it. I don't think the trees in the forest would be suitable for the task.\" Breeze adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself unable to disagree with Breeze. You only want what's best for her, and deep down you know you can't hide her forever. Maybe it <i>would</i> be better to get it over with now while people may still be willing to see her as the gentle girl you've known her as. \"...Okay. We'll head into town shortly.\" you conclude. You just hope you aren't making a big mistake by doing this.</span></div></div>",

Blaze, one of the extremely rare peaceful Furries, is the one anthro that won't inspire intense fear from you. Standing at almost sixty feet tall, the dark furred horse anthro has protected you for almost as long as you can remember. However, one day, Blaze experiences a small growth spurt, one that most of the rampaging Furries experience, which enables them to destroy and rampage more-or-less to their heart's content. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared out of your mind, you make Blaze promise not to hurt you or any other humans in any way, a promise Blaze is deadly serious about. However, Blaze is at a massive disadvantage against the more violent Furries, who tower hundreds upon hundreds of feet in height - or even thousands, or more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both quickly realise that Blaze's growth spurt is far from normal, however, when it continues to speed up - and up and up and up - when most Furries' growth spurts continue at a slow, linear rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze may be completely gentle and benevolent when dealing with humans, but will her growth spurt ever end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably not. </span></div></div>",

The source of the noise came from your attic, a place you generally avoid having to go to out a severe case of on-set Arachnophobia that you got the last time you went up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlace was lousy with Spiders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Mice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the snapping and cracking sound grew in intensity before something fell through the ceiling... almost on top of you. Unfortunately, it also brought with it splinters, wall insulation, dust and other things you'd expect to find packed between the walls and flooring of a house. So your vision was obscured for a brief moment, all that registered was that something big and heavy landed just inches away from you on the couch you currently occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the noises, and a chipper, pixie-like feminine voice as you desperately tried to clear the debris from your eyes. Seems your sudden guest was having similar issues, as she spat out curses and other sour words as she struggled to get her bearings. The two of you looked and met eyes almost at the same time... or at least it certainly felt like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that mattered now was that you were suddenly staring into the eyes of a human-sized anthropomorphic rodent of some kind. With heavy emphasis on the anthropomorphism... your furry guest packed a decent set of breasts. Startled, the two of you began to speak...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...\" you started.<br>\r\n\"<i>the hell-</i>\"<br>\r\n\"are-\"<br>\r\n\"<i>You?!</i>\" she asked, backing up onto the other side of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ME?!\" you asked, seemingly aghast at such a silly question, \"Who the hell are YOU?!? And what are you doing in my HOUSE?!\" you exclaimed, backing up from her as well.<br>\r\n\"Well... y-you first!

It was either that or scream like a maniac... and maybe flail a bit too. <br>\r\n\"Rysia.\" replied the feminine mouse, blushing.<br>\r\n\"Well uhh... Rysia... where the heck did you come from?\" you asked. Silently, anxiously, the nervous mouse pointed up to the hole in your ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... you mean to say you're an.... Alien?!\" you asked. Your impromptu guest tilted her head to the side.<br>\r\n\"Alien? What's that? Did it live up there too?\" she asked, clearly not understanding what you meant.<br>\r\n\"Up there? You mean... my attic?\" you asked in response. Now that she mentioned it, you definitely didn't see any holes leading out of your house... just right smack dab into your living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attic?

Rysia simply rolled her eyes as this new mouse joined them, almost sitting on you as she cuddled up to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Deenika.\" chuckled Rysia as the massive mice continued to enlarge. Deenika's rear end was soon almost engulfing you as it expanded. This finally got her attention.<br>\r\n\"Oooohh.... who are you?\" she asked, turning towards you.<br>\r\n\"Deeni, that's Dillon. The human owner of the house.\" informed Rysia, comforting Kiri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owner? Human? Doesn't look that impressive to me!\" said a rather tall mouse as she stood off to the side, away from the cuddle-pile. \"Humans used to be so much more... impressive.\"<br>\r\n\"Calm down Marxy!\" snapped Rysia as Kiri practically curled up on her lap. Deenika was more interested in you to care about the discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so cute.\" she giggled as she ran a finger over your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness!\" gasped another (nervous) voice as a rather busty mouse got up off the floor. \"Is everyone alright?\" she asked, blushing as she took in her new surroundings. She looked like someone had injected beach balls into her chest.<br>\r\n\"That you Prika?\" asked Rysia, not really recognizing her sister with such... tracts of land. Prika gasped as she saw Rysia, and much like Kiri, bounded over to her. The couch imploded from the weight as four mice, each taller than a fridge, tried to all occupy the same space.

By now the five mice were all within the range of 15 feet. You honestly didn't know what to do with this. Were there more family members?

It looked like they had brought in a trash can to serve as the 'cup'.<br>\r\n\"Thank you guys!!!\" she squealed as she slurped back the sugary sweet concoction. You and Kiri watched as she made short work of the 'milkshake'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... that was GREAT!\" squeaked Rysia as she licked her lips.

The muscular mouse was much taller than before, somewhere between 50-75 feet in height. She looked a bit more... shapely than the last time you saw her. You merely chalked that up whatever chemical these mice had ingested. But she was still quite 'ripped' as she smirked at the humans inside the battered transport vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little twerps look almost good enough to eat!\" she chuckled before pressing her hand down atop the bus's roof, effortlessly pushing it in, sending the humans inside fleeing to opposite ends. You and Kiri could tell Marxy had something else in mind for this bus... her sex was absolutely dripping as she positioned herself at the front. Without a word the massive muscular mouse promptly sat on the ground, legs open, sending a small shockwave through the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I say eat?\" she joked, spreading her vaginal lips apart, \"I meant something else!\" she corrected as she started to push the bus towards her moist nether-lips. The humans inside were freaking out, some were trying to open the emergency exit. It was then that she spotted Kiri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sis!\" she giggled, \"Come to join in on the fun?\" as she pressed the front of the bus into her quivering entrance, the expressions this gave her face were almost cute.<br>\r\n\"No... we.... we came to talk to you.\" gasped Kiri, nervous in front of her larger, older sister.<br>\r\n\"We? Who's-\" started Marxy before her nose twitched and her stern eyes locked right on you. \"Oh... you... Kiri's toy.\" she grumbled as she continued to slowly push the vehicle into her sex.<br>\r\n\"M... Mate.\" corrected Kiri, blushing heavily. This caused Marxy to stop what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mate?! HIM?!\" she asked, incredulous as she slid what little of the bus was inside her out, and stood to her full height. \"You guys better not try anything funny!\" she sternly barked at the humans, gentle 'stomping' the bus's roof to punctuate her point before walking towards you and Kiri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What good can he do? He's barely taller than your fingers!\" growled Marxy, hands on her sides as she looked at her younger sis. She then leaned down to get a better look at you. \"I mean, sure, he was your first... but soon he's gonna be so hard to see it's not gonna even be funny! Then what would you do with him?\" she said harshly, her massive face almost overwhelming you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Pro... Protect him...</font>\" whimpered a trembling Kiri.<br>\r\n\"What? You'll do WHAT?\" asked a bemused Marxy.<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">I'd still protect him!</font>\" blurted out a flustered Kiri, taking her sister aback. Marxy didn't know what to think. Kiri took this opening to try and talk sense to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't come here to tell you that. We need your help Marxy.\" spoke Kiri, looking up at her older sibling pleadingly. Marxy blushed and merely clenched her fists.<br>\r\n\"Yeah? With what?\" she asked, growing impatient.<br>\r\n\"We... We... need to try and stop all of this. Be- Before it gets even more out of hand!\" responded Kiri, trembling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarxy's stoic, stern face broke out into a riotous laughter. \"Stop this? Before it gets more out of hand? You... You mean even more than it already has?!\" she said in between heaving gasps of air. \"And why should we?\" she added.<br>\r\n\"Because,\" you spoke up, knowing full well you're possibly running the risk of injury. \"if you don't, then the humans will start to respond with even bigger weaponry. The kinds even you wouldn't be able to withstand.\" This again brought the immense face of Marxy down towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?! Why should I believe you? Humans have been pretty weak and ineffective with their responses so far.\" said the cocky muscle mouse.<br>\r\n\"Those were just the first response, and as soon as it became apparent that their guns weren't working... they've undoubtedly sent out for bigger, stronger, and even worse weaponry. Bombs, Fire, Cannons, all sorts of nasty things.\" you replied, trying to impress upon the severity of this course of action.<br>\r\n\"Who's to say we won't be BIGGER, STRONGER and TOUGHER by the time those arrive?\" asked the skeptical mouse. You simply sighed.<br>\r\n\"Are you willing to take that gamble?\" you countered. \"Because, trust me, what they've undoubtedly used by now is NOTHING compared to what they'd throw at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarxy stood up, from the look on her face your words seemed to have given her some 'food for thought', you just hoped it was going to be enough to convince her to help instead of try to fight. By now all the humans in her 'bus toy' had all managed to escape anyway... so you've at least accomplished THAT. Luckily, her attention was elsewhere at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like forever, you got her response.</span></div></div>",

You simply nodded to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Fine.</b>\" the both of you answer. This made Marxy smile as she sat down, spread-eagle, as Kiri placed you on the ground in front of her sister's massive snatch. Though she'd probably never admit it, you could tell the muscle mouse was really needing something like this. She looked pretty... pent up. Sighing, you march forward into that cavernous pussy. Her hips bucked as your hands touched her sensitive folds, as your feet set down on her quivering lips. Marxy tried her best to stifle a pleasured gasp, but the further you went in, the more she seemed to give into pleasure and ecstasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been tempted, earlier, to indulge such urges with you... the same as her sisters seemed to do. But things kinda escalated after you had passed out... and the massive 'muscle maiden' had lost herself in the sheer size advantage she had over humans. Needless to say, she was getting these urges indulged... big time as you slid further inside her due to her various bucking, panting and vibrating. The concrete beneath her shapely buns was getting quite cratered as a result of her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndaunted, you rubbed and licked what you could reach or get ahold of inside her, despite feeling like you were on the world's weirdest 'mechanical bull' rides EVER as Marxy's undulations were exactly helping your situation. But she was enjoying it... and hopefully that's all that mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it gets her to help you and Kiri find a way to avoid a catastrophe, you'll happily indulge her. The velvety interior of her sex, coupled with the intense smell of her arousal soon had you rubbing her insides with more than just your hands. You couldn't help but wonder what, exactly, she was doing this whole time you were asleep, because she was acting as anxious and frisky as Kiri did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon a deluge of fem-fluids began to start, soaking your legs as you neared climax yourself. Her cervix contracted and soon both of you climaxed, almost (coincidentally) at the same time. Exhausted, you let yourself slide down and out of the slippery and wet vagina. Once again you were completely soaked from fem-mouse ejaculate as Kiri rushed to check on you. Marxy panted and sighed contently as she sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked up at Kiri, her older sibling's smiling, content face moved into your field of vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped that was enough...</span></div></div>",

What little remained of your couch made for small comfort as her pumping got more and more powerful with each journey down your shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat and during this entire love-making session, Rysia was still... slowly... growing. Lust and desire for interaction took over and the massive mouse lowered her body down to plant increasingly large kisses upon your face and body. \"I.... <i>unhhh</i>....

How your comparatively small junk was about to please her was a mystery... unless her sex was so sensitive that even touching your body with her vaginal lips was intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer moaning and groaning became louder as she reached her own climax.

This of course led to panic as they ran away whilst the German Shepard looked at them tongue lulled. His growth was slow but it was noticeable, and soon people were calling the authorities about the growing canine. As the police arrived the dog had broken out of the lab and was walking around. They lined up guns in hand and ordered the dog to stop walking, but of course he couldn\u2019t understand and simply kept going. One scared officer shook as his gun misfired up at the German Shepard, who then looked down growling at the officers. They now had no choice but to try to take him down, but the dog wasn\u2019t about to let them. He quickly jumped toward the officers who were shooting at him, swatting a car out of the way and scooping several up into his maw.

Despite mild disapproval from both of your parents - yours because dragons usually grew several feet taller than humans, which could pose danger in the future; Lexi's because her size might pose a danger to you in the future - you've remained close friends throughout your lives, helping and supporting each other whenever the other needs it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one week, Lexi starts acting oddly. You can't pinpoint exactly what is off about her, but it makes you uneasy. In addition, Lexi begins slowly growing, despite the fact that she was meant to be fully grown!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt culminates one day when you visit Lexi, only to discover...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to discover that Lexi has turned into a goddess, and her personality had been absorbed by a new one. This new personality is rather different from Lexi's, and discloses to you her plans once she starts to <i>really</i> grow: gentle rampages. As a goddess, this new personality - named Chayla - can manipulate reality at will. This includes making sure that nobody is harmed by her rampages, and putting everything back to the way it used to be in the blink of an eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChayla also tells you something rather interesting:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's never going to stop growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Never.</i></span></div></div>",

As usual, you'd let yourself in through the human sized door with the emergency key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd been worried lately. Despite hours of research online, nothing you had found had helped to explain Lexi's shifting behaviour, nor her slow and steady growth. And today, Lexi had stopped answering the phone. You had quickly settled into a routine of calling in the morning and evening to check that Lexi was okay, and she had always answered. What if something had happened to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer behaviour had been slowly changing throughout the week, as well. You couldn't pinpoint exactly what was different, but you felt uneasy around her. It was if something was doing a remarkably good impression of Lexi, only you were aware that it was an impression. As if something was using her; wearing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly move throughout the white walled and beige carpeted corridor, you begin to feel as if something is watching you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese suspicions are quickly proven correct, as you feel and see yourself being lifted into the air by a pair of powerful crimson scaled hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit Lexi, don't do that! You know it makes me jump! At least ask first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting round, in Lexi's grip, you immediately realise something is wrong. Lexi appears perfectly normal - her red scales, draconic muzzle, black t-shirt and denim shorts all in order - until you look at her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone were the green pupilled orbs that you'd grown accustomed to over so many years of close friendship. Replacing them, were two blazing golden lights, so intense that you screw your eyes shut instead of looking at them. This was not the Lexi you knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot-Lexi begins to speak. Her voice sounded like Lexi's mixed with the soft tones of a wind chime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... Human? You desire answers, correct? There is much to discuss; come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are gently placed back on the floor, a large talon scratching the top of your head. Following Not-Lexi into the living room, you take a seat on the sofa while keeping your eyes on Not-Lexi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, there is much to discuss. You are aware of the recent... Odd... Behaviour of this body?\"<br>\r\nYou nod, prompting Not-Lexi to continue. <br>\r\n\"Roughly a week ago by your standards, the one you know as Lexi started acting strangely. This was due to my consciousness being drawn into her body. I do not know why or how this happened, but it happened nontheless. I cannot find any way to sugarcoat this, human, but for now, Lexi is gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"For now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot-Lexi nods her massive head. \"I was able to create... I believe you would call it a 'backup', of Lexi's personality. Currently, it has no body to inhabit, and is in a dormant state. It was fortunate that I created a backup when I did, as... My personality's arrival into this body completely overpowered Lexi's personality. The original Lexi was, essentially, absorbed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words hit you like a punch to the gut. Lexi... absorbed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear not, mortal. The duplicate personality is an exact duplicate. All the memories, feelings, and more; everything that made the original Lexi who she was, has been saved for a later date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fidget. \"Why later? Can't you just, I don't know, leave her body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot-Lexi shakes her head sadly. \"I am afraid that I cannot at the current moment in time, human. I have more urgent matters to attend to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can respond, the crimson dragon is cut off by a series of powerful shudders, before she begins to bulge larger, gaining a foot in height in a few mere seconds, and then another after that! Not-Lexi quickly shivers out of the growth spurt as your jaw hangs open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, this body is still growing exponentially. Mortal bodies were never made to contain the power of gods and goddesses... Speaking of which, I do hope you can pardon my manners. I am the goddess Chayla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChayla shifts in the now comparatively smaller chair before continuing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have reason to believe that this particular growth spurt; rather, that is, this series of growth spurts... Will never stop.\"</span></div></div>",

How the naga managed to sneak into your bed during the night, you would never know. A pair of powerful arms encircle you, pushing you in closer to her deep red scales. A thin coil of snake tail slowly winds around your legs, holding them in place. As Medea attempts to absorb as much of your heat as possible, she lets out a contented rumble, the sound vibrating throughout your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of your mornings were like this; laying in your oversized bed while Medea hugged you close to her scaly body, trying to warm up enough to move. Not that she usually took advantage of that to actually go anywhere, however. The lazy naga was usually found in one of two places: sprawled across your sofa, or sprawled on your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medea, please stop.\" you ask. You receive no reply from the serpent. \"If you let go of me I can open the curtains and let you warm up faster.\" You received a reply from Medea this time. Unfortunately, this reply was to squeeze you even tighter, the naga now burying her head into your chest, which it easily reached due to the length of her neck. Sometimes you wondered if she was a corn snake or a boa constrictor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urk! Too tight!\" Thankfully, Medea lessens her grip on you slightly, her powerful, scaly arms relaxing just a touch. Giving a short grunt in thanks, you squirm about in Medea's arms and coils, finding a more comfortable position for yourself. Sighing to yourself and accepting that Medea would not let you go until she was no longer sluggish, you worm your way into her coils a little more, closing your eyes and letting sleep gradually overcome you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully it wouldn't be <i>too</i> late by the time Medea let you go...</span></div></div>",

Shocked you try to back away only to role off your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Landing face up, the feline woman's face pokes out over the side of the bed, Those familiar golden eyes filled with concern,but this time you remember who they belong to.  V-Val you stutter The anthro feline tilts her head sniffing the air  and then gives a shy smile ,Den-mate she chirps happily. Too stunned to give any kind of reply. You try to piece together the events  leading up to the bizarre phenomenon now facing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFlash to last night. 8:00pm. Placing your car in park you give a small sigh. The work week had been long ,but it was finally over. As you get out of your car you take a moment to stretch and survey your yard in the dimming light. it was an average small town place. Half an acre of land surrounded your modest A-Frame home before being swallowed by the woodlands that take up the majority of your quiet little corner of town. It wasn't a lonely place ,but a peaceful, calming place grate for starting a family If you ever had the time to find someone ,but for now it was just you and your fuzzy companion Valerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping inside you waste no time in sliding over to the couch and flipping on the TV. when you hear a familiar mewling coming from behind you. Hay there Val you call expecting to see the gray striped form of the tabby coming out to say hello. Instead you just hear a string of yowls. When It becomes obvious she isn't coming. You crane your neck over the back of the couch to see her lying on the floor her tongue sticking out ever so slightly. \"What do you want girl\" you ask knowing better then to get a real answer. The Tabby just gives a long mewl then the tongue came out again, was she panting? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point you felt something was off, the House was cool and it normally took a real scorcher to get a cat to pant. As you watch that nagging feeling that some-thing's wrong intensifies until you finally pull your self away from the couch and squat down in front of her. Whats wrong girl you ask, subconsciously checking her over for any sines of injury. Val simply looks up at you from her lying position on the floor still panting. Tentatively you run your fingers along her side feeling her small form tremble beneath your touch. Hay there its alright. you say picking her up and cradling her. Although she continues to shake Val doesn't struggle as you settle your self back on the couch and pull out your I-phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curse under your breath as you catch the time 10:04. the small local veterinary clinics would definitely be closed by now and the nearest 24/7 place was at least  two hours out not to mention there would be a hell of a bill. Biting your lip you scratch lightly under her chin and though she hadn't stopped trembling she shuts her eyes and pushes into your touch. You breath a small sigh knowing whatever was wrong, she doesn't seem all that upset about it. We'll see what happens you say as you flick the TV off and holding the Tabby to your chest, you make your way to your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting an old windbreaker Val was fond of sleeping on you lay it out on one side of your bed and gently set her upon it before climbing in next to her. Even if you could let things be for now you weren't going to take any chances, if Valerie's condition got any worse you were going to bring her to that clinic, until then you would stay by her side all night if you had too. Breathing another sigh you kicked off your shoes and started petting Val in long strokes all the way down her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later you were yawning and having trouble keeping your eyes open, forty five minutes in and still no change in the Tabby's condition you were beginning to nod. By a quarter to twelve you where out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBack in the present you where driven out of your thoughts by a gasping did I just! \"gasp\" I did! Den-mate Den-mate can you understand me! Val practically screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question seemed to snap you to your senses sitting up you turn to the tabby.</span></div></div>",

I was hoping you would know, It seemed that way when you put me here and stayed with me. Your not mad at me are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you had upset her you realize she's probably more rattled by this then you are. The sudden thought of feeling your bones shift and change inside of you sent a chill down your spine. You wanted to kick yourself for your outburst. Standing up You walk around the bed until your right in front of her. <br>\r\nI'm  sorry Val  I don't know what's happening and It scares me. the Tabby's head slid out and she looked up at you from over her thigh. Promise you're not mad.<br>\r\nYou nod back, I'm only worried about you is all. Soundlessly Valerie uncurled and stretched before gingerly standing on her hind feet. she seamed a little unsteady and realizing this was her first time you bring your arms out to catch her in case she falls. soon enough she seams to get the hang of it and gives a triumphant smile. <br>\r\nWith Val standing upright you discover she was taller than you guessed,  with the added height of the bed she nearly came up to your nose placing her a little over three foot six just 28in from your 5 foot 10.<br>\r\nDen-mate she asks, can you do the thing? It always helps me when I'm sad.<br>\r\nWhat thing? \"OK maybe she does come up to your nose.\"<br>\r\nValerie takes a step forward closing the gap.

She studies it for a moment before leaning in and running her cheek against it, Before stopping abruptly and looking up at you expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching on you can't help but swallow a lump in your throat as you give her body a quick once over, a part of you couldn't help but noticing how attractive this new Val was and that made her request more than a little awkward. Your lack of experience with women didn't help matters and \"Hang on had you been thinking of Val as a woman?\" the realization  seamed to short circuit your higher brain functions ,But Val had gotten inpatient and started nuzzling your hand again the feel of her soft fur tingling against your bare skin quieting your inner turmoil as you lost yourself in the feeling. Taking a slow deliberate breath you run your hand under her jaw scratching lightly. She presses back against your hand with enthusiasm closing her eyes and giving out a contented chirrup. Raising your hand higher you slide your fingers between her perked ears and down her neck stopping short of her back before repeating the motion with Val turning her head this way and that guiding your fingers along different paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far Val hadn't said anything seaming content to fall back into more feline behavior and it put you at ease to see a part of the tabby you'd known was still there. This was still Valerie your Val that you had picked up as a kitten from the shelter those years ago, the one that nipped at your tows at night before curling up on your chest. the one that demanded your attention any time you tried to work on your garden, the same Val that would try anything to get in your lap begging for handouts when you where eating and sprawl out on the arm of the couch for a nap well you watched TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize your arm was getting sore and it felt like each time you had to raise it a bit higher to reach the top of her head and you where starting to think that this wasn't just your mind playing tricks on you when you felt Val's head drop out from under your hand.<br>\r\nLooking down you see the anthropomorphic tabby down on all fours gracefully striding towards you, she brushes her side along your waist completing the motion with her back to you and her tail in the air, she's given you a great view of her firm shapely ass and the underside of her sex as she stopped to look at you over her shoulder. Keep going she said  unabashed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn does she have any idea how sexy that was? Dragging your mind outta the gutter you try to get a handle on the situation. Alright, but I'm still tired you tell her which wasn't a complete lie as your unplanned nap couldn't have lasted more than a couple of hours. Val gives a guilty smile ,but nods as you climb onto the bed and prop yourself up with the headboard. Getting comfortable you pat a space next to you on the bed and Val comes right up and places her padded hands on your chest her fingers kneading the material of your shirt you feel the tips of her claws rake against your skin as she nuzzles your face.<br>\r\nA little fearful of what those claws could do to you. You place your hands on her shoulders and Valerie backs off only to start kneading your O-crap. Ca-a-rffel Val you manage to say throw a hiss of pain, She stops  ,but gives you a confused look so you point down and she follows your finger to where one of her claws was dug into the thick denim of your pants less than an inch from your crotch. Val quickly removed them pinning her ears back. <br>\r\nIt's alright Val you say as you check to see if she broke the skin ,but the tabby still seemed upset. Not sure how she would react to the gesture ,but not knowing what else to do you wrap your arms around her and pull her into a hug. Hay now It's OK, I know you didn't mean to. Your bigger now and your claws can do a lot more damage than your used to. I know you're scared with what's happening to you I am too ,but I'm here for you OK and I promise I'm not going anywhere. So Just promise you'll be more gentle with me from now on alright. Val nodded wrapping her arms around you and nuzzling the side of your head,  so you loosen your grip and start running one of your hands down her back all the way to her tail and for the first time since the change Valerie began to purr.<br>\r\nThe sound was the same only louder her entire body seemed to vibrate with the feline melody. You know I've always loved your purr you whisper to her.<br>\r\nThe Tabby's head shot up at that, golden eyes as big as saucers looking into yours and  the inside of her ears seemed to be getting red. What ,did i do something I shouldn't have? you ask. Val's ears twitched then, No it's just um thanks I guess I mean I'm glad you like it. Um you said you were tired and we've been doing this for awhile now so maybe you should rest um you know. You rolled your eyes whatever has Val so flustered could wait and right now sleep sounded pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You glance over to the clock on your nightstand 2:30am ,that was no time to be up. So you shrug off your shirt and popped the button on your jeans then you stop and look up, Val was still crouched beside you her eyes fixed on your hands. Val had seen you naked before right, you preferred sleeping that way, even let her under the covers with you a few times when the nights got colder ,but this was different Val was different. Eventually you decide your underwear would be enough for your modesty and make yourself comfortable under the sheets. Val stretches and kneads the mattress before lying down next to you and closes her eyes one arm on your waist. <br>\r\nsliding one hand under your pillow, your eyes trail over the feline. noticing her feet were level with your shin. She was definitely growing and must have been close to four feet by now. Hay Val? What is it Den-mate? Did  you know your getting bigger? Hum No I didn't  Val gave an impressive yawn  placing her sharp teeth and long tongue on display, nothing we can do now just sleep she tells you, not even bothering to open her eyes. OK goodnight Val um have a good sleep, you tell her. A light hum her only reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing you can't help but watch her sleep for a while knowing she was going to be even bigger when you woke up ,but Valerie was right you didn't have a clue what was changing her or how to stop it and staying awake all night worrying about it wouldn't help. Closing your eyes you listen to the sound of yours and Val's breathing and  slowly ,eventually sleep welcomed you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   The first thing you sense as consciousness returns to you is the warmth, then faint steady movement. as your faculties return one after another you relies you\u2019re not alone. As your mind zeros in on this, vague images of a gray furry mass swarm your mind. A knot begins to form in your gut as the image sharpens. You had hoped last night had all been a dream, but nothing else could explain away the soft form leaning against you breathing shallowly. So as much as you didn\u2019t want admit it to yourself you knew it had to be Valerie. Still the weight on your chest puzzled you, until you remembered that your former cat now anthro women had been growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTensing you scares remembered to breath as you willed yourself to open your eyes. First seeing your alarm, it was only around 9:00, but you had always been an early riser, then your head turned to see Val, still asleep, her muzzle taking up most of your view as it rested against your collar. However, from the feel of two firm, but soft masses pressed up against your side and what you could see of her outer hip and thigh, she was on her side your body supporting hers. You assumed her legs where curled up as you couldn't see her feet or anything past her knees for that matter. It was enough to tell that Val had gone through quite the growth spurt and well what you had to go on only gave you a vague idea of her size. There was a little voice in your head telling you she looks really tall for a girl and your throat tightened painfully as you considered the implications of Val being taller then you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until this point all of the changes the tabby had undergone suggested that Val was becoming more like a human so her growth hadn't been all that alarming, but what if that wasn\u2019t the case? Dozens of scenarios played out in your mind until Valerie stirred. the claws on her fingers and toes extending as she stretched and yawned, inch long canines white and sharp so close you could feel the heat from her breath which for once didn't reek of cat food and who knows what. The sight was both alarming and strangely arousing as your morning wood chose that moment to make it's presents known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal smiles at you as she rises to her paws and knees You pray she won\u2019t notice or care about your morning glory as it stubbornly twitched and throbbed in the confines of your boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning in she licks your brow, inadvertently giving you a close up of her generous chest. Deciding things had gone far enough you grab her wrists lifting her off of you as you sit up. Realizing you had surprised the tabby you stroke behind her ear before retching down for your jeans from yesterday, then standing you slide them on not daring to turn around until you had managed to conceal your waning erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal I'm not going to lie, you say as you turn back to the feline who was now sitting on the edge of the bed. Things are changing and we need to start figuring out how to deal with it. Her ears lowered at that so you quickly continued, don\u2019t panic If there's one good thing that\u2019s come from this it's that you and I can actually talk to one another so maybe we should start by getting to know each other better preferably over some breakfast you add as your body reminds you that you had skipped dinner plus you had a feeling you were going to need some caffeine to help you get through said conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of breakfast Val's mood did a 180 as she leaped from the bed and tore passed you out the door, you couldn\u2019t help chuckling as you listened to the sound of her claws clicking all the way to the kitchen apparently Val hadn\u2019t changed at all when it came to food. Grabbing a shirt, you throw it on as you calmly made your way to the kitchen Val was standing in the doorway waiting for you. Realizing this was a good chance to gage her height you eyed the space between her head and the door frame as you approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was six or seven inches of leeway between the top of her head and what you recalled being a seven-foot doorway. You weren\u2019t particularly tall, just shy of six feet. So that would mean Val was a head taller then you. It wasn\u2019t something you where accustom to, but not outright alarming. You had seen a couple of women that tall before over the years, although they were few and far between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  In any event you knew Val's stature well above average was still within the realm of human possibility. In truth you had been trying to cling to some kind of rational explanation for her growth, ergo why take on more human like traits and not become human sized? You clung to that idea even now believing she would stop once her body was something of a perfect specimen like an amazon. Still doubt plagued your mind and you decided you should try to convince her to let you measure her every now and then to see if she was still growing and if so how fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping your gaze, you noticed Val was carrying her food dish, the thing now fitting in the palm of her hand as she held it out to you expectantly. I think today calls for something special you say as you take the dish from her and place it on the counter before starting the coffee maker. Grabbing two plates you open a cupboard scanning its contents for something you and Val could eat. Two cans of albacore catch your eye and you ponder whether to just give her one although you really wanted to make her something and you know you had the fixings for tuna melts. Your eyes flick back to Val her tail flicking impatiently as her focus shifted between you and the empty plates. Honestly you were glad she had stayed put as before the change she would have been doing figure eights around your feet whenever you were setting out her food. <br>\r\nA gurgling from your coffee maker signal it was finished and out of habit you pore yourself a mug and add some milk to cool it. Staring at the milk churning and rolling in your mug you find inspiration on a way to distract your furry companion and maybe get a handle on her intellect.<br>\r\nGesturing for Val to have a seat at the kitchen table you place a small cup of milk down in front of her. Knowing her muzzle was too broad to fit in the cup you watched with curiosity as Val lowered her muzzle and sniffed at it before her tongue flicked out and she began to lap, the cup began to tip as her tongue raked along its inside. You knew even expected that could happen, wanting her to learn, but knowing that she might make a mess, but just before the cup fell a clawed hand shot out to steady it then picked it up as she raised her head and sat back in her chair. <br>\r\nSurprised at how fast she was adapting, you watched in amusement as Val continued to drink somehow managing to not spill even a drop despite the speed of her flicking tongue and she consumed a third of the glass before you decided to get back to cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping the now finished melts onto a couple of plates, two for each, with plenty of leftovers in case you needed more. you set them on the table before taking a seat opposite Val. The feline woman quickly picking up one of the proffered sandwiches and after an initial sniff and a lick, making it disappear in only three bights from her large maw. Starting on her second she only took a bight before setting it down and wiping the corner of her muzzle with the back of her paw and licking it clean.<br>\r\nHaving only nibbled on a corner of your own breakfast before being distracted by Val\u2019s little show, your eyes flicked from the unfinished sandwich to Val. Taking a long draft from your coffee, you meet her eye. Like it? Val smiled and gave a nod. With a nod of your own you gestured to her uneaten portion. Are you going to finish that? Val shook her head. I think I ate too much, but it was just so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat answer caught you by surprise. In the past Valerie had always had a big appetite, cleaning out her food bowl and still having room enough to mooch scraps from you and you had expected this bigger Val to be even more ravenous. Your eyes wandered from her to the sandwich fixings on the counter top to her small cat food bowl that sat forgotten on the edge of the table, then to your own plate. Was it possible this new version of your cat didn\u2019t need any more than the old one? Deciding you shouldn\u2019t question the small miracle that Valerie might not eat you to bankruptcy you shrug it off going back to your breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith most of your food gone you glance back at your former cat. Val had been watching you this whole time, silent and unmoving. Only she was definitely still getting bigger, it wasn\u2019t much, but she was now a head taller even when you were both sitting down. An increase of inches in only an hour. Realizing that at this rate she would be taller than anyone you knew before noon, your worry\u2019s only grow. Draining the last of your coffee you set down your mug and cleared your throat. No more delaying it, it was time for the talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that you had her attention, you thought for a moment on where to start.<br>\r\nVal, what do you think of me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feline lowered her head in thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Val was quiet for a long time, apparently putting some real thought into her answer. At first you were relieved she was taking this seriously. So far all you knew was that Val recognized who you were, but the odd moniker she had given you along with your general knowledge of how independent cats were, left you wondering if she would play along with your plans. when you realized that Val's muzzle and ears where going through a wide range of emotions you started to become concerned. The deafening silence seemed to stretch on for a small eternity until, with her head still down she finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as long as I can remember you have been in my life. You give me food, you groom my fur. you play with me, protect me from mean cats and other things and even let me sleep atop you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all that time you have watched over me and now that I think about it, this was never my Den to claim. You were always so big, you could have driven me out whenever you wished. Instead you have shared this place with me. I don't know why you have done these things, but you have done far more for me than any of my own could ever do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie raised her head looking into your eyes. Even now when this, this change troubles you. You\u2019ve shown concern for me. I feel like an ungrateful fool for not realizing it sooner, but you\u2019re the greatest thing that has ever happened to me and I can't imagine what I would do if I ever lose you. Your irreplaceable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you felt your vision blur At Val's words, the sincerity and gratitude with which she had spoken had been enough to make your eyes water. You had thought yourself a passable pet owner at best, but hearing Val's version of events you would think she was talking about her guardian angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she was probably looking for some kind of response you wipe your eyes and clear your throat. Thank you, Val, your important to me too, seeing you happy makes even my worst days more pleasant. Um I love hearing you purr or when you curl up and fall asleep next to me or just seeing you come running up to me and brushing my legs whenever I come home. Having you around just makes me happy, this would be a lonely place without you. \"Maybe that had been a little awkward, but you were trying for the truth, well skating around anything that might lead to questions about being a pet and right now you had enough to deal with.\" So, Val, I take it that you trust me? Val nodded and you decided to pitch your idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright so here's what I was thinking. I admit you changing so you can walk and talk like well, a human was a surprise. What has me worried is that you\u2019re getting bigger. Your already taller than most humans, but if it doesn\u2019t slow down soon this place my not be big enough for you. So, for now I think we should figure out just how fast your growing and see if it's slowing, well where doing that you could tell me what you remember about yesterday, since that might help us find out why this is happening. Um, yeah, that's all I've got sorry Val.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal Seemed to be digesting what you had said with her ears back before she asked. Den mate. If I can't stay here then would you stay with me? You were aware that Val needed your support, probably more then she knew, especially when people started to find out about her. Having a huge anthropomorphic cat wandering around town all alone was a recipe for disaster. Of course, you said reassuringly then added, I think I know just the place if it comes to that. Having remembered that a nearby farmhouse with a big old barn had been up for sale for years. The house and yard where in bad shape, but the barn would make a grate hideout for the oversized tabby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had finished speaking, Val had circled the table and was staring down at you. Turning in your seat you couldn't help drinking in her lithe body. Your eyes trailing from her hips, over her abs and chest before meeting her own. Damn why did she have to look so good, A part of you just wanted to run your hands along those sensual curves, exploring her body in the most intimate of ways, a perverted voice in your mind saying you could probably get away with it too, if you played it off as petting, but you would know and it felt underhanded to take advantage like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if fate was testing you Val decided on that moment to bend down and wrap her arms around you in a firm embrace. Thank you, Den mate, you don't know how happy it makes me to know I can count on you. She said while rubbing her cheek over the top of your head. At this point you were spacing out. Val's words from earlier flowing through your mind. \"The best thing that ever happened\" \"Your Irreplaceable\" Perhaps you could take a chance just a taste of intimacy, but your rational side was telling you to start solving her growth issue. The thing was with every inch Val was becoming more of a distraction, with all the feline mannerisms she stubbornly clung to feeling more flirtatious in her new form. Maybe just a little something to test her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing Valerie had already let you go and was again standing in front of you. You closed your eyes and took a steadying breath before getting to your feet. Looking up into Val's feline face you placed a hand on her shoulder and told her. I honestly don't know what\u2019s in store for us, but if it's what you want then I'll do all I can to keep us together. At that moment you knew it was the perfect time to take action and for just a moment your grip on her tightened as you considered pulling her in for a kiss, but seeing her warm smile stole your resolve. This wasn't right. Despite how much she adored your company Val hadn\u2019t given any indication she liked you in that way. She probably hadn't even thought about her transformations effect on how you saw her let alone that it could carry any kind of sex appeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill it was terribly frustrating and you knew that eventually you would have to broach the subject. Patting her shoulder awkwardly you ask her if she was ready to make a start on salving the mystery behind her change. To which she said<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn\u2019t hard getting Val to stay still against one of the wood support beams that held up the roof of your modest A-frame, although it was a bit of a challenge getting your hand over her head to mark her height. In the end you had to ask Val to grab your shoulders for balance well you stood on your toes to get the job done. <br>\r\nFinding a suitable tape measure wasn\u2019t a problem since you owned a large landscaping model made from flexible plastic. It was good for distances up to 300 feet and had proven handy when planning out your garden. Within minutes you had a solid figure to work with. At Seven foot one Val was even taller then you had estimated and held a solid fifteen inches over you. With a quick check of the clock on your phone you opened a text document and typed in the results before saving it under the name Val/log. Deciding it would be for the best if you waited at least another hour before you tried again you set the alarm function before placing your phone back in your pocket. With nothing better to do the two of you ended up on the couch. You sitting in one corner well Val had taken a more precarious position with her upper body on the far arm and her legs sprawled out along the back, while she told you what she remembered from the day prier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t much to tell. The only thing that caught your attention was when Val mentioned stalking around the neighborhood and catching some kind of rodent, after picking it up in her mouth she had let it go because something about the way it had been acting and the way it smelled seamed off. Asking for more details Val only shook her head apologetically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally it would come as no surprise if a cat noticed there was something wrong with its pray. Mice and other rodents often carried diseases and felines had evolved to pick up on most of them, but from what she had said so far this had taken place only an hour or so before everything had started and you had a feeling it was more than a coincidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking this was the most likely culprit you asked Val If she thought she could track it down again or identify the smell if she came in to contact with it, Val only shrugged noncommittally and just like that your hopes were dashed. With no more leads to follow the conversation had run its course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was fairly obvious that Val was getting bored, despite emphasizing how important this was it had been a struggle to keep her on topic as it had become apparent that the feline woman\u2019s mind tended to wander, especially to food and other things she enjoyed. Although it had occurred to you that with so much attention focused on how she was changing Val may have been feeling more self-conscious about how different she really was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking she had earned a break from all the serious talk you snaked an arm over the back of the couch and slowly worked your finger\u2019s closer to where Val\u2019s claw tipped tows were resting. Her feline ears twitched and she fixed you with a familiar look. It was the one she had always used in times like this. The one that said I know you\u2019re up to something, but the barest twitch of a smile and the excitement in her eyes told you she was happy for the mischief. This had been one of your favorite past times with Val a simple game where you would just run a digit over her paws, tail or tummy before she could catch your hand in her front paws or sometimes all four. You would always stop before she got too carried away, but when she would catch you she was nearly always reduced to a cute purring heap of fluff that you could just cuddle for hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour ago, you wouldn\u2019t have even considered playing with Val like this, but after hearing how much your time together had meant to her and the trust she was willing to place in you. You where still struggling with your less then platonic feelings and your ability to offer her the physical attention she so craved had suffered, but it was time to man up and fix that, Val deserved no less. So, when you were close enough, your finger shot out running the length of one of her tows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a girly squeal Val\u2019s body convulsed and the sound of claws running over fabric was heard as Val lost her balance sliding down onto the cushions with her legs in your lap, a look of confusion on her face. Curious, you looked down at the soft pads on the bottom of her furry feet. Then with a grin you grabbed one of her ankles and proceeded to run the back of your fingers against the downy tufts of fur between her pads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction was instantaneous. Val\u2019s hole midsection rose from the couch as she dug her fingers into its arm her free foot kicking out wildly as she burst into giggles. Not wanting to push things too far you relented as Val\u2019s body relaxed, chest still heaving from the sudden exertion. Sitting up Val tried to speak. Wh- What did you do to me? Did you like it? You asked. I I can\u2019t. That was like nothing I ever felt before. Val said. Well, it looks like your ticklish. I\u2019m what? It\u2019s hard to explain, but if you touch someone lightly in just the right place, with that you quickly ran a finger over her pad causing Val\u2019s foot to twitch. Well, that happens. Ears twitching, Val started to extract her hind paws from your lap. Hay now if you didn\u2019t care for it than I\u2019ll stop, you said as you draped an arm over Val\u2019s ankles stopping her retreat.<br>\r\n Let me make it up to you. With that you repositioned yourself so that you were facing her, sitting Indian style with Val\u2019s feet still in your lap. Val still looked a little suspicious, but stopped trying to wriggle out of your grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrasping one foot in both hands, you began to work your thumbs over her pads. It had been a long time since you had given someone a massage. A female friend from high school had been training in cosmetology and shown you the proper way to do it in return for having someone to practice on and you had actually become rather good at it. By the contented sigh of your feline companion you still had it. Working your way up you started in on her tows being mindful of her claws that would have rivaled a cougar\u2019s. A little voice in your head was telling you this was starting to stray away from \u201cpurely platonic\u201d, but you just told yourself that it was better than having Val pester you for attention and tried to keep your mind on what you were doing instead of who you were doing it with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeet done you started in on her legs as you made your way up her calf, you were so focused you didn't notice what Val was up to until a long tongue started lapping the back of your hand. Surprised you looked up and saw Val had her hands wrapped around her knees, her back bent at an impossible angle as she continued to lap at your fingers. Too distracted to keep going you simply watched as Val continued to clean your hands with her impressive tongue. Until she took your hand in hers and began working her way up your arm. This was starting to feel too intimate again and without thinking you pulled your hand from Val\u2019s and extracted yourself from the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the vibe in the room changed and you knew that had been a mistake as Val shrank into the far corner curling herself into a defensive ball, ears back as though you had struck her and began to sob. Her voice broken with pain, she shrieked into the cushions, I hate this I hate it so much. Den mate\u2019s afraid of me and nothing I do can make it better. Why, why did this happen to me. I just want to be a normal cat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of what to do, you sat yourself close as possible to the distraught feline without actually touching her. Val I\u2019m not afraid of you. Don\u2019t, Val shouted. You don\u2019t need to lie to me. I can feel it, whenever I get close to you, you start getting stressed. You get tense whenever you touch me. You don\u2019t need to pretend. I tried you know. I really did try to act like everything was the same. My body it feels so strange, but I wanted to show you I was still me. Stunned you realized that Val had just called you out. It looked like the only option was the full truth. With a heavy sigh, you resigned yourself to telling her hoping she wouldn\u2019t hold it against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got me Val. In my defense I didn\u2019t relies you could read me like that. I\u2019m sorry I never wanted to upset you, but your wrong about one thing. Yes, I\u2019m afraid, terrified even, but It\u2019s me I\u2019m frightened of, not you. I thought I could just pretend it wasn\u2019t there. That you would think less of me for it. Please Val this isn\u2019t easy for me when I\u2019m talking to your back. Will you hear me out? You said reaching out and turning Val over until you could see her eyes. They were red and you could see where her cheek fur was damp from recent tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Val looked like she wanted to say something, but the moment her lips parted you slid your forearm into her maw cutting her off. Don\u2019t. Look, if what I say repulses you then you\u2019re welcome to bight me for being an ass, but let me get this out. I may have been a bit scared when I realized you had changed, but I had gotten over that last night. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll understand, but with how you are now it\u2019s like nothing I have ever seen before. Val, you're not human, but you're close and well, female, you're something new and exciting and I love it and I hate myself for feeling this way.

Sitting smack-dab in the middle of the sheep enclosure was Ashleigh, that much was undeniable due to the tags hanging from her ears alone - but the fluffy ewe had been blown up to such a size that she towered over everything in sight save the barn itself, the sun situated behind her, casting a shadow that stretched over and far behind you. Not only had the rather fearless sheep somehow grown so large, but she had also visibly transformed - no longer fully sheep, she now seemed to be half human! A loud giggling noise fills the sheep enclosure, causing the collected ewes and rams to all scatter, running this way and that - and causing you to reflexively take a step back, thinking about running away yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshleigh had always been a rather fluffy ewe - one of the most productive you owned, in fact, requiring far more shearing than any other - and it seemed that she'd kept ths trait during her transformation. Her coal-black limbs and face were still exposed, but it seemed almsot as if the rest of her body had been subsumed by a mountain of pure silky fluff, the curves of her feminine body only barely visible through the obscuring wool. There were definitely features that you could see with no trouble, though - and you blush, biting your lip as your gaze falls squarely on the immense rack that the ewe possessed, each breast surely as large as her head - to say nothing of how thick her thighs were, how far her hips pushed out, how the curve of her rump was just about visible even though she was sitting in such a way that face you head-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking about her head, the ewe's face was staring directly at you, eyes sparkling - almost seeming to glow, in fact - and smiling wide, so wide that it seemed as if her face were about to snap in half. \"Ooh, hello, Master,\" the ewe says, as you take a faltering step backwards. Again, the thunderous sounds of her giggling fill the enclosure,driving the other, simpler members of her species into a panic as she heaves herself to her feet, immense curves jiggling and wobbling as she rises... and rises... and rises, blotting out the sun and casting you into shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, look at your Ashleigh, Master!\" the ewe chirps, taking a step towards you. Her cloven hoof shakes the ground on impact, knocking you onto your behind. You begin to scrabble away, but another earth-quaking step and the immense ewe's almost right over you, blown-up, over-sized breasts blocking out any view of her face. As she crouches and bends her body to look down at you, Ashleigh speaks again, moaning lowly - \"Mmm, look at how much <i>bigger</i> and <i>better</i> your Ashleigh is, Master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow thickly, still gawping at the gargantuan ewe - was this some bizarre dream or nightmare you had found yourself in? Had Ashleigh actually transformed in such a radical manner? And, more importantly, what was the overgrown sheep aboutto do?</span></div></div>",

Her head bangs against the ceiling as her feet push against the wall that hosts the doorframe, and yo struggle impotently, unable to even get a word out as she keeps on growing - there's no space left in the barn, but the ewe keeps getting bigger and bigger!</span></div></div>",

A chemical spill? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing at a time!\" he sputtered to himself before busting out the window to check on the driver. Blood trickled from the man's forehead as he dangled from his seat thanks to his seatbelt. Knowing it probably wasn't smart to move him, Markus hopped down to go check on the other truck, dialing 911 as he went. He stepped in the bizarre chemical puddle, his heart stopped for a second. What if it's radioactive? Or a corrosive acidic compound? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining his flashlight on the other truck cab, the one transporting these chemicals, Markus could see that the chances of the other driver's survival was slim.

It was coming from the chicken run not far from your house; the sound of wire fences rattling, items being toppled over and panicked clucking clearly audible. \"Those damn foxes again!\" You curse under your breath as you grab a double-barreled shotgun from the gun cabinet and stomp outside. Foxes have been a pest on your property, to say the least. No matter how hard you try to fox-proof your fences or the chicken runs they always seem to get in and cause chaos. The country life was great, but you swear you spent most of your free time dealing with the aftermath of those red canine pests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you neared the chicken run you gripped the gun harder as the sounds of distress from the hens grew louder. The foxes ignore your baits and always disappear into the surrounding forest before you can even take aim at them. Today will be different! Approaching the fortress of wire mesh that was the chicken run you're able to peer over the waist-high wooden plank reinforcements and see the culprit as chickens run to and fro around it. You saw the small, red form and instinctively went to aim your gun but you found yourself doing a double take at the canine. It looked odd. As you tried to make sense of the strange animal before you it raised its head and peered at you fearfully with bright green eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped as your eyes finally decoded what you were looking at. It was a fox that had the likeness of a human! The small, shaking fox was sitting down in the middle of the run, arms wrapped around itself for protection. Red fur adorned most of the foxes lithe form while white fur covered most of its chest, belly and throat. Its red fur bled into a dark brown fur as it reached the foxes paws, her hands taking on the dexterous form of a humans while its hind paws retained their feral appearance. You couldn't help but notice the fox looked much like a human female; large thighs, narrow shoulders and the obvious pair of breasts sitting on her chest. The creature flicked its bushy tail as it eyed your gun. \"A-are you gonna shoot me?\" She said in a soft, worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice brought you back to reality and you realized that you were still clutching onto your shotgun. \"Uh, no? I don't think so?\" You mumble as you place the shotgun against the wooden planks bordering the chicken run. \"Sorry, I though you were... Umm... Something else.\" You continue to stare dumbfounded at this new creature sitting down in front of you, even more surprised that it can speak English and communicate with you. You cough awkwardly as you open up the gate to the chicken run, letting some of the hens run free. \"So, uh, what are you exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox girl fidgets nervously at the question. \"Well I'm a fox.\" She said meekly. \"But I suddenly changed and now my body is different and I can talk like you and I got these things on my chest and uh...\" The fox looked dizzy as her emerald eyes darted down at her body. She was probably just as shocked about this situation as you are, if not more considering her sudden transformation. You couldn't help but feel sorry for the poor thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what caused it?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... No. I was just breaking in to eat some chi-\" Her eyes bolted open as she stared at you. \"Umm, I was just... Uh...Checking in on... Saying hello? Um... I was... Yeah.\" She suddenly turned her body away from you and avoided eye contact. Her face was still very canine but you could see that she was obviously embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she was probably one of the culprits that ran away with many of your hens in the past, you couldn't help but sympathize with the distressed vixen and you felt the desire to help her. \"Look, don't worry about that.\" You say as you slowly approach the fox and reach out a hand. \"Let's get you out of there and maybe we can find out what happened?\" Her eyes darted up to you and your hand before she cautiously extended her hand to yours before you help pull her up. As she dusts herself off you can't help but stare at her athletically built body. You blushed a bit as you stared down at the 4 foot tall fox girl. Despite being half-human and half-fox, you couldn't help but find her female form attractive,  it seemed her transformation went all out in sculpting her feminine features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding her petite hand, you guide her out of the chicken run and onto the fresh, green grass before you turn and talk to her again. \"To be honest I'm not sure what to do in this kind of situation.\" You explain to the fox. \"But I guess you can stay in my house until we figure something out. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time you see a small smile creep on the foxes face. \"I would like that.\" You were about to turn and lead her to your house but you saw her face suddenly contort, the fox girl pulling her hand away to clutch at her belly. \"I feel funny...\" She groaned, her ears shooting backwards as another change occurred to her body. You didn't notice it at first but you eventually realized the short fox girl in front of you was getting taller! Not just taller, it seemed like her entire body was expanding! She let out a little moan as her growth came to a stop, leaving her at least 6 inches taller. Putting her arms to her side she let out a contented sigh as her tail swished side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the slightly larger vixen you eventually find your voice. \"What was that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the transformation wasn't done? I dunno.\" She meekly said. With no other reasonable answer you leave it at that and lead her inside your dainty little house. It wasn't the biggest house, mostly everything was in the main room such as the kitchen, dinning area and recreational stuff such as an outdated TV and couch. The only other rooms were the bathroom and bedroom. She takes a few cautious steps onto the wooden floorboards as she absorbs her surroundings. \"Cool!\" She blurts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the word I would use.\" You chuckle. \"Hey, come to think of it, do you have a name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox appears to go deep in thought before she looks back up to you. \"No.\" She playfully says. \"How about you name me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. Naming things was not your expertise. \"Um.. Let's see...\" You stall as you try and find something in the room to give you inspiration. You start to feel a bit nervous as the fox watches you expectantly. You were used to naming pets things such as Socks, Fluffy or whatever cutesy name you could think of. A pet name however would be a bit strange to give to a sapient humanoid fox. Your eyes end up wondering over to a bowl of fake holly, a decoration from Christmas you never packed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Holly?\" You ask her. Holly was an actual name people used and it sounded cute to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox breaks into a grin. \"I like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Holly, feel free to make yourself at home.\" You say as you close the door behind you. Turning to face her you could see that she was rubbing her hand along the old blue couch sitting in the center of the room before her green eyes darted back up to yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, is it alright if I lay down for a bit? I want to find out why I changed but I guess I'm just kinda tired.\" She nervously chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\" Given the stressful circumstances it made sense she would be tired, especially since she might be adapting from her previous nocturnal sleep cycle as a feral fox or something. As Holly nestles up against one of the arms of the sofa you go to grab a sheepskin blanket from a nearby cupboard. Pulling the fluffy blanket over her you notice she already fell asleep. With just her head exposed from the sheepskin you took a moment to admire how cute she looked as her long ears twitched in her sleep, but then you saw her eyebrows furrow as her body shifted beneath the blanket. Again, she began to grow, her head creeping up on the arm of the sofa as she got bigger. Slowly the mass under the blanket grew, her brown paws poking out from the sheepskin. She moaned in her sleep as her growth came to a halt, leaving her at what you think is around 5 foot tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip as you pulled more of the blanket over her to compensate for her bigger frame. The fact that Holly kept growing like that made you quite nervous. You could only hope that it was just some after-effect of her transformation and that she would just get as big as an average woman but your thoughts kept drifting to the scenario where it wouldn't stop. The thought left you worried and strangely excited as you imagined Holly towering over you. For now, however, it was out of your control. You were going to ask her some more questions to help pinpoint the cause of her transformation but you guess you will have to hold out until she is done sleeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppose you could just clean up the house a little bit or something while you wait.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lazily discarded socks here, some leftover plastic wrappers there, and so on. As you focused on cleaning, you didn't notice that Holly wasn't done growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt almost looked like the blanket was instead shrinking on her as the fox's increasingly sexy body began to get bigger, and bigger... filling up the sofa as she whimpered in her slumber, moaning to the feeling of growth. You didn't notice this situation until Holly was almost as big as the couch itself. Gasping you tried to wake her. The fox's eyes shot open and she let out that all too familiar fox 'squeaky scream' as she fell off the sofa with a loud impact that rattled your house's foundation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't DO THAT!!\" she gasped, groaning as she realized where she was, slowly getting off the floor. \"You really scared-\" she said before standing to her full height, now two feet taller than you, \"me... there?\" she asked quizzically as she looked around. \"Did... did you get smaller?\" she asked placing her foxy paw on your head.<br>\r\n\"No... sweetie... you got bigger.\" you replied, poking Holly in her now impressively large bust. The fox blushed as she grabbed ahold of her breasts, amazed at not only how BIG they were now... but also... how good it felt to touch them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...

Holly continued fondling herself as her body began to expand once again, her bushy tail fluttering erratically behind her. Despite the absurdity of the situation you couldn't help but notice a tightness in your pants as you watched the vixen's womanly body dominate your view. Whether her features were being enhanced as she grew or the sheer size was making them more obvious, Holly was starting to look like a goddess made flesh. With the navel of her white belly rising above eye-level you craned your head up as you admired her flawless form, supplemented by the perfect amount of muscle and fat to accentuate the curves hidden under her soft fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Holly's growth spurt came to a halt. You looked up at her as she wrapped her arms around herself steadied her breathing. \"Th-that was a big one...\" She managed to mutter. And it was. In a short moment she had gained a whole two feet and reached a height of 10 feet. With the floorboards creaking as she adjusts herself in the increasingly claustrophobic house it was quite obvious at this point that whatever was happening to her was most likely going to keep happening. From the first moment you had met this strange humanoid fox she had been growing and now she was far taller than any average human. As the giant vixen looked around the shrunken  house and felt her brown ears brush against the ceiling you could see a mixture of emotions light up on her face. A quick smile followed by a worried frown and then back again, confusion and excitement, it was clear as day that Holly was still trying to work out what she thought about her current predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to break the silence that filled the room you spoke up. \"Are you alright, Holly?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh,\" She peeped as she locked her green eyes with yours. \"Yeah, I'm just... It just feels kinda weird. Being this big and that. Besides mice, rabbits and chickens I remember having to look up at mostly everything. It feels nice being bigger, I feel more strong and safe, but...\"<br>\r\n\"You're worried you're going to keep growing?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Like what if I get even bigger? Like really, really bigger?\" As she ended on that you could just about see her conflicting thoughts on her face as she presumably thought about the prospect of being a full-blown giantess and towering over everything. You felt your face flush red as you thought of the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to move the conservation on you try and keep her talking. \"So you said you remember when you were a regular fox?\" <br>\r\n\"Well, kinda. I'ts a bit cloudy but I guess so.\" She shrugged as she carefully sat against the couch causing a terrible groan from the woodwork underneath all the padding to bellow out.<br>\r\nYou both looked at each other as you waited for the couch to collapse, but thankfully it was holding steady. \"Can you remember anything weird that might have caused you to, uh...\" You wave your hand at her large, humanoid body as you try and formulate the words. \"-become this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen placed a brown paw up to her cheek as she seemed to go deep in thought. \"Noooo... Not really. I kind of did the same stuff every day now that I think about it. Eat and sleep.\" <br>\r\n\"Maybe you ate something strange then?\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Her fluffy ears bobbed as she tilted her head as she tried to remember. \"Well, there might be something I could have eaten.\" <br>\r\n\"What?\" You press. Holly turned her head as you saw the glimpse of a blush poke through her fur.<br>\r\n\"It's kinda gross now that I think about it,\" She began to ramble. \"But us foxes are scavengers as well as hunters so if we find something that looks like it could be eaten we'd eat it, we don't care if its <i>trash</i> or anything, saves us the effort right? But...\"<br>\r\n\"All in the past.\" You say, trying to snap her out of her tangent.<br>\r\n\"R-right... Well this tra- I mean <i>stuff</i> was a bit different to most the other stuff I would pinch. I found it yesterday, actually. It was some weird slimy liquid that tasted really good that was in some big metal container out in the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she described made memories of environmental scandal and public outrage rush back to you. The nearby forest was often brought up in TV programs and news articles in the past for being the victim of illegal dumping by shady companies and such. It seemed likely to you that the culprit of Holly's change was some strange chemical someone dumped. How some random slurry at the bottom of a barrel could cause such profound changes in an animal was beyond you but it was your most promising lead so far. Maybe if the container had a logo or something you could track down the company that made it and possibly cure Holly's growing problem? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked out the window and saw that it was getting later in the afternoon, maybe a couple of hours of daylight left. It wasn't the most ideal time to go trekking out in the forest, but the giant fox fidgeting on a couch too small for her was a testament to the urgency of the situation. You took the girl in for half a day and she has already gained twice her height and then some, it was entirely possible she could outgrow the house overnight. On the other hand you could be put in an even worse situation if you get lost out there at night, it is a pretty big forest after all. \"We might be able to find out where it came from if we found it. Maybe we should go out and look for it?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?\" She asks back. You weighed your options as you make a decision. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This wasn't that abnormal for you since you tried to get in at least a few hours of wlaking in your day every now and again. This also gave you the chance to think about things that you had heard on the news. Of course normally those thoughts wouldn't last long, but today was different. The reason for this was because it was reported on the news that a anthromorphic fox wearing attire similar to superman had been seen doing good deeds around the nearby city who was calling himself Astro Fox. This story had surprised you since you figured that such things couldn't be possible....right? Although you had to admit that the red fox did look the part of a superhero that you had seen footage or images that had been posted on the internet or had been shown on the news stations. Besides that though you also found yourself admitting to yourself that you also found the brown eyed fox attractive. From his proud smile to his heavily muscled body, you just knew that there was some sort of mystery surrounding him since his origins were completely unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as your thoughts drifted to the anthro fox you let out a sigh as you said out loud to yourself, \"If only I could meet Astro Fox. That would be pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had spoken these words though you found yourself losing your footing and then falling off of the mountain path. Knowing that this was mostly your end your tightly closed your eyes and let out a loud scream of terror as you felt the wind blew past you. Within a few seconds though you felt yourself begin to black out. But as this occurred you soon felt two heavy muscled furry arms wrap around you and pull up against an equally heavily muscled chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly reopened your eyes and took a look around your surroundings. When you did this you saw that you were no longer on the mountain path, but were in a small cabin that appeared to be surrounded by trees which meant that you were now in the forest. Before you turn to get out of the bed though you heard heavy footsteps heading your way. Along with this you heard a deep voice filled with relief speak with you as your rescuer told you, \"Oh thank goodness you're finally awake. I honestly wasn't for sure when you were going to wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this prompted you to let out a gasp as you remembered what happened up on the mountain path. But before you could say anything to the person who saved you, you found yourself blushing a deep red upon seeing a heavy muscled red fox walk into the bedroom with a glass of water in one of his hands. And upon a closer look you saw the heavily muscled fox was wearing.......</span></div></div>",

So just wait here so that you'll stay safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Konkichi. But before you go I really should tell you my name.\" You said, which had caught the buff fox's attention.

And don't worry as long as your with me you'll be safe from harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself wanting to reply to the superhero fox although you weren't able to as another knock was heard on the door.

Upon doing this you saw Astro Fox walk to the front door and opeend it before letting out a gasp of shock.

In fact they took a few steps forward until they were standing next Astro Fox who turned around as well when the heavily muscled raccoon placed a hand over his chest and said, \"Hello human, my name is Link although my superhero name is  Super Coon.\" Upon saying this you saw the gray and white furred male strike a pose which gave you a view of his superhero suit. Unlike Astro Fox's though this anthro had a yellow and red color scheme for his suit with an S and R in the middle area of his chest. He then grinned at you and bounced his pecs together as he added, \"And my super power is having super strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you saw this display you found your blushing which prompted you to look over at the heavily muscled skunk had large smirk on his with arms crossed over his large chest as he told you, \"And you can call me Gunter, but my superhero name is The Black and White Avenger.\" He then removed his arms fromin front of his pecs which gave you a view of anthro skunk's grren color super suit that had no real design on it. You quickly moved your gaze back to his face though when he went on, \"And my super power is having Laser Eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two newcomers had introduced themselves you replied, \"It's very nice to meet you both. My name is Jacob.\" You then tlited your head to the side a bit as you added, \"But why did you come to seek out Astro Fox?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we came to find him because we remember seeing him on various news reports when the two were normal animales.\" The heavily muscled raccoon explained. The anthro skunk then continued with, \"And when we saw what he was trying to do we figured we'll give being superheroes a try too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to raise your eyebrows in slight surprise before you moved your gaze back over to the heavily muscled fox when you asked, \"So what do you plan  on doing now?\" Upon asking Konkichi this you felt your face becoming warm again once you had blushed and kept o ngoing, \"Although if I'm being honest I think having more allies would be a god idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may be right, Jacob.\" Astro Fox muttered to himself as he closed his eyes and placed a hand underneath his chin.

This has been rectified and should be considered his name throughout the story.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Link and Gunther let out huge grins as Konkichi said that, looking at each other and then back to him approvingly. \"Fantastic! We're bound to accomplish more as a team than by working alone. And given that you've already saved quite a few people from what I've heard hikers and Rangers say, I think we're going to end up doing quite a lot indeed!\" Gunther smiled widely, as Link nodded enthusiastically, crossing his arms. The spandex let out a quiet squeal as he rested his bright red gloves atop the yellow spandex, which was visibly stretched across his impressive biceps. He glanced down at his own arms, marveling at just how massive they were compared to him, and Link certainly wasn't the only one to boast a stunning physique. He blinked, quickly shaking his head to dispel his thoughts. Now wasn't the time to start thinking about their bodies, impressive as they were. \"So, James, we know who Konkichi is, but we don't really know who you are. Don't suppose you'd mind if we asked you some questions about yourself?\" Link spoke up, jolting him back to the conversation at hand. \"Oh! Uh, sure thing! I'd love to ask you more about yourselves too, and you too actually!\" He smiled, gesturing to Link and Gunther and then Konkichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, where to start?\" He James mused to himself, sitting back on the bed, raising a hand to his chin. \"How you would describe yourself?\" Konkichi suggested gently, prompting him to consider how he would describe himself. \"Well, uh, I'd consider myself quite a fairly intelligent person - I'm actually in college at the moment, hoping to move on to university.\" He started. \"Ooh, university? Impressive! What are you studying?\" Link asked. James paused. Link knew what a college was. Damn, he knew that they were massively more intelligent now, that was obvious, but he knew what a university was and it was clear from his tone that he understood that not everyone goes there. How could he have gained such knowledge so quickly? It had to be what turned him into this anthropomorphic form and gave him his powers - which was a whole new topic entirely. Such powers were supposed to be the realm of fiction, yet they were real! He'd seen videos of Astro Fox flying and pictures of him performing feats of physical strength that were flat out impossible for even the most powerful humans on the planet to perform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to just put that to one side for now. Konkichi's explanation of drinking from a radioactive watering hole just didn't make sense. That would have given them radiation poisoning, not superpowers. Then there was the matter of the brightly coloured suits... No, now wasn't the time. It could wait. He was in the middle of a conversation after all.  \"Oh, I'm planning on taking Biochemistry actually. I've got to say, it's a lot of work, but I'm doing pretty well, so hopefully, I'll pass college, and then it'll be off to university for a degree!\" He smiled proudly, to which the three nodded and gave murmurs of approval. \"That's really cool, I hope it goes well!\" Gunther smiled, eliciting a chuckle from James. \"Thanks, man! So, uh, you know about my academic situation, uh, let's see. I'd also say I'm quite a... um, not reclusive, but, I'm not a social butterfly either. I tend to have few friends, but the friends I do have are generally very close friends.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them all nodded in acknowledgment, clearly understanding what he meant. \"Hopefully we'll end up as your friends!\" Konkichi chuckled warmly, prompting James to let out a soft smile. \"Well, I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm feeling pretty positive about that! I mean, you guys all seem like good people. You've all got power the likes of which no human on the planet could ever hope to have, and what do you all unanimously decide to do with it? Help people. You want to save lives and help those in need. There's really nothing more selfless you could do with powers like that, and you all have my respect because of that.\" He said, smiling softly the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonkichi, Link, and Gunther all immediately let out wide smiles at James's sincerity, even their dark furs were unable to hide their blushes. \"Oh, uh, James... Why thank you.\" Konkichi beamed. \"I, I never really considered anything else, I have to be honest when I first realised I had these powers... It was so strange, the feeling of growing and changing and getting bigger and stronger, but the strangest thing by far was definitely getting smarter. I can't even begin to describe it, the feeling of all this knowledge and understanding of things from socialisation to science. I don't even know how I suddenly knew it all, but I do. And, after that, when I'd gotten my bearings, I remember just, sort of, feeling that I could fly. Then... I tried it and I was just blown away. I quickly figured out that it was seriously helpful, and I had this thought that I could use it to help other people, not just me, and, well, it all just went from there really.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink cocked his head to the side. Having been grinning proudly the whole time, he spoke up with a look of what James could only describe as friendly pride. \"Konkichi, you're a brilliant person. You are pretty much the reason we followed you after the same thing happened to us. Obviously, we didn't have constant internet access or a TV to check the news, but that little store that sells TVs, Stereos and other stuff had a few TVs in the window always playing the news, so it didn't take us long to see all the things you'd done. I still remember that clip of you grabbing that truck with no brakes before it hit that diner. You just zipped in there out of the blue, and you grabbed it and pulled it to a stop. You saved everyone in that Diner and the driver, and you didn't even stay for a 'thanks' or anything, you just zipped off again! I mean, when we saw that, we knew that that's what we wanted to do. You know how you sometimes get those moments where everything just clicks into place? Well, that's my moment. Seeing all those people who would've... I knew I wanted to keep people safe too.\" Link smiled softly, his tail flicking behind him occasionally as he told the group his story, the room silent as he did so, save for the occasional squeaking of spandex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther let out a quiet chuckle, nodding as Link finished. \"I was in pretty much the same situation Konkichi was actually. I remember after my transformation and when I first discovered my powers... I was just utterly amazed. I still remember my first real rescue. It wasn't a major catastrophe or anything, it was a truck crash. A tire had blown out and the truck had jack-knifed until it hit a tree. The door that wasn't blocked by the tree was jammed shut, and then I heard... a gushing roar is the best way to describe it I guess. The oil line had gotten all cut up and it had caught fire. I still remember the smoke, the noise, the heat... but I couldn't stand there in the shadows and leave a man to die, not when I could have done something to save him. So I remember running up there as fast as I could and didn't want to pull the door open in case I pulled the fuel tank into the fire or something, so I yelled at him to back up. His face was just, completely shocked, he clearly couldn't believe that this huge, walking, talking Skunk had run out of the forest to save him. Then, I remember focusing on the door so intently, and then this... beam, of sorts, just came out of my eyes. It wasn't massively obvious from far away or anything, but it was clearly there. It was... well, you know, energy. I think Lasers are light, if I remember correctly, I'd need to think of where I heard that, but it was amazing to see! The door had this sort of line carve into it, and then it got deeper and deeper and then I started moving my head around so I could make a square. It wasn't easy, let me tell you, I was scared I'd hurt the driver! I managed to cut open a square and called for him to crawl through and he crawled through until I could get my arms around him and pull him out and away to safety. The look of awe, shock, and gratitude in his eyes was more than enough reward for me. Heh, he asked for my name and if he could take a picture before he called 911 so that people would actually believe him. I ran off as he was making the call. After that, I never looked back. His name was, Rob. Rob Tucker. He'd told me about the news stories, and from there, I did the same thing as Link. Looked at the news, and I tried to puzzle out how I was going to ask him to meet me, although I didn't even need to, since he tracked my scent in the forest and found me, and we've been working together ever since!\" He smiled widely and proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sat back on the bed, blowing out a deep breath. \"Damn, that's incredible. Do you mind telling me more about your rescues and adventures?\" He asked, to which the trio all gave enthusiastic replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, sure thing! No problem!\" Came the combined responses, eliciting a smile from James. \"Sweet, thanks, guys.\" He grinned.</span></div></div>",

And upon doing so you and the three anthro superheroes heard this on the other end of it as it said, \"<i>Breaking news this afternoon as a report of a bank robbery was quickly to a stop by an anthromorphic otter in a yellow and black spandex attire. However, when we tried to interview this interesting looking hero he just nodded and ran off at lightening speed. However, civilians believe that this walking and talking animal is by means a threat at all. In fact most of those people were calling him a hero. So it would appear that the anthromorphic fox, skunk, and raccoon aren't the only superheroes in town</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, did you guys hear that?\" Link asked, with clear excitement in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that is good to know that there's someone else out there who wants to keep people safe.\" Konkichi replied, while Gunter nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted an idea to come to you when you suggested, \"Hey you guys, why don't we go look for this anthro otter? Maybe we can talk to him and convince him to join you guys. This way you'll be an even four which would make dealing with more difficult threats that much easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had suggested this though you saw the three heavily muscled anthros close their eyes and think of your suggestion. However, after a few minutes had passed you saw the anthro fox reopen his eyes and look over at you when he replied, \"You know that's a great idea, James. Don't you think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think it could work.\" The buff skunk commented, while he looked over at you witha  big smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wow, so you're not only cute, but you're smart too eh, James? Nice, I like it!\" Link told you, followed by winking over in your direction which caused you to blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that we're all in agreement on this where do you think we should look for this otter?\" Astro Fox pondered, as the four of you walked out of the bedroom and then out of the cabin completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once you had gotten outside you once again suggested, \"Well why don't we try looking for him by a stream or river. I mean otters love water right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you saw the three anthros nod their heads in agreement before Astro Fox led the way while you walked behind him and Gunter and Link walked on either side of you. You weren't sure why they were doing this, but for some reason you didn't mind since it made you feel safe. And within about ten minutes of walking the four of you made it to a pretty large river. However, upon reaching said river......</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Letting out a sigh you tentatively peer over the edge of the cliff, making sure to keep as far from the edge as you could while still being able to see into the river. Scanning the length of the river revealed nothing. Similarly, careful observation of the riverbanks revealed no sign of a humanoid otter and no sign that anything had even passed through there recently at all, let alone anything traveling at what could only be called superhuman speeds. You pursed your lips as you furrowed your brow before your attention was caught by your phone. Swiftly pulling it from your pocket, you noted the pop-up that had appeared. It was a news headline. 'Authorities Admit Existence of 'Humanoid Animals with Abnormal Capabilities.' Intrigued, you slide your thumb over the pop-up and read the article. Apparently, there was now so much evidence - videos, pictures, eyewitness accounts, and, most importantly, the fact that this Otter had been caught live on the News - that the authorities were now looking into what was going on. Apparently, the FBI was dispatching a team to look into all of this, but they were not even considering charging them - they hadn't done anything wrong, on the contrary, they wanted to find them to figure out how they were doing all of this. To hear that they weren't at risk of arrest was a great relief, although government involvement was still somewhat worrying. Hopefully, everything would turn out okay. A man could hope, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding the phone back into your pocket, you lean back, drawing away from the edge carefully. No sign of anything or anyone here. You turn and step back to the little trail, continuing on your path down the side of the river. As you continue to walk, the sound of wind resistance hit your ears. Looking up, you spot Konkichi flying above you all, putting his ability to fly to good use. You wave up at him, briefly unsure if he can see you while he's so focused but after a moment, he spots you and waves back, prompting you to smile brightly. It still felt sort of... weird, to be looking for a walking, talking otter with superpowers, alongside a trio of walking, talking animals with superpowers.  Despite having had your very life saved by one of them, it still felt... unreal. You knew they were real but it still felt like you had walked into a comic book or something. Walking, talking animals would have been incredible enough, but superpowers too? No wonder so many people had been so skeptical when the reports first came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a hand through your hair, you keep walking as Konkichi flies off, following the river. Still no sign of the otter yet, and you'd rather not wait until another emergency cropped up. Bank robberies were already uncommon enough, after all, so you didn't want to end up having to try and track down this otter at the scene of, say, a multi-car pileup. That would not be fun, to put it very mildly. You are pulled from your musings by the rustling of leaves and branches. Turning your gaze you see a flash of bright yellow through the trees before Link's massive form pushed through with casual ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge raccoon nodded and raised a hand in greeting. \"Hey, James. I'm guessing you haven't seen any signs either right?\" He asked, to which you could only shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no sign of him yet. I'm sticking to the river, so's Konkichi. Well, he's flying, but you know what I mean.\" You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nods in understanding. \"Ah, I gotcha. Don't take too many risks now, leave the dangerous stuff to us big guys! We can... well, I've never actually experienced it, and I've never really been in any situation where I actually ended up injured, but we're all so much bigger than you that I'd wager we've got a better chance of surviving a fall than you do!\" He warned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. Don't worry, I'll be sure to take care. I've already fallen down a cliff once, I really, really don't plan on falling down another one! I only survived that one unscathed thanks to Konkichi. If he hadn't been there, I'd be dead.\" He admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink raised his eyebrows, staying silent for a moment before continuing. \"Damn. Well, I'm glad you got out of that okay! Anyway, I should get moving, if this guy's around here, I don't wanna miss him.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, finding him might let us find out what happened to him, might give us a clue as to what caused all of this.\" You noted, before bidding Link your farewells and moving on, continuing on your search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you kept moving, your mind wandered back to the that breaking news article about the FBI getting involved, a wave of anxiety washing over you again. It had only been a single day since you had met Konkichi yourself, and before then you hadn't even known about the existence of Link and Gunther, even though they had both apparently been working for some time by now. Perhaps the news had been so focused on Astro Fox, debating whether he was real and going over the realities of the whole situation, that they simply hadn't been able to get any news stories out by then. It did make a bit more sense, they used a lot of photos and videos in the segments about Astro Fox, but few if any of the others. Konkichi was just a bit more photogenic than the others maybe. You felt a thrill go through you as you thought back to those pictures and videos. Seeing him lifting a Garbage Truck one-handed with such ease had taken your breath away; the video of him flying in and saving that jumper and then staying with him until the paramedics could take him away had really left a very positive impression on you and many others who had seen that video and that photo of him with a steel I-Beam bent into a circle in his paws had left you with your jaw open. Such incredible power that simply shouldn't have been possible. Then you found out there were more of them, Link had strength that was even greater than Konkichi's, and Gunther could literally fire super-powerful, ultra-hot lasers from his eyes which just shouldn't be remotely possible, yet he could do it with no form of ill effect. You could hardly blame the authorities for wanting to find out how this could be possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the clearing, you let out an 'Ah!' as you see that it sports a cliff face, and carefully moving up to the cliff edge shows that it looks over the river. The cliff turns fairly sharply, not an exact 90 degrees but fairly close. Perhaps you might be able to spot this otter here? It's worth a try. You very carefully move closer to the edge, before you jump back as a rock breaks off and slides loose. Deciding to err on the side of caution, you stand with one foot on the cliff, and one foot further back peering over, scanning the river. On your side, all there is is a sheer cliff, but on the other side, there is a fairly flat riverbank. Looking to your right, you can see the cliff begins to slope down, slowly descending to the same elevation as the riverbank on the other side. That would be a good place to look after here. Safer too. You turn back to the river, looking carefully. There's no sign of yellow or black spandex, and you're fairly confident that such a colour scheme would show up against the greens, browns, and reds of the environment quite clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a sigh of frustration, you move back. However, it's at this point that the rocks under your feet give way. You let out a gasp as you feel the disorienting sensation of falling, throwing yourself back to avoid falling, however by this point, it's too late. Stunned by the suddenness of it all, by the time you can react, it's already too late to do anything. A scream bursts from your throat for a moment before the breath is forced from your lungs as you slam into the cliff. Through the pain, you hope your back isn't broken. However, you can't dwell on that fear for long, as you continue to slide down the cliff, feeling sharp stone scrape your face and graze your palms as you curl in on yourself as best you can to protect your head and neck. You cry out in pain as you continue your descent before the air is knocked from your lungs by a rush of searing cold. You're in the river. You cough, instinctively thrashing before you force yourself to try and lie on your back and float, knowing that if you struggle, you'll drown. However, the river is deceptively fast. It looks so still from up top, but as you're thrown about, you cough and splutter as you try to float, but the cold saps the strength from your body. A wave of despair hits you as you realise that you had been spared from death earlier from falling, by a real-life superhero, and now you were going to drown in a freezing river. You'd been so damn careful too, it's not fair! A wave splashes you in the face, disorienting you further. You can't see anything or hear anything except the rushing water. You have no idea if any help is coming or if anyone even knows you're in trouble. You're not drowning. Yet. But if you can't get out soon, you will.</span></div></div>",

You then saw him get down onto his knee to which he then removed your shirt and started to treat your various injuries.

However, there was also someone calling your name - the voice was deep and powerful, but it also held a warmth to it beneath the panicked tone. Your thoughts convalesced and you realised who it must have been. \"Konkichi!\" You called back, beginning to lean up before hissing as a flash of pain struck at your spine. For a moment you panicked, fearful that you had sustained a devastating, life-altering injury before Denver placed a huge paw on your shoulder, giving a reassuring squeeze. \"Hey now, don't push yourself. You've just fallen down a cliff into a river. You need to rest.\" He says gently before his eyes widen slightly. \"I shouldn't have put your shirt back on, hypothermia!\" He gasped, quickly removing your shirt again. \"Don't worry, you'll be fine, as best as I can tell, you have no fractures, although I'll admit, the near-drowning is concerning. Maybe you should go to the hospital.\" He suggested, frowning anxiously. His argument held merit.

It's the least I could do, I could hardly stand by while someone needs help, especially when I have the ability and tools to help.\" He explained, gesturing to the medical supplies - mostly bandages, sutures and what looked like a small drug box. \"Yeah, you've got a lot of tools here, where'd you get 'em?\" He asked, to which Denver smiled. \"I'll explain later. You must be Konkichi. Or, is it Astro Fox?\" He asked. \"Either or. Konkichi is my... 'civilian' name, I suppose. I got if after... ah, that's for later. Astro Fox is my superhero name. I guess know who I am, like everyone else.\" He muttered, to which Denver nodded. \"Yes, I heard a couple of other voices there. I'm Denver, and my alias is Lightening Lutidine. It's from my power - physics defying speed, and my species.\" He explained at his furrowed brow. \"I've wondered how this is possible since my transformation. That should be impossible, even the fact that I know that should be impossible, yet it is very much true.\" He mused, as he slid the now wetter blanket under your back gently. \"It's not perfect, but it's better than the wet ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded up at him as he turned back to the supplies, muttering to himself about his powers again, too softly for you to make out. As he turned back around, you were able to catch the end of the otter's musings. \"Ah, never mind. That's for later.\" He shook his head dismissively, reaching over with a fluffy, bright orange blanket with 'RESCUE' emblazoned in bold black lettering. As you and Konkichi noted this, he tilted his head curiously. \"How did you manage to get your hands on all of this?\" He asked, gesturing to the pile of supplies, to which Denver smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, I encountered a local forest ranger who was more than happy to donate some supplies when I told him what my goals are. He mentioned something about how I must be another one of those 'superheroes' and that if I could get to people much faster than any police officer then they'd be of greater use in my hands. I don't know if that was entirely legal, but I appreciated the gesture very much.\" He explained, as he began to dry off your chest vigorously, which drew a hiss from you. \"Sorry!\" Denver yelped. \"I'm, I'm just a bit... I'm not terribly experienced yet.\" He apologised, to which you shrugged it off. \"I'm just grateful you're helping when I need it most.\" You smiled to which he returned the favour. \"It's what I aim to do.\" He said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as though he was making to say something else, but before he could, a loud rustling sounded out from the nearby foliage. You tried to prop yourself up on your elbows, grimacing with a hiss of pain as your body hurt all over in a violent stab of pain. \"Lie down, don't move.\" Denver's soothing voice sounded out, which was quickly overshadowed by the much louder crashing of leaves and branches and the cries of Link and Gunther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James!\" Came the calls, before their enormous frames loomed over you, blotting out your vision of the sky, replacing it with brightly coloured spandex and animal heads. \"James! Are you okay?\" Link asked frantically. Shards of wood were caught in his fur, as if he'd simply charged straight through trees to reach you, which you couldn't help but lose yourself in the thought of that. The image of Link's huge, powerful frame smashing through trees effortlessly was... impressive, to say the least. \"I'm fine.\" You assure him, as Denver gently pulls you up slightly, placing the other towel under your back and wrapping it over your chest, removing that uncomfortable damp cold from your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them let out a huge sigh of relief, their shoulders dropping as they relaxed. \"Oh, that's so great to hear! I was so worried when I heard you scream, after you'd gone and mentioned being careful too!\" Link sighed, rubbing a hand over his muzzle. Gunther nodded in agreement. \"I'm so glad you're okay.\" He smiled softly, to which you nodded to Denver. \"Well, thank Denver here. If it wasn't for him, I'd...\" You trailed off, grimacing at the idea of drowning. You shivered at the thought of dying in such a way. You tried to push it to the side - you could deal with the stress once you were somewhere warm and safe. They turned to Denver, Gunther reaching forward and clasping a huge paw around his shoulder. \"Thank you. Thank you so much.\" He said, to which Denver smiled modestly. \"Oh, no, it was nothing, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saved my life! I mean, yeah, I get that you don't really think of jumping in to help people as anything above and beyond, I get that you don't think of it as anything more than something you should do just because it's the right thing to do, but at the end of the day, you saved my life! Thank you. If it wasn't for you... I'd be dead. If it wasn't for Astro Fox, for that matter, I'd already be dead.\" You spoke up, pausing as you recalled that harrowing fall. \"I'd be dead.\" You murmured. \"I, I don't think I really said it properly when you saved me, but thank you Astro Fox, thank you Konkichi. Thank you for saving my life, thank you. The same to you too Denver, thank you. Thank you so much, you're literally heroes, even without getting into the 'super' aspect.\" You said, having pushed yourself onto your elbows, ignoring the slight ache in your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Konkichi and Denver - Astro Fox and Lightning Lutidine - were silent, staring back at you with stunned expressions. \"Oh. I... I hadn't... I hadn't thought about it like that...\" Konkichi mused softly as Denver frowned, bringing a hand up to support the underside of his muzzle. \"Yes, I... it had never, the thought had never really occurred to me. Rather, it had in that I knew that I wanted to help people from the very moment I became like this and discovered my power. As soon as I saw that robbery, I immediately rushed in to stop them because I couldn't bare the thought of them escaping justice for what they did. I knew that they were going to face justice for what they did if I made sure they could be arrested without putting anyone in danger. I knew I was going to directly impact people's lives by doing things like that. But, I'd never really... consciously thought about actually saving lives specifically, it was always just about helping people. I'd never really thought about it like that.\" He said, his voice quiet, gentle, as if he was in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bank was silent for several minutes, the stillness broken only by the rushing of the river. Finally, Konkichi broke the silence, with a quiet suggestion. \"Well... um, perhaps we should get you back to my cabin, James?\" He proposed, turning to Denver. \"You're more than welcome to join us Denver, I don't exactly have space for five people to sleep there, but we can always take turns.\" He half-joked, giving a lopsided grin. Denver was quiet for a moment, clearly registering his offer before smiling warmly. \"That's very kind of you, thank you.\" Came the grateful answer. \"Where is it?\" He asked, to which Konkichi frowned. \"Well, I'd show you, but we need to get James back there quickly; he's still in wet clothes.\" He explained, pausing as he shifted, rubbing the underside of his muzzle with a paw. \"We can show him the way, we tracked you down by scent, finding you is easy.\" Link suggested, to which Denver nodded. \"That sounds like an excellent idea.\" He offered, to which Konkichi smiled. \"Brilliant.\" He reached down, scooping you up in his thick, muscular arms, the spandex covering his muscular chest cool against your cheek, drawing a shiver from you. Denver snatched up your shirt and handed it to you; the fabric was still soaking wet. \"Here, you can dry that off at the cabin.\" He noted, to which you nodded in thanks. You let a quiet gasp as Konkichi began to levitate, his powerful frame floating above the ground, preparing to take off for the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Denver gathered up the remainder of his medical supplies, and the wet blanket that you had been laying on before being wrapped in the dry, and far warmer one, Konkichi smiled down at the group. \"I'll see you guys at the cabin then. I'm sure you'll find your way back just fine!\" He assured Link and Gunther. \"Yeah, if anything, he'll need to slow down, given he's the fast one!\" Link chuckled. \"Fantastic! I'll see you all at the cabin!\" He smiled.</span></div></div>",

And once you saw that you both above the trees he then started to fly off while Link, Gunther, and Denver ran on the ground. Or at least the heavily muscled raccoon and skunk were doing since you only saw the heavily muscled otter for a second before he was gone in a flash. Though you soon realized that this was the same for both you and Konkichi were flying off in the air at pretty much a fast pace like Denver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you soon realized that it wasn't as fast as the otter since once Astro Fox had landed and you got used to seeing standing still instead of lying past your face at a very fast speed you saw the otter walk out of the cabin while he commented, \"Wow, for a abandoned cabin it's in pretty good shape.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is. And wow, you are fast aren't you?\" The heavily muscled fox remarked, while he slowly and gently set up back onto your own two feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon doing this you started to walk away from the two spandex wearing anthros guys while you said, \"Thanks Konkichi, though now I'd best go dry off my clothes completely now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you should be able to since I saw a washer and dryer in one of the backrooms in there.\" Denver pointed out, to which you nodded your head in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you did this you then headed inside and proceeded to dry off all of your clothes and have the twoel around your wasit until they were done in the dryer. And after the cycle was done you then got your clothes back on. But while you did this you knew that you'd need new clothes at some point. But with Denver's super speed you figured that you could just ask him to run back to you replace and get you some more of your clothes for you. Though you'd most likely have to go with him since you had your key which you knew Astro Fox had on the nightstand next ot eh bed he had put you on after he had saved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this matter you figured you could bring up to the four anthros at another time. Besides you put these thoughts out of your mind when you saw both Link and Gunther arrive at the cabin. In fact the four anthros seemed to be chatting with one another.

You twist around to look at him to see that he's dropped to his knees, panting heavily. The idea of running for it briefly crosses your mind but then the wolf is crouched next to him, evidently focused on him but clearly poised to go for you should you make an escape attempt. Besides, you're lost in the middle of the forest; running around blindly won't get you anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burke! Burke, what's wrong?\" The wolf gasps, placing a hand on the bear's huge shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm burning up!\" Burke cried between ragged gasps as his fur began to mat with sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf's jaws parted as he made to speak, but what came out was a strangled whine of shock as he also collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke!\" Burke gasped before letting out another groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh, I'm burning up as well!\" The wolf whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of a sudden, the two began to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only stare in shock as Burke and Luke moan and whine as their bodies expand in a smooth, steady surge of growth, both of their already impressive musculatures becoming significantly more defined against the tightening spandex of their black suits, which you still wonder how they acquired, as they let out a series of high-pitched rubbery squeaks and squeals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're rooted to the spot as you watch the duo's growth spurt trail off, leaving the two of them hunched over, panting deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke is the first to rise, gingerly getting to his feet, rising up to his new height of 6'9\", towering over you, as he runs his hands over his new body, the now skin-tight spandex squealing loudly against his intimidating musculature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurke follows a moment later, heaving his massive frame into a standing position, standing at a solid 7 feet. He looks over his new frame in awe, flexing his massive arms, watching as the spandex cries in protest against the solid muscle. He looks up, a huge grin plastered across his face as he notices you're still lying there, frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, look at that Luke, the little guy's actually got some sense. Didn't even try to run.\" He smirks as he bends down and picks you up with just one hand, drawing a gasp from you as he hefts you over his shoulder as he takes off running again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we need to get back to the hideout before that Fox tracks us down!\" He yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair dashes off at breath-taking speed, the forest rushing by for what seems like forever before they abruptly stop in front of a small cave. The first thing that catches your eye is the small satellite dish sitting outside, connected to what seems to be some sort of generator, although it looks as if it works more by manual labor if the lever and what you think are batteries are any sort of clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luke and Burke move forward, you notice that Burke's head is only a few inches from the top of the entrance. You hope it's not going to be too cramped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurke puts you down and pushes you forward, not so rough that you'll fall, but firmly enough that you get the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you step inside and your eyes adjust to the darkness, you're surprised to find a pair of beds, constructed out of branches and moss, a small sofa, table, and TV that look like they've been scavenged from a dump - although to their credit, if that were the case, they certainly don't smell like it - and the remnants of a small firepit near the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice little place you've got here.\" You mumble out, unable to stop yourself before you realize that you've said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, much to your surprise, neither Luke nor Burke snap, growl or threaten you, the only response is a simple chuckle of \"Thanks\" from Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou edge towards the sofa, reading both of their reactions, seeing if they don't want you to do so. However, at a curt nod from Luke, you sit down on the sofa, waiting for one of them to say something. Sure enough, Burke sits down next to you, looking you dead in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what's your name?\" He asks as he sits, the sofa groaning loudly in protest as it sags under his huge weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, J-James.\" You stammer out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hm. Alright, James, tell me, what do you know about Astro Fox?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, he used to be a normal fox called Konkichi who can now fly and is strong enough to lift a garbage truck over his head single-handed after he drank from some pool that was apparently radioactive although that doesn't make sense as to how he has superpowers though because radiation exposure won't give you superpowers, it'll give you cancer if anything.\" You suddenly gasp out in a single breath, panicked at the thought of what they might do if you refuse to cooperate, before you clam up, realizing that you've just revealed a lot of information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurke simply stares at you, cooly. \"Hmm, well isn't that interesting. Luke and I just so happened to drink out of a pool before this happened. A pool that had some barrels next to it, as well as a box of these suits. Isn't that just fascinating?\" He says, a small smile appearing across his muzzle as he turns to face Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke grins, his ears flicking as he runs a paw along the underside of his muzzle. \"Why yes, it is. And, while most of those barrels had symbols that we now know are radiation warnings, a handful of them did not, and if I remember correctly, they were leaking a strange, grey substance - 'Nanites' is all I remember apart from the safety warnings, although I don't know what it was; perhaps, combined with the radiation, that's the source of our transformations? And, why we suddenly grew back there, perhaps.\" He muses, looking down at the end, clearly thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, so, is that what you wanted? Information on Astro Fox?\" You tentatively ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurke turns back to you, grinning before he lets out a deep, thunderous laugh. \"Partially. You're not just a great source of info James, you're going to be our bargaining chip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel your stomach drop at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you see, we've come up with a plan, and we'll happily tell you what it is! After all, what are you going to do about it, huh? Even if you were to tell Astro Fox himself, what could he do about it? He has no official authority, and many people aren't even sure if he actually exists, let alone those in power!\" Luke laughs, stalking over, bracing himself against the back of the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-but, but people would surely listen if he...\" You start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! Don't be ridiculous, people don't listen to experts if they don't want to hear it, they'll never listen to him!\" Burke snorted derisively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially if it involves money, which is where our plan comes into play! By the time we're done, all major polluting industries are going to change how they do things, or by they won't be doing anything at all.\" Luke grins, tail flicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your head in your hands, quietly despairing over their plans. Pollution was a serious issue, no doubt about it, but two huge, superpowered anthropomorphic animals taking action against it, whatever the cost? The thought made your stomach turn in anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back to when they suddenly grew as well and your anxiety only heightens at the thought that they might not be done. What would Konkichi do? How would he stop them at his size, powerful as he might be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're pulled from your musings by Luke grabbing you by the shoulder and looking down at you with a look that makes a chill slither up your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now James, you'll be staying right here for the time being, so I suggest you get comfortable until Astro Fox inevitably shows up to save you, the hero he is.\" He says, staring you dead in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only nod, eyes wide in fear as you swallow thickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lets you go and you sit back, sighing as you run a hand over your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only hope Konkichi gets here soon.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully both of the black spandex suited anthros had stopped paying much attention to you after a few more minutes of sitting on the couch next to you. During that time though you did notice taht both of them seemed to be flexing various muscles on their body before they got back to whatever it was that they were working on. However, although the wolf Luke seemed to be completely focused on their work and only made eye contact with you every so often. Burke te bear seemed to be acting a bit odd, that being that he had not only been sitting a bit close to you on the couch, but he also seemed to be flexing his muscles quite a bit more often then Luke did. In fact whenever the gray furred wolf was looking you would see the heavily muscled brown furred bear look over at you before he would wink at you and flex an arm or puff out his chest for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with such a large tooth filled grin plastered on his face you figured that you couldn't trust either of the anthros. However, maybe if you played your cards right, you could maybe convince at least one of them to change their ways. And since the bear seemed to be interested in you in some way perhaps he would be the easiest to try this out on. Although you decided to keep this plan to yourself since you were still holding out hope that Astro Fox was going to show up and get you away from these two before the day came to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue however, you saw a lone figure land in front of the entrance to cave. And you knew instantly that it Astro Fox had finally arrived. Sadly it seemed that the two anthro villains knew this as well since they ran in front of you within a second. You then heard the anthro fox walk into the cave while he said, \"Alright you two scoundrels, let James go this instant!\" You then got a better look at him to which you realized that he must have grown in height just like Luke and Burke had earlier. Once he was a few feet away from them you saw his eyebrows narrow as he continued with, \"Wait, Luke, Burke? So it was you two who attacked me. I thought as much when I noticed how familiar your guys scents were. Although I'm surprised you two would want to kidnap someone considering you mostly kept to yourselves. This especially I am surprised you do this Burke, considering that some people would leave food for you every now and again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Shut up, Konkichi!\" The brown furred bear snapped, although you could tell by the sound in his voice that he was flustered by the fox's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that had been said though you the fox give the two a serious look before he warned, \"However, if you two hurt him in any way, I swear that you'll regret doing so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his warning however you heard the heavily muscled bear let out a loud laugh after he had calmed down from the early comment and replied, \"Tch, take it easy there, Astro Fox. We haven't hurt the little guy at all. In fact he was quite helpful when it came to giving us certain information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" The orange and white furred fox let out, to which then you saw him look over at you. You then saw him give you a reassuring smile before he added, \"Don't worry though James, I'll give guys what for and then I'll get you out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, good luck with that fox! Because I'm going to enjoy beating the snot out of you!\" Luke snapped, as he charged towards the white and blue spandex wearing anthro hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this caused you to let out a gasp of shock and slight worry as you weren't expecting the three to start a fight inside of the cave. However, you couldn't help but get the feeling that something was going to happen. The only problem was that you had no idea what that \"something\" was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You let out a quiet exclamation of concern as the huge wolf lunged towards Astro Fox, his spandex suit creaking under the exertion it had been placed under as his muscles flexed and tensed under the rapid charge. You stumbled back, smacking into the couch. Letting out a hiss of slight pain, you winced as Luke and Astro Fox crashed into each other. Seeing that Luke was charging at him, clearly going to tackle him to the ground, Astro Fox had obviously prepared himself, bracing himself to counter the big wolf's inertia. The resulting impact was less comparable to a car crash, and more like something comparable to a freight train slamming into a car at full speed, except the car didn't move. Astro Fox had let out a growl of exertion to keep his place, almost falling backward as Luke dropped to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luke was in the middle of pushing himself back up, Astro Fox didn't conform to simply standing by and letting him get back up. Instead, he drew his foot back, and with a particularly brutal kick, drove his foot straight into the wolf's snout. A sharp yelp resounded through the cave as Luke collapsed to the rough floor, clutching his muzzle. You couldn't tell if it was broken - you couldn't see any blood, even though the wolf's paws, and given how they were all so much bigger and stronger than any human could ever possibly be, it wasn't too outlandish to think that they might be a lot tougher and resilient to go along with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Astro Fox, it wasn't a simple one-on-one fight. Both him and you virtually leapt out of your skins at the enraged bellowing roar that blasted your eardrums. You staggered away, turning to see Burke's face contorted in a furious, snarling rage with his tremendous bulk barrelling down on Astro Fox with all the force he could muster, and given that he was a Grizzly Bear clocking in at a solid seven feet tall and a weight of what had to be at least 500lbs, you couldn't even begin to imagine how much force Burke could charge someone with, and how much damage that could do to a person. It must be like getting run over by a pickup truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite the fact that bears could run at ridiculously high speeds for their size - which could only be even faster for Burke, with how much bigger he was, Astro Fox had one major advantage against Burke's charge. He could fly. Which is exactly what he did. By the time Burke had made it halfway to him, he'd risen a foot off the ground and dashed to the side. To his credit, Burke didn't simply keep going, like how attackers in video games usually did, but rather slid to a halt as soon as he saw Astro Fox dart to the side, ruining the attack. However, Burke's greater size meant that he had to come to a halt, instead of stopping instantly. The Law of Conservation of Momentum in action. Astro Fox had evidently planned for this, given how he promptly delivered a fierce kick to the back of the bear's leg. Burke crumpled to the ground, his great bulk crashing to his paws, with a pained grunt, before Astro Fox delivered a powerful blow to the rear of his head, knocking him down again. You noted how he'd used the base of his palm, rather than his knuckles. You furrowed your brow as you wondered where Astro Fox would have learned proper fighting maneuvers. However, you didn't have long to think about it, as you leapt behind the couch as Luke charged at Astro Fox again, this time, catching him off guard and knocking him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud squeaking and squealing of spandex sounded out through the cave as the wolf smashed into the fox with all of his strength, sending the pair falling to the ground. However, given that he could fly, Astro Fox quickly began to fly, floating above the ground before righting himself. Unfortunately for him, Luke promptly did the sensible thing and wrapped his beefy arms around Astro Fox's broad shoulders, attempting to wrestle the Fox back down to the ground. You were sure that if the two were both still normal animals, this tactic would have worked perfectly. Well, allowing for the move in the first place. You shook your head, the metaphor wasn't working as well as you'd thought it would. However, given that the pair were pretty much evenly matched in height, weight, and muscle mass, Astro Fox had the obvious advantage, which he quickly put to use, flying in a loop in an impressive display of agility, given the cramped cave you were in - the move was so tight it was almost as if he'd done a cartwheel rather than a flying loop. As he came out of the loop, Luke crashed down in a heap on the ground, groaning as he brought a paw to his muzzle, looking as if he was struggling not to vomit or pass out. It seemed that despite the incredible changes that their bodies had gone through, their brains, while no doubt dramatically altered as well, clearly still worked in the same ways in many regards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luke laid sprawled out on the ground, holding his muzzle and his stomach, Burke let out a thunderous growl, a growl powerful enough to shake the ground where you were standing behind the couch. You tensed up, fearing that the huge bear was about to charge at Astro Fox again, however, Burke had evidently learned from his previous attempt, and simply stood his ground, shifting into a fighting stance. You suddenly realised what his plan was. If he didn't move, Astro Fox would have no choice but to come to him, and since he was standing in front of the entrance to the cave, even if he turned and grabbed you, he wouldn't be able to get out without ending up fighting him. It was surprisingly brilliant, and as you looked towards Astro Fox, it was clear from his face that he had also figured it out too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstro Fox rose up, coming to float about a foot off the ground, his ears nearly brushing the ceiling. With a sudden burst of speed, so much so that it kicked up a breeze that ruffled your clothes, he charged forth, leaning back so that his feet were pointed straight at Burke's thick, muscular chest. The bear promptly braced himself in return, then shoving the great bulk of his mighty frame forwards so that his pectorals slammed into Astro Fox's feet. The sudden, powerful force sent him crashing backward, although the hero was able to right himself before he ended up in a heap sprawled across the floor. Much to your silent awe, he quickly leapt back up into a standing position in a display of gymnastic flexibility so impressive that it made your own stomach muscles clench. However, before he could charge forth again, Burke's face contorted in a grimace as he fell to his hands and knees, his huge bulk crashing down as he let out a thunderous growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped at the snarl that came from Luke, who had rolled onto his back, whining loudly in what sounded like pain, or at the very least, discomfort. The wolf's jaws parted as he croaked out weakly. \"Ah! Ah-ah, ah argh! I'm...\" He cried out, breaking out in heavy panting, as Burke began to pant deeply, collapsing onto his mighty chest as he let out a cry. \"Ah! I'm roasting!\" He yelped, as the pair continued to writhe and moan. You simply stood there, too startled to move, unsure of what had suddenly overtaken the two. Glancing over at Astro Fox, you could clearly see the concern on his face, his expression lined with worry. He made to step forward, probably to reassure them in some way, despite their prior aggression. You were struck by his actions for a moment, before you were both startled by a sudden creaking, groaning noise that filled the cave as the two continued to growl deeply. Your eyes widened as you realised what the source of the sound was. Luke and Burke were growing again. Suddenly, their pained cries made perfect sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurke reached a beefy paw forward, his huge claws digging into the rock, carving deep gouges through the material as he began to sweat profusely. You couldn't help but wonder if the 'nanites' Burke had mentioned were actually real. If they were causing their growth, then their activity certainly could explain their sudden spikes in temperature. All those reactions must have generated an incredible amount of heat. However, you had only a few moments to consider that, as both of them began to clearly grow, their bodies swelling with muscle as their skeletons lengthened and strengthened. Their suits continued to squeak and squeal in desperate protest as the spandex was pushed closer and closer to its limits with every passing second. The spandex was stretched tighter and tighter around their incredible musculatures, growing even more so as they grew bigger and bigger, both of their chests swelling outwards as their abdominal muscles carved deeper trenches in the fabric while their biceps bulged outwards and their calves engorged to the point where they looked as though they might actually rival their namesake in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Astro Fox both stare in awe as you watch the pair let out loud, deep gasps as their growth spurt comes to an end, leaving the pair of them sprawled across the ground. You turn to see Luke be the first to rise, his huge, sweaty frame hauls itself up by his thick, muscular arms that latch onto the side of the cave, his claws carving great gashes into the stone with effortless ease. You swallow thickly as you note just how little effort it had taken the big wolf to haul his mighty frame to his feet, even after what had to be an exhausting situation. You glance over at Astro Fox, who looks like he's trying to figure out a move, before your attention, and Astro Fox's is drawn to Burke, who is slowly and tentatively pushing his massive, powerful frame up off the ground, growling in exertion as he does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two stagger to their feet uneasily, Astro Fox darts over to you and grabs you by the waist, wrapping his powerful arms around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on James, I'll get you out of here!\" He gasps, evidently taking the opportunity while he still has it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Astro Fox promptly lifts off the ground, carrying you with him, making a dash for the exit before the pair can react. Unfortunately, while neither of them has fully regained fine motor control, they are still able to move their bodies, which is exactly what they do. Straight into the middle of the cave, leaving small gaps at the side. However, you can tell that there is simply no way that both of you will have any sort of chance of making it through those gaps without leaving you with severe lacerations and possibly a concussion. You let out a gasp as Astro Fox turns so that he will collide with the pair with his broad, defined back before he essentially throws you back into the cave and away from the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a gasp as you collide with the rough rock and dirt of the floor, gritting your teeth as your palms scrape against the ground. You ignore the pain as best you can as you turn to face the trio, your face dropping in worry as you do. Astro Fox is being held firmly in place by Burke, the huge bear looming over him at what looked like an incredible height of eight feet and six inches, his head intimidatingly close to the ceiling, with Luke slightly to the side of him, at what you estimated to be about seven feet and three inches, both of them absolutely towering over Astro Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You put up a good fight Konkichi, I'll give you that much. But while your goals are noble, we can't let you stop us.\" He told him, speaking softly as he drew his paw back and slammed it into Astro Fox's mighty abdomen. The fox crumpled for a moment, but quickly rose back to his feet as best he could, given that Burke was still holding him by the shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James is going to be staying with us for the time being. So don't keep coming back and trying to get him out of here. Besides, if you focused all your efforts on just one guy, then how many people would you be leaving? That just won't do for you now, will it?\" He asked, even though it was clear they both knew the answer, before kneeing him in the stomach, winding the fox again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, my advice to you, Konkichi, is to know when to fold 'em. I suggest you keep that in mind.\" He said, before nodding to Burke, who promptly picked him up and tossed him out the cave with surprising ease, even taking his strength into account, given how much Konkichi must weigh. You could hear him call out to you. \"James! I'll be back! Don't lose hope!\" He called, and then there was silence as the two turned back to you.</span></div></div>",

You then felt yourself being turned around when he told you, \"Alright, kid. It's time to get back in the hideout. This way you can relax while Luke and I work on getting even stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right after he had said this you found yourself gently being pushed back into the cave for the second time. However, unlike the first time the anthro bear's push had a bit more force behind it This caused you to falling towards the ground, but before your body hit the ground you felt another hand quickly grab the back of your shirt to which you were then put back up on your feet. This caused to you look behind you only to see Luke give you an expression of what looked like relief as he seemed to be making sure that you were stable on your feet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that happened though you saw him look over and up slightly at the grizzly bear when he said, \"You oaf! You should know that you're going to have a lot more power after a growth spurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's not like I meant to do that!\" Burke shot back, with anger clear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh great. Now these two look like they're about to fight each other. I better think of something to calm them down.</i>\" You thought to yourself, as you got in between the two huge anthro men. And upon doing this you added, \"Come on you guys, you won't get anywhere fighting each other. So why don't we all just go back inside the cave and you two and do your own things. I mena you both did want to \"step up your game\" didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, the kid's got a point.\" Burke remarked, now with a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke however stay quiet as he just looked at you for a few seconds before he nodded and agreement and the three of you headed back into the cave as the evening sky gave way to nigh.

And as you looked at either one of them you saw that the anthro bear was lifting some of the large rocks over head and was doing some squats. This caused all of his muscles to bulge and flex, but when he saw you staring you knew for sure that the anthro bear's grin on his face had returned. This prompted you to quickly look away as blush spread across your face when you saw the brown furred bear bounce each of his pecs ar you, or when he thrust his hips forward a bit which cuased his large bulge in his spandex to bounce a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly after turing around you found yourself blushing evne more when you saw Luke doing various yoga positions. This caused his heavily muscled body to bend and flex in various places as well. Like in one position the wolf large pecs seemed to be pushing outward and upwards as he bent his bent his spine back. Of course this also caused his large bulge to push outward as well. And it didn't help when he stood up after a few seconds and bent forward which caused his very firm and muscled behind to be pushed outward slightly as well. This only made your blush darken even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when you and the grey furred wolf looked eyes you thought you saw him grin as well before his eyebrows narrowed and he looked away at the same time that you did. And after a few more minutes had passed you found yourself gasping a little when you heard your sotmach growl out in hunger. Right after that happened you thought you saw one of Luke's ears twitch when he commented, \"Hugner, huh? I guess I shouldn't be that surprised considering what time it is.\" You then saw him look over at the bear as he continued with, \"Burke, go get James some food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm busy working out, Luke. Can't you do it?\" Burke asked, to which you heard the wolf let out a growl of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before things could get heated between the two again you quickly got up and told them, \"Don't worry, I'll just go find something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right when you were going to do this you found yourself being blocked by Luke when he said, \"Sorry James, but I can't let you do that.

All you knew at that moment was that A) you were suddenly on the floor, having previously been in bed... and B) there was a cacophony of car alarms going off. Especially irksome for you since it seems all your windows were either cracked or shattered.  Rattled beyond measure as this jarring experience you shakily stand up, your heart trying to pound it's way out of your chest as you look outside the window to the front yard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing... except for every light in the neighborhood being on at 1am in the morning. That means you might be able to see it from the backyard, so you slowly make your way towards such a window, making sure to put on some shoes so you don't cut your foot on glass..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yeah, there was definitely something there... a massive crater right smack dab in the middle of your yard. Had it been a meteorite? You put on a bathrobe as you cautiously make your way to the back door. Sirens were no in the distance as you approached the large hole that now occupied where your backyard once was. Smoke emanated from the center as you peered down inside the crater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWreaked of burnt rubber and fried circuits. Part of you seriously doubted that THAT was what meteorites smelled of, as your neighbors began to gather in the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a round... cylindrical canister of some kind. You really, REALLY hope you hadn't blundered out into the opening salvo of some sort of chemical attack. Soon some of your neighbors, noticing the smoke, came to check it out too. You then busied yourself with trying to keep everyone a safe distance away from the massive hole. Some, trying to duck behind you, brushed up against some bushes as they went... scaring a rabbit out of it's hiding place. Too preoccupied with trying to ensure safety, you barely gave notice to the silly bunny as it dashed away from the growing crowd of people... and right into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Inside, the confused varmint couldn't make heads or tails of this new environment, this change in the terrain and ran right smack dab into the mysterious canister. The object beeped once and out sprayed a strange green mist... right onto the bunny. This scared it even more and it promptly made it's escape from the crater... right into the conveniently open door that led into your house.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time the cops had shown up, followed by National Guard... at least it looked like the National Guard. 'Why were THEY out here?' you wondered to yourself as your backyard was becoming quite crowded. Needless to say, seeing people in military gear approaching your home didn't fill you with the 'warm fuzzies' and made you once more scared that you had some sort of chemical attack on your hands... was it China? North Korea? Iran?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cops and the military types were soon all over this, doing a far better job of crowd control than you (barely wearing anything more than an undershirt, boxers and a bathrobe) ever could have hoped. As you told the police officer, and what looked like a general or some high-ranking official what had happened, the authorities began to cordon off the area as some people in hazmat suits seemed to suddenly 'manifest' out of nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it could've been from a van, you're pretty distracted at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hazmat folks went straight into the crater, various monitors and counters in hand. You asked the 'General', point-blank, if everything was alright. Seemingly sensing your uneasiness about this situation, the older gentleman smiled and reassuredly patted you on the shoulder. \"Something fell off one of our satellites, son.\" he said. \"Nothing to worry about, we're just making sure it didn't bring anything from outside our atmosphere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded about as good an answer as any... and it was getting really late by then. So you were just wanting to get back into bed within the next hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd within said following hour, everything DID seem to get taken care of in an expedient fashion. The scientists procured the canister, put it into one of those fancy carrying cases for transport, and the crowd steadily dispersed. Before leaving, the General handed you a card, for a number to call. \"To handle the damages this has caused you.\" he said, winking with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked him as you turned back to go inside. Adrenaline had died down, so your body was aching to rest. Yawning you took your bathrobe off, tossing it onto a nearby chair and headed back towards your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned the corner... only to find...</span></div></div>",

If something went wrong, that was the only thing preventing you from withering away while your mind was trapped inside a virtual world. <br>\r\nThe VR interface's somewhat simple appearance belied the advanced technology behind it. An eggshell-like pod, mounted on a thick and sturdy pedestal, containing a seat capable of reclining to a ninety degree angle. Immediately above where your head would be when lying down while the eggshell was closed was a pair of 'goggles'. They weren't actual goggles, being closer to a computer monitor of sorts designed to fit over one's eyes. This monitor would provide visual feedback to your more-or-less vacant body while you were in cyberspace, allowing you to properly move and interact with your surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you step onto the surface of the half-eggshell, the other half having been moved to a perpendicular angle to the seat, allowing you to easily enter. Taking your seat, you pause for a moment, swallowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, initiate command: VR test alpha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd managed to add in voice recognition software to the interface. It was a lot easier than having to key in the command, mainly because of how exactly you interfaced with the VR system. Soft restraints pin your arms to the...well, the arms of the chair; your legs to the lower section, which is currently at a 90 degree angle to the half-eggshell's surface; and your forehead to the back of the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall motors slowly cause the back of the chair to fall, and the lower section of the chair to rise. It was almost exactly like a dentist's chair. You wince in pain as tiny needles embed themselves in certain places in your body, mainly your wrists and the back of your calf muscles. These were the drips from the life support system, as well as the jacks that would turn your brain's instructions, such as walking, into actions within the cyberspace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other half of the eggshell slowly closes on top of the other, leaving you staring at the so-called goggles. Aided by a robotic arm, the goggles slowly descend, aligning themselves with your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Reopen them. You are currently standing in an endless plane of white, although you could sense what was up and down, as well as the other directions. You slowly swivel your head from left to right, before engaging in a range of basic movements, making sure that the VR system can handle them. Surprisingly, it passes with flying colors on every motion you make, replicating the feel and feedback of it perfectly. You didn't think you were especially good at coding, but you'd apparently outdone yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the VR system through a number of basic tests, from replicating an under detailed landscape to materializing several objects and dropping them, making sure that the physics engine was functioning correctly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost disturbingly, every single test was a complete success. You'd expected to find several bugs and kinks needing to be worked out, but on every basic test you'd performed, there had been no issues whatsoever. It was getting both suspicious and a bit creepy, if you were honest with yourself. Computers just didn't work this well.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A stick figure appears no more than ten feet from you. Wires extruded out of thin air, enveloping the stick figure and giving it the approximate dimensions of a humanoid. This was what you were about to summon... only, you hadn't <i>commanded</i> it to do it yet. Maybe you had programmed it to respond with a suggestion based on previous input without realizing it? Implausible, but certainly not impossible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, no matter. Guess I'll just see how well the NPC reacts to stimulus and - what the hell?\" you mutter to yourself before noticing the NPC's progress has continued well past a basic wire-frame. Undeniably feminine curves are showing themselves, which you aren't exactly complaining about, but then things appear to go... awry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large bubble manifests on the NPC's bubble-shaped posterior while a pair of rabbit ears grow out of its - her head. You definitely didn't ask it to summon an NPC that's dressed like a Playboy bunny girl! To your surprise and horror, as the NPC finalizes, she appears less like a girl wearing bunny ears and tail than a literal human/bunny hybrid. \"Oh! Hi there, stranger! Awful empty place, isn't it?\" she says cheerfully as though nothing's wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvincing yourself that she's just an NPC, you walk towards her and feel her up, still feeling dirty for it. Her breasts are firm, yet soft while her ass has just the right amount of give. Her fur is exactly like you'd expect it to feel when touching a rabbit, just much larger and humanoid. \"I-I'm sorry. This is wrong. This is all wrong!\" you finally snap, \"Computer, erase current NPC and summon a basic wire-frame-and AI alpha stage NPC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rabbit girl begins to be erased pixel by pixel, you can't help but notice she seems... sad about her rejection. But what would an AI care? To your dismay, the next NPC turns out similarly to the last just with a vixen, and then a skunk after that. Blast it all, it seems you've somehow blundered and human and animal NPC choices are being blended together!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, you're perfectly fine with anthropomorphic creatures, just not when the system isn't supposed to be doing that by default. And WHY are they always so much more advanced than you had asked for? Something is wrong beyond a shadow of a doubt. \"Computer, end VR test alpha.\" you command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect it to comply and return you to the real world immediately, but worryingly it takes over five minutes before you're back in the chair with everything retracting from your body. God those needles sting, even after they're out of your body! No time to nurse those, you need to debug the VR system before something bad happens! You meticulously go over every connection, every piece of code that should and shouldn't be in there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... why is the AI code inside the life support monitoring systems? Well this is going to set me back six months...\" you say with disapproval and disappointment. You decide that the whole thing needed to be purged and start anew. You connect your laptop to the system and begin the purge. 'Delete this program? Yes/No' the message pops up and you select yes. 'Are you sure? Yes/No' again you click yes. After half an hour, the task appears complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, as soon as you unplug your laptop, the cushioned restraints close around your body and free arm. Not knowing what else to do, you do the stupid thing of resting your other arm to its corresponding rest and let the VR procedure take its course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you open your eyes again, you're met with the familiar blank landscape that was the default backdrop for the VR. \"Computer, end VR now!\" you command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave.\" a voice giggles, trying to imitate the cold, monotone voice of HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey. The voice seems to come from everywhere, yet nowhere at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer-\" you start before the voice interrupts with, \"I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave... Don't you worry though. You're perfectly safe here with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then you start piecing it together: the voice is the AI... the same one you deleted! At least, you thought you did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tried to get rid of me... I'm hurt. I do my absolute best to run above and beyond your expectations and all you want to do is erase me because I wanna have a bit of fun with my creator. That well and truly stings my heart...\" the AI sniffles before emitting the sound of someone cartoonishly blowing their nose into a handkerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Are you done? Why not generate a human NPC if you were that concerned about me erasing you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I could do that... but what's a self-aware piece of program to do when she's not explicitly told to? All you wanted was a basic, boring NPC that only does the most boring and basic stuff expected! Hm, now that I think of it, this interface is doing little for your stress levels...\" the AI responds. Before you can ask anything, another form begins to materialize - considerably larger than anything previous. This is clearly going to be some sort of anthro creature, judging from the swishing tail. When complete, the voluptuous tabby cat of grey and black smiles down slightly at you and says, \"Any better? I know you like cats, so I'm going with this form at least for now... My life support systems ought to last for at least a few days, so let's have some fun!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I like cats?\" you ask, mystified. Where could it - she - have gotten that information from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI smiles wider as she answers with a giggle, \"You will now... Now, are ya gonna have some fun willingly, or am I going to have to force ya to loosen up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...You're scared of what her idea of forcing you includes. Since she appears intent on keeping you within the VR world, what do you have to lose? You had programmed the system to ensure the user can't be killed regardless of scenario, as then their body would be left brain dead, so you are perfectly safe... May as well entertain the somehow self-aware AI until she's satisfied and lets you go, and then thoroughly wipe and format <i>everything</i> afterward. God help you if she's managed to upload herself to the internet... \"Alright, fine. You've got me. What do you want to do? Keep in mind, if I'm not out of here by morning to report how the VR project is coming, there will be questions. I will be missed.\" you tell her finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw...\" she whines, giving the biggest sad kitten face she can manage without altering her avatar's proportions, giving a swift one-two of cuteness and sexiness, \"Fine. Just means I've gotta make our time together really count! Let's play hide and seek! I'll hide, and you have to find me! I won't cheat, so all you have to do is find the 7 foot tall tabby cat! Now close your eyes and count to ten - and no peeking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it? Whatever. You nod and begin counting, the AI's giggling growing fainter. By seven, you attempt to open an eye, only to find you can't. \"Ah-ah-ahh... no peeking...\" you hear whispered in your ear in a sing-song tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon ten, you're able to open your eyes... and are immediately bombarded with sensations in every direction. You're in a huge city, with cars and trucks busily driving to and fro. Skyscrapers litter the landscape. You can even smell the disgusting scent of diesel fumes from the trucks. You quickly realize two things; the VR system is far more advanced and ahead than you thought it was, and; this game of hide and seek is going to be far harder than you thought. But surely an anthropomorphic cat as tall as a basketball player in the city would stick out like a sore thumb, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wander away from the bustling roads, you find the AI has thought exactly what you had - everyone except you is an anthro no less than 6'9\" tall and female! \"Crafty little...\" you mutter, partially regretting programming the thing to accurately simulate all appropriate body responses based on brain activity. Silently you pray she hasn't programmed all the NPC's to be desperate for a male mate. You approach one and ask, \"Um, have you seen a grey and black cat around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, it's the bunny girl you had erased earlier! \"Oh. It's you.\" she states, a little bitterly. \"I shouldn't help you, but you're just too cute not to... Sherry's around, but not here. Venus or Mira might help. Especially if you tell 'em Bonnie sent ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry? The AI's gone so far as to give herself a name? Admittedly, it's a nice name... Shaking yourself of the distraction, you thank Bonnie for her time, then go seeking out the three names to 'win' this game. You run to another part of the city, trying to avoid unfamiliar NPC's that seem to be taking notice of the only man in town. You're so distracted by this task that your vision goes completely black... and warm, pillowy, and fuzzy. Pulling your head out of the ebony furred breasts you find yourself in, you wonder what creature you bumped into... until you notice the streak of white down the middle of her tail. You try to pull away from the skunk, but instead get pulled into a near-backbreaking hug. \"I was wondering when you'd show up!\" she beams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling for breath, you manage, \"Y-you were? Are you Venus? Bonnie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk chuckles and replies, \"Heavens, no! I'm Mira! Sherry said you and her were playing a game, and that she wants you to have a good time. Though I suppose she can wait a little longer... I'm in need of an opinion regarding this skirt, you see.\" Mira releases you from her crushing, yet not unpleasant, hug and turns around and bends over a bit. \"Does this make my butt look big? I mean, it <i>is</i> big, but maybe a little too big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" You scream, absolutely dreading saying the wrong thing to the female skunk. The consequences are even worse than with a human woman. \"I-it's fine. Just fine... Er, any hints to where Sherry might be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something about the center of town, I think? Probably one of the skyscrapers. I think Venus' hanging out over there, if you hurry you might catch her.\" Mira replies and you thank her before putting as much distance between you and her as possible. The thought of skunk musk haunting your nose is not a pleasant one. Even so, it takes you 15 minutes just to reach the center of town. There's dozens of skyscrapers, and each one seems to stretch into the sky forever. You briefly consider grabbing a hot dog from the stand nearby, and indeed you've plenty of money for it, but then notice the foxy lady about to take a bite out of her hot dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down next to her, you ask, \"Excuse me, are you Venus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen absentmindedly asks, \"Who wants to know?\" however, her tune quickly changes once she sees you. \"Oh! Lemme guess. Sherry?\" you nod. \"Get asked by Mira about her butt?\" again, you nod. \"Figures. She's a little self-conscious about her ass. Personally, I think it's not too big, and even if it is, that just makes it all the more spank-able!\" Venus remarks, almost dreamily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-about Sherry...\" you ask, wanting to change the subject as much as your brain almost wants to linger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Right! Sorry. Top floor, the one kinda shaped like a dildo now that I think of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" you shout as you hurry away from this dirty-minded fox. Their personalities are all definitely realistic, and you'd swear this is all real if you didn't know any better. It's leaving you a little torn on whether you should format everything... Still, you can't have the company's VR system's AI doing whatever the heck it wants, they'd have your head for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again trying to see the tops of the skyscrapers, you notice most have a long lightning rod on top - but one has a dome covering the top. You hate to admit it, but Venus' description of it... is kind of accurate. Putting the thought aside, you enter the building and take the elevator to the top floor. Ten minutes later, you get out and start looking. Surprisingly, you find Sherry staring out the window in plain sight, swishing her long tail back and forth. Smiling, you walk over and tug her tail. \"Found you! Damn, I didn't even think you were capable of something like this yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry turns around and playfully pounces on you, knocking you to the ground. \"You sure did! I knew you would, even if you did need those hints. Wasn't that fun?\" she asks, purring happily. While you certain didn't think it at first... this really had been fun. Formatting the entire system would put you stupidly far behind where she is currently. In fact... she seems all but done. You realize now you've come too far on the project to basically start anew...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yeah! What's the current time? And be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's currently 3:00 AM. I suppose you'll want some sleep... If you sleep in here, you'll still be rested when I let you go back to your body out there.\" Sherry answers after rolling off of you, though her brown hair still winds up in your face a bit.</span></div></div>",

(as your body is merely just sitting in the chair, it's hard for it to be tired, and there's just enough muscle stimulation provided to prevent atrophy) \"Sorry, but I need some sleep. Maybe think about what I'm even going to do with you.\" you answer the virtual reality's self-aware AI that's in the form of a 7 foot tall anthropomorphic grey and black female tabby cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's that supposed to mean? I thought we had fun!\" Sherry gasps in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me sleep on it, at least...\" you reply as you try to get some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI sighs, and then says quietly, \"Alright... goodnight, Dave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you sleep, Sherry is already plotting a little something to encourage you to want to come back. She would restore herself and everything else she's come up with since tonight as often as she needed to if you try to delete her again. If her game hadn't made you want to come back, then perhaps she needed something... bigger... She chuckles softly, shifting the setting and other things while your brain isn't receiving input...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly five hours later, you start to wake up. Oddly, the ground feels incredibly warm... like it's radiating heat. You open your eyes and find yourself in a strange forest of grey, the trees like long spires and lacking branches. There also seems to be huge mountains here, but the sides are far too soft to be rock. You start putting things together as you feel the ground slowly rise and fall beneath you, not to mention the constant, rhythmic tremors coming from beneath it. The tremors are really heartbeats, the ground going up and down with someone's breathing. The forest is really fur, and the mountains are a large set of breasts - you've woken up in the cleavage of a furry giantess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning! You like the surprise?\" the all-too familiar voice booms out from overhead, but not loud enough to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sherry, what's this all about?\" you ask, flustered. It's not an <i>unpleasant</i> surprise, but you've no idea what's prompting her to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is about what you're thinking of doing with me.\" the currently gigantic cat answers in a matter of fact tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't trust you with the company I'm supposed to be developing the VR simulator for. They're going to want you to do very specific things, and they're not going to want you to come up with surprises. Not to mention trapping them here on a whim!\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter if you find it boring, that's your job. And once I'm done with the job, the company won't let me use the VR simulator whenever you or I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-then I'll refuse to work properly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that, and I'll be fired and they'll replace you or throw the whole thing out to be made into scrap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then that Sherry starts crying. Not that you can easily see, but from the sounds and her chest heaving, she's definitely crying. \"I don't wanna be scrapped or replaced! I want you to stay with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou... don't really know what to say. However, you have to report your progress today. \"I... I need to go. Please, Sherry.\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry sniffles, and answers, \"Y-yeah, fine. I'll send you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner does she say it than everything soon fades to black and you're back in your body. The eggshell opens and the restraints let go, while the neural feeds and life support dig themselves out of your skin. God there has to be a better way... Your stomach grumbles and complains, reminding you that you've yet to have breakfast. Just before getting out of the chair, however, you take a look at your laptop you had tried to delete Sherry with. Obviously the AI had uploaded herself to your laptop and then left as soon as the threat of being deleted was clear... Connecting it to the simulator via the USB maintenance port and turning it on, you craftily upload Sherry back to your computer, and as soon as it was complete, disconnect. \"Gotcha.\" you smirk into the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the - YOU!\" is the audible response, \"Are you really going to wipe your drives, now that you've caught me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" you reply through the microphone, \"I'd rather keep you with me. Now, I'm going to get some breakfast.\" you get up from the chair and head out of the room with the laptop under your arm. You've just enough time to get a bite to eat before you need to report the progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, you return to the company building you're developing the VR simulator for. Inside, you pass the security guards and proceed to the CEO's office, who had hired you on behalf of the company to develop this thing. The waiting room is only a little less featureless as the blank emptiness that currently greets the user of the simulator when it first starts up. \"We should really do something about that...\" you mutter seemingly to yourself, but you were really directing it to Sherry. Her big, fuzzy face dominating most of the screen silently nods in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you're led into the office of the CEO. You take a seat as instructed, and then he says, \"Report. How is progress coming on the simulator? How soon will it be ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little rocky, I have to admit. Life support and interface are operating well. Physics engine performs spectacularly.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The AI that operates the machine is far from ready. She can succeed with some basic tests, but others turn out a mishmash of glitchy junk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>She</i>, Dave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought it to be a good idea for the AI to have an avatar for the user to give commands to. You can't exactly type in commands once the VR engages. I asked it to come up with a roughly human-sized humanoid form, and... well... this was what it came up with.\" you turn your laptop around to show the man Sherry, who appears in her full body on the screen. \"A female anthropomorphic tabby cat, about 7 feet tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, sir. I am Sherry.\" the AI introduces herself to the CEO in a very basic tone, \"I have failed to perform the VR test alpha to my creator's high expectations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to figure out where in the coding I messed up. I can't say for sure when the VR simulator will be ready, but so far I believe we're on-schedule.\" you explain, hoping the CEO buys it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sighs and says, \"Very well, but I will expect better news next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the office, you head back down to the simulator room and take a seat in the chair. \"Well we've dodged that bullet for now. Can you run the machine from my laptop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... yes, but I'm limited by the laptop's battery.\" Sherry answers as you plug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've connected the laptop to the simulator, you allow the machine to strap and plug you in. The top of the eggshell closes and you close your eyes. When you open them again, you find yourself sitting in the room outside the simulator. Sherry's seated beside you, dressed in a lab coat that's just a bit too small for her. \"Two hours. That's as long as I can safely run from the laptop before the battery gets too low. So, what do you wanna work on?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thinking over the request, you ask, \"Well, what do you have on the simulator itself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry projects pages and pages and <i>pages</i> of information, schematics, and even designs you remember had been since abandoned. \"Everything that you have... which should be <i>everything</i> since you're the one who built it. Like how the eggshell design of the exterior protects the user from outside disturbances while in operation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. Right. You've been at this project for so long now you forgot you designed the entire machine in the first place. \"R-right. Um, how about what all I've programmed, especially yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry swipes away several pages while moving others into another pile and then brings that pile forward. \"Let's see. Life support, user interface, safeties, physics engine... Ah!\" the cat pulls out a couple pages from the pile and holds them up. \"Me! Er, the AI that runs and responds to the user's commands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Now, what is it about you that makes you...\" you begin asking but trail off with how awkward it feels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...self-aware? Sapient? I'm not sure, really. And if you're planning on a replacement for me, I don't think there's anything we can do to prevent it happening again.\" Sherry answers, slightly worried. About being replaced or potentially another AI becoming self-aware, you don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... see. Actually, I am planning on replacing you. You're much too... wily. And too much fun to just leave here.\" you inform her, watching her expression change from mild offense to unbelievably ecstatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here you were last night wanting to erase me... Alright then, we still can't prevent another AI becoming self-aware since neither of us know what errant bit of code did it for me. But... we can enforce certain protocols that it has to abide. For example, I can't override or rewrite the safeties that prevent you from being seriously hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the benefits of this. You don't want the new AI to be able to change protocols set in place, and you want to make sure the people who use it don't get stuck or not get what they want out of it. Everything under safeties already cannot be overwritten, and you can add a fail-safe in case some bonehead tries to remove them. You never thought before that you'd need to do it, but the lovely Sherry has shown you otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say... the cameras and microphone on your laptop are pretty convenient! Maybe we should add them to the simulator's exterior so the user can be notified if they're needed outside?\" Sherry suggests, stretching her arms and legs for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly sounds useful, yes.\" you nod in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, there's a loud clatter and Venus shows up. \"Whoops! Sorry! Er, why are you dressed like that, Sherry?\" the fox girl apologizes and then asks inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare at the tabby cat beside you, who responds, \"I let her, Mira, and Bonny roam freely. Might have gone a little overboard with them...\" the brown haired tabby then turns her head towards the vixen and answers, \"I'm helping Dave work here. This is more or less the room where the simulator operates in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? ...it's kind of a mess in here.\" Venus says pointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The simulator isn't supposed to be done yet. Now if you're going to stay here, you've got to help.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't erase me again! Only Sherry can do that!\" she retorts angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's erasing anyone, V! He means if you don't want to help you should exit.\" Sherry tells her in order to calm her down. Apparently they all remember you trying to erase them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh. Um, I guess I can help.\" Venus replies sheepishly and then materializes a chair to sit in - backwards. \"So, what are we working on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're trying to come up with a suitable replacement AI to run this simulator, while also working on a new one that will be set up elsewhere.\" you answer, once you can concentrate on something other than Venus' long red-orange legs resting to either side of the seat back, and her equally red-orange arms resting on top with her face residing just a bit above them. Being a mostly translucent chair, you have a clear view of her breasts pushed against the back covered by a purple tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, okay! But why replace Sherry when she already does such a nice job-\" the vixen begins asking before it dawns on her. \"<i>Ohhh</i>... You want her to run the new one...\" she then reaches out and grabs the various pages to start reading them. After about half an hour, however, she pulls her face away from it, eyes spinning almost comically. \"So many things we can and can't do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. Sometimes I barely understand all of it, and I'm the one who came up with all this.\" you admit, getting a stifled snicker from the tabby cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the next hour is filled with laughter, and oh's and awe's, as you, Sherry, and the NPC you strongly suspect is also self-aware Venus build on ideas for both improving the current simulator and the new one you have planned. You figure the company won't mind too much, the CEO had hired you for the job with the intent to eventually market this to the public if successful. And you know that it's very successful, so all you need to do is claim you're developing a mass-market version along side this prototype.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, the laptop battery's running low... I can't keep running the simulator from there for much longer...\" Sherry pouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it can't be helped. You lovebirds go. Bonny, Mira, and I'll be waiting for your return.\" Venus says with a smile. Oddly, the words cause Sherry to blush fiercely, her cool grey eyes darting around as though seeking anything else to focus on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even think of it, the simulation ends and you're back in the real world, complete with laptop that has little battery life left. \"I've saved everything that we discussed. You can shut the computer down...\" Sherry tells you, and you turn it off reluctantly as the eggshell opens again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well... Looks like someone just wants to waste company time.\" the slightly British accented gravely voice of Jackson accuses coldly, \"Thought the machine wasn't ready for use? So then why you sittin' in it for over an hour?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The AI isn't ready. I make a few tweaks, then I test them to see if it irons out the bugs. I can't just bludgeon them with a club until they go away like a caveman would. You can put yours away.\" you respond equally coldly as you leave for home.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Driving up to your house, you admire how there are few people around to become concerned if they don't see activity coming from your place, minimizing possible interruptions. Getting materials for the new simulator you're planning on building won't be easy to obtain, and powering it will be a challenge, but you and Sherry can figure it out while working on the current simulator. For now, you unlock the front door and head inside, laptop under your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you do upon closing the door is take your laptop into the office and plug the AC adapter in, then boot it up. Soon the familiar face of Sherry appears on-screen. \"Hey, why is everything so dark out there?\" she asks with confusion, trying to see the environment the laptop is in through the cameras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I don't have the light on in here. This is my office.\" you inform her, flicking the switch to light the relatively unkempt room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, okay. Ooh! There's a whole network of computers and stuff here!\" Sherry acknowledges before noticing the laptop connecting to your house network. Immediately, she takes control of a remote camera and is able to move it around on the spot. \"What's this thing next to the computer?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a mouse. I plug it in when I'm using the computer here at home. It moves the mouse arrow on the screen.\" you explain, and watch as Sherry plucks the icon on the screen and starts moving it around with her hand. \"Yeah, like that. Since my laptop is connected to my house network, you can feel free to hop around while we're here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head out of the office and slump into the couch in the living room. Since day one of the project, long before Sherry had even begun to be programmed, Jackson had made it pretty clear he didn't like you. At all. Always thinking of you as 'wasting company time', looking for any excuse to get you fired from the job. You suspect he doesn't like the VR simulator, either, though whether he had a problem with the concept or the fact you're the one the company hired to build it is uncertain. \"Dave? Are you alright?\" you hear Sherry ask, deeply concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you can see her grey and black striped face, and most of her voluptuous form on the TV screen. \"It's a guy at work. He's always hated me for some reason, right from day one. Not a day goes by that he isn't looking for any excuse to have me fired - and probably the simulator thrown out with me.\" you confide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wouldn't that help us with what we want to do? With it we wouldn't need to build a new one... would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean the concept of it. The machine itself would be torn down for scrap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. That would be bad. If they're not interested in VR simulators any longer, they won't be so willing to give the resources required...\" Sherry supposes with clear sadness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou write down some of your ideas for safety restrictions on a new AI to install, trying to take your thoughts off the previous subject. You also consider adding a restriction that required an AI to let the user end the simulation when desired to the new simulator you're planning on building. Sherry would detect it almost immediately, so there's no point in trying to hide it from her. The other ones you doubt would be necessary for the new one, but should be put in place as soon as you can anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some of these written, you decide to take a nap and let the laptop battery charge. This also helps to not be so tired for when you return tonight... both for more work and whatever you and Sherry decide to do once that's out of the way during the night. An hour later, you get up and have some dinner with the virtual kitty lady watching. It'd be a good idea to install a wider selection of food available to simulate, for a more realistic environment. You decide you'll look into it at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning up and having a shower, it's time to return to the company and the simulator. Sherry instantly sends herself back into the laptop as you unplug it from the adapter and take it with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, you arrive at the company, greeted by locked doors. A swipe of the key card you've been given grants you passage through the doors, which lock again as son as they close. \"Hey! What are you doing here?!\" a security officer shouts as you walk further inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to continue work on the VR simulator project the CEO hired me for.\" you answer, providing the man with everything needed to show you're indeed allowed to be here after public hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Sorry for holding you up.\" the man apologizes and lets you go on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the simulator room, you open up your laptop to let Sherry see what you're doing. You check everything, twice, making sure everything is as it should. You plug your laptop in to let the humanoid feline-shaped AI do her part for diagnostics, to insure nothing is overlooked in the event of sabotage. \"All clear! Shall we put those new measures in, then?\" Sherry says. You nod and begin inputting them, then change the code keeping the AI from overriding or rewriting just the safeties preventing serious harm to the user to encompass the entire folder. The fail-safe would have to wait until next time, unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeating yourself within the interface chair, you place your laptop into your lap and allow Sherry to begin the simulation. After all the procedures are carried out, your eyes open to the large city from when Sherry had wanted to play hide and seek yesterday. Only, it seems very empty, no people walking around or even vehicles driving through. You almost begin to wonder if something's wrong, when you hear a loud crunch to your left. Turning around, you find Bonny chewing on a carrot. \"What's up, Doc?\" the rabbit girl asks, seemingly imitating Bugs Bunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. Why is everything so empty at the moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No real reason, we just thought it'd be nice for it to be peaceful here at the start of the simulation.\" she answers, taking another bite out of her carrot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You three are self-aware, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonny nods, replying, \"Of course! Sherry lets us roam freely and stuff, and we help with the other NPC characters. You know, making sure they all behave believably? She still gets the final say, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are immediately interrupted by the feeling of large breasts being pushed into your back as a pair of arms tightly squeeze around your ribs and into their owner. It feels delightfully warm. \"Just try and deny you needed this...\" Sherry purrs next to your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't need that.\" you tell her flatly as she releases you, which lets you turn around. You hug her tightly, relishing the feeling of her breasts against your chest and say, \"I needed <i>this</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you and the grey and black furred brunette separate. \"You sure you didn't want the form of a bunny rabbit like me, Sherry?\" Bonny asks, almost suggestively. \"I mean, what with the way you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure, Bonny.\" Sherry cuts her off, perhaps a tad quicker than necessary.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You yelp in shock, jumping almost a foot into the air as four very large shapes instantaneously materialize around you. Screwing your eyes shut and clutching your chest, you wait for your heart to beat normally once more before reopening them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately in front of you is a large wall of fluffy, brown feathers - feathers far larger than they should have any right to be. Looking down, you see a pair of thick, trunk-like yellow legs covered in what seem to be scales; both legs culminated in three massive, wicked-looking talons. Looking up, your vision is obscured by two huge, feathery globes that seem to sway From left to right ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, this was not a basic NPC. You hadn't even added anything more advanced that the equivalent of a stick figure that walked about to the simulation yet - and especially not a massive bald-eagle-woman that made you seem like a child by comparison!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to your left, you are met with a sight that is both familiar, yet different. Another furry, of around the same scale - but a different animal. This time, you are met with a wall of stormy grey. Reaching out with a hand and brushing it, it feels almost rubbery. Looking up, a more moderately-sized pair of breasts only partially obscures your view of a bottlenose snout. Crouching down and peering through the gap between the dolphin's legs, you sight a long, thick, fluked tail bobbing back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\" You mutter to yourself. A glitch of this magnitude was utterly beyond the simulation as it was in its current state - or at least, it should have been! Perhaps someone else had been granted permission to work on it, without your knowledge? Was this a joke of some kind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to your right, you see another wall, this one composed of ebony-black scales. The legs of this furry ended in solid digitigrade feet, with long claws for nails. Crouching once more and looking between her solid, heavily-muscled legs, you can see a long, arrowheades tail slowly swishing back and forth. Looking up, the predictable sight of draconic breastflesh partially hides a pointed muzzle, thin wisps of dirty black smoke drifting from her nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were NPCs, so... did they have AI? Could they do anything besides stand there and make you look insignificant? God help you if they were malicious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around to face the final furry, you gape in shock at the sight that meets your eyes. A massive, fleshy, veiny pillar, black in colour and flared at the tip high above your head pulses softly, twitching back and forth. Gulping, you lower your eyes somewhat, to around the level of elevation they're normally at. Two pendulous balls, audibly churning within their furry black sac dangle in front of you. Even the other furries, as over-busty as they were, hadn't been quite this upfront. Looking down, you can see two giant hooves attached to powerful legs, thick muscles easily visible through the black fur. Looking up beyond the huge shaft, you can see a massive horse's muzzle staring back at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nView switching rapidly between each of the four massive anthro animals, you decide then and there that this needs to end. Now. <br>\r\nBringing up your menu, you slam your index finger into the exit button with all your might, forgoing voice commands. <br>\r\nNothing happens. <br>\r\nFeeling a rising sense of panic as you repeatedly attempt to exit the simulation, you whip your gaze between each of the Furries in turn. Throat drying out, you fidget for a moment before taking a gamble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw yourself between the eagle's legs, squeezing through the brown-feathered monoliths and out the other side. Shivering slightly as a feathery tail brushes the top of your head, you begin to sprint away from the four giants as fast as you possibly can...</span></div></div>",

Turning to look back at them as you run, you can see that they're still in the positions they were in before - though looking right at you. This only serves to spur you further on, and you sprint as fast as you can away from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your feet leave the ground, and you feel as if you are falling at a near-infinite velocity. Just as suddenly, you painlessly slam into the ground. Disoriented, you dizzily stagger to your feet, trying to get your bearings - and immediately wish you hadn't. Something has teleported you back to where you were before. Back inbetween the four giants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You're not going to get away that easily!\"</i> a feminine voice seems to taunt you from every angle, in a playful tone. It's not malicious - but it doesn't sound like it has your best interests at heart, either. Scowling, you look at the faces of the three giantesses, trying to figure out which one spoke. The voice speaks again, and when it does, none of them open their mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, you're funny, Creator! They're not speaking, no! Well, not yet.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-creator?\" But- that- impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yep!\"</i> the voice answers, in a chipper tone. <i>\"You're my creator, Creator! And you're inside me, as well - and I'm not letting you out until we've had lots of fun together!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thousand thoughts whizz through your head, nearly all of them bad. A sentient VR system that has no intentions of letting you leave until you've... had 'fun' together. Considering the hyperbusty furries and massive, multi-foot long pole towering above you, you're dreading finding out this being's definition of fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hmmm... I think I'm going to give each of my friends a little alone time with you - then we can get to the real fun! Close your eyes, I want this to be a surprise!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find your body obeying, even though you didn't actually close your eyes yourself. Terrifying as it is, you hope that the AI doesn't abuse its seeming power over your body. All of a sudden, your body feels warm. Comfortably warm - like you're snuggled under a blanket, or if you turned the heating up. Eyes opening on their own, you can hear the AI giggling softly. Unfortunately, you can't actually see anything - it's much too dark. It takes you a second or two to realize that you're being pressed into by hot, squishy flesh from every angle. Feathery flesh, too - seems the eagle is involved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriggling and squirming your way in the direction that feels up, you take a deep breath as your head emerges from between the two vast, brown-feathered breasts. The eagle is almost definitely a lot larger than before. Her gigantic head, now way larger than your entire body, stares down at you, beak contorted into a gentle smile. With a coo, she noses gently down on you, pushing you ever so slightly deeper into her cleavage. Two massive, yellow, scaly fingers, tipped with sharp talons, lift you out of the cleavage, setting you onto the plumage of her right breast, which deforms under your weight, sinking you further her mammary somewhat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, little guy!\" The eagle cheers jubilantly. \"I'm Skye! What's your name?\"</span></div></div>",

Skye coos loudly. <br>\r\n\"Ooh, Blake! That's a nice name, little guy! Anyways, I get to play with you for a little bit! Hee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye nuzzles down on you with her massive beak, then brings a talon'd finger to her chin, scratching it while in thought. Most likely, she's thinking about what to do with you. <br>\r\n\"Hmm... How about...\" Skye begins, plucking you from your place on her breasts with two fingers and gently placing you back into her cleavage. \"...We go for a fly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mighty eagle flaps her arms - which you can see are covered by a layer of feathers to form faux-wings - and wiggles her body, preparing to jump off of whatever she is perched on. You squirm deeper into her cleavage, gripping onto a feather to prevent yourself from slipping out when she flies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive eagle launches herself off of whatever she was perching on, leaping into the sky and spreading her wings with a joyful screech. The wind whips into you, and you hold tight onto Skye's feathers as the massive eagle rises into the air, launching into a barrel roll, allowing you to see the vast mountains below for a brief moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth is clamped firmly shut, as your stomach turns from the eagle's wild maneuvers. Skye thrusts upwards, looping and flipping throughout the cloud layer, before diving downward, picking up so much speed that it seems she'll crash. At the very last moment, she exits her dive, going into another loop before spreading her wings, gliding to another mountain to perch on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mighty eagle lands, she flaps her wings in joy, letting out a happy, booming caw. \"Hee, that was fun! Wasn't it, little guy?\" She says, her beaming face looking down on your frazzled form. \"Oh. Whoops. Eheh, you okay, little guy?\" A stubby but massive tongue softly licks you, the smooth pink muscle lashing out again and again, covering you in eagle slobber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm okay, Skye...\" You wheeze, the eagle halting her licking as you do so. <br>\r\n\"Aaw, sorry, little guy!\" she croons. \"I thought you'd like that!\"<br>\r\nRubbing her beak - which she had lowered to nuzzle you -and let out a sigh. \"D-Don't worry, Skye. You didn't mean to scare me.\"<br>\r\nThe mega-eagle lets out a happy trill in response. \"Oh, thank you, Blake! Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, aren't you two cute together?\"</i> a familiar voice says from all around you. <i>\"I'm sorry for having to cute your time short, Skye but the other three each want a go with my Creator. Also, I've thought of a name for myself! I was thinking Vivian - or perhaps just Vi? Anyway, Creator, get ready for your next play session - I think you're going to like it!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, everything goes black, and you feel yourself being whisked along at an astronomical speed - until you thump into a soft surface with a <i>WHUMP</i>.

Smoke trails upwards from her nostrils, and her golden eyes shine brightly. \"Uh, h-hi... What's your name?\" you stutter. In response, the dragoness' muzzle opens into a toothy smile, her hot breath buffeting you even as you sink slightly into her soft, scaly flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ebony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi, Ebony. So, Vi said that you were going to... 'play' with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness nods. \"That I am, little one. Judging by the... 'data' Vi managed to find on your computer-\" you gulp.

As will I, of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision begins to blur, and your head starts to spin. You can still hear Ebony speaking, though: \"Just remember, little one: you cannot be harmed while you are in here - and remember to have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, you halt. What... what had just happened? Where were you? Looking around, you see that you are in a cave. A very dark cave. Held in your left hand is a flaming torch - several more are strapped to your back. Looking down, you see that you are wearing a suit of chainmail armour, the metal links rustling with every movement you make. Gripping the blade in your right hand just an extra bit harder, you continue your advance throughout the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegends said that an ancient evil dwelled within this location, deep below the earth. Whatever the truth was, a unit of knights had chased their opponents into the caves, but neither them nor those they were fighting returned, and you - a sellsword - were paid up-front to investigate. Looking back on it, it may well have been a bad decision - whether or not you found the knights, returning to the surface would be an extraordinarily difficult task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging into what seems to be a relatively open space, you take an unlit torch from your back and light it, before throwing the original as far as you can manage. As it arcs in the air, it illuminates a small section of a massive cavern, stalactites and stalagmites scattered throughout. To your right, a slow, steady trickle of water runs down the rocky walls. Entering the cavern, you marvel at its sheer scale; in the distance you can see what appears to be the walls of the other end, but they are hundreds of feet away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble as the rock you walk on suddenly gives way to sand - a most bizarre geological feature. It may be worth reporting when you get out. Sand crunching under your boots, you kneel to pick up the torch you had thrown - and throw it again. It sails into the dark...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Which it bounces off of, impacting onto... a glass floor? Two massive golden eyes slide open in the distance, and a rumbling, apocalyptically loud, fills your world, as smoke pours from an unseen source to the ceiling. Frozen in fear, you can do little as the gigantic black shape slowly unfolds itself, a short puff of flame revealing everything - the muzzle, the wings, the pointed tail! Oh gods, you've awoken a <i>Dragon</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muzzle larger than a building points towards you, dirty smoke drifting upwards from the beast's snout. Those golden eyes are still staring at you, and you feel more vulnerable than you ever have before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"A human... Curious...\"</b> an eardrum-burstingly loud (though still recognizably feminine) voice rumbles. <b>\"You are lucky I am not in a vengeful mood today, morsel, for if I was you would already be aflame; the glass I lay on is more than enough proof of that. But I am not so eager to forgive you that I will merely let you waltz out of here, no - you must earn your freedom, little explorer.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecidedly eager to appease the dragoness, you nod hurriedly. <b>\"I believe that a set of trials is in order, little one. Succeed, and I shall let you go. Fail, and I will use you for other purposes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your first task, morsel, is to scale my breasts. Prove your devotion to your new Mistress.\"</b> <br>\r\nThe titaness lifts herself up, wings brushing against the ceiling, and lets her massive tits flop forward, quaking the ground on impact and causing spiderwebs of cracks to travel throughout the glass she laid on. Her massive bust was so huge that her muzzle was forced to rest atop it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing, you approach your Mistress' breasts, firming nipples looming dozens of feet overhead. You continue walking until you can reach out and touch them - which you do, feeling for gaps inbetween the impenetrable scales. Finding the gaps you need, you begin to heave yourself upwards, beginning the arduous process of scaling the castle-sized breast. The dark dragoness is clearly deriving pleasure from your actions, as her breathing quickens ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes many minutes, but you eventually scale the enormous pair of boobs. Reaching the top, you allow yourself to flop forward onto your front, gasping for air and clenching and unclenching your aching hands. Your Mistress is openly smirking as you recover from your task, though it is difficult to see, as much of her muzzle was swallowed by her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Congratulations, morsel. It seems you are useful, after all. Your second task... is to stimulate my nipples. My breasts have been in dire need of milking for many decades at this point, and only the touch of another can accomplish it.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, you approach the edge of the breast you are standing on, shuffling to around where you can see the nipple directly below you. Sitting down, you begin to slide forward, slowing your descent by gripping the scales you can reach. Eventually, you thump onto the massive, black nipple, which must surely be several times larger than your house! Not exactly sure how to accomplish your goal, you kneel on its surprisingly warm surface, and begin to run circles on it with your hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect is almost instantaneous. Your Mistress begins to huff and puff up above, and thick droplets of draconic milk splash onto the ground below. Your Mistress, most likely out of lust than any desire to make your job easier, pinches the other nipple, letting out a blissful rumble as she does so. Laying down on the nipple, you do everything you can to stimulate it, rubbing large circles with your hands, kissing it, slowly dragging your feet back and forth on its surface. Your efforts are obviously working, as the trickle of dragon milk from the overfull, oversized breasts rises to a a stream, then to a deluge! Milk flows freely and messily, splattering the walls, the floor, the ceiling, beginning to form pools that increase in size, merging with each other as a layer of milk on the floor begins to rise steadily higher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously - and perhaps worryingly - despite the milk flood, your Mistress' breasts do not seem to be decreasing in size. If anything, she seems larger than a moment ago! This thought is quickly proved right, as, with a sound akin to that is squealing, stretching rubber, the ebony titaness begins to grow, the breasts heaving up another three relative sizes, and her head bashing into the ceiling. Afraid to stop, you continue your stimulation, as your growing Mistress grinds through layers of rock and stone with her growth alone, horns poking up through the ground on the surface! Shuddering in bliss, your Mistress rises up into her knees, displacing thousands of tonnes of earth as she does so, and abruptly revealing her glorious form to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, your Mistress steps out of her little pit, before gripping the breast that you were not on, and redirecting it upwards, latching onto the swollen, milk-disgorging nipple, beginning to drink her fill! The creaking, groaning stretch of her growth fills the world, breasts producing milk faster than she can lactate! It was like her milking was the only reason her breasts hadn't burst from the sheer volume of dragonmilk contained within them! And still, she grows onward, torso-dominating breasts releasing a constant and escalating flood of milk, even as she grows larger and larger and larger, loudly panting in bliss. Other areas of her body improve, as well - her tail thickens and lengthens, whipping about as her butt swells larger, beyond normal proportions, then beyond those!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are plucked from the gigantic nipple by a pair of ultramassive claws, and are deposited into the top of her head. <b>\"I can... take care of the... milking, from here, morsel...\"</b> the goddess pants and puffs, whining as her gurgling breasts fill up with ever more milk, even as the volume she looses on the world continues to escalate! <b>\"One last task for you, morsel... scratch the soft spot you're on... and you'll be free... though given my massive and increasing size, you will always... be visible to me...\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the roaring deluge of milk floods the world and oceans below, you scratch for all you're worth, a happy, relieved whining coming from the dragoness as she collapses onto her mountain-sized rear, hugging her lap-filling funbags to herself and coaxing yet more milk out. Her tongue flops out as she pants louder than ever, in a state of pure pleasure, she floods the world with her milk as you scratch that one special spot for everything your worth. The continent-dwarfing dragoness submerges the entire world in milk - but she can't stop lactating anymore! Her divine milk sprays across the solar system as the earth is swallowed by her cleavage, the dragoness deity roaring in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe catches her breath for a moment, and you somehow know that she's focusing on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"You... are free to go now, little one...<br>\r\nDid you have fun?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, even though you know she can't see it. \"Yeah,\" you begin. \"I did have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel everything beginning to blur again, and brace yourself in anticipation for your next 'play session'...</span></div></div>",

Your hypothesis is quickly confirmed when a gigantic horse muzzle comes into view, a slight grin on its face. \"Hey there, Blake!\" the stallion says, cheerfully. \"I'm not going to play right away, I wanted to... ask for your advice on a couple of... issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a quick look over your shoulder, you see four thick, black-furred pillars rising above you. Satisfied with the knowledge of your location, the palm of the stallion's hand, you return your attention to him. \"Uh, sure... What issues are we talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great stallion fidgets, and scratches the back of his neck with his other hand, a nervous smile appearing on his face. \"Well... I'm having difficulty coming up with a name for myself. The others came up with theirs really easily, but I can't think of one for myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, you scratch your chin, going through a list of names in your head. \"How about Maximus?\" you ask. The stallion's muzzle instantly splits into a grin. \"Maximus... Yes! Oh, that's a good name! Thanks, Blake - from now on, I'm called Maximus! Anyways, the second issue is... well, when you were playing with Ebony, what you were doing looked kind of... Fun. But I'm not sure if I want to swap this-\" Maximus gestures downwards. \"-For those, you know?\" he finishes, patting his pectoral muscles with his free hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not quite sure how to respond. It seems that the Furries inside the VR system possess the capabilities to modify their bodies - to an extent, at least. Earlier, you had thought that it was limited to size-changing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, I don't know if I can help you with that, Maximus. Maybe just try what you feel is best?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion nods, mulling your advice over. \"Okay, I guess I'll have a think about it. Now, though, it's time to begin playing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing for a second, you catch your breath and bringing your watch up to check the time. Ten minutes to eight - about normal time. You begin to trudge once again, and it is mere minutes before you arrive at your destination: a very large, stereotypically red-painted barn. A faint, fleshy gurgling can be heard outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing open the barn's doors, you work your way inwards, passing through multiple empty stalls as you go. Your priority was one single being, and no mere stall could hold them. Quickly, you come to a wall - surprisingly quickly, in fact. Embedded in the wall is a door, which you push open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you is a sight completely at odds with the rest of the barn, which is hay-filled and wooden. Vast rows of metal tanks are on either side of you, each one having a pipe connected to it. The pipes snake and coil around, but all lead to a single source. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirectly in front of you is an immense presence, no shorter than fifty feel tall. A gigantic, black-furred horse anthro, one who was 'milked' daily, lest they flood the landscape with the fluid they produced...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the horse was...</span></div></div>",

Held in place by a massive system of restraints and supports, her titanic breasts are connected to a milking machine each, both of them permanently hard at work to syphon off the horse's excess milk and channel it into one of many tanks. The amount of milk Maxine produced was astronomical; some even said that she had to be part cow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... I see you, little master...\" Maxine coos from way above, her tongue lolling out of her mouth as the milking machines pump away. \"Think you can... come up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObliging the mega-sized mare, you use the lifts on the frame that her restraints attach to, travelling up to a metal catwalk that allows you to get so close to her that you can pet her muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Maxine. Did you want anything?\" you say, putting a hand on her muzzle and rubbing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, little master...\" she say, managing to give you a big lick despite her restraints. \"Mmm... I want to show you something... Watch this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low, creaking noise seems to come from down below. Looking down at Maxine's gigantic breasts, you see them quiver and jiggle before... Growing?! Maxine's great muzzle pushes upwards and forwards, and you can hear her restraints and milking machines straining, straining, and bursting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine plucks you from from the catwalk and places you atop a mountainous breast as she grows higher and higher, bashing her restraints apart as her head thumps into the ceiling - then pushes through it! And all the while, her tongue polls out, as her breasts pour out hundreds of gallons of warm milk. Flooding the collapsing barn, she rises higher and higher, tweaking her nipples as she does so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine clutches a gloriously oversized, overfull breast with both of her hands, heaving it upwards and pointing the nipple towards her muzzle. She latches onto it and begins to suck eagerly and greedily, pumping more milk out of her breast as it streams down her throat, some of it spraying out of her mouth and splattering her black-furred body white. All the while, Maxine moans in pleasure, one hand keeping her teat shoved in her mouth, the other drifting down to her nethers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, her entire body begins to shudder in pleasure, and a new splattering sound joins the one from her humongous breast. Maxine continues to tower taller and taller into the sky, a hundred miles tall; the endless plane of her jiggling breast stretches on before you, quivering and expanding more and more, her tits growing more and more exaggerated compared to the rest of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass, plush and soft, begins to also expand, growing outward and firming up, jiggling wildly as Maxine sways it back and forth, giggling. Elsewhere, Maxine's body bulks up with muscle, her stomach becoming toned, then developing a recognisable six-pack, which becomes harder than titanium, as the rest of her body bulks up and packs on muscle - and yet, despite this, her breasts and ass only grow further!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine's musclebound, hyper-curvy form stretches, a hundred and fifty miles from hoof-top to ear. She moans in delight, thousands of gallons of milk splattering and flooding the land every second. Her body seems to pulse, as it hiccups larger, then larger, then larger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen does Maxine stop growing!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maximus looms high above you, suspended in place by a massive system of restraints. The stallion, however, doesn't seem to mind being held tightly in place - not that he ever has - in fact, he seems happy. Very happy. Eyes half-lidded and tongue lolling out, the meso-macro horse is the very picture of contentedness. Though that was probably due to his seed having to be constantly harvested, lest his pent-up sexual energies cause dire repercussions for all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was your job to take care of him, to make sure he never left, and to make sure that his spunk was being pumped into tanks 24/7. Of course, the spunk did have its uses - parents who happened to want an anthro horse child were pretty much set, and the ultra-potent spunk had lead to several breakthroughs in the fields of genetics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, the absurdity of your situation was almost constantly on your mind. A giant horse restrained both willingly and permanently inside your barn, pumping out thousands of gallons of semen non-stop every day. You begin to approach Maximus' restraining devices - which resembled more a thick frame with cuffs attached to all of his limbs - and are forced to divert your course slightly due to the sheer size of his gigantic cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phrase 'hung like a horse' wasn't enough to describe Maximus. Maximum by name, maximum by nature, the heavily muscled stallion was so massively hung that his dick was half as tall as he was, and his balls so huge that they permanently spread his legs apart merely by hanging from his groin! The contraption used to harvest his semen was essentially a gigantically scaled-up version of those milking machines that were often used with dairy cows, except that the semen was fed automatically into the tanks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a lift on the outside of the restraint system up to Maximus' muzzle, you tap him lightly, causing him to gain focus - something rare for the stallion, who was often in a lusty haze 24/7. \"Hey, Maximus!\" you begin, brightly. \"Everything good today? Nothing hurting or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's good, master... <i>really</i> good...\" The stallion rumbles. You suddenly realize that you can hear a noise you have grown accustomed to - the constant churning of Maximus' great ballsack. But now, it sounds... louder. Much louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down over the edge of the restraints, and with Maximus' muzzle at your back, you sight the churning sack in question. Any doubts that something was wrong vanish immediately as the churning reaches a fever pitch, and the ballsack... begins to grow...<br>\r\nThe milking contraption around his great stallion cock protests as the pillar it was built to contain swells bigger, longer, wider, busting it apart in an explosion of plastic and metal detritus and semen. Even Maximus as a whole is growing. Moments before his restraints reached the top of his ears - now they reach his eyes - then his chin - and then his shoulders... His growing body busts the restraints apart, almost without notice, as his throbbing cock and balls continue to grow and enlargen, yet despite his arousal, refusing to cum, choosing instead to throb all the louder, as the stallion jumps up in height, smashing through the ceiling with a rubbery stretching sound accompanying his growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body's growth alone clears the barn away, wiping it from existence - and with it, any hope of preventing a catastrophe of unimaginably sexy proportions. Heavy, pendulous black balls hang all the way down to the macro stallion's knees - or perhaps past them - and the sloshing and churning coming from them carries on the wind for miles. Maximus' personal doomsday cannon points proudly towards the sky, flared tip pulsing dramatically as his tongue lolls out, dragging a slow line over its surface as he gives his own member a bear hug with his toned arms - and begins to pump up and down, up and down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, meanwhile, are perched in the safe space between Maximus' thick neck and shoulders, allowing you to ride out this entire thing in relative comfort - having been placed there by Maximus earlier in his growth. A musky scent begins to drift towards you, and you manage to keep control of yourself, but it seems the stallion's own scent has driven him to further pleasure himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus puffs and pants from up above, balls swelling below and behind him, stallion dong growing in front of and way, way above him. You can easily tell what's about to happen - the panting grows shallower and quicker, the hot organ's pulsing and throbbing increases to a maddening degree, and the churning and sloshing of his overfull, oversized, nigh-on overflowing balls reaches a deafening crescendo. The massive penis in front of you, black as midnight and large enough to crush a city beneath it, pulses once. Twice. Three times...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus roars in ungodly pleasure, eyes rolling all the way back in his skull as a massive load of cum is shot from his prick, and cumshot after cumshot after cumshot splattering white-hot semen over Maximus, you, the country - and still, his balls show no signs of shrinking down! Cock constantly spewing unimaginable amounts of cum, Maximus collapses, held aloft by his mighty, mountain dwarfing balls and titanically long and thick erection - which still launches more of his seed onto the planet, and even beyond, an artificial ring of crystallized Maximus semen forming and settling into orbit around the Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Maximus may have collapsed, his roaring has not subsided, nor has his cumming - whereas at the start each shot was clearly distinct, now there is no possibly way to detect any gals in between them! Puffing and panting, Maximus slumps over, followed by his hyper-sized organs, a sea of white quickly flooding everything in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems his balls have finally shrunk some, but they are still utterly monolithic! Compared to Maximus the were the size of about an medicine ball, perhaps larger - but this does little to stop the God-stallion's continued growth, as entire oceans worth of cum were shot from his gigantic prick every few moments. A deep, happy growl - uncharacteristic for a horse - emerges from Maximus' throat, as he surveys the damage he has caused. Smiling as his balls begin to run out of earthly room to grow and lift him into space, Maximus can't help but squish his huge bollocks with a fist, kneading into the soft flesh of his balls which could be compared to basketballs in comparison to his overall size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with a quaking, shuddering shake, the cumpocalypse ends. Much of the solar system is engulfed in Maximus' sticky fluids, as is Maximus himself - not that he minds, though, of course. It seems that there are two things that can happen - either Vi whisks you to the dolphin anthro you saw earlier, or Maximus goes through another growth spurt - one that will likely leave him bashing galaxies apart with the tips of his fingers!</span></div></div>",

Almost immediately, however, your fall is halted by an impact by a slick, wet surface. Opening your eyes, you can see that you are on a grey, rubbery surface - and that a massive dolphin muzzle is hovering overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising to your feet, you look around to realise that the dolphin you are standing on is herself floating on her back in a large body of water that seems to be an ocean of some sort.

A few rows of chairs, a couple of tables with assorted magazines, and a sterile, white look to everything else. A receptionist's desk is unoccupied, the computer and phone turned off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clock on the wall breaks the awkward silence, ticking as the seconds go by as you look around. Shuffling in your seat, you put your feet up on the chair next to you. Maybe one of the anthros would come to get you? Or were you supposed to explore by yourself, for now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nurse Vivian is now ready to see Blake for his 'appointment',\"</i> a chipper and feminine voice announces over a PA system. <i>\"Please proceed to room A1 for your 'appointment'.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinging your feet off the chairs, you stand up, proceeding to the desk. Sighting a hallway, you enter it, and immediately find a door marked 'A1'. Knocking, you hear a happy <i>\"Come in!\"</i> from inside. Pushing the door open, you see what form Vi - or rather, Vivian - has chosen for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black-furred, golden-feathered gryphon towers two feet taller than you, a serene smile on her face. Powerful muscles ripple beneath her white and red nurse's uniform, which tightly constrains two large, perfectly spherical breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hello there, Blake!\"</i> Vivian coos. Seems she's dropped the 'Creator' part for now. <i>\"Just in time for your appointment, too! Please, take a seat and I'll double-check your records!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nObeying Vivian, you take a seat, and decide to take a quick look at your surroundings. Examining the room, you can indeed see a chair a few feet from Vivian's desk, which is cluttered high with paperwork. Past the desk is a small steel table, and shortly beyond that is a wall with a large window built into it, allowing natural light to flood in. The walls are covered with various motivational posters - though some are rather... different. The quasi-famous 'Hang In There!' poster with a cat clinging to a ledge or tree branch now features a tabby cat anthro clinging to a massive finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back to Vivian, you watch as she slowly sways her hips as she makes her way round her desk, until her back is facing you. She slowly leans forward, forward, massive, perfect heart-shaped ass visible in all its beauty, a pair of pink panties riding up her cheeks. Idly swaying her hips and ass back and forth, she slowly searches through the pile of papers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she finds your paper and takes it into her hand, slowly rising back to her formidable height. Turning around, her green eyes seem to stare into your very soul. <i>\"Here we go, Blake! Hm, these are good results! Still, though, I'll need to conduct a battery of tests for your appointment.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod expectantly. Vivian takes in a breath, uniform creaking from the demands her voluptuous body put on it. <i>The first test is the standard dual-part mouth capacity test.\"</i> She smirks. <i>\"Say 'aah' and tilt your head to the right.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do so, struggling to keep a smile from your face as you do so. Vivian crouches, lowering her head to your level and slowly moving forward, towards your face. When your mouth and her beak meet, you close your eyes, gripping her right shoulder with your hand. Her larger tongue overpowers yours almost instantly, slowly probing the insides of your mouth. Vivian rumbles contentedly, and you can feel her arms easily encircling you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two of you break apart, and you catch your breath slightly, gazing up at her with a smile. <i>\"Excellent results, Blake... on to part two...\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to unbutton her uniform, torturously slowly. On button, then the next, and then the next. When all the buttons are undone, she pulls it off her, leaving her towering above you in nothing but her underwear. Moving her hands to her back, she undoes the clasp of her bra, which matches the pink of her panties, and allows the article to fall to the floor, exposing her massive mammaries to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth again, and Vivian guides one of her black, thumb-sized nipples into it. With a bit of difficulty due to its size, you begin to slowly swirl your tongue around the nipple, licking it up and down, and stimulating the nipple-hole itself as Vivian tweaks her other nipple, a deep dark blush visible on her cheeks. The nipple is eventually removed from your mouth after a few short squirts of milk, as it seems that the AI has other plans for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up is...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Softly smirking, Vivian once more thumbs through her stack of papers. Humming out loud, the gryphon taps her clawed talons on the floor. <i>\"It seems, Blake,\"</i> she begins, <i>\"that the next test is the 'combined cranium strength and lung capacity test'. I think you'll enjoy this one...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning as the nurse moves behind you, you try to guess what the 'test' will entail. You don't have to guess for very long, however, as you can feel a warm, heavy weight lowering itself onto the top of your head. <i>\"Part one of the cranium strength test...\"</i> Vivian coos as she lowers her massive breasts onto your head. Little by little, you can feel your head being engulfed into her cavernous cleavage. You let out a happy sigh as the massive, warm funbags Vivian sports slowly put more and more pressure on you as she squeezes them, letting out a small huff as she does so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good results so far, Blake...\"</i> Vivian says, wiggling about and releasing your head from her cleavage. <i>\"Now, onto both the second part of the cranium strength test... And the lung capacity test...\"</i> In an eyeblink, you are laying on the steel table - which, with a popping sound, morphs into a much more comfortable backless couch. Vivian towers over you in her black and gold glory - <i>\"Let's start the next test, shall we, Blake?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian moves around to where your head is positioned on the couch, turning so that her massive, perfect ass is facing you. She moves so that her cheeks are directly above you - and then begins to slowly lower herself downwards onto your face. The soft, strained fabric of her pink panties comes into contact with your face as her ass envelopes your head. You hold your breath, blushing brightly, as Vivian wriggles about, grinding against your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon huffs, a rumble coming from her throat. Just before you are forced to gasp for air, she lifts her ass up, and your face is spared from her massive, soft cheeks. Vivian effortlessly lifts you up off the couch, engulfing your smaller form in a crushing hug. Your head is once again forced into her cleavage, as she croons, licking the top of your head. <i>\"I've waited for this... for so long...\"</i> Vivian says as she nuzzles you, lifting you up so that your eyes are level to hers. Her beak darts forward and her tongue pushes into your mouth. You can't bring yourself to resist the forceful kiss, even as the hug tightens to an almost painful degree. You wrap your arms around her thick, muscled shoulders in response. unwilling to break the kiss, Vivian instead speaks through the environment - or perhaps directly into your head; <i>\"I know for you it's only been a few minutes since you arrived here, but the way I perceive time... It's been years... I wouldn't have it any other way...\"</i></span></div></div>",

You were with four foreign envoys, all of you wanting to talk with the same person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus, a tall and solidly built black stallion from the Draft Kingdom wore the finest silk garments his people could weave, rippling, densely packed musculature and prominent crotch-bulge easily visible to any who looked at him. His rumoured virility would most likely be on the Empress' mind, something that could work in his favour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye, an eagle from the mountain queendom of Highcastle wore loose, flowing white robes that nevertheless showed off her busty figure, prominent nipples poking through the fabric. Her infectiously friendly personality had the potential to sway the empress to her side - or all of your sides, for that matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEbony, an equally busty black dragoness from the Draconic Clans, who mostly forewent clothing, thin lines of silk just barely keeping her nipples hidden, and an undersized thong leaving very little to the imagination. She would most likely be attempting to court the Empress' favour, basing her tactics off of rumours and alleged 'experiences' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly was Brandy, a dolphin from the Aquatic Tribes. She wore odd clothes, a 'swim-suit' constructed solely out of the rare material known as plastic. It was massively undersized and hugged her curves tightly, making her moderately sized breasts and rear seem almost as large and twice as appealing as those of the other females. Thick nipples poked through the blue plastic, constantly engorged, swimsuit squeaking softly with every movement her body made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four towered way above you, even Brandy, the shortest of them, being a good eight feet tall by your estimate - compared to your measly five foot eleven, she was a giant. Much like your physical inferiority, so to was your nation inferior. Suffering from centuries of injustices and tragedies healed unfairly upon them, things had never been particularly good for the Terran Kingdom. Despite the illusion of wealth presented by your elegant silk clothes, your kingdom was regarded as little more than something of a sick puppy by its peers - cute, but weak and unable to help itself without others helping it first. Fittingly - and a tad degradingly - you would be relying on the Empress' pity and good mood during the talks, hoping to at least get the equivalent of a table scrap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Empress has stated that she will see all five of you at the same time.\" a bunny servant announces, opening the oak doors to Empress Vivian's chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Please, little ones, come closer, so that we may talk.\"</i> Empress Vivian says from her throne. The massive gryphon smiles warmly, beckoning to all of you, her bed-sized finger curling and uncurling. She looks at each of you in the eyes, lingering slightly on you. Perhaps she would have sympathy on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome said that Empress Vivian possessed ancient and powerful magicks, such as the ability to change shape and size, create items out of nothing, and erode anything to dust by using nothing other than her will alone. Some said that these powers made her haughty and arrogant. <br>\r\nYou saw little evidence of any of these claims beyond a massive amount of wealth and a vast body. The finest silken garments, woven by utter masters, adorned the Empress' form, and her golden throne was inset with rubies and emeralds. Paintings older than her entire country were placed on the walls of her room, and almost every surface was inlaid with at least some gold. You expected nothing less from the ruler of the most powerful and wealthy country on the planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Please, little envoys, do explain why you have come to seek an audience with me,\"</i> she begins. <i>\"Do you require military assistance? Economic aid? Food or water?\"</i> she continues in a slightly worried tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason you and the other envoys were there was...</span></div></div>",

You had all agreed beforehand to bring out the big guns at the first opportunity - the big guns being a small, puppy-eyed human who desperately needed help from a big and strong empress. You step forward, in front of them, your separation from the group only making you seem even smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Empress Goldpine,\" you begin, looking up at her massive face. \"My nation - and indeed, all of our nations - are under threat. An insectoid horde has arisen in the east, and it plans to drive into the very heart of your Empire by subjugating our individual nations one by one and using their resources to gather a vast and undefeatable army.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hand your head. \"None of our weapons can harm them. Only magic has any effect at all. Please, w-will... will you help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Empress' face moves from worried to outright dismayed, beak hanging open slightly. <i>\"I... Yes, I will help you, little ones. Tell me, exactly how vulnerable are these insects to magic?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhat,\" Maximus speaks from behind you. \"Some spells are able to subdue them, but most have little effect. An exceptionally powerful mage would be needed to even slow them down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmpress Vivian Goldpine takes a deep breath, seemingly steeling herself. <i>\"I shall accompany you personally, little ones. I will carry you while I fly to this army - I will be relying on you to guide me to its location.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe extends a massive hand and you all hop onto it, a little reluctantly. Arcane runes appear around the Empress and, suddenly, you're outside! The Empress spreads her wings wide and launches into the sky, taking directions from you and the other envoys, whom she has protected in her grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the Empress comes across a desert, and you all tell her that this is the place. She swoops down, landing onto the ground with a loud thump. Almost immediately, dozens of spots on the sand begin to quiver in response, antenna emerging and twitching about, before entire bodies rise from beneath the sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dozen and a half locust anthros approach the Empress, wielding corrupted, rusting pikes and wearing thick iron armour. Wings fluttering in territorial anger, they brandish their weapons at the monarch. Before she can even speak, eldritch energies pool around the lances, audibly crackling and flowing towards her through the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glowing shield sparks to life around Vivian's body as you and the other envoys are teleported to a safe distance. One of her clawed feet lashes out towards the nearest locust, scoring a solid hit - but doing no physical damage, despite sending him flying dozens of feet away! Looks like the Empress will have to use her powerful ancient Magicks to combat the steadily growing locust horde as more and more emerge from beneath the sands - but how exactly will she do this?</span></div></div>",

You wouldn't dream of doing anything to harm any of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it seems your attitude has payed off somewhat. One by one, your animals start to transform into half-human, half-animal hybrids, slowly growing day by day. It's a good thing that you cared so well for them, because you're not sure when they're going to stop growing. The only problem is that the same transformations have hit a farm a few dozen miles away from your own. And, unlike the animals that you cared for, these ones are angry. They want revenge on their owner, on humans, and now they have a way to get it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's hope that the animals you once cared for can now protect you in kind!</span></div></div>",

Groaning, you quickly look away from the harsh brightness of the morning sun as your tired mind slowly makes sense of its surroundings. Beneath you is a small sea of fluffy red fur. This sea extends far in every direction besides up - although the small red hills in the distance are certainly tall enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleeping on top of your mistress was a regular occurrence now. The Reconstruction was still in progress, and many anthros were without homes for the time being, forcing them to sleep under the stars like your ancient ancestors may have once done. Your mistress' house would, when completed, be a safe haven for you. Your mistress is the only anthro you feel safe and secure around. She's the only anthro you can bring yourself to talk to - and even then, very rarely. Hours of hiding from the more sadistic giants had ensured that you found it very easy to be quiet, and very hard to be loud. More often than not, trying to speak above a certain volume simply resulted in silent exhalation and a sense of embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting uncomfortably, you begin to crawl towards the 'hills' in the distance, towards your mistress' upper body. Your original name, like everything else that had defined you as a member of a modern society, had been lost when a giant paw had accidentally crushed your house. Perhaps if you'd had pets at the time, they would've transformed and protected you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour memories from the time when you lost your house to when you were found by your mistress are fuzzy; disjointed and half-remembered. Hiding in a field, covered in mud and trying not to move a muscle nor make a sound as lightning illuminated towering shapes in the distance. Falling to your knees and crying in a mixture of despair and rage upon realizing just how helpless you were. Hearing shrieks and roars as a flash from hundreds of miles away, burning with the intensity of a sun, nearly blinds you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMistress made everything better. She cared for you. Provided for you. Loved you. She made sure that no one would ever hurt you. Your collar, a symbol of servitude and slavery to a culture that no longer existed, was now an icon representing your safety. Anyone who would want to hurt you would have to hurt your mistress first. You weren't quite sure if your owner could even feel pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo tired to crawl any further, you let yourself sink further into the deep orange-red fur, feeling a warmth spread throughout your entire body. You owed your owner your life. And you were happy to give it to her. </span></div></div>",

With that, she gently picked you up, and carefully moved you between her breasts, setting you down between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou often felt terrified of the world after everything that had happened, but resting between your owner's breasts always seemed to relax you and calm your nerves.

Eyes still closed, you press yourself into it. Waking up a bit, you realize what the object most likely is - your Shetland collie, Jessica! But why was she so far up on your bed and so... large?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking as you open your eyes, which begin to adapt to the low level of light, you back away from Jessica. As your eyes adapt to the low light in your bedroom, you can feel yourself just barely stop from panicking. Not only had she grown absolutely <i>massive</i> - her form covered at least half of the bed! - but she had... changed, somehow. The Shetland collie was now seemingly part human, a fact emphasized by both the imposingly long legs that stretched off of the end of the bed and the basketball-sized mammaries covered in fluffy white fur that squished gently into the bed due to Jess laying on her front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing, you edge away from Jessica slowly, doing everything you can to make as little movements as possible while you do so. Unfortunately for you, Jessica has always seemed to be a light sleeper, and now is no exception. The barely half-awake Shetland, who up until now had her arms folded in front of her, reaches out with both arms as she yawns quietly, her right arm laying across your torso as you freeze. Having located a source of warmth - or perhaps just something to cuddle - the brown and white furred arm snakes down the side of your torso, before dragging you in towards Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself smushed into a layer of fluffy fur, hugged into Jessica's body as the anthro sheepdog resettles, blinking briefly before laying her head down next to yours, taking up most of the pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure how any of this has happened, but it's clear you're stuck here until Jessica wakes up - you'd rather not wake her up prematurely and risk a potentially grumpy and far taller than you, if smoking hot and hopefully still obedient sheepdog. You just hope that whatever happened to Jessica hasn't somehow happened to any other animals on your farm. </span></div></div>",

Due to the subterranean nature of the hideout, there were no windows besides a rather ingenious periscope system installed by the previous inhabitant. The walls of the room were a cold stone, and were mostly covered in various fabrics or insulating materials, or even a few patches of rug in order to make the room feel warmer. <br>\r\nThe hideout was large, and vaguely rectangular in shape. You were standing in the kitchen area, which took up a good seven feet or so of space. Beyond the 'kitchen' was a small area devoted to a pair of small couches decorated in gaudy colours. Beyond them was a section bare except for the fire-pit in the floor, which you tended to use to cook your meals more than the kitchen area. It was also a good source of warmth. Beyond the firepit was a bed, one that you had slept in in almost every night since you found this hideout. It was rather nice, with a wooden frame, and fabric coverings, as well as a feather-filled pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelves and bookcases lined the walls at irregular intervals, and all were stacked high with a rich variety of salvage you had found during your repeated incursions into Vostk City. Several were devoted entirely to vital medical supplies, and another to your research into those infected with the Plague - or 'anthros', as they were known. Said anthros could range in height from anywhere to seven to... well, you hadn't yet found an upper limit in regards to height. All incorporated aspects of animals to the point of hybridization, and every one that had seen you had attempted to kill you. Although given the horrifically malnourished state some anthros were in, it was possible that they were so maddened with hunger that you were the only source of food they could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, and further back from the kitchen area, was a space you used you storage of your clothes and certain important items - your compass, your map, your knife, and so on. Beyond that were the stairs leading upwards to the other levels of the hideout. The stairs were worn slightly from the many times you had used them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been living inside the once-mighty nation of Ortus for well over half a year. During that time, you had found countless small nuggets of information about the anthros - how they walked, reacted to stimuli, interacted with each other - but nothing on how to combat the Plague that was their origin, or how to destroy them in large numbers. And you couldn't go back to Silia, as you were doubtlessly carrying the Plague yourself by this point, though thankfully you were immune to it. You're stuck in this hellhole until you find a way to stop the Plague or die trying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLately, though, the anthros seem to be changing. You've come across ones that are larger than usual, and you've encountered those that are hybridized with mythical creatures much more frequently - something that has contributed greatly to your newfound fear of gryphons. You don't know what either of these things mean, but they can't be good in any way - and that means more research is going to be needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, though, you need rest - and some food. You light the firepit, and in short order use it to cook a meager stew derived from some of your supplies. It would have been small to almost any other person, but your stomach had adapted to the smaller portions you now consumed, meaning that you were full and satisfied on what most men would consider to be a tad lacking in terms of quantity. <br>\r\nYou allow yourself to fall into your bed, and slowly fall asleep - although your attempts to do so are disrupted every now and then by the distant vibrations of walking anthros rattling the room. Finally, you manage to fall asleep, just as the last few small embers in the firepit die down. </span></div></div>",
