All Kat can do is shrug as her legs start to get absorbed by the rest of her body. After about 10 minutes, the girls are filled up to the point where they're rounded by the stuff. The girls are 30 feet wide each, and are one hundred times as heavy in pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls don't say anyting for a while, but Ana suddenly breaks the silence with a giggle. \"Ooooh...I think I'm starting to enjoy myself...\" Ana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat starts to object, but realizes that she's enjoying herself as well. \"You're...right.

With that, Ana feels the heavy liquid inside her start to expand her again due to the violent charge at the tree. Kat looks astonished as Ana fills up to be about 50 feet wide and stops there. Kat feels a bit left out and very carefully scoops up 10 of the round fruits and eats through them like nothing.<br>\r\n  \"Wow Kat, look at you!\"<br>\r\n  As she said that Kat grew out to become 85 feet wide all around and could feel all the liquid inside her sloshing about. <br>\r\n  \"I think my lungs are somewhat bigger, I mean if they weren't i'd probably have drowned in liquid by now.\"<br>\r\n  Kat then drew on her lungs and breathed in deeply, little did she know that the liquid had a reaction to excess air. In that very instant all the liquid that rested inside Kat wanted to escape through her skin to get away from the air that was also inside her gigantic spherical body. This made her triple in size and begin to be able to move about as long as she had air inside her belly.<br>\r\n  \"Okay Ana, I want you to eat some more of those fruits and do as I do.\"<br>\r\n  \"Sure thing, I can't move as is..\"<br>\r\n  \"Come on, I know you can do it!\"<br>\r\n  \"Alright Kat, i'll try.\"<br>\r\nAna rammed the tree again, but this time caught the falling fruits in her mouth on the way down, she had 23 by the time the side effects had kicked in.<br>\r\n  \"Here we go!\" Yelled Ana<br>\r\nAna's whole frame began to squeal under the bloat of the new juices inside of her, and she watched to see exactly what Kat was doing to stand up, but didn't understand and continued to expand.<br>\r\n  By the time she stopped she wasn't much bigger than Kat size wise without sucking in air, but she was MUCH heavier. <br>\r\n  \"I didn't get it, so I just went with what the fruit was going to do to me.\"<br>\r\n  \"That's okay, now this is what I want you to do, suck in as much air as you can, not exactly into your lungs as I thought of, but just swallow air down into your belly.\"<br>\r\n  Ana thought about it, and then with one enormous gulp she sucked in so much air that she was now touching Kat with her bloated form at a distance.<br>\r\n  \"Holy crap Ana, that was amazing.\"<br>\r\n  Ana has a plan..</span></div></div>",

Soon, Ashley reaches the same size as the girls are, only she looks slightly like she's packed full of the fluid the girls are only partially filled with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls giggle a bit as they waddle over to Ashley, who is genuinely shocked. \"Why are you moving?!\" she asks, being unable to move herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls giggle as they look Ashley over. \"Hehe. We filled ourselves with air in addition to the stuff from the fruits. It seems like you're purely filled with that stuff.\" Kat explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smirks. \"Oh? Hehe, I don't think you girls should have told me that...\" she says. The girls are forced to back off as Ashley quickly fills herself with air, which causes her to tower over both of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon, both girls find themselves droping towards a giant red surface that is actually Ashley's massive body. It seems Ashley is big enough to now be the center of gravity, which has caught the girls but not the planet. Ashley grins as the planet disappears over her horizon while the Kat and Ana plop down in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, how's that? Impressed?\" Ashley says, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna shrugs. \"Doesn't really solve the original problem of you not being able to move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Since you're so big, you've become the center of gravity around here, which means you won't be able to move unless you find something bigger to stand on.\" Kat explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley blinks. \"So, I still planned on this.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, plan this, then!\" Kat says as she waddles over to Ashley's head and promptly sits down in that spot. \"Hehe, can't do much when I'm sitting on your head, can you?\" she asks, which prompts a giggle from Ana.

She then starts stirring for a while, but nothing seems to be happening to the contents. After a few more minutes of stirring, Ashley sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh. Another failed potion...\" Ashley says disappointedly. She shrugs, and goes over to a shelf and pulls out rather large spellbook. However, as she turns to a page she bookmarked, the contents of the potion begins to ebb a little. Ashley is too caught up in trying to find her mistake to notice, but Red sees this immediately.<br>\r\n\"A-ashley! It's...moving!\" he shouts. Ashley groans. \"I have lots of things that move, Red. If you're going to bother me while I'm in the middle of something, and you at least tell me what is moving?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ashley says this, some sort of odd cylinder-shaped thing has spawned from the potion. Not surprisingly, the thing looks like the scuba tank Ashley tossed into the potion. The main difference is now the tank has a pair of eyes, that are looking right at Ashley. The damage of the air tank seems to have been repaired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take a look of the cauldron!\" Red shouts again, worried that the newly spawned creature is about to do something to Ashley. Ashley lets out a n annoyed sigh, and turns toward the cauldron. \"Ok, Red, let's see what you're trying t-\" she begins, cutting herself off as she sees the tank monster. \"Whoa! It wasn't supposed to do that...but hey, it did something!\" she says, as she lightly grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the creature suddenly zips over to Ashley and spins behind her. Before Ashley can even react, the creature has slapped the mouth piece of the tank into Ashley's mouth. As it does this, it's eyes shift into a happy position. Both Ashley and Red's eyes widen as they suddenly hear a loud hissing sound coming from the tank.</span></div></div>",

With a loud creak, the walls of the mansion burst open, revealing a mansion-sized Ashley balloon where her mansion once was. At this point, the creature detaches the mouth piece from Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, Ashley is speechless.

Aha... salami... white mushrooms... salmon... bananas... spinach... a piece from the moon... extra cheese... and a diet cola. Okay, your pizza will be delivered in about 20 minutes. Thank you very much! Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona hung up the phone, taking a casual look at the watch. 'Oh oh!' she thought 'I'll be late for cheerleading!' she was already dressed in her uniform to save time, but even if she drove to the training immediately after the delivery, it would be tough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly grabbed a piece of pizza dough, kneading it while looking for the ingredients. On the shelves in front of her, packed in little bottles, she saw slices of bananas, spinach, salami, salmon...<br>\r\nThe pizza dough tore apart as Mona noticed there was one ingredient missing. \"Oh no!\" she gasped \"I should have known! I should have noticed when he called us, but I was too much in a hurry to listen! I should have known we don't have any - white mushrooms any more as we used up the last ones yesterday.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic-stricken, Mona tried to come up with something. Buying some more at the market? No, that would take too much time. Then, an idea crossed her mind: There were other mushrooms in the storage, a fresh delivery from a far away land. 'Maybe one of those tastes like white mushroom.' she hoped, walking over to the storage door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill went down her spine as she entered the gloomy, cold room. Her teeth were shaking, her bare legs shivered as well as her arms. \"I-I should have \"d-dressed in th-thicker c-c-c-clothes.\" she murmured. Hugging herself, Mona searched the crates. She finally found one titled \"From: Mushroom Kingdom\". Still freezing, she opened the box: it was filled with mushrooms of all sizes and colours, many of them having spots, stripes or other kinds of patterns. What all of them had in common were two dots on their stalks which somehow looked like eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, Mona inspected the fungi until spotting one which woke her attention: It was completely white except for the eyes, looking like it had been painted. She picked it out of the other mushrooms to examine it in her hands. \"Maybe this one tastes like white mushroom.\" she wondered. She knew there was only one way to find out, so she took a bite from it. As she chew the fungus, Mona found it was pretty much tasting like... milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a burst went through the teenage girl, sending a warm sensation through her shivering body. She dropped the mushroom, stumbling backwards as she tried to hold onto something. \"What's goin...?\" She was interrupted by a strange feeling in her chest which suddenly felt like it was blowing up... and as she looked down, Mona saw it actually did! Her modest breasts grew inside her cheerleading uniform, growing an inch by each second. Soon the fabric of her already tight top started to stretch, her breasts having grown into small spheres to big to cover them with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a nearby crate, leaning against it as her bosom tried to drag her to the ground. Her expansion continued, her top sliding up her belly as her breasts had taken all free space. They pressed against her tight uniform, being as big as a CD in diameter, her shirt starting to get transparent around chest. It was painful, even more so as her bra was straining her back. Finally, it snapped off, her breasts once more growing another three inches before ripping up her front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona looked down at her chest. She stared right into the wide depths of her cleavage, going down almost her entire breasts while squeezing her breasts together. As she pulled her broken bra out of her uniform, she was still in a state of shock and surprise, not really realizing what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, standing inside the storeroom in torn cheerleading clothes with big breasts while holding a bra in her hand, she came back to senses. How will she react?</span></div></div>",

She leaned over its edge, letting her breasts fall from her body, and began to rummage through the mushrooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn orange one with black stripes caught her attention. After pulling it out of the lot, she immediately took a bite from it. Chewing on it, a cat-tail suddenly shot out from her butt, lifting her skirt up to reveal her panties. Also, a pair of cat ears grew at the sides of her hair, making her look like an anthropomorphic anime character. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Mona put the mushroom back, and took another one. This one looked like it was painted, shimmering in a red tone. She ate a piece from it, analysing the taste. Her mouth then began to change, gaining the shape of kissing lips after a while. It also looked like Mona wore lip stick, making her mouth shine in a ruby- red glamour. The mushroom didn't taste like white mushroom though, so she put it back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnconsciously waving with her tail as she continued her search, she found another red one that looked like it was made out of rubber. She took a bite. This time, her clothes began to change, their fabric transforming into red latex. Her already bare midriff top rose even higher, her ripped up cleavage turning into a clean V-neck, getting a bit larger in the process. Her skirt also grew shorter, her underwear at the same time turning from white to pink, shrinking to reveal some of her buttocks. Also, all of her clothes grew tighter around her body, emphasising her female curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mona felt her legs were pushed up: Her shoes had turned into red high-heels, making her a bit taller. Now her breasts were dragging her into the pile of mushrooms while her skirt was gliding over her entire butt. Grabbing the edge of the crate, she avoided falling into it, her new tail automatically trying to rebalance her. As she pulled herself out box, her skirt sliding down her butt again, a white-coloured mushroom was inside her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the same one as before, and it looked a little different - a bit paler - , but she could also just imagine it.<br>\r\n'Guess there's only one way to find out', she thought, closing her mouth. The mushroom fell back in the crate, Mona meanwhile eating the piece she had bitten off it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat effect will the mushroom have?</span></div></div>",

At the bottom of the crate then she spotted another white mushroom, and after pulling it out Mona found it was just what she was looking for. \"Perfect! Now I can finally make the pizza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith fast steps she left the storage, ignoring the bouncing of her breasts. A few trained hand holds and fifteen minutes in the oven later, and the pizza was ready to be delivered. She put it into a box, smelling its delicious scent. \"Hm, yummy!\" she smiled, closing the box. A peek at the clock told her she had just enough time to deliver the pizza and get to her cheerleader training in time. Quickly Mona slipped into her coat and under her helmet, then left the kitchen with the pizza under her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer moped stood on the sidewalk, ready for her to drive. After putting the box on the backseat she swung herself on it, some people on the street turning their heads as her chest swayed from side to side. Still oblivious to her body's new proportions she waved in their direction, starting her moped. All male eyes were set on her as she drove off, her bust vibrating to the sounds of her engine.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The house of her customer was located on a cliff slightly outside of town. Mona drove along the road next to the cliff, her breasts bouncing slightly from time to time. 'If I hurry I'll make it in time for the cheerleader training', she thought, accelerating a little. In the distance she could already see the house. \u201cGood!\u201d, said to herself. Her cheerleader top stretched a little as she sighed in relief. \u201cNo way I'm gonna be late now, except a meteor crashes down to earth or something.\u201d Suddenly, Mona heard a sound above her like something was falling from the sky, and she turned her head. From the blue sky a meteor was coming down towards her, moving at a fast speed in her direction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, it was only two inches big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely felt as the little stone bumped against her shoulder. The impact was so weak even her bosom didn\u2019t react to it. The meteor fell to the street, rolling down the cliff and then into the sea. Mona rubbed her shoulder, blinking a few times. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d, she asked herself. Oblivious and easy-going as she was Mona eventually shrugged it off, and concentrated on the street again. The house was quickly getting closer, Mona smiling as she soon thought only about her delivery and the cheerleading again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her, the meteor had left an alien energy inside her body. This energy was slowly moving from her shoulder towards her chest, settling into her baseball-sized globes. As her bosom filled with the weird energy it began to glow slightly, shining in a green light through the fabric of her top. It wasn\u2019t until her breasts started tingling that Mona looked down herself, being a little surprised as she saw her chest was glowing like a neon light. Looking at her bosom Mona didn\u2019t notice she wasn\u2019t driving right towards a bump in the street. When her moped hit the hole it made a small jump into the air. Mona squeaking as she and her vehicle hopped up before landing back on the street. Her fluoridating breasts bounced and jiggled, while Mona had some trouble to get her moped back under control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the glowing from her breasts increased. Jumping up and down they slowly began to grow again, squeezing each other as they fought for the space inside her top. The fabric groaned, stretching around her growing and glowing bosom, while her jacket was slowly pushed aside. As they curved out from her body, growing steadily rounder and firmer, the sensitivity of her breasts increased as well. The bounces and the growing tightness of her shirt made Mona feel jittery all over, pleasant feelings going through her whole body.  Flaring out to all sides the curves of her breasts bulged outwards, reaching the volume of large grapefruits. Her luscious meat flowed to all sides, putting her shirt under rising pressure. The colours of her shirt lightened up as the fabric grew thinner, making the light from her breasts shine brighter through it. They were still jiggling a little, and though the space inside her top was getting rather cramped there was just enough room for them to bump against each other, increasing the sensation inside the young girl. Mona blushed slightly, trying to keep her eyes open since she had to concentrate on the street. Even when the bouncing stopped her breasts continued to shake slightly from the roaring of her engine, the vibrations arousing Mona further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud rip a tear appeared on the front of her shirt. It was just an inch long and barely a half one wide, but slowly was getting bigger as her swelling orbs pressed against the fabric. The tear filled with cleavage as her breasts squeezed against each other, sending another subtle pleasure through Mona. Proudly and firm her bosom stood out from the rest of her slender figure, Mona having to lean forward slightly as the weight was dragging her. A bright flash suddenly shone from her breasts, blinding Mona for a second. When she looked down again she saw her breasts had stopped glowing, and to an extent were not growing anymore. Being all round and firm the cheerleader captain\u2019s breasts had gained the rough diameter of a CD, and were very sensitive to every little touch. Without a bra and only covered in a top that did a very insufficient job of supporting her new weight Mona\u2019s bosom jiggled and bounced at every slight impact, each little bump on the street making that it hopped up and down. After a while Mona moaned, putting a hand over one of her globes. The tense fabric groaned slightly as she cupped her breast with her hand, forcing more lustful sounds out of her mouth. After a while though she had to put her hand back on the handlebar as driving with one hand became a little tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mona arrived at the house of her client\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her hair glows star white as she murmurs a spell to herself. \"Stop laughing at MY ass and get YOUR ass on it!\" she shouts as she throws a few bright-blue fireballs at Red, which prompts Red to quickly run into the mansion as each fireball narrowly misses him. She sighs as her hair returns to it's usual coal black color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as quickly as he ran into the house, Red runs back out and has the rope tied to one of the trees. He then runs over to Ashley. \"H-here!\" he stammers nervously as he tosses the rope up to Ashley. She catches it in her hands, looks up at her butt, and ends up tying it around her torso.

So holding her two now metre long butt cheeks together as she started to turn red from the pressure she waits. And waits. Her cheeks start to slowly rumble, seemingly gurgling for an outlet to 'let-out' whatever was building up inside. After another 5 minutes of grueling waiting, the teenage witch decides it's time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly releases her hands, only to find her butt cheeks to grow strangely quiet. \"What!? What a rip-off!\" She starts to pout, for once losing her cool over her sudden inability to... Fart. \"Seriously, what the fuc-\" After a couple seconds of delay, her ass explodes. Not literally, of course. Yet her gas IS an explosion of colossal proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPRRRRPPPPFFFFFPPPPTTTTT*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a miniature atomic bomb going off in her mansion, the entire mansion trembles, windows falling and the like. The sound can be heard throughout the entire city, echoing for a few moments, near breaking the sound barrier. Her tights are nearly ripped to shreds by the atomic fart, with the rest of her bedroom having a thick, hazy, green fog covering it. It smells absolutely foul; everything seems eerily stained green, and looking at Ashley's now exposed cheeks, one could see a good deal of some 'stains' were left on the now absurdly large cheeks. All that was left was a panting, blushing Ashley. \"*Huff...* Oh man... *Breaths in* That was... The...\" She takes in a deep whiff of her own funk. \"Single best moment in my LIFE!\" She starts laughing as she awkwardly heaves herself back onto her feet, her legs slightly expanding to accommodate the new junk in the rump. She doesn't have much time to celebrate however: taking a quick glance through the window, Ashley spies...</span></div></div>",

Ashley then glared at Mona and said \"but there are pre-cautions.\" Then Ashley, with a quick snap, made some magical items appear. Then Ashley took out a blue vile. \"Drink this\" Ashley said, \"and whatever you wish will happen.\" Mona looked at it..but feeling a bit thirsty anyway went with it. \"Well..here goes nothing\" And in a gulp, Mona imagined herself with an inflated head...suddenly..she felt her head feel strange. \"ooh\" Mona said as the sound of air inflated her head. Mona's cheeks puffed out like basketballs..and her eyeballs bugged out a little..second by second Mona's head inflated huge like a round beach ball. \"My goodness..\" Mona laughed \"this is wonderful..thanks Ashley.\" \"But remember\" Ashley told her again \"there are pre-cautions.\" \"What kind\" Mona asked. \"Well..you know..slight airheaded-ness, puffy cheeks..and you might fart a bit.\" Ashley giggled. \"FART?..but this is my head.\" Mona shouted.

The pink-haired kindergarten shrieks from the sudden inflation as she examines her body; a sphere measuring six feet in height and width with puny hands, feet, and a head attached to its massive girth. She took a cumbersome step and immediately regretted it. Unaccustomed with her new mass, she wobbled precariously from her lack of balance, feverishly flapping her hands as her stability deteriorated. With a screech, she tumbled to the floor belly first. The resulting impact caused a bellowing fart to escape from the spherical ninja girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ana, Ashley, and Mona were all laughing their butts off at the spectacle before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahaha!

There was a small chest which seemed to have never been opened before sitting behind some boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what do you know? Maybe I found something really cool!\" Ana giggled, as she went over to the box. Looking into the plush interior, she found a sealed scroll. \"...oh, wow! Things like these usually have some sort of ancient knowledge on them! I wonder what I'll find when I read it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna unsealed the scroll and read it. \"Hrum... it looks like this thing is supposed to teach some sort of spell... 'Art of the Blimp', it says. ...'Art of the Blimp'? What a weird name for a technique! I wonder what it does. I wonder if I should go into the forest somewhere and try it out by myself...

The mantra sounds like it's in a different language, most likely Japanese, though. A few moments after she says the mantra, a fierce, almost tornado-like wind whirls around her. Ana can feel the wind forcing it's way into her body, causing her to expand rapidly. Almost immediately her limbs grow even with her whole body, rendering her very round as her whole body expands several feet wider with each passing second. Ana helplessly wiggles her hands and feet as her body continues to bulge outward, and soon finds herself rolled onto her front. Once on her front, Ana feels her body starting to elongate as she's stretched into the shape of a proper blimp. She can feel her whole head starting to form the front of the blimp. Before long, the wind starts to die down, leaving a very shocked Ana to realize she had just grown into a 500 foot long blimp in all of a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna simply stays quiet for a few minutes, before she suddenly hears something in the bushes. \u201cKat?!\u201d Ana asks, hoping that it actually was her sister...</span></div></div>",

It shouldn't be that much further.\" she says, as they make their way into what seems to be a clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...or it could be right here.\" Ana says, pointing out what Kat had described. While it isn't exactly what Kat had imagined, it certainly was a sight to see. The cliff is formed by a 1000 foot wide ring that drops into what seems to be nothingness. The island itself seems to be rather large, though, stretching at least 10 miles from the middle. The 4 foot wide rope bridge is, oddly enough, in perfect condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah. Told you we would find it.\" Kat says, as the two of them walk up to the rope bridge. The bridge has a sign next to it that has an image of a foot next to an arrow pointing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna scratches her head. \"I don't get it...why would a rope bridge need a sign saying that it should only be crossed by foot?\" she wonders. Kat just rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how the saying goes: 'Stupid actions cause stupid rules'. I'm sure somebody tried to cross it in a vehicle of some sort.\" Kat says, as she looks down at the cliff. \"Hate to fall down there, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the girls begin crossing the bridge. As they walk along, the notice that something seems odd. \"Kat, is it just me or is this bridge getting more narrow as we reach the end of it?\" Ana asks, felling less of the bridge with her feet with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it, it does seem kind of odd seeing that the bridge...hasn't...changed...\" Kat says, trailing off as if suddenly realizing something. She looks down to see that her feet were puffed up, just barely wide enough to fit on the bridge. She looks back at Ana and sees that her feet are in the same condition. Each of their feet are around two feet wide and four feet long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls blink as they recall the sign and realize what it really meant. Now that they are standing still, they can feel their feet continue to swell up. Ana begins to panic as she realizes their feet will continue to swell until they're either off the bridge or have fallen off. \"What are we going to do, Kat! If our feet keep growing at this rate we won't be able to stay on the bridge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat just rolls her eyes as if the answer was obvious, which in her case, it was. \"We just keep going. If we stand around, our feet'll get too big to keep us balanced on the bridge.\" Kat says, as their feet suddenly rip out of their shoes as if on cue. Kat remains collected, though, and just moves onward. Ana shrugs and walks along with her.</span></div></div>",

We'll have to find another way off...somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna begins to calm down. \"I don't mind.\" She says, as she plops onto her feet, which are two feet longer than Kat's. \"At least it'll be better than the bridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat rolls her eyes as she looks through the clearing they're in. Unlike most islands, it's covered in a large forest rather than a jungle. She notices a large rectangular stone with a message written in Katakana written on it. \"Hum...'The legendary scroll can restore your body'\" she reads aloud. \"Hey, this means we can find it and restore our feet to normal. Then we can safely cross the bridge again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna's eyes widen. \"No! No bridge! We're finding another way!\" she says, half in anger, and half in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat sighs. \"Fine, but let's at least find that scroll. It's kinda hard to be stealthy with our feet bigger than us.\" She says, lifting her left foot and letting it fall back down with a loud 'plop!' sound to demonstrate this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna nods. \"All right, then...so...how do we find this scroll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat looks around to see that there are a couple of paths. The island, which is a mixture of forested areas and man-made walls, seems to be set up a lot like a structure. \"Maybe we should split up? There has to be a million ways to get where we're going.\" Kat suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a million ways to get seperated from each other! I think we should stick together.\" says Ana.</span></div></div>",

After walking a quarter of a mile, she finds what seems to be a very large hole in the wall, at least 15 feet wide. However, what's unusual about it is that it doesn't look like it is supposed to be there, as bricks stick out from the sides. Something else that she finds odd is that it looks like it was made recently, at least a few days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...this must mean that somebody else is on this island.\" Ana says, as she goes inside. Sure enough, the hole leads to a clearing where it looks like someone has set up camp. It's appearance is crude, though, with it's only contents being a bed made from whatever could be thrown together to make a soft surface and a pillow which is little more than a sack filled with leaves. It looks like the bed and pillow haven't seen a lot of use, though. \"Huh...I guess whoever was here must have moved on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I just outgrew the bed and the pillow.\" says the voice of a young girl behind her. Ana turns around expecting to see a small girl, only to find a large, puffy-looking girl instead. \"Using myself as a bed is more comfortable, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looks like she's at least 5 feet wide and is mostly round. Her age seems to be around ten or so. She's wearing a pink dress that stretches about halfway down her puffy body, leaving only her panties to cover her lower body. The dress also has a heart design in the middle of her. She wears a simple pair of red boots and wristbands, as well as a set of headphones on her head. Ana realizes who she is around the same time she notices that she doesn't have puffy feet like she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...you're that singer girl...uhm...Nao Komori, right...wait, how did you end up here...and like that...without puffy feet!?\" she says, looking at her in a confused manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKomori shrugs. \"I have no clue...I've been stuck here for a while now, since I realized what would happen to my feet if I tried to cross the bridge before I crossed it...which you apparently did not.\" she says, as Ana blushes a bit. \"I must have slept through whatever happened, because that's the last thing I remember doing before I woke up on this island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna nods. \"Uh huh...but that doesn't explain the puffyness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, I found an odd fruit. You could say it really fills you up for a day or so, as you can see.\" Komori explains, as she pats her bloated body a bit. \"It's pretty nice once you get used to it...so, anyway, how'd you end up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna explains about how they're searching for the healing scroll and how they're also looking for a way to get off the island. \"I didn't want to split up, but Kat thought it was a good idea. Though she didn't say I couldn't join up with anyone else I found along the way...\" she says, grinning a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKomori giggles. \"Say no more. I'll come along with you, though you might have to deal with a little problem the fruit gives me...\" she says, as she suddenly farts. \"It's made me really gassy. Hehe. Hope you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna shakes her head. \"I don't mind at all.\" Ana says, giggling a little. And so, after Komori manages to pack up a large supply of the fruits, the two girls head on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey eventually come to a split, with one path leading left, and the other going right. There's also a set of etchings on the wall. The one of the left looks hand, while the other one is just an arrow pointing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrum...either way's probably going to involve getting bigger in some manner.\" Ana says, as she scratches her head.</span></div></div>",

It doesn't take her long to find him, as he's fallen asleep in the middle of the hallway, with a tray of various ingredients on top of him. \"Grr...sleeping on the job again, huh?\" she says, as she picks the little imp off the ground. Red groggily opens his eyes, only to see the blurred image of Ashley's wide-open mouth rapidly getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWide is an understatement, as Ashley's mouth is stretched out to the size of her head. She almost seems amazed herself as she stuffs Red into her mouth. As she closes her mouth, her cheeks cartoonishly bulge out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...mmm...kinda spicy.\" Ashley says with a muffled voice, as Red struggles to get out of Ashley's mouth. Red's shouts are muffled as Ashley starts to swallow him in one gulp. As she swallows, the bulge in her cheeks moves down to her neck. The bulge stops for a moment, but then continues down her body until it reaches her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley can't help but giggle a little as she feels Red tries his best to escape from her stomach. However, the only thing that Red's struggling does is build up gas within her, which she soon releases in the form of a loud burp. \"Mwehehe...my potion works perfectly! But then again...\" Ashley begins, as she pats her belly. \"...you didn't make much of a meal, Red.\" she finishes, rubbing her belly to emphasize how little it's bloated up. \"But what...er, who should I eat next?\" Ashley says, cackling a little as she exits the mansion.</span></div></div>",

Mars, Saturn, Venus, even the entire Milky Way, absolutely everything was drawn into Ana's mouth, swallowed down and sent to Ashley and Kat. With every moursel, the three girls radically expanded in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the former solar system was left with just Ana and the Sun, but that was about to change very shortly. The very sun itself, came up to less that a 5% of Ana's current size. And with one swoop, the star had also been swallowed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, that was fun.\" Ana said to herself.

I bet she'd even go along with it!\" Ashley says, as she heads off after Mona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of running, Ashley finally arrives at Mona's destination, Mona's pizza parlor. \"Phew...I really...need to get...something to ride...or something...\" she says between pants. After sitting down to rest for a few moments, she gets up and walks inside, eager to gulp Mona down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona hears the sound of the door opening and turns toward it to see Ashley. \"Oh, hey, Ashley! You here for something?\" Mona shouts while in the middle of making a pizza. She finishes kneading the dough and sets it down so she can chat with Ashley. \"Well?\" the older girl asks with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley grins and nods. \"Mwehehe...yeah. I've made it so that I can eat pretty much anything I desire. So...I'm going to demonstrate it on you, whether you like it or not!\" Ashley says in a slightly threatening manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona blinks for a moment, then giggles a little. \"Hehe...okay! It sounds pretty interesting.\" Mona says. \"But do you think you can swallow me without help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley blinks, and scratches he head a bit. Suddenly, she gets an idea. \"Ooh! Since you're willing to do this, maybe you could fit yourself into my mouth?\" Ashley suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, okay, then.\" Mona says, chuckling as she walks in front of Ashley and forces Ashley's mouth open so that it's wide enough for her to fit. Ashley gasps a little as she feels her mouth getting stretched out about as wide as her body is tall. \"Alright, here I go.\" Mona says, as she climbs into Ashley's mouth. She blinks as she feels her mouth snap shut around Mona's midsection as she slides herself deeper into Ashley's mouth. Ashley's cheeks are at least as wide as he head, and keep widening as Mona keeps going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a mintue or so, Mona manages to get all the way into Ashley's mouth. The end result of all this leaves Ashley with a couple of puffy cheeks and an equally puffy head. Ashley can't help but grin. \"Mmm...this feels great...\" she says, rubbing her nice, swollen cheeks. Mona giggles from inside as she feels Ashley's hands rub against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mwehehe...now...to swallow you!\" Ashley says, giggling a bit as she pushes on her cheeks in order to force Mona down into her throat. Due to the position Mona is in, her butt just happens to be the first thing to be pushed into Ashley's throat. Mona grins as she realizes this, and considers having a little fun with Ashley before she ends up in Ashley's belly. \"I hope Ashley doesn't mind a little gas...hehehe.\" Mona thinks.</span></div></div>",
