He had his legs kicked up on the dashboard as the dumpy van drove slowly through the woods. He wore a black Metallica t-shirt beneath an unzipped brown jacket, complete with dark blue jeans. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI mean, \u2018turkey day\u2019? Who even says that anymore?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cYeah, well she\u2019s in Virginia this month, and I don\u2019t feel like cooking. Do you have any better ideas, Seth?\u201d</span> The woman driving rolled her eyes, tired of her husband nitpicking the flyer throughout the entire drive. She wore a black scarf atop a beige duster coat, over black skinny pants.  <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cBesides, it\u2019s 20 bucks per ticket, and they\u2019ve got some kind of five-star caterer lined up. There\u2019s even some kind of play going on, I think.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cDo you really believe all that, Megan?\u201d</span> Seth laughed, gesturing to the seemingly never-ending forest stretching from horizon to horizon. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of nowhere! This \u2018vampyre lane\u2019 isn\u2019t even on any maps!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cIt\u2019s some rich gated community. They probably want their privacy,\u201d</span> the woman chuckled. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cWe should be happy they\u2019re letting us proles stink up their fancy neighborhood.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan tried to focus on navigating the strange, bumpy, winding road, but it was difficult with all the distractions coming from the back seat. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cC\u2019mon! Give it!\u201d</span> Their daughter whined loudly in the backseat, twisting her seatbelt to her limit as she reached over to the other side of the seat, trying to pry the console from her older brother\u2019s hands. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cIt\u2019s my turn! You\u2019ve been playing for the whole drive!\u201d </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHey! No! Just one more level!\u201d</span> The boy complained, trying to shake her off his back. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cGet off!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he overpowered her, forcing her back to the other side of the car. Annoyed, she crossed her arms and pouted. She wasn\u2019t even interested in the game itself at this point; it was a matter of principle.  <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cMooom, Jacob won\u2019t let me play!\u201d</span> She complained loudly, in the most annoying voice she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cUgh. Jacob, just let Donna have a turn,\u201d</span> Megan groaned, furrowing her brow as she rubbed her forehead with a hand. These kids were giving her a headache\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cUgh, fiiine, whatever,\u201d</span> Jacob groaned in frustration, saving his progress before handing it over to his annoyingly smug sister. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cJust don\u2019t mess up my save file.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cNo promises,\u201d</span> Donna taunted as she started playing. As the drive continued, the entire family slowly grew more and more confused by the sheer stretch of forest they seemed to be travelling through. They seemed to keep crossing by the same landmarks, as if they were traveling in circles, although the path consisted of a single, uninterrupted stretch of road. Worse still, the annoying bumpiness of the road was starting to become nauseating, and eventually it felt like they couldn\u2019t take it anymore. This \u2018Vampyre Lane\u2019 was supposed to be just a few miles from their house, and yet it seemed like they\u2019d been driving forever. Eventually, though, the fabled Vampyre Lane came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cThere, see? This doesn\u2019t look so bad, does it?\u201d</span> Megan smiled in relief as she drove right into the neighborhood, the huge front gates hanging wide open. Compared to the wild and untamed forest outside, the neighborhood was incredibly clean and well-kept, with beautifully maintained lawns and huge, gorgeous mansions as far as the eye could see. Even the kids seemed impressed, pausing their bickering for a moment to gawk at the houses as they passed by. As they drove, though, the car passed by a woman raking the leaves off her porch. The catch was, the woman seemed to be dressed in some sort of huge, hyper-realistic wolf costume!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhoa, hey! What was she wearing!?\u201d</span> Jacob said, turning to the back window as he tried to get a look at the costumed local. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cGo back! Go back!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWas that some sort of wolf costume?\u201d</span> Donna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou were probably just seeing things,\u201d</span> Seth said, unable to tell whether the kids were just messing with them or not. The car was silent for a few moments as the two siblings stared attentively out at the neighborhood\u2026 until one of them saw something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cLook! Over there! There\u2019s another one!\u201d</span> Donna yelled, eagerly pointing at a window to a woman mowing her lawn while seemingly dressed in a giant squirrel costume. The two practically pressed themselves against the window, staring at the squirrel lady as they passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOh <i>no</i>...\u201d</span> Jacob gasped. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDid we just drive into a neighborhood full of a buncha <i>furries</i>?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cThey\u2019re probably just dressed up for thanksgiving or something,\u201d</span> Seth offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat do wolves and squirrels have to do with thanksgiving?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI don\u2019t know. What\u2019s the alternative? That they just dress in those huge costumes 24/7, 365 days a year?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cMaybe!\u201d</span> Jacob insisted. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cMaybe they\u2019re weird furry cultists that lured us here to <i>sacrifice</i> us to their furry <i>gods</i>!\u201d</span> His little sister clasped her hand over her mouth, horrified by the possibility. His parents just rolled their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cAlright, now you\u2019re just being ridiculous,\u201d</span> Megan said, seeing the park approaching in the distance. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cNow, Vampyre Park\u2019s right up ahead. <i>Please</i> don\u2019t get us kicked out, okay? This is our one shot at a nice thanksgiving.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNo promises!\u201d</span> Jacob repeated, as they drove into the parking lot near the park. \u2018Vampyre Park\u2019 was huge, and resembled an exotic garden more than a regular park, with beautiful rivers and ponds travelling through between its perimeters. Dozens of people were wandering the park, chowing down on delicious food and listening to the bands playing in the distance. They notably didn\u2019t see any more people in animal costumes, to their relief. Everyone at the festival seemed pretty normal, or at least they seemed normal from the perspective of the family just getting out of their car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery member of the family seemed to be interested in a different part of the festival. Seth wanted to check out that beautiful, revolution-era mansion in the distance; Megan wanted to try some of this cuisine she\u2019s heard so much about; Jacob wanted to investigate those few weirdos with their strange animal \u2018costumes\u2019; and Donna wanted to head to the stage and see the performances. They all recognized this immediately; this certainly wasn\u2019t the first time the family had to split up at an event. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAlright, well, dinner won\u2019t be in a couple hours, so we can meet up at the hill there then,\u201d</span> Seth said, wrapping some weird, Vampyre Park armbands around Donna and Jacob\u2019s arms. He didn\u2019t know what they were for, but according to the flyer, if anybody was caught without them, the consequences would be \u2018severe\u2019. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cUntil then, you have fun. Try not to spoil your appetite, and don\u2019t lose your armbands.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the four excitedly split up, excited to check out the most interesting parts of the festival. Which character should we follow until the Thanksgiving Dinner proper rolls around?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are Jacob, and you thought this thanksgiving would be just as boring as all the others. You were never a big eater, and having to hang around a bunch of boring grown-ups all day was always miserable. You thought this festival would be just as lame\u2026 but now, it seemed things might get a little interesting. After all, now you had a real, genuine mystery to solve! You had seen a few people in huge, hyper realistic animal costumes while being driven through the neighborhood, and you got the feeling those weren\u2019t the only one. What kind of dark secrets were being hidden in Vampyre Lane, you wondered? The possibilities were endless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the rest of your family wandered off, you started asking around the festival, but you ran into a problem immediately; nobody at the park seemed to be a local, and all the other visitors were just as clueless as you were. Eventually, though, you learned that one of the \u2018animal\u2019 people was actually hosting the entire festival! It was all you could do to not go rubbing your hands together in devious excitement; this was exactly the lead you\u2019d been wanting! Perhaps this entire festival is part of the Vampyre Lane conspiracy! Apparently, her name was \u2018Katie\u2019, and she was dressed as a giant turkey for thanksgiving. Most people just thought she was the mascot or something, and thought her costume was completely innocent\u2026 but you saw through the lies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t that hard to find. She was about eight feet tall, utterly towering over the rest of the crowd. She was almost twice your size, in fact, which made you slightly nervous. Not only was she tall, but she was \u2018thick\u2019 too, for lack of a better world. Perhaps \u2018pudgy\u2019; she definitely had a prominent pear shape, with her hips being much wider than her shoulders. Most of her weight went to her rear and to her belly; her huge rump and round paunch were both clearly visible even through her big, flowing old-fashioned dress, and both looked like they could crush you easily. She seemed to be in a bit of a rush, but you wanted to interrogate her before she could get away. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHey, uh, lady?\u201d</span> You said, tugging on her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned by just how detailed and realistic her \u2018costume\u2019 was. She could actually control her beak, which was made evident when she smiled at you. The huge, curvy woman leaned over, until she was about eye-level with you. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOh, well hello there, little one! Did you want your picture taken with me?\u201d</b></span> She said, in a big, booming, but friendly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat? No,\u201d</span> you shake your head. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cCould you tell me what\u2019s up with the costume?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWhat? Oh, this is the kind of outfit the early pilgrims might\u2019ve worn during the very first thanksgiving!\u201d</b></span> She smiled, gesturing to her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNo, I mean why are you a turkey?\u201d</span> You replied, deadpan. She stared at you for a few seconds, uncomprehending, before she snapped her fingers in realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cAh, you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019m not part of the thanksgiving feast!\u201d</b></span> She incorrectly realized. Before you could correct her, she stood up and continued.  <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWell, about 15 years back, back when I was just a normal turkey, I was pardoned by the president himself!\u201d</b></span> She explained, as if she\u2019d rehearsed this whole speech before. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cI thought for sure I would be somebody\u2019s thanksgiving dinner\u2026 but out of all the turkeys in the world, he chose me!\u201d</b></span> She almost swooned at the memory. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cI was so thankful, I decided to dedicate myself to spreading the spirit of thanksgiving\u2026 and Vampyre Lane seemed like the best place to start!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this lady is absolutely insane, you thought to yourself. Before you could ask any further questions, though, the turkey just reached down and playfully ruffled your hair. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cI hope that answered your questions, little one. Now, I have to get to the turkey run!\u201d</b></span> By the time you fixed your hair, she was already walking away, her huge hips swaying as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWait! What\u2019s a turkey run?\u201d</span> You cried out after her, but your voice was drowned out by the chatter of the crowd, and the huge woman walked much faster than you could even run. You clenched your fist as you watched her disappear into the distance. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d</span> You had successfully confirmed that the owner was completely insane, and might even think she was a real turkey\u2026 but you hadn\u2019t figured out why, or to what end. Though she had gotten away, your resolve was stronger than ever, and you knew you needed to find out what this \u2018turkey run\u2019 was. You could only think of one place to figure that out, though\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDad! Dad! Helloooo!\u201d</span> You cry out as you wander around the festival, in the general direction you thought you saw Seth walking. You eventually find him chowing down on a freshly cooked hot dog at one of the stalls. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDad!\u201d</span> You yell, running up to him, eager to figure this out before the \u2018turkey run\u2019 started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cHmm?\u201d</span> He raised a brow, turning to you half-attentively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDo you still have that flyer?\u201d</span> You ask, eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cUh, I think,\u201d</span> he said, digging through his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cCould you give it to me, maybe?\u201d</span> You insist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he finally finds the flyer, pulling it from his jeans pocket. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cSure. Knock yourself out,\u201d</span> he said, before turning back to his meal. You skim through the flyer as fast as you could, looking through all the events planned, until you finally come across this;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>THE TURKEY RUN<br>\r\nStarting Point: Amphitheater at 3:20 p.m.<br>\r\nStay in the shape by jogging this exciting circuit through the Therian Forest! Don\u2019t fall behind, or you may get gobbled up by the thanksgiving turkey! A decent level of fitness is recommended. Special prizes offered.</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were filled with panic. That was in 5 minutes, and the amphitheater was all the way on the other side of the park! You were so anxious over this that you completely ignored the part about getting \u2018gobbled up\u2019, too preoccupied with sprinting to the amphitheater as fast as you could. You arrive just as the director of the \u2018race\u2019 was making their announcements and explaining the rules. Once again, you ignored the rules completely, trying to squeeze into the crowd and grab one of the empty spots in the race. Finally, you get settled, doing your best to fit in with the other racers. There was only about a dozen people in the \u2018turkey run\u2019, you included. Up on the stage, the turkey was looking over the runners with a hungry look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOnce again, the trail is about one mile long, and runners will be given a 1-minute head start before I start comin after ya!\u201d</b></span> You hear, arriving just as the announcements were wrapping up. You realize you really had no experience running. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cMake it to the end without getting gobbled, and you will be given special prizes you can\u2019t get from anywhere but Vampyre Lane! Everyone understand the rules? You\u2019re all ready?\u201d</b></span> Wait\u2026 gobbled? What does that mean? Before you can ask, you hear what sounds like a bell going off. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cGo, go, go!\u201d</b></span> The turkey declares, and everybody immediately starts jogging down a trail, deep into the darkness of the woods. You nervously follow along with them, although you really had no idea what you were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first tenth of the run was largely uneventful. Just a big group of people jogging at a surprising pace down a big hiking trail. All you could hear was the sounds of birds chirping, and your own, belabored breath. You were already getting pretty tired, and the run hadn\u2019t even really started yet. You couldn\u2019t keep up with the other runners, which made you slightly concerned, too. Was the turkey really going to be chasing you? What would happen if she caught you? That thought kept you running, despite your exhaustion, but you knew you couldn\u2019t keep it through the whole stretch. You had to come up with a plan...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had barely even started, and you could already tell you were dreadfully unprepared for this \u2018race\u2019. Just keeping pace with the rest of the runners was sapping you of all your energy quickly; you didn\u2019t know how you could possibly outrun any of them. Maybe\u2026 maybe if you started spriting, you\u2019d give yourself a head start before you ran out of energy? That could work! You were going to run out of energy either way, so it\u2019s not like it could hurt. With that thought, you start pushing yourself to run as fast as you possibly can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to work at first. You passed every other runner, eventually running ahead of the pack. It didn\u2019t even feel that bad, at first\u2026 until you finally started to feel the exhaustion. And when it kicked in, it kicked in hard. You felt like there was this intense pressure bearing down your heart and lungs, to the point you could barely breathe. Blood rushed to your head as you tried to push yourself to keep moving, but eventually, you just didn\u2019t have the strength to continue. The group of runners parted around you as you collapsed, leaning against a nearby tree as you tried to catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision was blurry and your heart was beating in your chest. You tried to rest your eyes for a few moments as you recuperated\u2026 only to hear incredibly loud footsteps from further down the path. You open your eyes, and can vaguely see, in the distance, the turkey lady from before barreling down the trail, her large body allowing her to chase after the runners at an incredible speed. Even more notably, she seemed to be completely naked now that she was away from the prying eyes of the festival, her body jiggling as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared in disbelief, almost failing to even comprehend the sight. Eventually, your instincts kicked in when you realized the turkey was heading right in your direction. Despite your exhaustion, you got up and started running again; there was a quarter mile distance between you two, so she could never catch up, right? Wrong! She could move at almost three times your speed, allowing her to easily catch up to the runners\u2026 and since you were the further behind the other runners, you were the first one to get grabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cGotchya!\u201d</b></span> She laughed, as you felt her talon-like hands wrap around your sides and scoop you off your feet. As she held you in the air in front of her, she teased you with a good view into her huge beak and cavernous throat. You were finally struck with the realization; she definitely wasn\u2019t just wearing a costume! This \u2018Katie\u2019 was an actual giant, humanoid turkey woman, and now she was about ready to \u2018gobble\u2019 you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cAaah!\u201d</span> You cry out as you wriggled futilely against her powerful grasp. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cNo!\u201d</span> Your heart skipped a beat as you watched that mouth of her suddenly lurch forward, as your head was shoved into her huge beak, your face pressed up against her tongue. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cMph!\u201d</span> At this point, you braced for oblivion, certain that she would \u2018bite\u2019 your head of any second now; however, to your surprise, she instead took a big gulp, accepting your head into her throat. In a moment of pure terror, you realized what that flyer meant by \u2018gobbled up\u2019; the giant turkey woman was going to swallow you whole!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms were restrained against your sides, but you definitely start kicking at the air with all your might, hoping you\u2019d be able to land a kick and she\u2019d cough you up in surprise. However, you have no such luck; instead, the turkey just leans her head back, lifting your body up in the air. Her throat was now a vertical tube beneath you, meaning even gravity was helping her send you into her belly. She gulped more of you inside with a loud gluck\u2026 and then another\u2026 and then another. Before you knew it, her tight throat was wrapped around your upper body, only your legs remaining dangling from her beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before your head was pressed through a tight sphincter, which squeezed around every inch of your body as she slid you into her stomach. Eventually, you unceremoniously fell into her belly completely, not even making a bulge in her huge, round, feathery gut. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cMm! You were just delicious!\u201d</b></span> She smiled, patting her belly as she finished gulping down her first meal for thanksgiving. She was giving the other runners a head start by stopping to taunt you, of course, but she could catch up easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were slowly starting to cry. You knew roughly what happens to food inside somebody\u2019s belly, and you wanted to have nothing to do with it. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cP-please\u2026 don\u2019t do this\u2026\u201d</span> You begged, the misery evident in your voice. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cI don\u2019t want to\u2026 to\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</b></span> She asked, sounding genuinely confused. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cYou know I won\u2019t digest you, right, sweetheart?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cW-what?\u201d</span> You said, blinking. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cReally?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOf course not! The \u2018turkey run\u2019 is just a game! I\u2019ll let you out once it\u2019s over,\u201d</b></span> she laughed, and you felt a little embarrassed. Now that you think about it, it was obvious that you were never in any real danger. If you were, why would anybody sign for this? She gave her belly a comforting pat as you got settled in, cooing at the feeling of you moving around inside her body. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cNow, get comfy in there and don\u2019t move around too much. I gotta get back to runnin\u2019.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she ran, even as her jiggling belly swayed and wiggled, her stomach remained quite still and stable. Now that you weren\u2019t afraid anymore, you realized it was actually quite comfortable in here. It was super roomy, and while it was a little moist, it was surprisingly dry. It was like chilling out in a big, moving, natural sauna. More than enough light poured in through the walls to let you see around, and the pink walls were some of the most comfortable surfaces you\u2019d ever felt. You signed as you leaned your head against one of the walls, the utter relaxation distracting you from just how crazy this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the \u2018race\u2019 continued, the turkey eventually caught more runners, sending them each down to join you in her stomach. They all seemed to take it much better than you did; you guess they must\u2019ve actually read the flyer, and thus expected to get swallowed up. Either way, they all seemed like nice people, and you had fun telling jokes and making small talk with them as they were added in one by one. Eventually, after about 10 minutes had passed, about 9 of the runners had been locked away in the turkey woman\u2019s gut, yourself included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWell, that about wraps it up!\u201d</b></span> Katie smiled as she reached the end of the trail. Only about three people had made it through the run ungobbled, which was about as many as she expected. She stops for a while to catch her breast. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWhew! What a workout!\u201d</b></span> She wipes the sweat from her forehead with one of her huge wings, before smiling as she pats her big belly, now bulging with all the people stuck within. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cYou folks wouldn\u2019t mind stayin\u2019 in there a little longer while I announce the winners, right?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNope!\u201d</b> You all practically say in unison, amid your laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to hear!\u201d</b></span> The turkey giggled, shaking her belly playfully before she started getting dressed. Her old-fashioned dress just barely squeezed around her belly, looking like it was about to burst at any moment; but surprisingly, the fabric held firm, even when her gut bounced and jiggled as she walked. She made her way onto the stage of the amphitheater, where she looked down on the three runners that remained. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cAnd our lucky winners are\u2026 Douglas Parker, Tina Thompson, and Sandra Bailey!\u201d</b></span> She announced over the microphone, and a few passersby clapped in applause. The turkey handed out special tickets to each winner. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cRedeem these any time for an item of your choice from the Dark Meadow Estate stockroom!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that settled, the turkey disappeared behind the amphitheater, and got to work coughing up the other contestants. She knelt over, and the sphincter at the top of her stomach slid open. You watched as the other runners crawled up her stretchy throat, one by one. When it was finally your turn to crawl in, you were surprised by how quickly her throat muscles gripped you, and slid you up her throat in seconds, until you landed on the soft grass still covered in saliva. Soon, all the runners were out, and they all laughed and chatted as they dried off. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cGet job, everyone! Even if you didn\u2019t win, remember, at least you had fun,\u201d</b></span> she said, before adding with a giggle, <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cor, at least, I did. Hehe!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, all the other runners parted ways, and the turkey went walking back to her mansion, leaving you sitting there in the grass, pondering just what the hell just happened. There was definitely more to \u2018Vampyre Lane\u2019 then met the eye\u2026 but it didn\u2019t seem so nefarious anymore. As crazy as it was to admit it, you felt almost a little disappointed when \u2018Katie\u2019 finally let you of her stomach. Compared to to her warm, soft belly, the outside world was frigidly cold and constantly uncomfortable. You sighed as you finally stood up, easily drying the smelly saliva off your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that settled, you still had over two hours before dinner started. What should you do next?</span></div></div>",

As far as the eye can see, pot roasts, cobblers, casseroles, pies, cornbread, biscuits, delightfully prepared dishes of all sorts were laid out along the big, long wooden table in the center of the field. In the center of the table was a huge cornucopia, from which emanated the most tempting and delicious smells to ever grace a man\u2019s nostrils. Amidst all the food, the patrons couldn\u2019t help but notice there wasn\u2019t any turkey, though they realize that might\u2019ve been offensive to the massive turkey woman standing at the far end of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWe hope you are impressed by the feast! Please, take anything you like! There\u2019s more than enough for everyone!\u201d</b></span> The turkey smiled, and indeed, there definitely was more than enough for everyone. In fact, there was so much food, everyone could probably eat all day and not put a dent in the supply. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cI\u2019d like to remind you that everything you see here was donated freely by the citizens of Vampyre Lane! Don\u2019t worry about thanking them now; you will be giving your thanks to them at the end of your feast, as is traditional.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cSure beats going to your ma\u2019s, huh?\u201d</span> Megan smiled as the four filled their plates, almost awe-inspired by the sheer wealth of options available. They had to pay extra for their spots at the table, as only a few dozen people could fit; the rest of the guests brought their own picnic blankets and set up strewn around the field, although you were also provided with some of Vampyre Lane\u2019s free, delicious cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHah! Got me there,\u201d</span> Seth smiled as he shoveled more food onto his plate. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cThis. Is. <i>Incredible!</i>\u201d</span> It seemed every food item the heart could desire was somewhere on the table. There were even some dishes nobody could recognize, and while they looked strange, they smelled delicious, so some people were eager to try them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThey have some <i>weird</i> food here,\u201d</span> Jacob said, staring at the mystery meat with fascination. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s even a <i>name</i> for this\u2026\u201d</span> Other than the turkey, there didn\u2019t seem to be any of the \u2018animal people\u2019 around, so if there were any locals at the feast, they weren\u2019t wearing their costumes at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cIt looks <i>amazing</i>,\u201d</span> Donna smiled, her face buried in her phone as she snapped some photos of her plate. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cMy friends are going to be <i>so</i> jealous.\u201d</span> As the family stared at their dinners hungrily, barely able to restrain themselves from sneaking a taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, every guest had taken their seat and filled their plate, and the turkey woman stepped up to make another announcement. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cI\u2019d like to thank you for your patience,\u201d</b></span> she says, somehow speaking loud enough for her voice to be heard by the entire field clearly. Maybe a microphone was hidden in her costume? <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cNow that everyone is settled in, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I would like all visitors to say grace\u2026\u201d</b></span> With the turkey leading them, they all chant simultaneously, their voices collecting into a booming montone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><i>\u201cBless us, oh Lord, and these, thy gifts, which we are about to receive...\u201d</i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jacob got a strange feeling, as if something was watching him. He lifted his head slightly, peaking around, only to see one of those animal people hiding in the bushes, watching them from the shadow. She looked like a wolf, and it didn\u2019t seem she was wearing anything, though it was hard to tell. The moment they locked eyes, the wolf woman disappeared back into the bushes. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cH-hey! Look!\u201d</span> He whispered in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSsshhh!\u201d</span> Donna shushed him, and with some reluctance, he bowed his head again, trying to ignore what he had just seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><i>\u201c... from thy bounty, through Christ our Lord, we pray. Amen.\u201d</i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the prayer finished, the guests started digging into their meals like pigs, their willpower having reached its absolute limit. The turkey woman almost giggled at the spectacle of the dozens of patrons greedily gobbling down their dinner like hungry dogs simultaneously. Jacob held out for a few moments, confused by what he had seen, but eventually he was overcome by the hunger.The moment the food touched their lips, the patrons noticed something exciting; the food here seemed to be ten times as good as it would be anywhere else! Truly, the citizens of Vampyre Lane must all be world-class chefs. Nobody could tell if there was a secret ingredient or what, but the flavor of even the most mundane food item was powerfully addictive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the feast continued, people started shoving food into their mouths with greater and greater fervor. To the family\u2019s surprise, they each finished their plates in a matter of minutes, and they couldn\u2019t help but eagerly reach for more. The mystery meat tasted heavenly, which was a pleasant surprise to Jacob, but he figured it was just a fancy dish; to his surprise, though, the green beans were just as delicious, and so was the pecan pie! As he dug into the feast, awed by the sheer variety of delicious flavors, he completely forgot about the mysterious she-wolf he saw in the bushes earlier. Megan, perhaps, ate with the most fervor, getting so into her meal that she was startled when she accidentally swallowed an entire sweet potato whole! Such a feat seemed impossible\u2026 but with a shrug, she went back to eating, not stopping for even a moment to consider the mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn entire half hour passed in what felt like minutes. The patrons were now in a hypnotic haze as they obsessed over their feast, churning through food at an alarming rate, and yet the supply seemed endless. All the laughter and festivity one would expect at a Thanksgiving dinner was replaced with the overwhelming sound of chewing and slurping as the guests were overcome with the flavor. It was almost unnatural\u2026 as if some powerful hex had taken control of their minds and driven them to gluttony...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they practically shoveled food down their throats, the patrons felt themselves grow painfully full. Fuller than most of them every thought possible. By the time the half hour had passed, all the human guests had garnered incredible potbellies, which jiggled and bounced as they desperately reached for more food. Seth\u2019s had to take off his belt to account for his new gut. Megan, the biggest eater of the family, almost looked pregnant again. All the while, the turkey giggled as she walked aimlessly around the field, amused as the human\u2019s minds were overcome by gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured into the distance\u2026 and, unnoticed by the hypnotized humans, the locals of Vampyre Lane began to emerge. Anthros of all kinds, averaging about seven feet tall, all in various states of undress, eyed the gluttonous patrons hungrily as they emerged one-by-one into the field. Most prominent among them was a pudgy squirrel lady, wearing an apron and nothing else, who walked proudly up to the turkey.<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cYour curses worked like a charm, April!\"</b></span> The turkey woman smiled, patting the squirrel on the back with a wing.<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWe don't even have to fatten 'em up \u2014 they're doing it <i>for</i> us!\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the humans were literally hypnotized by their food, and didn't even notice the anthros as they discussed their plans. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\"Oh, it was my pleasure, Katie. These humans you found look absolutely <i>scrumptious</i>!\"</b></span> The squirrel lady smiled, her pudge jiggling as she walked. She licked her lips as she admired the humans. The food stuffing their bellies would sure give them a delicious taste. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\"Why, I could just eat one up right now...\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\"Temper yourself, April. Remember, Katie was generous enough to lure them here for us, so she gets the first bite,\"</b></span> an elegant-looking bird woman said as she followed along behind her. The dress she wore was actually quite modest, and her figure was definitely more 'well-maintained' then the others, though she was still incredibly curvy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cteal\">\"Damn! How many of them are there? A hundred?\"</span></b> A muscular, teal-furred jackal noted, her arm wrapped around a smaller canine woman's shoulder. She wore nothing but a tanktop and a sports bra. <b><span class=\"cteal\">\"I wonder how many I can gulp down in one go. I might even beat my record...\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\"What's your current record, Jazz?\"</b></span> The she-wolf Jacob had seen earlier asked. Just as he suspected, she was completely naked, more attuned to the 'natural' side of things, although she was new to being a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\"><b>\"Five!\"</b></span> The enthusiastic dog by the jackal's side smiled, also completely naked. Her tail wagged uncontrollably behind her as she walked. <span class=\"cpblue\"><b>\"You should've been there, Violet! They wriggled like <i>crazy</i>!\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\"Alright, alright. Calm down everyone. Our 'guests' here will be finished eating soon, so we need to get ready,\"</b></span> the turkey said, before turning to a pudgy tiger woman. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\"Sheryl, all the gates in and out of the park have been sealed, right?\"</b></span> The tigress nodded eagerly, a sly smirk on her face. The turkey rubbed her 'hands' together, overcome with excitement. This was always her favorite part of the year. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\"Well, alrighty then. Looks like it's time to get down to business!\"</b></span> With a single, easy movement, she slipped out of her bulky dress, revealing her curvaceous, completely nude form to the unsuspecting crowd. She licked her lips and rubbed her belly as she eyed up her visitors, trying to decide which one would be the first to fill her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\"><b>\"Well? Don't keep us waiting!\"</b></span> The equally nude wolf man by Violet's side said, his arms crossed. <span class=\"crose\"><b>\"Who's it gonna be?\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does the turkey gobble up first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The turkey seemed nonplussed by his rudeness, the same amused smile locked on her face. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\"Well, let's see here...\"</b></span> She said, making her way back to the main table. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\"Eenie meenie miny moe...\"</b></span> She sing-songed, poking each guest on the head as she passed by. Each of them were too obsessed with their meal to even notice. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\"Catch a tiger by the toe...\"</b></span> She comes closer and closer to the family of four. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\"If he hollers, let him go...\"</b></span> Eventually, she pokes Megan on the head, but passes her on, tapping Jacob and Donna as she walked by. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\"Eenie meenie miny...\"</b></span> Suddenly, Seth was torn from his meal when huge wings wrapped around his sides, lifting him up in the air with terrifying ease! <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\"... moe!\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was always the skeptical one. Even when he was just as embroiled in his meal as the others, it never fully hypnotized him. There was still some awareness in his mind, clawing to break free. When the turkey poked him on the head, distracting him from the meal, he was halfway knocked from his hypnotic trance... and when his father was torn from the seat beside him, that finished the job! The boy suddenly tensed up, as if woken from a dream as the hypnosis clears from his mind, and he realizes the situation he was in. Jacob turns, eyes wide with fear, to see the turkey woman from before as naked as the day she was born, with his father's head lodged in her beak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation, Jacob screams at the top of his lungs, watching the turkey take another <i>gulp</i> and pull his father deeper into her throat. The other patron's attentions were torn away from their meals, as they all turn to witness the spectacle of the man kicking and flailing as he was swallowed whole by the giant turkey woman. <span class=\"crose\"><b>\"Damn it! That kid will ruin the hypnosis!\"</b></span> The wolf man yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\"><b>\"I'll take care of him,\"</b></span> the nearest anthro, the jackal, stomps swiftly towards Jacob. Just as he was about to reach out to rescue his father, he felt the giant, muscular canine woman grab him the arm, hoisting him up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"No!\"</span> He said, struggling against the canine's grip. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Dad!\"</span> As the jackal dragged him away, he could only watch in horror as Seth's legs wriggled in the air, his body creating a sizeable bulge in the turkey's throat. With a few more gulps, even Seth's legs disappear, as the turkey pulls him down into her body with incredible speed, the man not even making a bulge in her big, round, feathery belly. Before he could even mourn, the jackal spun him around, and before he knew it, Jacob was staring into the canine's huge, hungry maw!  <span class=\"clblue\">\"<i>No</i>! Let go of me!\"</span> Just as the canine was about to wolf him down, he reached up and punched her squarely on the nose, desperate not to meet the same fate as Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\"><b>\"<i>Ow!</i> Damn it!\"</b></span> The jackal yelped, reflexively letting the human go as she stumbled back, clutching her snout in pain. Fueled by his adrenaline rush, Jacob immediately rushed back into the crowd, waving his arms wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Run! Everybody! <i>Ruuunnn!</i>\"</span> He yelled, realizing the horrifying extent of the anthro's plans. The other visitors had been pretty thoroughly awakened from their hypnosis at this point, though at this point, it might already be too late; the other anthros immediately pounced on the nearest human, swallowing them down with similar ease as the turkey did. Jacob rushed back to his family, seeing Megan and Donna were paralyzed with fear as they watched the bird woman swallow Seth whole and alive. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Eat <i>this!</i>\"</span> He shouted like a battlecry, picking up a nearby dinner roll and tossing it at the turkey's face. As if fate was on his side, he hit his mark once again, the roll colliding with the turkey's eye, blinding her and giving his family some extra time. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Run!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to ask twice. Megan and Donna immediately joined with the clamor of the fleeing visitors, now a veritable stampede as the humans rushed for the nearest exit as quick as they could. In the crowd, they quickly lost track of each other; all they could do was try not to fall over and get trampled. All the anthros had filled their bellies with at least one human already, but they were far from satisfied, running after the stampeding humans like a pack of wolves, picking off the slowest and weakest on the edge of the crowd. They were much faster then any human, but they could only swallow one person at a time, and each person they devoured bought the rest some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis worked out for the smartest and the fittest... but Megan had eaten more then any other person in the crowd. She was a reasonably fit woman overall, but all that extra weight really slowed her down... and soon, she found herself lingering in the 'danger zone' on the outskirts of the crowd, huffing and puffing as her rounded belly bounced up and down, certain she would be picked off soon. Surely enough, her sprint was interrupted when she felt a pair of claws wrap around her sides, lifting her up in the air! <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Aaahhh!\"</span> She squealed as she was spun around, finding herself face-to-face with her captor...</span></div></div>",

You were heading to Vampyre Lane, or Hopping Lane as it was called on this holiday. You had heard the rumors of how it only appeared on holidays. For Easter, you had heard that the chocolate eggs were the tastiest. You had also heard that there were fun games to play and nice people to meet. Hopping Lane was even said to have the Easter Bunny roaming around, and those who were lucky to find her would get a special reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you hadn't heard about the bad rumors about it, one of them specifically being that people who go there often don't return. Since you were oblivious to the danger, you excitedly walked towards the area. By your side, you had your two best friends. Your friends Bethany and Lee. They were both looking forward to the day as much as you were. However, Lee was twice as excited, he absolutely loved Easter more than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to Hopping Lane, you noticed a sign at the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\"><div align=\"center\">Warning!</div><br>\r\nIf you are human, than beware.

They looked like normal houses, save for the decorations. Fake green grass seemed to line the windowsills, a few painted eggs in each of them. You could also see a few rabbit plushies the size of dogs on several fields. However, a few of the fields seemed to have rabbit plushies that had longer limbs than normal rabbits, which seemed to work with a thinner frame and a different frame to make them look a little more human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Lee stopped suddenly, and you could see his confusion, even from behind his head. You rose a brow at that, and Beth herself seemed confused. You moved around him to see his face, where you saw his wide eyes and his gaping jaw. Confused, you looked at where he was facing, only to mirror his expression. Forwards, you saw a bunch of picnic tables, each round and bearing a nest of colored eggs on them. A lot of the picnic tables are moved away, leaving one table in the middle of an empty space. Around the table, however, were the source of the confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a... pink lioness? That definitely looked like a lioness: large feline, lion-like tail, no main... However, on top of the pink fur, she seemed to bear more human-like proportions. Well, model-like more like it, seeing as she seemed to bear an hourglass figure, complete with long legs, thick hips, and a rotund chest. Around the table were young-looking animal... people. Next to her was some orange-dyed snow leopard boy. Next to him was a young, chubby polar bear boy with his fur dyed blue. And across from the lioness was a goat boy with green fur, who was in a very peculiar position. The other boys looked on nervously as the lioness' foot was extended over the table top, the goat boy pressing his face into her sole, his hands grasped around its side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could swear you heard a few sniffs from him while the lioness rhythmically tapped the table top, wriggling her toes on the goat's forehead as she did so. Next to her was a mechanical timer. When you couldn't hear sniffs, you could here the tick of that timer, it getting closer and closer to 0. Soon, it rang out. And at that, with an intense gasp, the goat yanked himself way from the foot, before turning around where he's sitting and coughing, taking in deep breaths of fresh air while the lioness put her foot back under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicely done,\" she complimented. She glanced over to the humans, and her expression seemed to light up. \"Alright boys, we can continue this later!\" Upon hearing that, the three other animals with her perked up, and instantly fled from the table, the lioness chuckling. \"C'mere, you wanted to play a game, right?\" At that, you and your friends seemed to freeze up, as if suddenly realizing you were under the gaze of a predator. \"Well? Come on then~\" At that, as if compelled by some invisible force, you guys moved forwards towards the table she sat at, and you sat at spaces similar to those boys from earlier. Lee sat to the lioness' right, Beth sat to her left, and you sat across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know truth or dare, right?\" she said. You all glanced nervously at each other, and nodded, feeling like so much as saying the wrong word would mean bad things for you. \"Good! I tend to go first, and I offer others the chance to exchange their dare for one, and only one, truth. If you don't do as I ask, then... I'm not sure you'll want to know what happens after that.\" With that, she began pointing around the table, and you could swear you heard her saying \"eenie meenie minie moe\" to herself. Eventually, she decided to choose...</span></div></div>",

Not in our universe, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in other dimensions, the sky\u2019s the limit. Somewhere out there in the multiverse, every possible variation of reality exists. There are versions of Earth populated entirely by giant, talking crab wizards; versions where very conceivable rumor, folk tale, or conspiracy theory proves correct; even versions where the moon is made of cheese. Sometimes, the denizens of a universe grow so powerful, so magically or technologically adept, that they\u2019re able to open gates to \u2018neighboring\u2019 universes, on special occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was one of those special occasions. Christmas eve. A time when magic was in the air. On a day like today, everyone was restless with burning excitement for Christmas. People were singing carols in the streets, building snowmen, or settling in around the fireplace with their families. Not everyone was having a very happy Christmas, however. Some people, through one circumstance or another, were truly alone during the holidays, with nothing to look forward to on Christmas morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those people, this year, there was a glint of hope. A couple hundred select youths from around the world were mysteriously given tickets to an incredible town calling itself Candy Cane Lane. Amid the hustle and bustle of Christmas eve, somehow, no one noticed these youths sneaking out into the snowy night, driven by an almost supernatural sense of curiosity. According to the ticket, all they had to do was walk to the nearest bus stop, and as long as they had the special ticket, a fancy, Christmas-themed bus would stop by and pick them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver would be a cheerful, generic elf with rosy cheeks and pointy ears. After driving aimlessly for awhile, he would veer off into the wilderness, travelling down mysterious roads that nobody knew existed. No matter where they were in the world, the bus would always take them to same place. After waiting for only a few minutes, they\u2019d see beautiful lights glowing over the horizon, as the bus drives them towards a huge, incredible, snowy little city. They\u2019d know they were inside when they passed through an immense archway, which read;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><span class=\"clgrey\"><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Vampyre Lane</span></span> <b>CANDY CANE LANE</b><br>\r\nBecause nobody deserves to be alone on Christmas!</span></div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, they\u2019d find the entire town decorated with what must\u2019ve been billions in Christmas decorations. Entire buildings seem to have been renovated to fit the occasion. Eventually, the bus would take them to the center of the city, where a grand parade was being held by the elves. As they stormed out of the buses, the children were delighted by the gorgeous light displays, parade floats, and beautiful festive choir music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The main event of the parade, though, was the last parade float, on which a cheerful, chubby man with a snow white beard sat on a christmassy throne, ho ho hoing his head off. However, this man wasn\u2019t just some lame mall santa. No, everyone could tell with a glance that there was something magical about him. There was no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that he was the real deal. This was ol\u2019 Saint Nick himself. Once the parade concluded, the visitors were set free to explore the town to their heart\u2019s content, all promised that the next morning, they would be given the \u2018perfect gift\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those who had been kind and well-behaved over the last year, Candy Cane Lane would be a place of unparalleled wonder, where all their dreams could come true and any number of magical events could occur. However, for those who had been \u2018naughty\u2019, the town could be a dangerous place indeed. Santa and his elves were far from the only denizens of the snowy little town, after all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, before we begin, which one are you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You used to love Christmas. Now, it seemed like the most miserable time of the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t a scrooge or anything. But just a few years back, you and your family were involved in a car accident that deprived you of your parents, your brother, and even your ability to walk. A \u2018drunk driver\u2019, the social workers said. You were all just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Well now, Christmas, the day you had once beamed with excitement for every year, now just reminded you of all you had lost. Your foster parents usually tried to surprise you with some gifts, or a trip, but it all paled in comparison to crowding around a Christmas tree with your family. This eve, you were grimly prepared for another quiet, lonely Christmas\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, a strange ticket blew through your window, with your name on it somehow, your breath was taken away. It claimed to have been sent by Santa himself\u2026 and how could it not have been? The way it was carried on the wind, it could have only been delivered by something truly magical. Sure, maybe you were a little too old to be believing in Santa Claus\u2026 like, way too old, but at this point, you were praying for a miracle. In the dead of night, you snuck out the door as best you could in your wheelchair, rolling towards the nearest bus stop as fast as you could. Sure enough, that special festive bus arrived immediately, whisking you away to places unknown\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second you arrived in Candy Cane Lane, you knew this was the real deal. Somehow, you felt the distinct, palpable sensation that you were crossing over into another universe entirely; a universe where anything was possible, and any dream could be made to come true. When you saw the parade, the magic of this place was only confirmed. The lights show was the most beautiful thing you\u2019d ever seen, bringing tears to your eyes. And at the end, when the saw the old, rounded man in that grand throne, he had a sense of kindness, generosity and wisdom about him no normal human could accomplish. You knew immediately that it was him - the elusive \u2018Santa\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t question what you were seeing in the slightest, too excited to be skeptical. All you could think about was exploring the magic of the place, and uncovering every secret it had to offer. And maybe, at midnight, when the gifts were supposedly to be given\u2026 maybe you\u2019ll get a miracle after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they let you roam on your own, you rolled your way around the town aimlessly for a while, just taking in the sights in awe. Every building had a comfortable, retro wooden cabin aesthetic, and was covered in lights, wreaths and stockings. Bakeries staffed by elves were offering free food; stages all around town were performing elaborate plays for all to see; colorful fireworks were continually going off in the distance. People all around seemed to be just as giddy as you were, laughing and celebrating together. Most beautifully of all, an aurora borealis was lighting up the sky, streaks of green and purple shimmering in the heavens. The more you explored, the more you were convinced this place was truly magical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you encountered an elf that was handing out maps. You took one graciously, eagerly looking it over to see what was available. It showed all sorts of businesses in the city offering free services, but also recommended a few areas as the \u2018main events\u2019 of the Christmas celebrations. You didn\u2019t have all that much time, so you decided to start with those first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closest was Candy Cane Park. Apparently, there, they were erecting the largest Christmas tree in the world; it was supposedly so tall it reached the clouds! At the party in the park, you could meet some of the city\u2019s local residents. Around the same distance was Santa\u2019s workshop, which offered an in-depth view into exactly how the magic of Christmas is performed. There, you would be able to meet the big man himself, as well as his twelve reindeer. If neither of those interest you, you could always head somewhere else...</span></div></div>",

You assumed the map was simply exaggerating\u2026 at least until you looked up and, sure enough, there it was in the distance. Even from miles away, the tree towered over the town like a skyscraper, a beautiful light attached to every single branch. It almost seemed to cut through the beautiful, starry night sky; a beacon of light in the heart of the town. While Santa\u2019s Workshop seemed tempting, you knew you had to see this tree up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you rolled into the park, you noticed it was bustling with activity. Beautiful lights were strung between every tree, and the grass was covered in a fresh few inches of snow. People were skating on a frozen lake, while visitors shared delicious-smelling pastries on the shore. Lovers danced together in a courtyard while elves played soothing melodies onstage. You immediately lost yourself in the festivities, grabbing some delicious pastries and munching down on them while chatting with the other visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It seemed people had come here from all over the world; most of them didn\u2019t even speak the same language, and yet they came together in harmony and understanding to share the joy of the season. Every person you met, you immediately understand so deeply, it felt like you\u2019ve known each other your whole lives. You made new friends instantly, even across language barriers, driven by an almost supernatural sense of comradery. Soon, you were singing Christmas carols on the shore with a dozen other visitors, all dressed up in santa hats and christmas sweaters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour flies by in what feels like seconds. Eventually, you start to realize that you\u2019ve been so wrapped up in the joy of the moment, you haven\u2019t even stopped to consider the apparent magic present in the park. Like, for example, the 7-foot tall animal people wandering around. You stared at them suddenly, as if woken from a dream. You\u2019d noticed them before, but for some reason didn\u2019t spare them a second thought. Everyone else seemed to be acting the same way, treating these talking, bipedal animals like they were completely normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppose you shouldn\u2019t be surprised. This entire town seemed magical. Still, you had no idea what anthropomorphic animals had to do with Christmas. Elves, sure\u2026 but these? You didn\u2019t know quite what the make of them. Well, whatever. They seemed nice enough. Maybe you should just go talk to one of them, see what they\u2019re all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to approach...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided to approach the anthropomorphic goat-like creature offering free candy near the base of the gigantic Christmas tree. As you drew yourself closer towards the center of the park, you blushed as you now could make out the feminine features on her body. The magical creature was covered from head to toe in downy, white colored fur, with droopy ears and short horns placed atop her head. You could scarcely make out a set of fangs protruding from her mouth, but any fear that may have come from that revelation was put away by the sheer warmth and care she eminated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever...and you were very ashamed of yourself to admit this, but you only noticed those particular features after you recovered from the shock of seeing her more prominent ones. The goat women was, to put it as politely as possible, incredibly well endowed with her build. She had a distinguishable pot belly, which would make sense since you have failed to see any food other than the warm pastries being offered in the snowy city. But you could only guess that most of the seven foot tall goat\u2019s weight went to her hyper voluptuous chest and rear end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo white, fuzzy orbs the size of basketballs bulged out heavily over the sides of the Goat\u2019s Christmas getup, swaying back and forth with every step, up and down with every breath. You chuckled a little, thinking that it could only take the magic of Christmas to keep her top from splitting at the seems. A stubby tail wagged contently atop dual beach ball sized spheres, a green and red skirt only covering a less than a quarter of it\u2019s mass. A couple of the more \u2018naughty\u2019 kids made sneering remarks about the goat\u2019s figure behind her back, but a harsh glare was apparently enough to shut them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head to knock off the snow that was piling on your hair as it fell, and mustered up enough confidence to approach the creature. You didn\u2019t feel any fear coming to her, rather...embarrassment. You honestly thought that she was very pretty, but you were at an age where your mind tended to wander to places that weren\u2019t for the Holidays. The goat, having just sent a younger child on his way with a chocolate bar, noticed you wheeling up to her and gave you a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello they're, little one!\u201d The taller goat women bent down to see you better,  giving you in turn a better view of her ample cleavage. Your blushed intensified. Normally, you didn\u2019t like being referred to as \u2018little, considering your age and your actual height standing up, but with her you didn\u2019t seem to mind. \u201cI hope your having a great Christmas Eve! Can I get you anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hi I\u2019m-\u201c you instantly beat your chest and cut yourself off as you heard how big pitched your voice was. The goat giggles knowingly and gives you a couple moments to calm down, as if this was a regular occurrence for her. \u201cSorry, I actually wanted to ask you a couple questions, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind at all sweetie~\u201d the goat women chimed, wiggling her soft paws around your waist as she carefully gripped your form. You let out a surprised gasp as she lifted you up from your wheelchair and into the air. From thin air, a wooden chair materialized behind her, wide enough to handle her generous backside. She sat down, guiding your form down onto her lap as the  other kids helped themselves to the unattended candy. It was all free anyways. \u201cAsk away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt uncomfortable being pressed up towards the goat\u2019s fluffy chest orbs, growing and detracting as her lungs filled with air. Still, you continued to suppress your less than desired desires and thought it would be rude to turn down the lady\u2019s offer. \u201cFirst off...um, w-what should I call you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may call me Jule, Julebuck the Yule Goat.\u201d Jule petted your head as you involuntarily rested it against her breasts. You didn\u2019t want to, but it was hard to not do so when she hugged your form in such a way that your head naturally wanted to lean towards her. The warmth her body gave off pulled your body into a state of comfort you never felt before, and her mammaries, although you didn\u2019t want to admit it, served as fantastic pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of the \u2018Yule Goat\u2019 before.\u201d You admitted, shifting your body as much as you could to get more comfortable on Jule\u2019s form. \u201cWas I supposed to know about you before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, cutie pie. Unless you come from Scandinavia or Germany, I\u2019m pretty much unknown in the Christmas stories.\u201d It than dawned on you that Jule was speaking German. You never questioned the dissolution of the language barrier the city seemed to provide, but it was curious that you could have a full fledged conversation here without knowing what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! So, all the other animals here are from Christmas legends?\u201d You gestured to the various other Anthro animals wandering throughout the town. The Reindeer and the Polar Bears made sense to an extent, but you were puzzled by the elephants and tigers, kangaroos and wolves. Jule gave off another cutesy giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, those are visitors like you children, though not in the way you would think.\u201d She fetched a cookie from a passing penguin offering them in a basket and offered it to you. \u201cThink of them as...very generous benefactors, without whom none of this would have been able to happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO...kay\u2026\u201d you were a little disappointed by the vagueness of her answer, but didn\u2019t press the question further. It added to the mystery of the whole night. You took the cookie from Jule\u2019s paw and nibbled at it. \u201cOne last question than...is they're anything I can help you with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJule blinked and gave you an amused smirk. \u201cThat is very generous of you to offer, my little one, but I don\u2019t think\u2026\u201d the Yule goat\u2019s gaze sort of wandered off as the wheels in her head began to turn. \u201cWell...there's ONE thing, but it\u2019s only for more my special helper. Would you like to be my very special helper, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I do. I really do!\u201d You responded with a little bit more enthusiasm than you intended. You don\u2019t know what it was about Jule, but the way she smiled down at you and warmed you inside made you feel so...spectacular. You really wanted to be with her, for as long as the night would permit you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would like me to do, Miss Julebuck?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone else was looking out at the snowy December night and making \u201cooh\u2019s\u201d and \u201caah\u2019s\u201d at the snowfall. They must all be stupid or something, it\u2019s just snow! Videogames are way cooler than snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus stopped in the Christmas village and you were all escorted out where you all watched the village parade with Santa. You scoffed at the whole parade. All the others were saying that was the real Santa. Could they really bed that gullible? That beard was clearly glued on. Once the parade ended an anthropomorphic reindeer woman walked up to your group and told you all to freely explore the village and enjoy yourselves. As your group cheered and happily dispersed you started to walk away when you felt the reindeer woman\u2019s hoof-like hand pat your head, \u201cHave a wonderful Christmas Eve deary!\u201d You scoffed at her too, \u201cYeah, sure. Nice costume by the way.\u201d The reindeer giggled, \u201cOh, how cute. It\u2019s not a costume honey. I\u2019m the real deal. You see, in this village the magic of Christmas-\u201c The reindeer stopped in her tracks once she noticed you were walking away and weren\u2019t listening. You yelled back to her, \u201cYeah right.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked around the snowy city streets, looking at all of the toy shops and bakeries. All of this would probably be exciting, if you were a poor kid, probably like most of the other chumps who came here. But your parents were loaded, they could probably buy this whole town twice over if they wanted. You were starting to get bored here, maybe you could get some kind of early bus home or something. You walk back towards the town\u2019s entrance and towards the parked Christmas Buses. No one was on the bus, but you saw a polar bear woman dressed in a red and green sweatshirt and pants combo, consoling some crying boy nearby. She had him sit on her bent knee as he cried into her furry belly and she soothingly rubbed his back, \u201cHush sweetie, it\u2019ll be ok. I promise.\u201d You walk up to her, \u201cHey lady!\u201d The polar bear\u2019s head darts towards you, \u201cI\u2019m sorry honey, just give me a few more minutes with this boy and I\u2019ll be right with you. If you need immediate help there\u2019s a Help Center down Pine Ave.\u201d You huffed in annoyance, \u201cI don\u2019t need help. I just wanna go home, this town is boring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe polar bear\u2019s head shot right back at you. At first there was a look of surprise, then it turned into a scowl. Rolling her eyes in annoyance, the polar bear woman growled, \u201cSo you\u2019re one of the naughty ones, huh?\u201d The polar bear peered around and called over a reindeer woman, the one that greeted you before. Handing the crying boy over to her the bear said, \u201cTake care of him. His grandma passed away a few months ago and it\u2019s still troubling him.\u201d A look of sympathy crossed the reindeers face, \u201cI\u2019m on it Hilda.\u201d A kind smile grew on the reindeer\u2019s muzzle as she cradled the crying boy and started walking off, \u201cI know honey. I was sad too when my nan-nan passed but always remember, they\u2019ll always love you. And that\u2019s another thing\u2026\u201d The reindeer carried the boy off, leaving you with the scowling polar bear woman, who was staring daggers at you. You didn\u2019t get what the big deal was, \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering polar bear Hilda snarled at you, spitting polar bear drool on your face, showering you in her hot, nasty breath, and showing off her bright pink gums and impressively sharp and big teeth, \u201cYou\u2019re in for it now you little turd!\u201d How did that crying boy even get so close to this thing, it stinks. You scowl back at her and cross your arms, \u201cTry me. Whatever you do to me, my parents will sue you and whatever company you work for into bankruptcy. So don\u2019t you dare touch a hair on my head.\u201d A devious, but equally frustrated and enraged grin spread across her muzzle, Hilda was stupefied by your meanness and lack of care for others, \u201cOh, you\u2019re gonna have a wild time here tonight brat. Ya\u2019 know this village is meant to reward good humans and punish and reform bad one\u2019s right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou narrowed your eyes and crossed your arms, \u201cYeah? So?\u201d Hilda\u2019s grin grew wider, she knelt down and forcefully grabbed you by the collar of your shirt and brought you up to her grinning muzzle. Now it really stunk. You waved a hand in front of your nose, scrunching your eyes and even pressing your hand against Hilda\u2019s wet nose, trying to push her away, \u201cGeez, get a Tic-Tac or something you freak!\u201d A predatory, animalistic growl escaped Hilda\u2019s throat, \u201cFirstly, young man. I am a LADY, not a freak. Secondly, you are most definitely on The Big Man\u2019s naughty list. So allow me to start administering your punishment.\u201d The polar bear started walking off, deeper into the town, still holding you by your shirt collar, \u201cLet me go! This is not A Christmas Carol. I don\u2019t need to be visited by any ghosts, or smell your nasty breath or learn some dumb lesson about peace on earth, I just need to go home so I can get my cool presents already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda rolled her eyes. There were always young humans who were a bit spoiled, maybe having a little trouble with expressing empathy, but this one? This one was especially rotten, almost cartoonishly so. A smug grin formed on Hilda\u2019s muzzle as she raised you back up to her grinning black lips, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. By the end of the night you\u2019re going to learn quite a few lessons. One of them being, never talk back to a polar bear.\u201d Hilda opened her maw nice and wide, giving you a good view of the pink inside of her drooling maw and the darkness of her esophagus, BBLLOOORRRPPP! She belched in your face, making you gag on her gas blast and punch her in the muzzle. Hilda took on a stern look as she glared at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour punch didn\u2019t hurt, but the fact that you had the gall to hit her made her angry, \u201cListen brat. Here\u2019s the deal. On Christmas Eve in Candy Cane Lane, time stops, literally. You could spend a whole decade here and never age, and once you leave here it\u2019ll still be Christmas Eve of today\u2019s date. Since you\u2019re such a brat, you\u2019re going to explore every single nook and cranny of Candy Cane Lane before you\u2019re allowed to leave\u2026 and trust me\u2026 the residents here can be very sweet, but they don\u2019t take kindly to naughty, selfish little humans like you. Hopefully once tonight is done, you\u2019ll learn a lesson or two, that is the whole point of this punishment after all.\u201d You struggle in Hilda\u2019s grasp, \u201cW-what are you gonna do with me then, burp me to death?\u201d An evil grin formed on Hilda\u2019s muzzle, \u201cGlad you asked!\u201d Hilda brings you to\u2026</span></div></div>",

Possessed with intent and completely ignoring your protests she turns left and right, navigating the mazelike network of tightly packed houses. Only once you tried to bite her did she stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really want to measure your bite up against a polar bear.\" She cooed, putting on her toothiest grin. \"Now shut your trap and stay quiet. We're almost at the party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna go to your dumb party!\" You shouted. \"Your party is gonna be lame. My parents always give me the coolest party. For one, they don't have any smelly bears in them. And they also get me a-\" You were cut off as Hilda lifted her free arm and flung you face-first into her armpit. She lowered her arm again, sealing you in the stinky pit. With her little human pacified she finished the last leg of her journey in no time at all. When you were finally released you were livid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stupid bitch! I'm gonna tell my parents what you did! I'll have them buy this whole village and fire everyone! Then I'll laugh as you waste away in the gutter, where smelly beasts like you belong!\" To your surprise your little tirade seemed unable to sour her mood any further. She just kept a pleasant smile as she showed you the door. \"My, you must be trying for some kind of record, the most rotten kid in the land. But don't worry, we'll get you sorted out. To start, since you're such a big fan of all the animals here, we've thrown you a party!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe polar bear pushes open the door and loud cheering thunders out. The house was packed to the brim with all manner of beasts. They wore various bright getups, all stark green and red. You saw horse people, more reindeer and even several more polar bears. There were even elephants and rhinos. There were so many of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Doesn't this look like fun?\" Hilda said with a joyous voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wanna go home.\" You scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home? But you are home, champ.\" One of the elephants greeted you and Hilda, walking up to the entrance. \"Come on in, but be careful. You better watch your head.\" She rubbed her forehead a little. In spite of being an elephant woman, she wasn't much taller than the rest. Nevertheless, the doorway would've given her issues. Hilda nodded and stepped in, holding you under her arm. The party was in full swing and the various animals seemed to be having fun. But amidst it all the only thing you managed to get out of this was the smell. So many beasts packed together worked up quite the stink for your delicate nose. Nobody else seemed to notice, but you couldn't believe how vile everything was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorst of all was the polar bear, whose strong grasp was impossible to break. You struggled as best you could, but she either ignored it or simply didn't notice. After spending a few minutes mingling with the guests Hilda finally had some time for you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now seems like a good time to start the punishment, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

You and your friends weren\u2019t old enough to legally drink yet\u2026 so no parties or bars for you. Christmas was still the favorite holiday of you and your friends, and you were still riding the high of getting that new game system a week ago. But you had heard of this strange place called Vampyre Lane, it was notorious for seemingly appearing in random areas out of nowhere on certain holidays of the year. It was most well known for supernaturally appearing around random small towns around Halloween, thus the mythical nickname Vampyre Lane. This neighborhood boasted tons of fun and festivities for anyone who entered\u2026 but urban myths also said that anyone who enters never returns. Since you and your friends have nothing going on tonight, you planned on sneaking out and trying to search out this elusive Vampyre Lane. If it was even half as much fun as some of the students in your school have described it\u2026 it should be a blast if it appears tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got on a heavy jacket and opened up your bedroom window. Thankfully your bedroom was on the first floor so you sneakily pop out of the window and gently close it before sprinting down the street. You meet your friends in the local square, Coin Square. There was a small park that you saw your other two friends, Beth and Leo. You wave to them and they approach you, \u201cSo\u2026 any idea where we could find this place?\u201d Leo pointed near a clearing near the local woods just a few blocks down, \u201cApparently Mr. Brixton-\u201d You interrupt, \u201cThat crazy guy? He can barely hold down his teaching job, let alone his own sanity!\u201d Leo shrugged, \u201cIt\u2019s all I\u2019ve been told about Vampyre Lane. He said he saw it seemingly appear out of nowhere in the woods that way\u2026 when he was walking his dog three Halloween\u2019s ago.\u201d You and Beth shrug. Beth replied, \u201cIt\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got. Let\u2019s go and see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou three walk towards the large clearing that led to a deep patch of dark woods. Considering it was 9 o\u2019clock at night during the winter it was nearly pitch black in those woods. You three walk into the moonlit clearing and you see something. You spot some lights deep in the woods, they\u2019re stationary and look like streetlights and house lights. You need a second to catch your breath from surprise, \u201cGuys\u2026 I think it\u2019s real\u2026 we\u2019ve found it.\u201d Vampyre Lane, the mythical party neighborhood, was actually real all along. Every other day of the year where you were looking would just be some trees and thick thorn bushes, but tonight it\u2019s magically transformed into a whole new neighborhood. You three happily rush towards it. After passing through the large metal gates you look around to see what looks like an upperclass gated community, lit up with tons of loud parties and festivities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spy a huge concert and carnival-like event going on in a park down a few blocks. There\u2019s also the rows upon rows of houses with loud parties going on inside as well as residents and guests spilling out into the streets. Down another row of blocks you spotted a ball-drop-like event happening where everyone was huddled around a ticking clock, the bars and clubs around that area also seem to be buzzing with life. Everything seemed like a normal neighborhood\u2026 until you took stock of the residents. There were a few patches of humans here and there, probably visiting like you and your friends, but this town was overwhelmingly populated by people dressed in animal costumes\u2026 strangely realistic animal costumes. You turn to your friends, \u201cS-so, where do we go from here?\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was the 4th of July, and that meant your family was taking a quick one-week vacation down to the shore to soak-up the sun and enjoy the holiday. Your parents were even nice enough to let your two best friends Aaron and Chelsea come along. You drove in late into last night and simply unpacked all your things before going to bed, but today was July 4th so you and your friends decided to go out and have some fun at the local beach. Your parents just told you to be back before dinnertime. You three got on your bikes and started pedaling towards the beach. It was a bit of a trek to get to the beach, your parents rented a vacation house a ways away from the beach to save some money, but it\u2019d be worth it once you get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou three saw a sign up ahead that read \u2018Independence Day Party At Vampyre Lane\u2019. You three stopped your bikes and looked at each other. You spoke, \u201cA party, huh? We should check it out!\u201d Aaron shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t really know this town all that well, maybe we should just stick to the beach?\u201d Chelsea smiled, \u201cAw, come on. It can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d You nodded and smiled reassuringly at Aaron, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll be in-and-out, then we\u2019ll head straight to the beach.\u201d Aaron was always a bit skittish and a momma\u2019s-boy, but you always tried to cheer him up when he was afraid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou three started pedaling down the path the sign directed you towards. The path was a bit bumpy and led through a wooded area, but as soon as you got to the other side you smiled in awe as you saw a huge, bustling beach town. There were ice cream shops, a beach in the distance, condo\u2019s bumping loud EDM music filled with loud partiers, swimming pools, a park with fireworks and a BBQ cookout, and so much more. You guys looked around in wonder. You turned to Aaron and grinned, \u201cSee? Better than you expected, right?\u201d Aaron grinned and nervously nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you did notice something a bit off. Walking around in equal number\u2026 or possibly outnumbering the various human families, teens and kids in the town were animals\u2026 walking and talking animals. Much like the humans in the town they were mostly wearing swim trunks, bikinis or other summer-wear. You turned to Chelsea and Aaron, \u201cAre those?\u201d Your two friends nodded, \u201cI think so.\u201d You weren\u2019t sure what to make of them\u2026 but no one else was screaming or panicking, so you decided to go with the flow. You turned and noticed a plaque that read, \u2018Vampyre Lane: A Town For Anthros \u2013 Where All Humans Are Welcome\u2019. So those animals must be the locals.

You already pulled some pranks in school today, filling the teachers coffee with worms and putting a whoopee cushion in the principal\u2019s office chair. You and your best friends Peter and Regina walked down the street, joking about the hilarious events at school today. As you three walked down the street you saw an arrow sign on the side of a fence reading \u201cPath to Vampyre Lane.\u201d You turned to Regina and asked, \u201cHey guys, that says it leads to Vampyre Lane?\u201d Regina replied, \u201cVampyre Lane? I thought it only appeared on Halloween?\u201d Peter chimed in, \u201cI heard it only appears on Holidays.\u201d You shrugged, \u201cWell\u2026 today\u2019s a holiday right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two friend nodded in approval, \u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d You and your friends walk down the path, following the signs. You end up walking through a few winding streets until you\u2019re led into the woods. After about fifteen minutes you three notice a large gated community, with the top of the black iron gates reading \u2018Welcome to Vampyre Lane\u2019. Peter said in awe, \u201cWoah, it\u2019s actually real.\u201d You were all giddy with excitement, Regina chirped, \u201cLet\u2019s go inside!\u201d You all rushed into the gates and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neighborhood seemed to be fairly upscale and rich, with large, lavish houses lining the blocks. You saw another sign that pointed in three directions. One arrow was pointing towards a huge house titled \u2018The Prank Mansion\u2019. The second arrow was pointing towards a park called \u2018The Humorous Haven\u2019. The third arrow pointed towards a row of houses, seemingly open to the public called \u2018Joyous Jokes Road\u2019.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had been eagerly anticipating this day all month. Finally, the first halloween you and your friends were allowed to go trick-or-treating all on your own! Unfortunately, so far it\u2019s proven\u2026 <i>disappointing</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look mournfully down at the empty pillowcase you were carrying. You\u2019d already hit every house in the neighborhood, but the area had been going through a tough time recently. Most of your neighbors had already moved out, and the ones that remained weren\u2019t in a very giving mood. Your family was pretty poor, so halloween was the only night you really got to binge on candy\u2026 but so far, you had barely gotten anything. So far, you had only gotten a gross bag of good &amp; plenty from the nice old lady down the block, and some candy corn from your friend\u2019s mom. To make matters worse, two bullies on your street, <span class=\"clblue\">Gary</span> and <span class=\"cteal\">Ron</span>, had been following you around and tormenting you endlessly, seeing that you were alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your parents had all forbidden it, your friends and you agreed that you had to leave your neighborhood if you wanted any chance of enjoying this halloween. You had narrowed down a good spot -- <i>Vampyre Lane</i>. Everyone else was afraid of it, spreading rumors of supernatural creatures stalking its roads, but you were too old to believe in that sort of thing nowadays! Among your brave ranks was <span class=\"clgreen\">Kevin</span>, a scrawny boy with wide-rimmed glasses who was dressed as a fireman, and <span class=\"cred\">Maria</span>, a hispanic girl with long black curly hair who was dressed as Cleopatra. Maria\u2019s mom also made you bring along her annoying brother <span class=\"cdorange\">Hugo</span>, who was dressed as a tiger. You were dressed as a pirate, though your costume wasn\u2019t very good, so you ended up having to explain it to everyone you met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to walk through the woods for a while to reach the neighborhood, but when you finally made it, you were in awe. You had expected <i>Vampyre Lane</i> to be some creepy old, abandoned little historical neighborhood, but it was actually a beautiful little gated community right in the middle of the forest. The huge, metallic front gate was covered in halloween decorations, welcoming trick or treaters and inviting them to enjoy their stay. Every house was huge, and their lawns were lavishly covered with halloween decorations, that looked like they must have taken all month to set up. Best of all, due to the neighborhood\u2019s fierce reputation, the streets seemed to be completely empty. You might be some of the first ones here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cC\u2019mon, guys, w-we\u2019re not supposed to be here!\u201d</span> Hugo whined incessantly, dampening everyone\u2019s spirits. He had been a literally scaredy cat all night, but by now it was just getting grating. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI want to go back! I want to go baaack!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cLet\u2019s try one house, first, okay? Then we can see how you feel,\u201d</span> Maria patted her brother on the head reassuringly as you walked up to one of the biggest, most expensive mansions on the block. The three of you wait, experiencing varying degrees of excitement and nervousness, as you ring the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, you hear footsteps approaching the door, and when it finally slid open, you were in awe. You had seen some expensive halloween costumes, but this one really took the cake! The curvaceous woman who answered the door seemed to be dressed as a tiger, but the make-up effects were amazing; it looked like she actually had orange fur running all along her body! She even had two big, fluffy ears, and a snout on her face you assumed was a mask with animatronics inside, given that she actually smiled when she looked down on you. Her tail swung back and forth behind her, seemingly of its own accord, and her ears twitched a little as she welcomed you. To make matters stranger, she was exactly seven feet tall, towering over all of you! Her costume looked <i>completely</i> realistic -- absolutely indistinguishable from what a real anthropomorphic tiger would look like! At least\u2026 you assumed it was a costume, anyway\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed a little when you noticed she seemed to be dressed incredibly skimpily, as if she had shown up to the door in her underwear. You figure wearing much more might\u2019ve ruined the effect of her fur, but still, it was a little awkward. You also noticed that she seemed to have big, wide paws for hands, as she lifted a bowl of candy out in front of you. For a moment, you grew a little nervous. Her outfit was almost a little\u2026 too realistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWhat are y\u2019all looking at me like that for? It\u2019s just a costume!\u201d</b></span> The tiger giggled. You realized that all you had been staring at her in silence this entire time, in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh! Uh, ahem!\u201d</b> You compose yourself, lifting up your pillowcase. <b>\u201cTrick or treat!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><i><b>\u201cSmell my feet, give me something good to eat\u2026\u201d</b></i></span> She sing-songed the rest of the chant as she reached into her bowl. She dropped into your bag\u2026 and entire, full-sized chocolate bar, a bag of kit-kats, and a bag of mini-oreos! <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWell, I definitely have my fair share of treats\u2026 and maybe even a few tricks! Hehe!\u201d</b></span> You looked down at your loot in awe as you step aside, letting Maria nervously walk up to the tiger and present her bag. Maria and Kevin were given similar bounties, and the three of you giggled with glee over the delicious candy you\u2019ve obtained. Finally, Maria\u2019s brother Hugo stood up to the lion, looking up at her nervously as he presented his pillowcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cAww, a lil\u2019 tiger! Why, your costume\u2019s even better than mine!\u201d</b></span> She smiled brightly upon seeing his costume, reaching down and ruffling his hair. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re so cute, I could just eat you up!\u201d</b></span> Hugo seemed to calm down immediately, smiling and giggling as the huge paw ruffled his moppy hair. He\u2019s always been a fan of big cats, tigers especially. She reaches into her bowl again, only to come up empty. Or at least, she pretended to come up empty -- she was too tall for you to tell if the bowl was actually empty or not. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cUh oh. Looks like I\u2019m fresh out of treats, actually\u2026\u201d</b></span> She frowns, only to look down and see the devastated look on Hugo\u2019s face. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t just let a fellow tiger go hungry!\u201d</b></span> She says to reassure him, stroking her chin contemplatively. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cTell you what. I\u2019ve been making some brownies and such for a party later tonight. Maybe you can help me cook -- be my assistant taste tester!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo seemed excited by the idea, and walked forward to follow the tigress; but Maria grabbed his arm before he could enter. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cUh, he\u2019s with us,\u201d</span> she says, not trusting the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWell, either way, I can\u2019t just let him walk around by himself out here,\u201d</b></span> the \u2018tiger\u2019 crossed her arms, sounding a little more assertive all of a sudden. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cHonestly, I have half a mind to call your parents\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaped at this. If your parents knew you had come all the way here, they\u2019d be so angry at you\u2026 you\u2019d never get to go trick-or-treating again! <b>\u201cNo no no! It\u2019s fine! Really!\u201d</b> You insisted to the tiger, pulling Maria\u2019s hand away. <b>\u201cW-we\u2019ll just be back later tonight, when we\u2019re done!\u201d</b> The tiger smiled at this, gesturing at Hugo to come on in. You can all only watch as he rushes inside excitedly, disappearing around a corner deeper into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry yourselves. I\u2019ll take good care of your friend here,\u201d</b></span> she smiled, as she slowly slid the door closed once again. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cHave a lovely halloween!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike that, the door slammed closed, and there was silence again. As you walked back down the woman\u2019s driveway, Maria seemed a little worried, but you and Kevin were relieved that Hugo would be out of your hair for the night. It meant more candy for the three of you, anyway! At this point, you figure this had to be a community full of weird, eccentric millionaires who loved halloween a little too much. It was basically a jackpot! You chomped down on mini-oreos graciously as you considered the next house you\u2019d stop by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe houses all seemed largely identical, but they had different \u2018themes\u2019 for the decorations on their front lawn. One of the houses seemed to be themed around bad omens, such as broken mirrors, black cats and salt. You\u2019d have to walk under a ladder just to get to the front door, which was a funny touch. Another house had a fake graveyard in the front lawn, with little animatronic skeleton hands \u2018reaching\u2019 out from the graves. Another seemed to be based on delicious halloween food, with giant, fake pumpkins, candy corn, and other tasty-looking decorations littering the lawn. While most of the houses seemed to be just fun and goofy, there was one \u2018haunted house\u2019 on the block that seemed to be trying to be scary, with spooky strobe lights and scary, ghostly noises played on speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost couldn\u2019t wait to see what kind of candy you\u2019d get next! You chose the next house almost without thinking...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The closest house\u2019s lawn seemed to be an unorganized mishmash of various bad omens. You recognized most symbols, such as the ladder, the broken mirrors, the ouija boards.. But there were also quite a few you didn\u2019t recognize, like the pair of shoes, or the fancy pocket knife. You weren\u2019t sure if this was supposed to be \u2018scary\u2019, but the three of you did have a nervous chuckle as you had to duck under a ladder on your way to the door. You eagerly ring the doorbell, excited to see what you\u2019ll find on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t hear any movement on the other side of the door for a while, and for a moment you assumed the house was empty, until you finally hear the doorknob slowly turn. Instead of opening normally, the door just sort of slid open slowly\u2026 so slowly you almost assumed it had just been blown open by the wind, before you said a pair of big, glowing yellow eyes peek at you, with distinctly feline pupils. Just from the position of their eyes, you could tell that they were also about 7 feet tall, which unnerved you somewhat. They didn\u2019t offer you any candy or anything, they just\u2026 stared at you from the darkness of their house. <b>\u201cUh\u2026 trick or treat!\u201d</b> You finally announced, nervously, trying to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYou walked under my ladder.\u201d</b></span> A scratchy but distinctly feminine voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there, blinking. <b>\u201c... what?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYou walked under my ladder,\u201d</b></span> she reaches out a hand, with long claws and black fur, pointing at the ladder behind the three of you. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t you know that\u2019s bad luck?\u201d</b></span> She insists ominously, almost whispering now. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cSomething terrible might happen now.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHeh, yeah\u2026\u201d</b> You chuckled nervously. You figure she was just trying to scare you, though her voice sounded completely serious. Eventually, she pulled the door open entirely, looming over the three of you. She, herself, seemed to be some kind of voluptuous black cat, some of her \u2018fur\u2019 somehow glowing yellow, which, in the darkness, gave her the impression of being a skeleton. It was a clever costume, of course, though moderately confusing. Plus, you suspected that the woman might be completely naked, but with her black fur combined with the thick darkness, it was impossible to tell. She seemed to be staring at three of you curiously, as if she had never seen anything like you before. Apparently, you were just as fascinating to her as she was to you. Her \u2018costume\u2019 seemed to be just as expensive as the tiger woman you met earlier. You wondered if there was some kind of store just for these weird animal costumes. Was the height part of the costume? <b>\u201c... trick or treat?\u201d</b> You repeated, waiting for her to offer up some candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYes. Yes, I have treats!\u201d</b></span> She said, her ears perking up as if you had reminded her. She had a very strong accent of some sort, as if English wasn\u2019t her first language. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cCookies! Very, very cookies I have prepared all month!\u201d</b></span> She rushes away excitedly, disappearing into the darkness. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI will be back!\u201d</b></span> You and your friends were left alone again, staring into the darkness of the woman\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cWe should leave,\u201d</span> Kevin whispered, nervously, the second she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 weird. I think she\u2019s up to something.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cShe seems to be from out of country. Maybe this is her first Halloween,\u201d</b> you whisper. <b>\u201cBesides, she made cookies. How could we turn that down?\u201d</b> Just as you finished your conversation, the cat returned. The tray of cookies in her hands seemed completely fresh, despite her insistence that she\u2019s been working on it all month. The cookies were still fresh, warm and soggy. They looked sort of like simple chocolate chip cookies, but\u2026 black, for some reason? You had never really seen anything like them before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cCookies! Take one! Be careful!\u201d</b></span> She says, holding them eagerly out in front of you. The three of you reluctantly take a cookie each off the tray, about to put them in your pillowcases. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t put them in your bags! Eat them while they are still hot!\u201d</b></span> She insists, staring at you in anticipation. You.. weren\u2019t sure if this was the best idea, but really, what\u2019s the worst that could happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you look at each other nervously, before biting from your cookies all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly what happens next depends on random chance. For your sake, here\u2019s hoping you get lucky...</span></div></div>",

You three were sent stumbling out onto her leathery paw. You shuddered in fear, looking at the paw beneath you that easily held you, Maria and Kevin. You felt truly miniscule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peered up at the cat lady\u2019s grinning face, \u201c<b>Thank you miss. Now can you make us big again</b>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat raised a furry brow and grinned, chuckling a bit, \u201c<b><span class=\"ctan\">Big? Make <i>YOU</i> big? Oh, no, no, no young one.

This weird lady obviously had some sort of magic up her sleeve, which could mean anything could happen. Soon, you saw the \"Good Omen\" itself, and you had no idea what to think. On a table in the corner, you saw a relatively large, mahogany board. On one end, you saw a half circle with \"START\" carved into it. A long, curving rode of blocks connect that half circle to another half circle with \"GOOD OMEN\" carved into it. You saw 30 spaces between the start and \"Good Omen\" space. Some of the tiles were a different color, and they had phrases carved into them. A few of them had some flavor text carved into them, followed by something like \"Skip Your Next Turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Our saving grace is a board game?\"</b> you asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cyellow\">\"No no no no!\"</span></b> the lady stuttered out. <b><span class=\"cyellow\">\"It's a sophisticated device I constructed under the strict orders of spirits.

Brace yourselves.\"</span></b> Suddenly, she tilted the jar, and you all fell out. You each tumbled down, you first, then Maria, then Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"C'mon, let's get off of this thing,\"</span> Marisa said.

If you don't follow the rules, the omens will never leave you!\"</span></b> she said. Marisa backed away, and the lady began to fish in a compartment on the side. She pulled out, clenching something in her hand. She dropped something on the Start space, and you saw the \"transportation devices\" were, in fact, tiny, six sided dice. They were still half your size, but they were tiny for the lady. <b><span class=\"cyellow\">\"The pirate was first, so he must roll first.\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou each grabbed a die, and decided you didn't want to risk ticking her off. You could only play her game now. You each got into position, you right in behind the border. <b><span class=\"cyellow\">\"6 spaces away, I see 'You stumbled onto a bog of eternal stench! You're forced to stay there for one turn.' 2 spaces away, I see 'You wandered onto a monster's platter! You're trapped until the other subject or subjects roll a sum of eight.'

You decided you may as well play this out for now. She wasn't going to let you out of the play area. You held the die overhead, and threw it forward.

One time in Science Class when the teacher announced a pop-quiz that he wasn\u2019t prepared for Kevin started hyperventilating\u2026 so much so, he had to be excused to the nurse\u2019s office.

He quickly shielded his eyes as if the die would attack him once it settled on the board. There was a long pause throughout the room.

Such a thing boggled the mind... and yet there she was in, in the flesh, towering over you like some kind of goddess. All you had to do to earn her favor, though, was play a little board game.

Most spaces were plain, <span class=\"clgrey\">gray blocks</span> that had no apparent effect. A few of the blocks were colorful, though, their effects hand-scrawled upon their surfaces; such as the <span class=\"corange\">orange spaces</span>, which simply shifted the flow of the game in minor ways. Most prominent, and most worrying, were the <span class=\"clred\">bad omen</span> spaces, which all advised some frankly disconcerting 'challenges'. Due to the strange wording, you couldn't rightly tell, but you prayed those bad omens weren't literal. Some of them were downright terrifying in their implications. Just as you were considering this, the cat urged you forward with one of her huge paws, and your friends watched on in horror as you obliged, leaping from one space to the other until you had gotten to where you needed to go. You looked down at the space below you \u2013 red. The cat clicked her teeth.<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\"Oh, dear...\"</b></span> she said, and you scream out when she lifts you by your shirt collar before you can even read the tile. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\"Well, I suppose this is as good a time as any to demonstrate the <i>bad</i> omens.\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively squirm and wriggle in her grasp as she brings you up to her giant face, hating the feeling of vulnerability. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\"My apologies, little one,\"</b></span> the feline whispered, low enough for only you to hear it; and when you opened your eyes, you found yourself staring right down her dark throat as she spread open her jaws. Before you could even react, you were plunged right between those waiting jaws, as she slammed her lips shut so your friends wouldn't have to bear witness to your fate. You were immediately soaked completely in saliva as her tongue pressed all over the sides of her mouth, rolling and squeezing you within the tight confines of her maw. You thought she was simply toying with you, as cats would with their prey; in reality, though, she was simply trying to position you in just the right way to slip you down her throat. Unlike most anthros, she wasn't the best at swallowing such lively meals whole, and certainly didn't enjoy it as much. She just wanted to get this over with. All the while, you were pressed against her cheeks and teeth as her tongue batted you around, until you eventually just didn't have the energy to fight back anymore. With that, you were laid on top of her tongue like it was a bed; it was even comfortable, for a while. Until her throat muscles locked down around your feet, of course, and dragged you down into the darkness with one terrifying pull...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Oh my god...\"</span> Despite only being spectators, your friends had an even better idea of what was going on than you did. While you were disoriented and blinded by darkness and saliva, they could clearly see the incredible bulge you made as the cat tried her hardest to force you down her throat. You were struggling with all your might as you tried to get her to spit you out, the cat cringing and gagging as you pushed at the confines of her throat for a while. But against the overwhelming power of the larger feline's body, you exhausted quickly... and the bulge in the cat's neck soon disappeared behind her impressive bust. The entire trip, from her hand to her belly, felt like it lasted hours, but in reality, it had only taken a few seconds. The feline coughs and gasps for air once the obstruction in her throat had finally passed, as she felt the familiar sensation of tiny hands and feet against the walls of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recoiled in horror once you realized where you were. You felt like you were in a giant, pitch-black sauna, the gurgling and groaning of the gut around you like a cacophony in your ears. You fumbled around blindly in the dark, trying to claw your way out of the corrosive pool of juices that rose up to your knees at the bottom of the stomach, but the walls were far too wet and slippery for you to climb free. As you tried to navigate in the darkness, you accidentally grabbed onto something hard and chalky that had been floating around in the gastric juices. Exploring it with your hands, you realized what you were holding... a <i>skull</i>, from one of the board game's previous victims! Your screams were muffled completely by the walls of her belly as you flailed around, consumed by panic. Meanwhile, your friends were staring at the cat's belly, certain that they had just watched you die. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\"I understand your concerns, little ones, but for your friend's sake, I recommend you hurry up and continue,\"</b></span> the cat said, rubbing her growling stomach, wincing uncomfortably at the movement within <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\"I'll try not to hurt him, but according to the rules, he must remain in there until the two of you collectively roll a sum of 8.

He immediately squealed and wriggled against his captor, only to freeze up like a deer in headlights when he noticed he had been lifted up to the feline woman\u2019s face. He was certain he\u2019d be devoured. Unfortunately, judging by the look on the cat\u2019s face, an even more humiliating fate was in store for him. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 sorry for this one. Truly. It\u2019s quite distasteful, but\u2026\u201d</b></span> The feline frowned, also seeming a little uncomfortable with this particular \u2018trial\u2019. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cLet\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Maria was smart enough to avert her eyes; watching her friend\u2019s fate play out would only distract her from the game. She needed to stay calm, now more than ever. Both of them expected the cat to simply swallow him, like she had you \u2014 and Kevin, having braced himself for a trip down a cat\u2019s throat, was equal parts relieved and confused when she instead brought him behind her back, lowering her hand down the length of her sylphlike body. His confusion only reached its peak when he reached his apparent destination, and found himself held aloft in front of the cat\u2019s rear end. Even from a normal perspective, the otherwise skinny feline\u2019s behind was prodigious; from this size, it was enormous! Despite the circumstances, he was, for a moment, enraptured by the sight. As he stared at it, it seemed to get even bigger, until it finally eclipsed the entirety of his vision. Eventually, he snapped back to his senses and realized it wasn\u2019t getting bigger\u2026 he was getting closer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another moment, Kevin suddenly found himself somewhere dark, soft and morbidly smelly. On second thought; he thought he was shrouded in darkness, but in reality, he was simply surrounded by long, pure black fur. His soft surrounding was actually pillowy skin, squeezing in on him from both sides. He realized where he was pretty quick \u2014 it didn\u2019t take a genius to put two and two together. The feline cringed and winced uncomfortably at the human\u2019s squirms, as she pushed him deeper into her crack with two fingers, trying to push the unlucky soul into a more convenient position. Withdrawing her fingers, she gripped her round cheeks with both hands and pressed them together as tightly as she could, restraining her tiny captive between them so he doesn\u2019t just accidentally slip free. With the human settled, she sits down on a chair by the table, just to restrain Kevin even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that the gruesome process was finished, she turned back to see the feline all alone, shifting uncomfortably in her seat. Kevin was nowhere to be seen, and Maria assumed the worst. She was completely unaware of her friend\u2019s current sweaty, musky, claustrophobic prison. All she knew for sure was that she needed to get her head back in the game, and mentally calculate the possibilities.. She could free both her friends with this very turn; she just had to roll a 3, a 4, or a 5. That\u2019s a 50/50 chance. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cUrgh\u2026 alright,\u201d</b></span> The feline frowns, obviously unhappy with what she has to do. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cGo ahead and roll.\u201d</b></span> She gently hands the die to Maria, who\u2019s busy pondering her next move. She was always pretty strategically minded, but no matter what plans she considered, her mind drew a blank. It seemed her only choice was to just roll the dice and\u2026 hope she gets lucky. Resigning herself to her fate, she closes her eyes, holds her breath and tosses the die with all her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fate, indeed, is a matter of chance...</span></div></div>",

All she had to do was not land on one of the bad omen spaces, and they would all be safe. She closed her eyes, trying to gather all her courage as she lifted the dice above her head\u2026 only to toss it forward with all her might! She took a deep breath, before daring to open her eyes and see what the dice landed on. \u2026 three! What was that again? Maria\u2019s mind had been so addled by fear, she had totally forgotten if that was a red space or not. But she felt strangely compelled to hop forward anyway, eventually landing on her space and seeing that it was, indeed, grey. In most games, that wouldn\u2019t even be particularly surprising\u2026 but here, Maria felt more relieved than she ever felt before in her life, almost jumping for joy! Even the feline woman seemed to \u2018clap\u2019 with the edges of her fingers, applauding the move. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cCongratulations! Lucky roll!\u201d</b></span> The black cat smiled, as if genuinely rooting for the trick-or-treaters. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cPlease allow me a moment to free your friends.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat stood up from her chair and lifted one leg slightly, digging between her soft, pillowy cheeks to retrieve Kevin, drenched in sweat and smelling surprisingly gross. Apparently, she had silently passed gas while he was in there. She placed him gently back onto his tile as he gasped for fresh air, before turning her attention to the human in her belly. She started hacking and gagging, like a cat trying to cough up a hairball, as a bulge worked its way up her throat, until she finally spat you onto her hand, covered in saliva. You were limp, covering your eyes as they adjusted to the light. Compared to the cat\u2019s stomach, the room-temperature living room felt like it was freezing, and the air felt and smelled fresh and clear. She wrapped you up in a napkin, letting you use it as a towel to dry the juices off you, as she placed you back on your tile. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI will give you a moment to recuperate.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cGuys!\u201d</span> Maria called from her tile. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cAre you alright?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d</b> you said with a shiver, surprisingly calm considering the circumstances.

He stood up, pointing an excusing finger at the cat. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cYOU! You put me\u2026 put me in\u2026 what is wrong with you? Y-you\u2019re crazy!

You\u2019d never seen him be so\u2026 assertive.  <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cBesides, it\u2019s not the omens doing this; it\u2019s you! You\u2019re the one that gave us these cookies, and you\u2019re the one that made this stupid board game!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m trying to help you, here,\u201d</b></span> the woman replied, looking a little offended. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cNone of this was my doing. Your fate was decided by the fates themselves; and if you give up now, then your fate is to be doomed.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cYou\u2019re crazy! Why should I believe anything you say, anyway?\u201d</span> Kevin said, dismissively turning away from her, seeing she wouldn\u2019t listen to reason. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cC\u2019mon, guys! Let\u2019s get out of here!\u201d</span> He insisted, looking to the two of you for approval, only to see you staring at him blankly. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cGuys? I said let\u2019s go!\u201d</span> There was a long silence, as if he couldn\u2019t understand why you weren\u2019t taking his side on this. Even you needing some time to get your thoughts in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cKevin\u2026 look around. Don\u2019t you see how tiny we are? I mean, we can\u2019t even make it off this table on our own,\u201d</span> Maria frowned, trying to gently break the grim truth of the situation; you really didn\u2019t have a choice. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cHow could we ever live our lives like\u2026 this?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah. I say, any risk we have to take is worth it,\u201d</b> you nod in agreement, <b>\u201cand this cat lady seems like the only person that might know how to cure us. So\u2026 I think we should do what she says.\u201d</b> Kevin seemed shocked that his only two friends in the world weren\u2019t siding with him. In shock, he looks back and forth at the two of you, and then up at the feline, trying to make sense of all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYou can drop out of the game personally, if you wish,\u201d</b></span> she offers, <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cbut note that every player serves as a safety net for the other players. With only two players, your friends\u2026 won\u2019t have much of a chance.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin seemed overwhelmed with despair by his situation. He was faced with two intolerable options; either he continue this abominable \u2018game\u2019, or he abandon his friends. It was near impossible for him to make a choice like that. You decided to help him out somewhat. <b>\u201cListen, Kevin,\u201d</b> you say, trying to calm him down. <b>\u201cJust let me take my turn, and we\u2019ll see what happens. Okay?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelmed, he covered his face with his hands, crying to himself. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201c... okay\u2026\u201d</span> He quietly whimpered, and the cat handed you the dice once again. You tried to look confident as you tossed the dice; after all, all you had to do was not roll a 4. The odds were in your favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes, and rolled\u2026</span></div></div>",

Even worse, they left him with a tiger of all things. Maria shuddered as she thought about her brother being inside that belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe die finally landed, causing the small girl to fall to her knees as she saw what it was: a two.

You were fearful of what was going to happen next but curious to know what exactly this board game had in store for you three. You noticed the cat lady was lost in thought for a moment, her long black tail swayed side to side as she pondered, \u201c<b><span class=\"ctan\">Hmmm, well it\u2019s not the worst thing.

Now you know why it was referred to as the \u2018Bog of Eternal Stench\u2019, it smelt like hot manure mixed with raw sewage on a hot summer day. You nearly felt like puking and you weren\u2019t even trapped yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough your friends couldn\u2019t smell the horrid stenches you were they could tell you certainly weren\u2019t having a good time.

The sweaty, furry flesh enveloped you on all sides. The clawed hand retreated out of the crevice behind you. You squirmed and kicked and punched with vigor but it had no impact on the jiggly butt-flesh that entrapped you. You whimpered, about to cry about your situation before you got filled with energy and anger again, you beat against the butt cheeks as they ensnared you, \u201c<b>Let me go you overgrown housecat</b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all of your thrashing about the most of a response you got was the cat lady clenching her furry, sweaty cheeks around you, \u201c<b><span class=\"ctan\">Enough squirming boy.

In no time a hot burst of wind blew past you, PPRRFFTTTT! The disgusting stench of cat farts invaded the fleshy crevice that entrapped you. Your eyes watered and your nostrils burned as you continued to squirm, eventually being assaulted by blast after blast of feline flatulence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside of the cat\u2019s bulbous booty she gave her butt a slap, \u201c<b><span class=\"ctan\">Settle down now you</span></b>.\u201d PRRFFFBBBTTTT!

You were about to thank her for the delicious cookies, maybe even ask for a few more cookies, but you stopped yourself. You felt strange and tired all of a sudden. Your limbs felt as if they were made of concrete and your eyes became heavy. Instead of thanking the cat lady you let out a yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whirled around to notice Kevin and Maria in a similar state. There must\u2019ve been something wrong with those cookies! Your hearing started sounding weird, the pitch of the crickets sounded deep and bassy, the crunching of Fall leaves sounded like explosions. Your vision became blurry and distorted. You were so tired, you laid down on the ground and almost immediately fell asleep as your head situated itself on the cat ladies concrete front stoop. Maria and Kevin followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black cat lady smiled widely at the three sleeping trick-or-treaters, clapping her paws together and licking her lips, \u201c<b><span class=\"ctan\">Ah, wonderful, yes! Mother\u2019s old recipe for Enchanted Sleeping Cookies worked</span></b>.\u201d The domesticated feline put her paws on her hips and wore a smug smirk as she looked down at you three, \u201c<b><span class=\"ctan\">Now you must pay for your bad omens</span></b>.\u201d You three were soon dragged into the cat ladies\u2019 dark house as the door was eventually closed once again, sealing you all inside with her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t sure how much time has passed when you reawaken. In reality, you three were only unconscious for ten minutes, but to you it felt like you slept for days. As you open your eyes you notice you\u2019re sat on a large couch in a well-lit living room. The place was nicely furnished with a black wood coffee table in front of you with a vase of deep purple flowers. In front of you was a large flat-screen television and hung on the wall above that was a painting. You gasped as you noticed the painting was of a nude black cat woman. You were in the black cat\u2019s house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gasping you could hear the cat\u2019s voice a few rooms away, \u201c<b><span class=\"ctan\">Oh! Trick-or-treaters awake again</span></b>.\u201d You then heard the click-clack of her paw-ed feet on the wooden floor as she approached the living room. You try to get up and sprint out of here before you notice your arms and legs have been bound with rope, a strange rope that had a faint green glow to it. You then notice Kevin and Maria were situated on the couch next to you, both starting to awaken. Click-clack-clack! The black cat entered the living room with a smile on her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b><span class=\"ctan\">Ah yes! My trick-or-treaters are awake. Now I must punish you three for bad omens</span></b>.\u201d Upon the mention of \u2018bad omens\u2019 her ears flattened and her feline eyes narrowed at you. Was she really that mad that you stepped under her ladder? The cat continued as she approached you, \u201c<b><span class=\"ctan\">Since I am the local omen mage I must administer your bad omens myself</span></b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what an Omen Mage was and even less of an idea why this cat was trying to punish you and your friends, but you did certainly know that you wanted to get out of here. You pull and tug at your bindings but you can\u2019t break them, in fact, they feel like they\u2019re getting tighter. By now Maria and Kevin have both fully woken up and both were startled at the situation. They tugged at their bindings, receiving a similar tightening effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria grunted and whined as she writhed on the couch, \u201c<span class=\"clred\">Mmmmmfff, what\u2019s going on? Let us go</span>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin whined and whimpered, kicking and grunting but getting himself nowhere, \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\">Aw man, I told you guys this was bad news. I knew it, I knew it</span>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only further grated on Maria\u2019s nerves, \u201c<span class=\"clred\">Oh, will you give it a rest Kevin</span>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin looked red in the face and said in a scared but slightly annoyed voice, \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\">I\u2019m not gonna be quiet Maria, you two were the one\u2019s that dragged us into this and</span>-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black cat growled and yelled, \u201c<b><span class=\"ctan\">Silence you three! You are breaking my concentration. I must now administer your bad omen</span></b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeak in fear and try to talk your way out of this, still believing this is just a lady in a costume. Probably just playing a mean, yet elaborate prank. \u201c<b>Listen miss, we\u2019re sorry that we broke the rules and walked under your ladder, but can we please just go. We promise to never cause any bad omens ever again</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria barged in with her own comment, \u201c<span class=\"clred\">Yeah! And if you don\u2019t let us go the cops will come looking for us. Don\u2019t think you\u2019d wanna deal with them. Vampyre Lane is just a few blocks from the local police station after all</span>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black cat seemed to be listening intently, closed her eyes and responded, \u201c<b><span class=\"ctan\">I dearly apologize for what I must do, but it is the law of Vampyre Lane that I perform any and all bad omens that befall trick-or-treaters. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, the sooner I can perform your omen, the sooner this will end</span></b>.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat\u2019s mind seemed to be made up as she loomed over you three before Maria interrupted again, \u201c<span class=\"clred\">Oh yeah. So what are you gonna do then</span>?\u201d The cat raised a confused furry brow before answering with a rumbling stomach\u2026</span></div></div>",

You stare back at the strange chocolate chip cookie and decide to take a bite out of it. It tastes pretty good. You turn back to Kevin and Maria who have followed suit and taken a bite. They both seem to be enjoying their cookies as well. Looks like you were freaking out for nothing. Sure this cat lady did act a bit strange but she did seem to be from out of the country. She was probably just getting used to the local customs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the cat lady, you look back up at her to see her smirking with a raised brow, \u201c<span class=\"ctan\"><b>See! I tell you. My cookies are very tasty</b></span>!\u201d You three nod in agreement as you finish off your cookies, the air of suspicion dissipating around you. You were much less afraid now. You half expected to find something nasty or evil in the cookies like a witches curse or boogers, but these cookies were actually super delicious. These were even better than the homemade ones your mom makes. You didn\u2019t want to sound too greedy, but you wanted to ask for more. They were just so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat lady waved goodbye to you three and turned her back to you, giving you a good view of her behind. Each butt cheek was the size of a pumpkin, and a pretty massive pumpkin at that. But you felt strange\u2026 wrong, almost. You needed more of those cookies! You couldn\u2019t stop at just one. They were too delicious. They were the best things you\u2019ve ever tasted. As the door started to creak shut you yelped, \u201c<b>Wait</b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat paused and then opened the door up again, turning back to face you with a questioning look, \u201c<b><span class=\"ctan\">Yes! What is it</span></b>?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou replied, a bit nervous, \u201c<b>Uh\u2026 miss? Could we have some more of your cookies? Please</b>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin, who was also nervous, but for a very different reason retorted, \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\">Um\u2026 actually that won\u2019t be a problem miss, we have a lot more houses to go to</span>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria grimaced at Kevin, \u201c<span class=\"clred\">Don\u2019t be such a scaredy cat Kevin</span>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin complained, \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\">I\u2019m not</span>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned widely, knowing that her enchanted cookies had taken affect. Her smile gives you a good view of her pointy feline teeth as her tail happily swayed back and forth behind her, \u201c<b><span class=\"ctan\">Well, it sounds like I have fans of my cookies. I do have many more cookies, tons. Just follow me and I\u2019ll give you a whole batch</span></b>.\u201d At this point your mouth waters, the promise of more of those delicious pieces of chocolatey heaven tantalizes you. Little did you know that this cat lady was a witch. The black cat gestures you to come inside. Should you continue inside for a feast of cookies or continue onward with your trick-or-treating?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You three decided to head towards the Graveyard House. As you opened up a rusty, creaking gate you were met with a myriad of cheesy Halloween decorations. Each side of the lawn had perfectly symmetrically cut grass and goofy props that probably only cost a total of a hundred bucks at the local Target. There were plastic skeletons and ghosts hanging off the house\u2019s drain pipe; plastic monster hands \u2018clawing\u2019 at the ground, Styrofoam headstones that read things like \u2018Here lies Dumbie Jones\u2019, and tufts of fog rolled out from a fog machine who\u2019s power button light could easily be seen from behind a bush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and your friends walked up the cobblestone path to the expensive house\u2019s porch you turned to Maria and Kevin, commenting, \u201c<span class=\"cblack\">For a huge house in a rich neighborhood this person really went for the budget Halloween decorations this year</span>.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin and Maria giggled a bit with you as you walked up to the door, knocking on it and waiting for the person inside to answer. You were in higher spirits now. That tiger lady surely was just a fluke, just someone who was really into Halloween. You bet this next person is in some cheesy witch costume, or a zombie covered in dollar store blood and make-up. You wait out there in silence in the cold October night until you finally hear heavy footsteps rushing their way to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear muffled cackles and evil laughter coming from behind the door, obviously fake and badly acted, \u201c<span class=\"chotpink\">Who dares comes to my haunted abode? They will surely meet an untimely demise</span>.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaks open and you needed to hold back your surprise when you were met with yet another person costumed as an anthropomorphic animal. This time the costume in question was that of a hyena woman. She had very shaggy, grey, messy fur, giving her an almost energetic and playful aura. Similar to the tiger lady, she was roughly seven feet tall, and wore very little clothing, this time opting for only a thin, silky black cloak to conceal her nakedness. But you couldn\u2019t shake just how life-like her fur looked? Did they use real animal fur for these costumes? Even more concerning was her muzzle. Her black, canine nose didn\u2019t look plastic at all, and instead had the same wet consistency that a living, breathing canine\u2019s would. You saw the nostrils even flare up, like she was sniffing you. You noticed how her teeth and tongue didn\u2019t look one-bit rubbery, and instead looked wet and natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena woman smiled ear to ear when she noticed you three. A smile that would be much more comforting if it wasn\u2019t worn by a sharp-toothed predator. She looked incredibly youthful\u2026 as far as you could tell. He facial structure and bodily features made her look like a twenty-something. The hyena woman also wore very wide hips and curvy thighs, with a sizeable bust the size of basketballs. The tall costumed woman knelt down so she was eye-level with you three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cooed, \u201c<span class=\"chotpink\">Aw, looks like I got the three cutest little trick-or-treaters at my door. I bet you\u2019re looking for some candy, well good news\u2026 I got tons</span>!\u201d The hyena stood back up and shuffled over, seeming to be grabbing large paw-fulls of candy off to the side of the door. She returned back into view with huge quantities of Hershey bars, Mike and Ikes and bags of Candy Corn. She dumped loads of the delicious treats in each of your bags. Once she was done she smirked at you three and cocked her head to the side and poked her cheek with a claw. She stared at you three as if contemplating something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look her up and down with suspicion before awkwardly starting, \u201c<span class=\"cblack\">Um\u2026 thanks\u2026 so I guess\u2026 we\u2019ll just go now</span>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou three turn around and start to head out before you hear the hyena woman yell, \u201c<span class=\"chotpink\">Wait, don\u2019t you wanna stay for a while</span>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Kevin more uneasy, he whispered to you, \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\">Let\u2019s go. This ladies\u2019 creepy. Can we just go home now</span>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then heard the hyena yell out again, \u201c<span class=\"chotpink\">I have a map if you\u2019d like</span>.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made you perk up. If you had a map that means you\u2019d know where everything in Vampyre Lane is. You could find the biggest houses and get the most candy. It was the perfect plan. You spun back around, much to Kevin\u2019s distain, \u201c<span class=\"cblack\">Wait. No. Don\u2019t close the door</span>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena lady, who\u2019s back was turned to you, spun back around with a grin on her black, rubbery canine lips. She raised an eyebrow, \u201c<span class=\"chotpink\">Oh, so now you guys wanna come inside, huh</span>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, beaming up at her big pleading, puppy eyes, \u201c<span class=\"cblack\">Please? We just want a fun Halloween</span>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena put her paws on her hips and looked down at you with narrowed eyes and a questioning expression. She soon broke her act and cackled loudly, clapping her paws together, \u201c<span class=\"chotpink\">Alright, come on in</span>.\u201d She waved her paw for you three to enter. She knelt down when you were about to pass her and playfully pinched your cheek, \u201c<span class=\"chotpink\">I could never say no to an adorable pirate like you</span>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood back up, closing the fancy, carved, wooden door and moving deeper into her well-lit house. The interior of the house, much like the outside was nice and lavish. The hyena woman had polished wood floors, pink paint on the walls and various expensive paintings hanging on them, most of anthropomorphic animals. What was up with this town\u2019s obsession with animals? You followed the hyena into her kitchen where she rummaged through a few cupboards. You noticed there was a DJ set-up, a drink and snack table and a large television in the living room playing scary movies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria noticed this as well, turning to the hyena lady who had her back to you three, and asked, \u201c<span class=\"clred\">Miss\u2026 what\u2019s that</span>?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena twisted her head back around, seeing that you three were eying her living room. She chuckled, pulling a large piece of paper out of the cupboard, \u201c<span class=\"chotpink\">Oh, that? It\u2019s for my party tonight. Whole town\u2019s gonna be here. If you\u2019re looking to meet the townsfolk of Vampyre Lane, this is the place to do it. There\u2019ll be party games, scary movies, snacks, the whole nine yards. Ever since college I\u2019ve always thrown the coolest parties</span>.\u201d She smirked, remembering her glory days in Vampyre University, batting the rolled up piece of paper in her paw. She soon snapped out of it, shaking her head, \u201c<span class=\"chotpink\">But anyways, here\u2019s the map</span>.\u201d She handed it over to Maria, \u201c<span class=\"chotpink\">Of course, if you\u2019d like to stay for the party, you\u2019re welcome to hang out here before it starts. If you\u2019re looking for candy there\u2019ll be tons of it here too</span>.\u201d What do you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next point of interest was a strange house. It almost looked like it was made of gingerbread. You saw gingerbread walls, with holes where the windows should be, what looked like frosting holding the bits of house together, and similar frosting decorations adorning the rest of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Woah, this guy went all out,\"</b> you whistled. You hoped they didn't spend all of their candy money on decorations. The three of you approached, and the closer you got, the more you smelled gingerbread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"They wasted no cent on decoration,\"</span> Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpgreen\">\"Let's just hope they spent as much on the candy,\"</span> Kevin said, an air of worry in his voice. You three soon reached the front door, and steeled yourself for whatever may be on the other side. Then again, it was probably a clich\u00e9d witch costume, seeing the gingerbread theme. You knocked, and the three f you held open your bags. Soon, the chocolate bar looking door opened up, and the owner of the house didn't look like anything you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis person owned another animal suit, this time resembling a goat. However, this goat was wearing an apron. <i>Just</i> an apron. You thought you might've miss-seen it at first, but, sure enough, you saw her frilly, pink apron, but no signs of pants, tank top, not even underwear. All you saw was the white fur of her costume covered only by a pink apron, which just so happened to have a pentagram over the stomach. That goat being a costume may've excused the \"nudity,\" but seeing this goat dressed only in an apron still made you feel weird looking at her, especially when the last person you saw wore clothes. Skimpy clothes, but clothes nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking things weirder was her body. Her hips were even wider than your shoulder span, and, even under her apron, you could see her bosom jutting out to the size of a beach ball. Her apron also did little to hide the guy she bore. You'd consider her a cute pudgy. She held an orange bowl, whose width was dwarfed by her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"T-trick o-or treat,\"</b> you said. You felt really nervous looking at her, to the point where you were scared to even say a full sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Oh my, what an adorable firefighter, pharaoh, and...\"</span> she began. Her voice sounded soft and caring. You almost felt like you could wrap yourself up with it like it were a warm blanket. Then, you realized someone else didn't know who you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"P-pirate,\"</b> you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"...and pirate!\"</span> she finished. She reached into her bowl, and you could hear the scrunching of candy wrappers. She pulled out a tiny handful of assorted candies, and dumped it into Maria's bag. Then she poured a tiny handful into Kevin's bag. And then she did the same with you. <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"You guys must've been getting a ton of treats.\"</span> That made you remember one harrowing fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpgreen\">\"Actually, we haven't,\"</span> Kevin confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"What?\"</span> the goat-wearer said. This time, her voice hurt. She sounded genuinely depressed at your situation, and hearing her sad made you feel worse. <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"How could little guys like you not be drowning in candy?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Yeah, the a lot of the neighborhood moved away, and the people that haven't don't usually give away a lot,\"</b> you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Oh, you poor things! I just wish I could do something...\"</span> she said. Then, she looked inquisitive, before snapping her fingers in a sudden moment of realization. <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"I just remembered I've got a ton of fresh candy deeper inside. Come along, I couldn't possibly carry it all by myself.\"</span> She stepped aside and tried to wave you guys in. She sounded very nice, and maybe the smell of candy was clouding your judgment, but going in seemed like a good idea. Then again, your parents have always told you to never go in a stranger's house. Then again, she didn't seem like she was up to any ill will.</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings. <b>\u201cAlright. Lead the way!\u201d</b> You say with a smile, gesturing to your friends to come with. Maria followed alongside you as the goat trotted deeper into her fancy house. Kevin didn\u2019t want to go inside, but he didn\u2019t want to be left alone outside either, so he quickly caved to peer pressure and followed along with the two of you. The interior of the modest house proved just how wealthy this neighborhood was; the halloween decorations were as silly as they were impressive, and they seemed to cover every square inch of the goat\u2019s home. You noticed a few odd things, though. There seemed to be quite a few pentagrams painted around the house, as well as depictions of baphomet among other odd shrines. They looked too well cared-for to be simple Halloween decorations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t help but notice her hips swaying as she walked, her rear end fully and shamelessly exposed to the three of you. It might not technically count as nudity, since it was probably just part of her costume\u2026 but still, it was oddly hypnotizing. This was the first time you\u2019ve even come close to seeing a woman\u2019s bare body, and it was quite an enchanting sight, especially with how unbelievably <i>curvy</i> the goat was. You noticed Kevin averting his eyes with a blush, self-conscious as ever, but you personally didn\u2019t seen any harm in staring. Maria, of course, seemed wholly apathetic to the nudity, more curious about the goat\u2019s \u2018costume\u2019 than anything else. It was an impressive costume, you had to admit. A convincing snout, moving eyes, the works. Facially, she looked much like a real goat, but much\u2026 prettier, somehow. You couldn\u2019t really put your finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually had you sit down on your comfy little couch, the room lit up by beautiful candles. <span class=\"cmaroon\"><b>\u201cJust wait here, cuties. I\u2019ll make this the tastiest Halloween you\u2019ve ever had!\u201d</b></span> She said with a big, cute smile, looking even more excited then you were. She rushes into a back room, and the three of you can hear her rustling through boxes and cupboards as you sit in silence. Eventually, Kevin works up the courage to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cWe should leave,\u201d</span> he says, wide-eyed. You and Maria stare him down, incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhy would we do that?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t even be here. She\u2019s a stranger!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWe should at least wait until we get our candy.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cWhat if she puts, like, razor blades in it or something?\u201d</span> He insists, and the two of you roll your eyes, annoyed by his constant cowardice. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cI\u2019m serious! Don\u2019t you see all the weird satanic stuff all over the house? She could be trying to sacrifice us!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s just a pagan,\u201d</b> you offer. Kevin didn\u2019t seem reassured, but before he could argue, the goat woman returned, her arms wrapped around a huge, pumpkin-shaped bucket of candy. It slammed into the ground as the goat woman dropped it onto the floor in front of Kevin, as the three of you stared at it in awe. Chocolate bars, bags of skittles and M&amp;Ms\u2026 there had to be at least five pounds of candy in there! Kevin\u2019s concerns were forgotten immediately as he accepted the bucket, almost trembling with barely-contained excitement. He didn\u2019t even bother to check for razor blades as he tore into his delicious Halloween treats. Smiling brightly at his reaction, the goat retreated into the back room once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked enchanted by the bucket, and seemed almost ready to grab some candy from him until the goat returned once again. She offered another, similarly sized bucket of candy to the girl, and before you knew it, you were watching both of your friends with envy as they chomped down on your sweets. You could hear the goat lady searching around the back room again, but she seemed to be taking longer than usual. Hopefully you\u2019d be getting your candy any second now. Eventually, she poked her head out the door, but this time she seemed downright worried. <span class=\"cmaroon\"><b>\u201cUh\u2026 pirate? Could you come back here, please?\u201d</b></span> You were a little reluctant, but you eventually agreed to head into the back room with her. Your friends were too busy chomping down on candy to even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back room seemed to be a regular pantry, with shelves lining the walls, lit up by a single light bulb. The goat woman closed the door behind you, you were just about to question her, when you realized she looked like she was on the verge of tears. <span class=\"cmaroon\"><b>\u201cI-I\u2019m\u2026 so, so sorry! Earlier, I got a little hungry, and\u2026 I ate, like, half my candy supply!\u201d</b></span> She said, apologizing to you desperately. <span class=\"cmaroon\"><b>\u201cI don\u2019t have enough candy left for you! I completely forgot!\u201d</b></span> You were a little disappointed, but it wasn\u2019t as huge a deal as she seemed to be treating it. Before you could reassure her, though, she continued. <span class=\"cmaroon\"><b>\u201cBut don\u2019t give up hope! You can still have the candy I ate! I swear it\u2019s probably still good!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so disoriented, you just accepted her offer without even thinking. <b>\u201cUh, sure.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed surprised and excited when you said \u2018yes\u2019. <span class=\"cmaroon\"><b>\u201cOh, thank you! I promise, you won\u2019t be disappointed again!\u201d</b></span> You were slightly startled when she grabbed you both shoulders\u2026 and you suddenly found yourself staring right into her gaping maw! For a costume, it looked so unbelievably realistic. Little drops of saliva even dripped down her chin, and you could feel her warm breath against your face. Her \u2018tongue\u2019 even seemed to move around of its own accord. You were so awed by her \u2018costume\u2019, you didn\u2019t even resist when your head was suddenly plunged inside the tall goat woman\u2019s mouth, and your cheek was suddenly resting on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, you don\u2019t even fight back as she grabs you by your sides and lifts you up in the air, preparing to swallow you down. Perhaps it was the same principle as why a kitten froze up when you held it by the scruff; you knew you\u2019d probably hurt both the goat and yourself if you tried to fight back, so you opted instead to just trust her. The gruesome reality of being eaten didn\u2019t even occur to you. To your addled, surprised mind, this made perfect sense; your candy was in her stomach, so obviously, she had to send you to her stomach so you could get to it. Thus, you were calm, at least, until your body was plunged into the tall, pudgy anthro\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your entire upper body was reduced to a bulge in her neck, you finally started to consider your situation. This was insane! First of all, you realized that there was no chance this was just a costume; your hostess was actually just a real, genuine goat/human hybrid. Worse still, you were halfway down her throat\u2026 and you knew what happened to food once it reached the stomach. Unfortunately, most of your body was already restrained, and your wriggling was so futile she didn\u2019t even notice that you were struggling. There was nothing you could do as the goat woman leaned her head back and let gravity slide you deeper down her throat with another gulp. Soon, she closed her mouth around your feet, which rested on her tongue. With another gulp, those, too, disappeared into the tight confines of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the consumption out of the way, you were finally dumped unceremoniously into the goat lady\u2019s big, round belly, which stretched even more to accommodate you. It was around 100 degrees in there, and the walls were covered in strange liquids, but it wasn\u2019t all that bad. You had some light in here, at least; just enough to see all the candy that surrounded you. Indeed, the goat already had about four bucket\u2019s worth of candy stewing in her gut already, and there was a sizeable puddle of melted chocolate at the bottom of her stomach. <span class=\"cmaroon\"><b>\u201cMm! There you go! Nice and settled, with all the sweets you can eat,</b></span>\u201d she smiles once you were settled in, as she rubbed over her sensitive, distended gut with satisfaction. It was a relief to know you could hear each other through the thick walls of her belly. <span class=\"cmaroon\"><b>\u201cHonestly, you were a tastier than the candy! So this is a pretty fair trade, I\u2019d say.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUmm\u2026 I don\u2019t really need any candy, on second thought,\u201d</b> you call, a little unnerved by the gurgling from all around you and the constant movement of her stomach\u2019s walls. <b>\u201cYou can just go ahead and let me out now!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\"><b>\u201cNonsense! There\u2019s no need to be polite for my sake! I\u2019m perfectly willing to let you stay in there for as long as you need,\u201d</b></span> she says. <span class=\"cmaroon\"><b>\u201cNow, go ahead! Try a bite! I\u2019ve been told my sweets are absolutely addicting!\u201d</b></span> You shrug, deciding it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try a kit-kat, at least. You could just pretend the candy was all spoiled or half-digested; surely, that would convince the goat to let you out. You tentatively take a bite, only to be stunned by the taste. This was\u2026 the most delicious chocolate you\u2019ve ever eaten! You finished the kit-kat in an instant, and without thinking, you grab another piece of candy, and then another, and then another. You understood the goat\u2019s binge, now; these were amazing! You had completely forgotten about your desire to escape, so preoccupied shoving candy down your throat like a maniac. You were in paradise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goat giggled, patting her gut as she noticed you were enjoying yourself within. Content she had made things up to you, she emerged back into the living room, nursing her now much larger gut; so huge it pushed up her apron. Your friends...</span></div></div>",

Plus, it\u2019s odd that she \u2018just remembered\u2019 she had a stockpile of candy. If she really did have that much candy, why was it not in her candy bowl by the door? But she did seem very sweet and nice so you decided to try to word your decline in a kind manner. You smiled up at the grinning, curvy goat, \u201c<b>Um, thank you so much miss.

Apparently, this event was running for all of October, but people who arrive on the night of halloween get in free. Your friends were nervous, but you didn\u2019t want to miss this potentially once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so you eagerly rush up to the front door and ring the bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, a woman who looked to be around 20 opened the door\u2026 but just like her neighbor, her costume made her look just some kind of anthropomorphic animal! She was also similar in height, at seven feet, and her \u2018outfit\u2019 was even equally skimpy, wearing only a black bra, panties and top hat to contrast her white fur. Unlike her neighbor, she seemed to be a canine of some sort. You wonder if this neighborhood was having a \u2018themed\u2019 halloween this year, for some reason. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cOoo! Welcome travellers, to the <i>Maniacal Manor of Misery</i>!\u201d</b></span> She announced, in a cheesy, \u2018spooky\u2019 voice as she stepped out to greet you. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cCan you survive the <i>twiiisted</i> halls, and the <i>spoooky</i> horrors hiding within?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhy does everyone around here wear animal costumes?\u201d</b> You ask, staring at her thick fur. She looked so realistic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201c... I do not know what you are referring to, travelleeer!\u201d</b></span> She said, trying to stay in character. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cI am simply here to guide you into the Maniacal Manor of Misery!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cIs there candy?\u201d</span> Maria asked, desperate to fill her bag with more sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cBrooownies are provided for freee at the end of the atraaaction!\u201d</b></span> The half-naked canine explained, in the same ghostly voice. <span class=\"cnavy\"><b>\u201cIf you can make it that far, that is\u2026 ahahaha!\u201d</b></span> She lets out a corny attempt at an evil laugh as she sets aside, gesturing for you to enter the darkened halls of the mansion. There seemed to be a fog machine hidden somewhere, as you could see the ground through the darkened fog as you stepped eagerly inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m not sure about this,\u201d Kevin whispered nervously as the three of you walked inside. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cI don\u2019t really like haunted houses\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat? This one is super cheesy. Are you seeing her acting?\u201d</b> You whisper with a chuckle. This wasn\u2019t a real haunted house, obviously; it was probably just something a bunch of bored college students set up. <b>\u201cBesides, I haven\u2019t had any brownies for as long as I can remember.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cI think it looks fun!\u201d</span> Maria says, lightly punching his shoulder with a laugh. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDon\u2019t be a scaredy-cat.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cOkay, okay\u2026 I guess\u2026\u201d</span> He said, agreeing to accompany you if only just to avoid looking cowardly in front of his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201c<i>Foools!</i> You know not what <i>great risks</i> you are taking here!\u201d</b></span> She says, in the same melodramatic voice, before she leans over and whispers for a moment, breaking character. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cRight this way. Watch your step. It\u2019s sort of dark in there.\u201d </b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThanks,\u201d</b> you say, walking through a curtain into the haunted house proper. <b>\u201cWish us luck!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\"><b>\u201cI am already writing your <i>obituuuaaaries</i>!\u201d</b></span> She said with a smile as you walked away, getting a laugh out of the three of you. The inside of the house seemed like a regular old victorian mansion, that has had the lights turned off and been redecorated. The only decorations were \u2018creepy\u2019 pumpkins, dancing skeletons, fake bats, and the like. \u201cPrepare to meet your dooooom!\u201d One of the fake skeletons \u2018shouted\u2019, startling Kevin slightly, while only eliciting a laugh from you and Maria. As you wandered through the various \u2018spooky\u2019 rooms of the manor, you start to feel at ease. This wasn\u2019t really scary; it was just sort of fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you travel deeper and deeper into the manor, though, things started to get scarier and scarier. The darkness only seemed to grow thicker, and hallways more confused. The jumpscares grew louder and more intense; the visuals became more disturbing, and soon, the three of your were covered in traces of fake blood, which smelled quite like ketchup. Kevin was freaking out at this point, and you and Maria were growing scared as well\u2026 but you definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to navigate your way out of here. Most of the jumpscares involved anthropomorphic animals, though you were always too shocked to tell if they were real or animatronic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, while wandering through the darkened halls, you realized you no longer could hear your friend\u2019s footsteps following behind you. You whimpered audibly when you realized they were suddenly gone! The three of you must have gotten separated somehow in the darkness. You take a moment to try and calm yourself down. It seems like you\u2019ve been stuck in this mansion forever; you were bound to find the way out, sooner or later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2504\u2504\u2504<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kevin was absolutely panicking at this point, having realized quickly that he was alone in the manor. He sprinted through the darkness, calling your names, but his voice just echoed through the halls, unheard. The hallways branched out in all sorts of confusing ways, and just when he thought he was making progress, he ended up right back where he started. He was quickly losing all hope for escape. To him, it seemed like the house simply didn\u2019t have an exit; he would be trapped here, forever and ever\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when he thought he was alone, he ran into one last jumpscare. This time, though, it definitely wasn\u2019t an animatronic -- it was one of the employees! To him, she appeared to be a college-age woman dressed as a creepy...</span></div></div>",

She had incredibly sharp teeth and a slithery tongue. Before he could react though, the dragon launched forward and grabbed him with her mouth. The dragon ignored his struggles and stood to her full height. With little effort, she slurped him up like a noodle and moaned. \u201c<span class=\"clred\">I said it would be painless, but I didn\u2019t say you were just going to walk away.</span> Her claws rubbed her full belly as Kevin made his landing into the pool.

Still, she pressed on until she came across a nice bedroom. She let herself have a moment to relax after being frightened before and laid down on the large bed. She\u2019s closed her eyes for a moment when suddenly, the door swung open. Maria sat up fast and saw\u2026</span></div></div>",

Even through the darkness, he could tell this wasn\u2019t some sort of animatronic; it was definitely a real person, leaping out at him from around a corner as a head-achingly loud scare chord played. This was obvious from the way she moved; instead of just sliding out out hiding, she seemed to maneuvering straight towards him. This knowledge was made even more disconcerting by the fact that her silhouette was 8 feet tall, almost twice his height. She was moderately \u2018curvaceous\u2019 too, you could say, her belly alone being almost as wide as he is tall. As she emerged into the light, Kevin realized the woman was dressed in a similar costume as the others in the neighborhood, but this one seemed to be a cow of some sort. This one wasn\u2019t wearing any clothes at all over their costume, revealing her costume to not only be unbelievably realistic, but also quite\u2026 <i>anatomically correct</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like that\u2019s what he was focussing on at the moment. He was a bit more preoccupied by the huge cow lady\u2019s jaws hanging hungrily open, giving the boy a clear view into the darkness of her cavernous throat. He had no time to react. All he could do was try to make sense of what he was seeing. Her \u2018fur\u2019 and snout were already seemingly impossibly realistic enough, but her mouth was really pushing the limit. There was no way it could just be a part of the mask -- her maw just looked too real, slid open too fluidly. Even in that instant, he could feel her warm, smelly breath blast his face, and feel the saliva glancing off her teeth. As she grew closer, she only looked more and more real -- even her long, flat pink tongue was hanging out the corner of her mouth, in anticipation for her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before darkness swallowed him, his mind reached one final, terrifying realization -- <i>she wasn\u2019t wearing a costume</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, the single instant in which the cow leaped out at the boy felt like it lasted forever. Soon enough, though, the adrenaline rush faded away, as he was left to deal with the reality of his situation. The mouth that closed around his head was definitely real, for starters, as indicated by the saliva wetting his hair. The rest of the cow\u2019s body was real, too, particularly her unbelievably hefty bust. Considering these faces, odds are, her stomach\u2019s not fake either\u2026 and judging from the way she\u2019s holding him, that seems to be where she\u2019s planning on sending the boy. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cAaahhh!\u201d</span> Kevin finally let out a scream, just a moment too late -- now, his voice was simply muffled by the cow woman\u2019s mouth. Her amazonian height lent her incredible strength, and she was able to easily restrain the boy against her pudgy body as she repositioned him to better slurp him up like a noodle. The process was terrifyingly fast; this obviously wasn\u2019t her first rodeo. She knew he would confused and disoriented at first as he tried to figure out what was going on, so she used this time to immediately fit his wide shoulders into her throat. Those were the widest part of every human\u2019s body, so once they were in, the rest of her halloween treat would be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until he was already a quarter way into her throat that Kevin\u2019s addled mind pieced together what was happening enough to start fighting back, kicking and wriggling with all his might. He was actually making some progress, for a moment, before the cow noticed and restrained him even more tightly. For such a pudgy young woman, she definitely had some serious muscle. Kevin knew he was running out of time; the more he disappeared down the bovine\u2019s throat, the easier it became for her to gulp him down faster, and the harder it became for him to resist. At this point, though, he feared it may already be too late; his arms were already pressed against his side by the tight, disgusting tunnel of the cow\u2019s throat, and her grasp on his legs meant he couldn\u2019t even throw any kicks. He was basically immobilized completely as his upper body was buried in her throat; all he could do was wriggle around, and try to position himself in such a way that she couldn\u2019t swallow him any deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few seconds, the cow woman seemed to struggle to gulp him down any further, and Kevin finally had a flicker of hope, believing he had successfully delayed his descent. If he can just keep this up, eventually the cow will choke and be forced to spit him out, right? Unfortunately for him, in reality, the cow was simply pausing to savor his flavor. She only gets a treat like this once a year, so she wanted to make it last. Still, a gurgle from her hungry gut reminds her of the task at hand. She\u2019s been subsisting on a liquid diet for a week to fully empty her stomach and bowels in preparation for her upcoming feast, and now, her belly was begging to finally be filled. With a snort, she decided it was time to get this over with. She leaned her head back, letting Kevin\u2019s kicking legs hang in the air, until, with the assistance of gravity, she took another grand gulp, sliding her prey deeper at a terrifying speed. In an instant, the only part of him that remained in the cow\u2019s maw was his feet, uselessly wriggling against the back of her mouth. She closed her mouth with a giggle, licking her lips as she sealed her prey\u2019s entire body in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart skipped a beat as his upper body was suddenly dropped into the cow\u2019s stomach proper. Eventually, the cow swallowed down his feet as well, leaving nothing to prevent him from slipping entirely into her waiting gut. The walls of the sac stretched easily, giving him the illusion of wriggle room at; but whenever he wasn\u2019t manually forcing them to bulge out, the walls would contract back into place around him, curling him up into a ball. It was of course around body temperature inside her, around a sweltering 99 degrees, and it felt like he was stuck in a wet, fleshy sauna. Seemingly excited by the huge meal, her guts began churning and gurgling loudly as they prepared to process him, and he noticed a small puddle of strange liquids pooling beneath him. His screams were muffled completely by the thick, fleshy walls, as any sign of him was completely lost to the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the young bovine woman was giggling and squirming in delight at the sensation of such a large, lively meal. She was a little worried about her friends \u2018haunted house\u2019 plan\u2026 if they didn\u2019t get any visitors, she might end up wasting her halloween! It all worked out in the end, though, it seems. The pudgy, college-age bovine sat, naked as they day she was born, on a nearby chair, rubbing all over her rounded, distended belly with satisfaction. The feeling of such lively prey inside your stomach is half the fun of halloween, after all. Eventually though, she got over the initial buzz, and excitedly took out her phone, to post an image for all her followers of her big, round, perfect furry gut stretching out of the front of her chubby, naked body, along with the caption;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>Just got a tasty treat delivered straight to my door! \ud83d\udc45\ud83c\udf6c\ud83e\udd30 Will keep U updated on digestion!

Maria, for instance, was currently mapping out the mansion in her head, trying to figure out its secrets. The geometry just didn\u2019t make any sense; the twisting halls of the \u2018maniacal manor\u2019 seemed downright non-euclidean. She could walk in a perfectly straight line, and end up right back where she started! Of course, it couldn\u2019t be magic or anything; she deduced that there had to be some sort of illusion at play here. All of the light-hearted fun of the haunted house had faded away, as she set to diligently searching for whatever secrets might be hidden in the darkness. She tried to be especially cognizant of secret passageways or subtle changes in slope which might explain some of the inconsistencies she\u2019s noticed, but so far she\u2019s had no luck in figuring out the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few things further frustrated her investigation. No matter how many times she wandered through an area, new jumpscares seemed to appear each time, a fact which further confused her. It was like the entire manor was changing all around her as she searched. Eventually, she collapsed into one of the old, dusty victorian chairs, chomping down on some of the candy in her bag to calm her nerves. This cheap suburban haunted house proved to be much more complex than she imagined. Once they noticed she had given up, certainly the staff of this place would give her a clue or something, right? She certainly didn\u2019t want to waste the rest of her halloween here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, while relaxing on the chair, Maria felt someone behind her tap her shoulder. She looked over her shoulder excitedly, thinking it was one of her friends, or perhaps a staff member here to aid her. Instead, though, there was only an unbelievably tall man looming over the chair, who seemed to be dressed as some sort of...</span></div></div>",

She only realized what she was looking at when the bear leaned forward, revealing his smirking face. By this point, it was already too late to flee; she already felt two huge paws grab her by the sides, lifting her up out of her chair with terrifying ease. She yelped at the sudden ascent, until she was hugging against the bear\u2019s soft, pillowy belly. She felt a bit of drool drip down onto her cheek as the bear audibly licked his lips, signifying that he was, of course, not actually just a costumed millionaire, but an actual natural-born predator. She should be surprised by this, but really, once she had felt the bear\u2019s immense paws, there wasn\u2019t a doubt in her mind that she had somehow run into a real, anthropomorphic bear. She\u2019d have time to go over hows and whys later -- right now, all she could focus on was her primitive fight-or-flight instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear simply chuckled as she began to fight back in earnest, her kicks bouncing off his belly like a drum and her hands unable to pry the bear\u2019s claws away. Still, he was impressed by how calm and calculated she was in her attempts. She was smart; if given enough time, should could\u2019ve definitely come up with an escape plan, but the bear provided her no such luxury. Being herbivorous, the taste of meat had been a special treat for the cow -- but being a carnivore himself, the bear was bored by the taste of meat, and more interested in the delightful squirminess of live prey. She\u2019d go down much faster than her friend had; indeed, Maria could already feel the warm breath of the ursine atop her head as he parted his jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear took a deep breath, and with a single, mighty shove, his wide, muscular throat easily accepting her head and shoulders. All of her escape plans were immediately forgotten as panic and shock overtook her reasoning, and she began to kick and punch wildly at the air, with no rhyme or reason. This, of course, failed to aid her situation; and with another mighty gulp, she was up to her elbows in the tight, wet confines. As the bear paused, seemingly amused by her struggles, Maria tried to calm herself, trying to come up with another plan while she still could. She tried to brace her arms against the sides of the bear\u2019s mouth, blockading her descent into the anthro\u2019s belly. This actually worked for a while\u2026 until, of course, the bear got frustrated and simply moved her arms out of the way with sheer overwhelming strength. As her arms were pressed against her sides, restraining her upper body completely, Maria realized it was far too late to escape now. Maybe an opportunity would present itself when she reached the stomach, but as far as her current circumstances\u2026 she was out of luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the bear\u2019s surprise, Maria decided to go gracefully, relaxing and letting her legs be slurped up like a noodle by the hungry carnivore. She was too disoriented and dizzy at this point to come up with any coherent plan anyway. Seeing her amusing struggles had ended, it only took a few seconds more for the bear to finish off his meal completely. Being a carnivore, the bear\u2019s stomach was even more miserable than the cow\u2019s; not that she\u2019d have such a basis for comparison. It was hotter, tighter, and more worryingly, she was already up to her chest in the caustic liquids. Maria whimpered, trying her best to keep her head above the liquid, even as the bear shaked and jostled her prison for his own amusement. As she settled in, though, she realized something even her observant mind hadn\u2019t noticed before. There was already another trick-or-treater in here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to be dressed as a vampire or something, although her costume was completely ruined by this point. Compared to the confused and wide-eyed new arrival, the other trick-or-treater looked cynical and defeated in comparison. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cH-how long have you been in here!?\u201d</span> Maria managed to yell over the surprisingly loud gurgling and churning of the bear\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201c\u042f \u043d\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044e \u043f\u043e \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438,\u201d</span> The girl replied, speaking in a panicked tone in an indecipherable language while Maria sat there, uncomprehending. The other girl definitely didn\u2019t look, nor sound, like she came from remotely nearby. Could it be that\u2026 she isn\u2019t? Maria\u2019s heart sunk as she finally put two and two together, and realized the true nature of this place. She had heard rumors -- impossible rumors, she thought -- that Vampyre Lane wasn\u2019t actually a physical place, but another realm overlapping reality. A realm only accessible on Halloween night, and only to those with a sufficient desire to find it. Indeed, this entire neighborhood was a spider\u2019s web -- designed to lure naive humans into the jaws of these monsters. The second she walked inside, she was already doomed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the bear let out an unbelievably loud, nasty belch as yet another satisfying meal settled inside his now bulging belly. He turned, sitting his completely nude, pudgy body down on the same dusty chair Maria had been relaxing in, the wood cracking beneath his weight. He licked his lips as he rubbed his paws over his gut, feeling the movement of two whole humans within. While most anthros would be more than satisfied with this arrangement, the gluttonous bear\u2019s Halloween fun was still far from over. Even now, he still had room for one or two more trick-or-treaters before he was completely stuffed. It would probably be terrible for his health, of course\u2026 but doesn\u2019t he deserve to splurge, every once in awhile? After all, everyone needs a treat on Halloween\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2504\u2504\u2504</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven while all this was occurring, you were completely unaware of everything that had happened to your friends, so wrapped up were you in the maniacal mansion\u2019s elaborate puzzle. For a while, you had been on the verge of giving up, believing the machinations of the manor to be complete nonsense\u2026 eventually, though, you started to see the purpose behind every nook and cranny, every out-of-place book and uncalibrated grandfather clock. You were fortunately always fascinated by riddles and such, and thus, you were the first one to have the diligence to see the manor\u2019s puzzle through to the end, even as an untold amount of time passed. Eventually, you had figured everything out and put it all in its proper place, and right before your eyes, one last secret passageway opened up in the wall of the main chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped curiously through, raising a hand as your eyes adjusted to the sudden onslaught of light, only to find yourself in a much more homely little room. The \u2018canine\u2019 gal from before was standing on the other end, and you averted your eyes with a blush when you realized all of her outer clothing was gone, and only her weird animal costume remained. You couldn\u2019t tell if she was simply wearing body paint or what, but even nude, her costume was\u2026 disturbingly detailed. She giggled at your innocence, as she slowly draws closer. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cCongratulations. You finished our little puzzle,\u201d</b></span> she said in a genuinely creepy voice now, all her previous light-heartedness completely disappeared. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cHonestly, I thought nobody would be able to manage it this year.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to back up from the canine, only to run into a strange, pillowy, furry surface. You turned around, letting out a startled little squeal as you saw the cow lady towering over you, her belly uncannily rounded. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cIt\u2019s almost a shame, sugar. You looked tasty\u2026\u201d</b></span> The cow said, crossing her arms with a smile. You could hardly believe your eyes as you saw hand prints bulging out against the sides of the cow\u2019s belly. That couldn\u2019t possibly be part of the costume. Could it be\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou backed away from the cow, too, only to once again run into another anthro\u2019s distended belly. This time, you turned to see a massive bear, smiling at you with a disturbingly toothy grin, showing off his fangs. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cYour friends certainly were\u2026\u201d</b></span> He taunted, rubbing a hand over his huge stomach. For a moment, you could clearly see Maria\u2019s face imprint against the side, and it felt like your heart had stopped in your chest. You became light-headed as the simple truth of the situation flooded you; these monsters were real, and they have devoured your friends. And, judging by the look on the canine's face, you were next on the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cW-why them?\u201d</b> was all you could ask, tears forming as the three massive anthros circled you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cBecause they gave up. You persevered. You found a way to the final chamber of the mansion,\u201d</b></span> the canine smirked, just a few feet away from you now. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cBut now\u2026 you have to find the way out. And I\u2019ll be right behind you every step of the way...\u201d</b></span> Suddenly, she leaped forward, trying to pounce on top of you! You dodged her attack by inches, your flight-or-flight instincts sending you sprinting away wildly, with no knowledge of where you were going. The bear and cow simply stood there, laughing as they watched the canine chase you through the darkened hallways of the manor on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had figured out the first half of your trial, but the true test of survival had only just begun...</span></div></div>",

You were busy running for your life through the halls of the manor, your heart beating out of your chest as the canine woman chased you on all fours like some kind of savage predator. Your only saving grace was that the canine was so large and moved so quickly, the sheer inertia alone made it difficult for her to take corners. Still, she wised up to this quickly, and began gaining on you at a terrifying rate. <b>\u201cS-stay away from me!\u201d</b> You yelled, pushing down a huge cabinet to block the bath behind you as you ran, which ultimately failed to slow the canine down for even an instant, as she hopped right over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cWhere are you going? You don\u2019t even know the way out of here!\u201d</b></span> She called after you, her tongue hanging out the side of her mouth as she chased you, as if this was just some sort of game. You shuddered, realizing she was right. You were so preoccupied finding your way deeper into the manor, you had never bothered to find the way out. You had no idea how you would figure out that puzzle with the canine hot on your tail. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cJust give up now, like your friends!

The canine would be entering in just a few seconds, and yet you simply couldn\u2019t muster the energy to flee. You needed to find a place to hide, a place where you can recoup your energy\u2026 but where? The anthro woman could probably see just fine in the dark, and knew this manor like the back of her hand. You would have to think outside the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hide behind one of the fake bookcases in the main hall. It was sort of an obvious hiding spot, but if you act fast and cover your tracks, she might just rush by, thinking you were still fleeing, It was such a concealed little alcove, she definitely wouldn\u2019t notice you there if she wasn\u2019t directly searching for you. Then again, you could also return to the deepest chamber of the house. She would never think to look for you there, although it had its own risks; mainly the fact that the cow and the bear were probably still there. Then again, they seemed reluctant to interfere, for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only had less than a second to decide. Where would you end up hiding?</span></div></div>",

You slipped through the secret entrance you had previously uncovered, and closed it silently behind you, moments before the canine ran hurriedly by. You tensed up, hearing her rush down the hallway, until breathing a sigh of relief when she was finally out of earshot. You silently pulled the door open again, peeking into the hallway, holding your breath as you check to see if she was really gone. Just as the tension was at its highest, you yelped in fright as you felt a hand grab your shoulder from behind. <b>\u201cAaahhh!\u201d</b> You reacted, whipping around, only to see the bear towering over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cWhoa!

They may be your literal key out of this terrible place\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cYou want \u2018em, right?\u201d</b></span> The bear said, wrapping an arm around your shoulder. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cThen let's have a seat.\u201d</b></span> You didn\u2019t want to do as he said, but with his sheer natural strength, you were powerless to disobey. Soon, you were made to join the two nude anthros on the couch, squished up between them as they lounged around. They were about 8 feet tall each, and quite chubby, leaving you very little space on the couch \u2014 making matters worse, you were about belly-level, and their bellies were churning and gurgling incredibly loudly as they worked on the people within. You shuddered, trying to focus on your objective; the key. She seemed to have it absent-mindedly clutched in her other hand while she types away at her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cS-so\u2026 w-what are you up to?\u201d</b> You said, gesturing to her phone, trying to figure out how you were going to get the keys from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOh, I\u2019m just keeping my fans updated! They love seeing pics of my belly when it\u2019s all big and round,\u201d</b></span> she smiles, giggling as she jiggles her gut up and down with a hand. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cEspecially when it\u2019s filled with such a lively, squirmy meal!\u201d</b></span> You\u2019ve deduced that Kevin is in the cow\u2019s belly, and Maria is in the bear\u2019s; meaning that Kevin probably has much more time before it\u2019s too late to save him, as morbid as that thought was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cDo you think you might\u2026\u201d</b> You ask, knowing you had to come up with some way to free your friends. <b>\u201cLet him out afterwards?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cHeavens, no! And give up such a delightful treat?\u201d</b></span> she waves a hand dismissively, as if the very notion was ridiculous. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cNope, your friend here\u2019s just going to be churned up into another year\u2019s supply of delicious milk! Maybe a little fat, too \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t mind!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cBut that\u2019s\u2026\u201d</b> You said, tears forming in your eyes. <b>\u201cYou <i>can\u2019t</i> j-just\u2026 <i>do</i> that to somebody.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cOh, c\u2019mon. It\u2019s all in good fun!\u201d</b></span> The bear laughed, jokingly punching you lightly in the shoulder, startling you. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cThey were warned there were risks when they walked in here. That\u2019s what makes our haunted house so thrilling; the danger is <i>real!</i>\u201d</b></span> The cow smiled and nodded in agreement, while you just looked at him, horrified at his logic. He frowned, seeing you still weren\u2019t satisfied. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cHey. This is our only chance all year for snacks like this, and your friends fit the bill. How would it benefit us to let them out?\u201d</b></span> You stared at the ground sadly, unable to answer his question. Seeing you were defeated, he raised the key up in front of your face, letting you grab it with a hand.  <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cLook. Our friend\u2019s still out there, searching for you. She\u2019ll probably be here any minute now. I advise you focus on saving yourself, pal.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clutch at the key. It was your ticket out of here, and yet\u2026 could you really justify just leaving your friends behind? You couldn\u2019t abandon them, but\u2026 if you stayed, you\u2019d probably just be devoured as well. How would that help anything? Once again, you needed to make a choice quickly\u2026 and this was probably the hardest choice of all...</span></div></div>",

All you knew for certain is that staying here and suffering the same fate\u2026 just wasn\u2019t an option. You needed to find a way out of this nightmarish mansion. Maybe, once you\u2019re free, you\u2019ll be able to call the police ro something to come help your friends. Hardly able to see through your tears, you finally swing work up the willpower to turn, swing the door open, and go stomping out of the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you had the key, the manor suddenly looked completely different. It didn\u2019t feel like you were lost in some endless maze of hallways anymore. It was as if it had returned back to being\u2026 just a normal house. You could see the front door just on the other hand of a hallway, and with no clue of where your pursuer was, you make a break for it. This almost proved a fatal mistake; you only barely managed to duck under the canines claws as she leaped at you from the darkness of the hallway. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cNot so fast!\u201d</b></span> She taunted as you fell to the ground in shock, trying to crawl desperately away from the canine woman. She seemed to be rearing up to pounce once again, and it seemed like it\u2019d be too late to flee out of the way of this one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she leaped for you, your hand happened to land on a broken, wooden handrail bar\u2026 and without a second thought, you swing it at her with all of your might. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cAugh!\u201d</b></span> She yowled as she stumbled back, covering her bloodied snout. While she was distracted, you slid past her, sprinting down the hallway once again. \u201cHey! Get back here!\u201d Slowed by her injury but ever more eager to capture you, she chases dizzily after you down the hall, to the point that you can feel her just a few inches behind you as you approach the door. Just a few more steps, and you\u2019d be home free\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canine leaped forward in a last-ditch effort when you made it to the door, ending up wrapping her arms around you and sending you both plummeting right through the front door! Bits of wood and glass splintered all around you as the door was blown off its hinges by the force of the canine\u2019s pounce, as the two of you finally land on the cold sidewalk outside. Fortunately, the canine broke you fall\u2026 but unfortunately, you were still wrapped tightly in her arms, unable to squirm free! However, to your surprise, instead of just devouring you right there, she started to laugh. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cHehehehe!\u201d</b></span> She giggled, hugging you gently closer, as if this had all been just a big game. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201c<i>Oh</i>\u2026 that was fun! You really gave me a run for my money, there!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimpered as the huge canine lady stood up, cradling you in her arms. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cWell, you were the first one to make it through the Maniacal Manor. So\u2026 congrats!\u201d</b></span> She smiled, holding you against her nude form as she carried you back towards the house. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cI think you deserve a special prize; every single treat we have, on the house!\u201d</b></span> You squealed and squirmed  when you realized she was taking you back inside, desperate not to have to return to that terrible manor\u2026 only to realize that the interior of the mansion now looked completely normal. There were a few halloween decorations all over the place, sure, but the house was actually quite well-lit and homely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. That whole maze you saw was all in your head! We got ol\u2019 Serafine to cast some illusionary spells on the house for us, making it seem spooky and haunted to newcomers. Clever, right?\u201d</b></span> She said, setting you down on the carpeted floor. You looked around like a deer in headlights, and the canine just gestured to the living room, where the bear and cow were sitting on that very same couch, watching TV. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cWe\u2019ve actually got a pretty nice place here. Go on, make yourself at home.\u201d</b></span> The canine walked down the hall into the kitchen, clutching her bloodied snout. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cI\u2019ll go clean up. Then, you can have your prize!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there for a while, trying to comprehend what you were hearing. Once you had escaped the haunted house, the canine\u2019s entire demeanor had changed. Had she just been\u2026 acting? You were tempted to just leave while she wasn\u2019t looking \u2014 the door had been ripped off its hinges, after all, so it wasn\u2019t like they locked you in \u2014 but on the other hand, this might be an opportune moment to save your friends. <b>\u201cH-hello?\u201d</b> You said, cautiously approaching the two nude anthros on the couch, readying yourself to flee at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOh, hey! Congrats on making it through the maze! I was rooting for ya!\u201d</b></span> The cow smiled at you, looking up from her phone momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cYeah, really impressive. I didn\u2019t think anyone would make it, honestly,\u201d</b></span> the bear nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cY-yeah\u2026 thanks,\u201d</b> you said, rubbing your arm. <b>\u201cSo\u2026 if all that was just for fun\u2026 do you think y-you could let my friends out now?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cWe already went over this. The house was fake, but the danger was real,\u201d</b></span> the bear sighed. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cBesides, fair\u2019s fair. You get a snack \u2018cause you won, <i>we</i> get a snack \u2018cause they <i>lost</i>.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cT-then I\u2019ll call someone!

Don\u2019t you understand that much, yet? This neighborhood\u2019s not a physical place,\u201d</b></span> the bear grimaced. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cIt only even overlaps with your world once a year. Come midnight, it\u2019ll disappear again.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cDisappear?\u201d</b> You say. <b>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019ll find yourself right back wherever you started, like you were never even here,\u201d</b></span> the bear replies. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cThat is, if you\u2019re not already trapped inside somebody\u2019s gut by then.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the ground, overcome with the revelations. <b>\u201cSo\u2026 there\u2019s nothing I can do?\u201d</b> You say, a few tears falling down and soaking into the carpet before you even noticed you were crying again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear paused, not wanting to see you cry. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cAlright, listen. I\u2019ll make you a deal,\u201d</b></span> he said, finally willing to throw you a bone. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cIf you can find some people to replace them, and lure them into the manor, we\u2019ll let your friends out. How\u2019s that?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered it. Could you really doom somebody to suffer such a fate? Then, you realize\u2026 the bullies! Gary and Ron! They might\u2019ve followed you to Vampyre Lane! If you could find them, they\u2019d make the perfect replacements for your friends! You perk up, full of hope once again. There was a chance you might be able to save your friends after all! <b>\u201cY-yes! Thank you so much!\u201d</b> You agree, almost crying tears of joy at the simple compromise. <b>\u201cI-I\u2019ll get right on it!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201c... <i>after</i> you enjoy your prize!\u201d</b></span> The tall canine said as she emerged into the room, carrying a huge box full of all the candy you could imagine. She dropped it curtly on the ground in front of you, and you stared at your prize in awe. Of course, you couldn\u2019t, in all good conscious, waste time on this\u2026 but judging by the expectant look on the canine\u2019s face, she\u2019d be upset if you didn\u2019t eat anything. Surely, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try a few...</span></div></div>",

Before you could slip out, the wolf suddenly sits down over you, pushing your head into his slick tail hole. His tail hole seems to be slick with lube or something as the wolf starts to pant. He then reaches down and starts to jerk himself off as he pushes back further onto you. You grunt at this and attempt to push him off. You couldn't manage to push the big lupine off as he was about 3 or 4 times your size and he was probably as strong as 2 or 3 men! He struggled to push your shoulders in at first, but he gets up for a bit to give you a bit of fresh air...before he sits back down fully and pushes your shoulders into him, causing him to let out a deep moan as he keeps jerking himself. Eventually, he would sit down until just your legs are sticking out, which he reaches down and pushes in hard, causing him to let out a loud howl as he sprays the room, along with himself, in lupine cum. He would stay in his seat and pant for a bit after shoving in his butt meal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he felt some grumbles and lets out a deep fart that vibrates the chair, panting as he feels the human female squirming inside of him.

Just wandering near the party, your nose was filled with the delicious smells of freshly-baked sweets of all kinds. Apparently, this was <i>the</i> place to go if you were interested in treats. The Halloween decorations strung from tree to tree in the park were beautiful, too, and similarly appropriate songs were being played over the speakers. The only thing that was disconcerting was that the locals here, too, all seemed to be dressed in those weird, super-humanly tall animal costumes. You were starting to question their mental health, at this point... but their cooking was delicious, so you couldn't explain. You and your friends stopped by the park just to chow down on some of the free deserts on offer. As you chowed down on some Halloween-themed cupcakes baked by a friendly 'squirrel' lady, you use the free time to plan out your next move.

There was just such a well-made, fun \u2018spooky\u2019 atmosphere in the park that you just wanted to soak in it for a while\u2026 and it seemed your friends agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to converse with some of the other trick-or-treats wandering around the park, but most of them spoke other languages completely. Strange -- you had never really met anyone in the area who couldn\u2019t speak English, but this one little park alone had dozens of them. Besides that, all of the trick-or-treaters looked and dressed like they were from all over the globe, rather than just this general area. It was just another aspect of Vampyre Lane you were confused by\u2026 but the language barrier didn\u2019t stop you from hanging out with the other guests. After tossing around a football with some for a while, you deduced that the stage was the aspect of the park that the visitors were most excited about. <b>\u201cHey, we should check out what\u2019s going on over there,\u201d</b> you point towards the stage, hearing a beautiful song being sung there, even from all the way on the other side of the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cAlright, coming,\u201d</span> Maria said, finishing the last of her cupcake as she stepped forward.

He was always pretty neurotic, but you hoped he didn\u2019t end up ruining Halloween for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed as fast as you could, but to your disappointment, by the time you reached the stage, the performance was already over. A beautiful blue-furred feline was walking proudly offstage, the audience clearly lovestruck by her singing. You, on the other hand, had missed the whole thing. You snort in frustration, planting yourself in one of the empty seats, in the hopes that you could at least catch the next performer. Your friends sat on either side of you, and the three of you munched on sweets and discussed your plans while you waited for something interesting to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, just as you were about to give up, the lights shining down on the stage dimmed and/or changed colors, signifying another of the \u2018anthros\u2019 was about to debut onstage. You perk up in anticipation, waiting to see one of the locals walk up the stage\u2019s stairs\u2026 instead, though, to your surprise, a dazzling cloud of light and fog burst onstage, slowly clearing to reveal the next performer standing before the crowd. She seemed to be dressed as a bat of some sort, with silk like purple fur complementing her long, orange robe. Though it took the liberty of showing off as much of her cleavage as possible, the robe still lent the voluptuous bat the most modesty of any of the anthros you\u2019d seen so far, so that was a plus. Completing her witch outfit was a big orange hat and a mystical-looking wooden staff, which she waved around whenever she wanted to perform feats of \u2018magic\u2019. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWelcome, visitors, to Serafine\u2019s Study of the Uncanny!\u201d</b></span> She greeted the audience in a loud, booming voice, as she took a bow. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cI don\u2019t get to perform for humans very often, so this is quite exciting!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans?

If you didn't see or feel the fabric, you'd swear she was wearing nothing. <b><span class=\"cviolet\">\"How many magic shows have you been too, precious?\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"None!\"</b> you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cviolet\">\"None?!

Though, I must warn you, when I perform, all other shows will pale in comparison.\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Whatever, bring on the show!\"</b> you answered. The crowd cheered, and Serafine's grin grew. She snapped her fingers, and you heard a oft \"POMF\" behind you. You looked behind you, and saw a cloud of smoke, slowly dissipating.

It appeared to be simply designed to hide something away from the audience. It's only odd feature was the golden symbol embedded into the fabric; a fork and knife over a plate. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYou lucky devils all get to see my special Halloween show! I only get to do these sorts of tricks once a year!\u201d</b></span> She announces, trying to hype up the crowd as you inspect the new feature on the stage. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cIn keeping with the theme, I can take care of the tricks, and my adorable volunteer here can be the treat!\u201d</b></span> She said, bending over slightly to pinch you on the cheek. Her cleavage hovering inches away from your face isn\u2019t enough to distract you from what she just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrdinarily, you\u2019d figure she was using the word \u2018treat\u2019 to mean, like, a pleasant surprise or something. However, the odd emblems on the curtains gave you some other ideas. <b>\u201c... uh\u2026 like a literal treat, or\u2026?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cShhh\u2026\u201d</b></span> She put a finger to your lips for a moment, before turning to the crowd once again. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cThese curtains aren\u2019t connected in any way! As you can tell, this stage has no trap doors, no secret mechanisms, no tricks! In fact, why don\u2019t I give you all a peek behind the curtain, as it were?\u201d</b></span> She pushes the curtains aside for a moment, giving the audience a good look of what was behind them, before moving them back to their proper places. Adjusting her robe, she continued. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cMy treat shall take his place behind this curtain, and I shall perform an incantation! What happens next can only be explained by the supernatural!\u201d</b></span> You didn\u2019t like being called a \u2018treat\u2019, but not wanting to embarrass yourself in front of everyone, you follow her instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you behind the big, fancy red curtain. You were a little panicked; she hadn\u2019t told you if you were supposed to be doing anything, or even what the \u2018trick\u2019 was going to be. Seeing you were nervous, she gave you a smile and a wink, as if to say, <i>\u2018don't worry, I\u2019ll handle this\u2019</i>. Weirdly, that actually managed to calm you down slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were well-hidden from the ground, the bat took her place, adjusted her robe, and raised her large staff. <span class=\"cviolet\"><i><b>\u201cSoth dolibix hakon!\u201d</b></i></span> She chanted, in a big, booming voice that echoed throughout the entire part. She waved her staff around rhythmically, her eyes clenched shut in concentration. Fog began to run across the floor of the stage, with no discernable source. You were starting to grow nervous. <span class=\"cviolet\"><i><b>\u201cSuh utzilah korilath!\u201d</b></i></span> You, and only you, could start to feel a faint rumbling in the distance, as if there was some sort of earthquake. The audience was giggling at the theatrics, but you were frozen with fear. You were starting to believe the bat woman actually had some sort of power. As she chanted, everything began to grow dark, and you felt like there was some kind of energy building up inside you. <span class=\"cviolet\"><i><b>\u201cVimi tagopar vigis!\u201d</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer incantation finally reached its crescendo. With one big, dramatic wave of her staff, there was a burst of smoke from behind the curtain, as well as the faint sound of confetti. The audience sat there in silence, curious to see what had happened to the volunteer. The bat was notably exhausted by the spell, but kept the show going undeterred. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cOh dear! It seems my volunteer has decided to just disappear on me!\u201d</b></span> She feigns surprise for comedic effect as she approached the curtain. She pushes the entire curtain over onto its side, to reveal that sure enough, you were gone! There was nowhere you could\u2019ve disappeared to during the performance. You had just disappeared from existence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience giggled at the reveal, trying to figure out what the \u2018trick\u2019 was. Even Kevin and Maria were entertained by the performance, certain that you were fine somehow. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHow rude of him! Doesn\u2019t he know everybody deserves a Halloween treat?\u201d</b></span> Serafine turned back to the crowd, gesturing with an arm expressively, pretending to be offended for comedic effect. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cLooks like I better go find him, then!\u201d</b></span> She lays one of her paws on edge of a foot of the overturned curtain, pulling it back up with her weight alone. With that, she ducked down and tiptoed behind the curtain, disappearing from sight as well for only an instant. The setup had gone well, but the punchline was yet to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she emerged seamlessly out from behind the curtain, there was suddenly something obviously different about her. There was a big bulge in her robe now, as if she was somehow sneaking a large beach ball beneath her robe. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cAh! Well, there he is!\u201d</b></span> She said, lifting up her robe (she was wearing strange black lingerie beneath, of course, although that\u2019s better than nothing) to reveal that her once skinny, furry belly had now expanded to the size of\u2026 well, you! At first, she simply looked full, but as she showed off her stomach to the crowd, the audience could easily see the bulges and outlines coming from within, confirming that you were, somehow, stuck in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cSo that\u2019s where you went, you little rascal! Wanted to curl up in ol\u2019 Serafine\u2019s belly that bad, huh? Couldn\u2019t even wait til the end of the show,\u201d</b></span> she teased you for the entertainment of the crowd, rubbing and jiggling her distended gut. The audience laughed and cheered upon seeing your fate, but your friends were silent, their faces flush. That couldn\u2019t be\u2026 real, could it? Nobody else was freaking out about it, so it couldn\u2019t be real. This had to be some sort of illusion. While Maria and Kevin stayed in their seats, they were less interested in the show now, and more wanting to see if you were okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, you definitely wouldn\u2019t call yourself \u2018okay\u2019. It was disorienting to simply fade from existence for a moment, but it was even moreso to come back and find yourself curled up in someone\u2019s stomach. You couldn\u2019t even tell where you were, at first\u2026 but with the constant sound of the bat\u2019s heartbeat just above you, as well as the churning and gurgling of her gut, it didn\u2019t take long for you to put two and two together. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t as bad in there as it could be. There was quite a bit of light and air in there, somehow, and there didn\u2019t seem to be an acid or anything. Only problem was that it was <i>tight</i>. You were forced into the fetal position by the cramped confines, and every single time you tried to stretch out and get some wriggle room, you only succeeded in making more visible bulges in the bat\u2019s gut, for the audience\u2019s amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWell, that\u2019s okay! I\u2019ve got some magic tricks you can take part in from right where you are!\u201d</b></span> You could hear the bat\u2019s voice clearly, perhaps even better than before, though it didn\u2019t seem she could hear yours. Either that, or she was simply ignoring your constant screams of <i>\u2018what is wrong with you\u2019</i> and <i>\u2018let me out of here\u2019</i>. It seemed she was continuing her stage show, but at this point, you were ignoring here, focusing only on figuring out your situation. What had just happened to you? You had just\u2026 <i>blinked</i> out of existence for a moment, and when you returned, you were here. Is this some kind of fake stomach\u2026 part of her costume, maybe? Why would her costume contain a fake stomach capable of fitting an entire person inside? You hadn\u2019t the foggiest idea; all you knew is that you wanted out. There had to be some kind of zipper or something\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating that random boy was just the first act in her show. This was the only time in the year she got to perform for those cute, bite-sized humans, and she tried to take advantage of every opportunity that comes with that territory, including the chance to have a big, bulging belly throughout her entire show. Finally done rubbing her gut for now, Serafine stretched for a moment as she got ready for the next trick...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was something\u2026 <i>addicting</i> about the fresh-baked sweets that squirrel lady was cooking. You really hadn\u2019t had anything like them before; even the expensive candy provided at all the houses around here couldn\u2019t compare. You <i>had</i> to have more. Without a word being exchanged between you, you and your friends all agreed, and you rushed back to the counter for a second filling. The pudgy squirrel woman smiled as she saw you returning; she was dressed in what looked like a moderately revealing chef costume, hat and all. Even the smells of her baking were intoxicating to your nostrils as you grew closer. She gestured happily to her supply; she seemed to have an endless array of treats to choose from. <b>\u201cAre you sure I can just\u2026?\u201d</b> You say, looking over the delicious treats in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cOh, sure, sugar! Eat as many as you like!\u201d</b></span> The squirrel nodded, and you and your friends eagerly reached for more. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cThere\u2019s more than enough for everyone!\u201d</b></span> You chowed down on yet another delicious chocolatey treat\u2026 and then another\u2026 and then another. You and your friends were grabbing cookies, cupcakes, muffins, all sorts of pastries with reckless abandon, scarfing them down with greater and greater vigor as you lost track of time. Even when your bellies were visibly rounded by the sweets, you still didn\u2019t feel remotely full. As you took a moment to look around, you realized about a dozen other trick-or-treaters were gulping down treats with similar fervor. It was like the pastries were having some sort of\u2026 magical effect on you. The squirrel looked on with a smile on her face all the while, encouraging you all with a mixture of approval and amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of constant, fervent snacking, the three of you finally convinced yourselves to take a break, out of sheer exhaustion. Your round bellies now distended a full feet or two out the front of your bodies, and yet, you still didn\u2019t feel quite full. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you would assume the tall squirrel lady was just trying to fatten you up for some devious purpose\u2026 but that would be ridiculous. Besides, you were way too tired to think about such things right now. You felt about ready to slip into a food coma at any minute. Just as you were about to doze off, you saw the tiger from before walk up to the country, pushing an entire cart full of fresh-baked pastries. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cSorry this took so long! I got a little\u2026 sidetracked,\u201d</b></span> the tiger said, wiping some sweat from her forehead as she began to stock the pastries into the shelves of the squirrel\u2019s stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the tiger\u2019s face went pale when she noticed Maria sitting there, staring at her incredulously. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cHey! Where\u2019s Hugo?\u201d</span> Maria complained, crossing her arms in anger. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDidn\u2019t <i>you</i> say he shouldn\u2019t be left alone?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOh! Y-your\u2026 uh\u2026 brother is still\u2026 back at the house,\u201d</b></span> the tiger said, her tone making it obvious she was trying to come up with a lie. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI left him with\u2026 my neighbor! Yes! I convinced one of my neighbors to supervise him while I brought these pastries here!\u201d</b></span> While Maria interrogated the tiger, you were too busy staring at the feline costumer\u2019s belly, which she was rubbing over with one of her \u2018paws\u2019, as if trying to placate someone inside. Her stomach looked slightly bigger than it was when you last saw her, though you couldn\u2019t tell if you were just misremembering things. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWouldn\u2019t want him getting hurt, would we? He\u2019s such a cute little human\u2026 and such a good assistant, too!\u201d</b></span> Just as she says that, you could swear you saw a small handprint press against the side of her furry \u2018belly\u2019 for a split second. Of course, that was impossible \u2014 she was just wearing a costume, right? You must just be seeing things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria obviously wasn\u2019t satisfied with the tiger\u2019s answer, but before she could ask any further questions, the tiger scampered off, as if busy. The three of you were far too busy to follow her; you were more preoccupied scaring down a few dozen more pastries, trying to get to them before the other trick-or-treaters could. With a dozen rabid hands tearing apart the supply, the squirrel finally ran out. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cOh, dear! It seems you were all even more ravenous than I expected!\u201d</b></span> She giggled, seeing the desperate looks on your faces.<span class=\"cbrown\"><b> \u201cWell, seems like I\u2019m going to have to wrap things up here. But if y\u2019all are interested, I\u2019ll be offering more pastries at another party across the neighborhood, if you want to stop by\u2026\u201d</b></span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t even a question. You were all hopelessly addicted to the delicious treats at this point. Thus, when the squirrel wrapped things up and moved on to the next event, she had a big line of fattened trick-or-treaters following along behind her like the pied piper, letting them blindly follow her to wherever she wanted them to go\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2504\u2504\u2504</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked, the taste of the sweets stopped clouding your mind, and you were able to think about the situation semi-rationally. There were a few things that put you off about all this. The handprint in the tiger\u2019s belly, the way the squirrel seemed to be fattening you all up, the sheer realism of their costumes, the way the other trick-or-treaters seemed to have come from all over the world\u2026  it all led you to one grim conclusion; this whole thing was a trap. It was a ridiculous conclusion, of course, and by all evidence, it should be impossible. Still, you couldn\u2019t shake the suspicion out of your mind. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cHere we are! Just up ahead,\u201d</b></span> She smiled, pointing to a house up ahead. It seemed to be one of the biggest houses on the block, and packed with locals in those strange, huge animal costumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached, your suspicions grew to the point that they were unbearable. Eventually, you couldn\u2019t help yourself but to grab the arms of your friends. <b>\u201cHey! Over here,\u201d</b> you said, whispering, as you pulled them into one of the nearby bushes, knocking them out of their trance. <b>\u201cOver here! Hide!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you were at the back of the line, the three of you were able to disappear into the bushes easily. Your friends looked at you wish confusion as the rest of the trick-or-treaters were led into the house. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cW-what?\u201d</span> Kevin asked. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cWhat are we hiding for?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should just walk in there,\u201d</b> you whisper. <b>\u201cI think the locals are\u2026 planning something.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cWhat? That\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d</span> Maria raises a brow, as if surprised you would even suggest such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cYeah!\u201d</span> Kevin agreed. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cAnd did you <i>taste</i> their cooking? I\u2019m not about to pass that up!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no harm in checking things out first, right?\u201d</b> You insist. <b>\u201cJust trust me on this; waltzing in through a stranger\u2019s front door is a bad idea. We should scout this whole thing out first. If it\u2019s safe, we can still get some treats.\u201d</b> Your friends were frustrated, thinking you were just wasting their time, but they knew they couldn\u2019t argue. They begrudgingly followed you as you as you approached the house, hiding under the cover of darkness...</span></div></div>",

You almost didn\u2019t want to believe it was true, but when you really considered the coincidences; the myths of disappearances, the inhuman heights and impossibly realistic costumes, the way those addicting muffins fattened you up, the bulge in that tiger\u2019s belly\u2026 you couldn\u2019t help but put two and two together. <b>\u201cMaria!

It seemed neither of your friends particularly believed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cSo we\u2019re just going to peek into their windows?\u201d</span> Kevin whispered in a concerned tone, always nervous about breaking the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThey invited us inside, so this should be fine, too,\u201d</b> you insisted, trying to get them to stop interrupting you as you finally peeked inside the window. <b>\u201cNow just humor me for a second, okay?\u201d</b> You peek inside, only to see a modest bedroom within. Despite the fact that it was empty, the lights were on and the door was open, so it was obviously open to anyone during the party. Your naive, innocent mind had no clue what anyone would possibly be doing in a bedroom during a party. Sleep? Impossible with the music playing. Monster Mash was blaring loudly on the living room speakers, of course; a goofy sort of song that made you start to realize you were just being ridiculous. Soon, though, you started hearing some other noises, just barely buried by the roaring of the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201c... I\u2019m not seeing anything,\u201d</span> Kevin said obliviously as you sprained your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSshh\u2026\u201d</b> You shushed him harshly with a finger, before gesturing for the two of them to listen. Eventually, the current song ended, and in the break between songs, you could hear the sound more clearly. You could hear the trick or treaters inside yelling and shouting, as if terrified of something. You could even hear furniture being flipped over and dishes being smashed, as if there was some kind of struggle going on inside. Before you could really tell what was going on, though, another song started playing, muffling the noise once again. The three of you stared at eachother, wide-eyed, trying to interpret what you just heard. You suddenly felt a weird chill, and when you looked down, you realized you had goosebumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201c... was that\u2026\u201d</span> Kevin asked softly, looking horrified. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201c... screaming?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cMaybe somebody just jumped out and scared them,\u201d</span> Maria said, trying to come up with a rational explanation, although you could tell she was also rattled by what you\u2019d just heard. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cIt is Halloween, after all.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cI don\u2019t know, this is creepy,\u201d</span> Kevin whimpered. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cMaybe we should just leave.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNot until I\u2019m sure they\u2019re all okay,\u201d</b> you said, before continuing to sneak around the house, <b>\u201cnow come on.\u201d</b> Maria and Kevin looked at eachother nervously, before ultimately following you once again, trying much harder to be quiet this time. You check every window you come across, but they all just reveal empty rooms; you\u2019d probably have to wander all the way around the house before you can get a good view of the living room. Eventually, you snuck around to the back yard, where the big, wooden back porch overlooked a creepily dark forest. Just as you were sneaking through the yard, you heard the back door creak open, and you immediately ducked into some bushes. <b>\u201cShh! Shh!\u201d</b> You insisted, though your friends had no plans of making a peep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard big, heavy footsteps crossing the back porch \u2014 obviously one of the locals. You peek out of the bushes to see another inhumanly tall, voluptuous young woman in a grey wolf \u2018costume\u2019, who seemed to be dressed up as a pumpkin. Well, saying dressed up wouldn\u2019t be accurate; she was almost naked, and the only thing she had as far as costume\u2019s go was the fact that the fur on her belly was dyed orange and black to resemble a jack o\u2019 lantern. Considering how big and round her belly was, for some reason, the jack o\u2019 lantern dye was actually pretty convincing.

The rest of her body was very skinny, so her big belly couldn\u2019t be blamed on her weight or anything. She obviously wasn\u2019t used to having such a big, round stomach, so she couldn\u2019t be pregnant; she had to have eaten something. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cUrgh\u2026 I\u2019m gonna get indigestion\u2026\u201d</b></span> She let out a little huff of relief as she finally sat down on the chair, rubbing over her sore stomach with discomfort. Eventually, she leaned back in her chair, closing her eyes as she struggled to digest whatever she had eaten. Still,  you couldn\u2019t prove she had eaten anybody. It\u2019s not like you could see any bulges coming from within, it was just\u2026 big and round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you were determined to get to the bottom of this. You wanted to be sure these\u2026 weird animal costumers were actually eating people before you called the police or something. Seeing that she had her eyes closed, you went prone and tried crawling you way past the porch, determined to get a view of the dining room. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cWhat are you doing? Are you crazy?\u201d</span> Kevin whispered frantically, seeing you crawling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI\u2019m gonna scout things out,\u201d</b> you whisper back. <b>\u201cStay here for now.\u201d</b> Kevin obviously thought this was a terrible idea, but it was too late to protest now without the \u2018wolf\u2019 hearing, so he just held his breath and hoped you made it\u2026</span></div></div>",

The closer you snuck towards the farthest side of the house, the more disconcerting noises you heard, and your heart was beating in your chest as you approached one of the windows. When you looked inside, you could only stare, frozen, at the unimaginable display before you. Through the huge, vertical windows along the wall, you could easily see the entirety of the living room, dining room, and the great room, and saw that the huge house was packed with over half a dozen anthros. It would almost look like your average house party, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that every patron was completely naked, and lounged around with huge, rounded guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes fell on a curvaceous bird woman who wandered by the window, with wide hips, big beautiful wings instead of arms, and most prominently, a huge, bulging gut. As she past you, oblivious to your presence, you saw a handprint bulge against her big, rounded stomach. You shuddered in shock and awe. There was no doubt in your mind; these \u2018anthros\u2019 were real, and they were eating people! Even more incredible, those people were still alive inside their rounded bellies; you shuddered to imagine the fate these anthros had in mind for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the bird woman walked up to the kitchen, where you realized the squirrel woman you saw earlier was standing. She looked pleased with her handiwork, though her belly wasn\u2019t as large as the other\u2019s, for some reason. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cMy compliments to the chef. Really, such an incredible feast to cap the evening off once again, April,\u201d</b></span> the avian complimented. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cSuch a shame there wasn\u2019t enough for everybody.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know what happened, Alona. Three of \u2018em just disappeared while we were walking here. Must\u2019ve wandered off,\u201d</b></span> the squirrel shrugs, distracted as she cooked up more conventional meals. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cOh well. The night\u2019s still young. Sheryl\u2019s rounding up some more humans as we speak, in fact.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cMm\u2026\u201d</b></span> The bird woman licked her \u2018lips\u2019 and rubbed over her already engorged belly. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cCan\u2019t wait for dessert, then.\u201d</b></span> Disgust and indignation brewed inside you. After swallowing an entire person, she was still hungry for more? Do these animals have no remorse? You look away in disgust, scanning the rest of the party to see how the rest of the patrons were handling things. They all seemed equally sadistic, rubbing over the bulges in their guts as the people inside futilely kicked and punched. Eventually, you noticed a blue-furred canine woman who didn\u2019t seem to have anyone in her stomach\u2026 though she, of course wasn\u2019t guiltless either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThey\u2019re both really wriggling in there, Jazz!\u201d</span></b> The canine smiled. She was on her knees in front of a bulky, muscular jackal woman who was sitting on the couch, and was diligently rubbing the jackal\u2019s belly, blushing and smiling brightly as she admired the bulges coming from within. The jackal woman\u2019s belly was huge even by the standards of the party-goers; the gluttonous woman must\u2019ve wolfed down two people. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t believe you at first when you said you\u2019d be able to fit that man up your, uh, other end\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\"><b>\u201cYup. Been practicing for a while\u2026\u201d</b></span> The jackal said, leaning back and smiling with her eyes closed as she passively enjoyed the enthusiastic belly massage she was receiving. <span class=\"cteal\"><b>\u201cThanks for letting me have your snack, babe.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cPleasure\u2019s all mine! I love it when your belly\u2019s all huge like this!\u201d</b></span> The canine replied. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cBesides, we can still catch more, right? Maybe I can even try out your \u2018technique\u2019...\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\"><b>\u201cI like the way you think, Reina\u2026\u201d</b></span> Excited by the thought, the jackal suddenly pulled the canine up and onto her belly, locking lips with her before she could react. Reina seemed surprised for a moment, before melted into the jackal\u2019s arms, using her huge belly as a makeshift water bed as the two kissed. This only caused the jackal\u2019s belly to bulge even more as the two people inside were slowly squished beneath the canine\u2019s weight. When the jackal started passionately groping the other canine\u2019s ass, you were forced to turn away in disgust, deciding you\u2019ve seen enough of that macabre make-out sesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust at around the same time, the wolf finally stumbled back into the house, looking a little bit better, but still nauseous. <span class=\"crose\"><b>\u201cWhatssa matter, Violet? Bit off more then you can chew?\u201d</b></span> Another wolf, this one male with brown fur, wrapped his arm around the woman\u2019s shoulder, helping her stay standing. His belly seemed to be just as full as hers, although he had no problem carrying the extra weight. Apparently, he was much more experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI\u2019ve just\u2026 never done this before\u2026\u201d</b></span> Violet said. As if to demonstrate her point, the person inside kicked roughly against her stomach, and Violet instinctively pressed her hand against her mouth, suppressing the urge to throw up. Once the feeling passed, she sighed and leaned against the wolf for support as he led her to a chair. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cUgh\u2026 I wish he\u2019d just stop wriggling\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\"><b>\u201cReally? The wriggling is, like, the best part,\u201d</b></span> he chuckled as he held her hand, helping her balance as she sat down on one of the chairs and got settled in. The chair creaked under her weight, but held firm. They seemed to be designed for this sort of thing. <span class=\"crose\"><b>\u201cWell, whatever. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cTrent\u2026 think you could\u2026 help me digest?\u201d</b></span> The she-wolf looked up at him, pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, before chuckling. <span class=\"crose\"><b>\u201c... how could I say no to that face?\u201d</b></span> He took a knee in front of her chair, and started gently massaging her sensitive belly in just the right ways to suppress the wriggling from within. He was apparently an expert at this, too, and the wolfess immediately seemed relaxed, leaning back in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cMm\u2026 ooh\u2026 that\u2019s the spot\u2026\u201d</b></span> She smiled, her tail wagging behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to avert your eyes from the terrible display in front of you, but you wanted to memorize everyone responsible her so you could report them accurately after this. You didn\u2019t want any of these monsters to get away with this. Still, this grotesque \u2018party\u2019 was getting harder and harder to watch with every passing moment. You looked to the far corner of the room, seeing that two anthro women \u2014 another bird, and a panther \u2014 were belly dancing in the open, while an otter sitting on the couch records them. Neither of them were particularly decent dancers, though the show was obviously designed for titillation rather than to show off their skills. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cDamn, Rosey, you got moves!\u201d</b></span> The bird said, obviously exhausted. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cI just can\u2019t keep up\u2026!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cJust follow my lead, Dorothy. You\u2019re a natural,\u201d</b></span> the panther replied. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHeh. Are they enjoying the show, Vince?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter gave a lazy thumbs up, fiddling with his laptop while balancing his camera with the other. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cYou betcha,\u201d</b></span> the otter smiled. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWe\u2019re almost up to eight hundred viewers. We\u2019re the most popular stream broadcasting from Vampyre Lane right now.\u201d</b></span> They were\u2026 <i>livestreaming</i> this? <i>Hundreds</i> of people were watching this? Not only that, but there were other streams just like this occurring all around the neighborhood? The pit in your stomach only grew worse. You weren\u2019t just watching one crazy house party\u2026 you were getting to the heart of an entire conspiracy! You can\u2019t imagine how many people have already been sacrificed to these vile creature\u2019s gluttonous guts. You weren\u2019t going to rest until every single person on Vampyre Lane saw justice for their crimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally stumbled away from the window, unable to handle what you were seeing any longer. You couldn\u2019t just stand by and watch anymore\u2026 you had to act! You stumbled, dazed, across the backyard towards your friends, your mind fried as it tries to register what you\u2019ve just seen. They seemed relieved to see you return unharmed, but frowned when they saw the look on your face. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cUh\u2026 are you okay, man?\u201d</span> Maria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s true\u2026\u201d</b> You said, so quiet that it was almost a whisper. <b>\u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 eating people\u2026\u201d</b> Before they could press you for an explanation, you started to cry into your hands, overcome by emotions. Kevin seemed too shocked to move, but Maria placed a comforting hand on your shoulder, letting you lean against the wall of the house as the three of you hide in the bushes again. There, through your sobs, you tell them all about what you saw inside your house. It almost needed to be seen to be believed, but by the way you were acting, they could tell you were serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cSo\u2026 what do you want us to do?\u201d</span> Maria asked when you finally finished your explanation.

None of you had your own phones, but you were somehow certain you could find a phone somewhere in that abandoned bedroom. Sure enough, whoever owned this place kept a corded telephone by their bed. Your friends were shocked to see you pull open the window, which, luckily, was unlocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cD-don\u2019t go in there!\u201d</span> Kevin insisted. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cWe can use someone else\u2019s phone!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThere\u2019s no time,\u201d</b> you said, thinking of all the people who were currently digesting. <b>\u201cBesides, we can\u2019t trust anyone in this neighborhood. Just wait here, alright?\u201d</b> You ignored all their further protests as you snuck one foot through the window, and then the other, sliding through without making a sound. All your fears and inhibitions had slipped away, replaced with one, singular purpose; saving those innocent people. You felt a chill as you entered the room, and remembered that the door was still wide open; you tried to hide behind the bed, to make sure you weren\u2019t spotted by anyone walking by. You fearlessly sneak your way over to the phone, expertly avoiding making a single sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis model of phone was before your time, so you weren\u2019t exactly certain how it worked; you simply pressed the receiver against your ear and dialed 9-1-1. It took a surprisingly long time for the call to go through, but eventually you heard the relieving voice of a dispatcher. <b><span class=\"cgrey\">\u201c911, what\u2019s the nature of your emergency?\u201d</span></b> The monotone, female voice on the other end replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI-I\u2019m in Vampyre Lane,\u201d</b> you whimpered. Only once you heard the sound of your own voice did you fully realize how scared and desperate you were feeling. <b>\u201cEveryone here is\u2026 crazy.

That\u2026 doesn\u2019t make any sense. Wasn\u2019t she a dispatcher? Besides, you also realized that she had had a wholly unprofessional tone throughout this entire call, as if your calling was an inconvenience to her. <b>\u201c... wait, what do you mean <i>you\u2019ll</i> be here?\u201d</b> You ask, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cJust stay where you are, sir,\u201d</b></span> the voice sighed in exasperation. <span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cI\u2019ll be right with you.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNo! What? Stay on the line!\u201d</b> You demand, only to hear her hanging up in response. <b>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</b> You smash the receiver down too in response, overcome by rage for a moment. You stood there, seething with rage, taken aback by that dispatcher\u2019s complete lack of professional conduct. Before you could try again, however, you heard heavy footsteps slowly approaching the bedroom, and your heart sunk in your chest. They must\u2019ve heard you! You only had a couple seconds to make your escape, and your flight or fight instinct instantly kicked in. As you saw it, you had two options; hide beneath the bed, or jump out the window. If you hid under the bed, you probably wouldn\u2019t be seen right away\u2026 but if you did get caught, there was no way you\u2019d be able to escape. If you jump out the window, they\u2019d definitely see you, but you may be able to run off before they can catch you.</span></div></div>",

Tonight was the night you\u2019d put that bit of wisdom to the test, it seems, as the anthro was only a moment away. By the time the purple-feathered bird woman you saw early stomps inside, you were already halfway to the window. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHey, you!\u201d</b></span> You heard her cry, angrily, though you didn\u2019t bother to check over your shoulder to see if she was pursuing you.

Looking back, though, you see your friends just kneeling by the window, staring at you wide-eyed, two startled and confused to register what was happening.

You had just been expecting to put yourself as risk, in a display of selfless bravery; instead, your plan backfired, and now your friends were in mortal danger. <b>\u201cHey!

Hehehe!\u201d</b></span> Seeing your cowardice, the bird smugly slams the window shut, locking it and sealing your friends inside that dreaded house. You stumble around as if in a daze, overcome by shock and regret. Eventually, you come to your senses enough to find a hiding spot just in case some of the anthros come out to capture you\u2026 but they all seemed too lazy to bother, content to continue having their party without you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was obviously a trap, of course \u2014 they were waiting for you to come to them, knowing you couldn\u2019t resist the urge to save your friends.

On the other hand, by the time the cops arrive, it might already be too late; your friends might\u2019ve already been swallowed up by the monsters! Who knows if the police would even have the tools to rescue them from the anthro\u2019s stomachs.

You could only lie there, imagining what your friends must be going through right now as you wait for the cops to arrive. Each minute that ticked by felt like an hour as you waited there, until finally, a single, measly cop car pulled up to the curb just in front of the house. It wasn\u2019t as much as you had hoped, but it was enough. The car looked little strange, and the sirens weren\u2019t blaring as it approached, but you didn\u2019t really know anything about cops, so you decided not to question it. At least, not until you realize the police officer was actually a titanic bear woman, barely able to fit out the door like it was a clown car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she approached you, munching on a donut as she stepped out onto the curb. You step back a bit, though she didn\u2019t seem immediately hostile. Her uniform seemed to be the real article, at least, squeezing down on her curvaceous form as best it can. It was definitely the least revealing outfit you\u2019ve seen an anthro wear. Her belly seemed quite large, but through her uniform, you couldn\u2019t tell if there was anybody inside, or if it was just paunch from all the donuts she eats. <span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you just the cutest human I\u2019ve seen all night,\u201d</b></span> she said in an incredibly unprofessional manner, and you flinch as she reaches down to pinch your cheek.

Was it really that well-known that the citizens of Vampyre Lane ate humans? If so, why hadn\u2019t anybody already done anything about it? <span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cHave no fear, though.

You certainly didn\u2019t trust the bear; she didn\u2019t act like a cop, and the possibility remained that she was just wearing a random anthro wearing a police officer halloween costume. Still, you were so close that you knew she could catch you if you ran. You\u2019d just have to see how she reacted to your testimony. <b>\u201cWell\u2026 those anthros in there\u2026 they\u2019re eating people\u2026\u201d</b> You nervously point at the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</b></span> She crosses her arms, looking more amused than concerned by the revelation. <span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cWell, who\u2019s getting ate?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cPeople from the park\u2026 they lured them to this house\u2026\u201d</b> You stared at the ground, unable to bring yourself to meet her gaze. <b>\u201cWe almost got lured, too, but then we broke free\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWe looked in through the windows, and saw what was happening to them\u2026\u201d</b> You said. <b>\u201cSo I snuck in, and used the phone to call you\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cHehe! I think I\u2019ve heard all I needed to hear,\u201d</b></span> she giggled loudly upon hearing your confession, and your heart sunk in surprise. Why was she reacting like that? Had you revealed too much? Before you could ask, the bear reaches towards you, holding you up by her sides. She was remarkably strong for such a pudgy woman; probably a result of her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cW-whoa! What are you-\u201d</b> You cry, kicking futilely against her grip. You open your eyes moments after to find yourself staring directly into the bear\u2019s dripping maw, gazing down her dark, cavernous throat. <b>\u201cMph!\u201d</b> You had zero time to react before the bear reached a claw around your back and shoved you headfirst into that gluttonous, waiting maw. You yell of surprise was muffled completely by the bear\u2019s mouth as your head and hair was instantly soaked with saliva, and your face was pressed up against her rough tongue. Just like every experience predator, she used the original moment of shock to gulp your head down before you could even bring yourself to struggle. By the time you finally started wriggling and kicking, trying to break free from the bear\u2019s grip, she already had you down to your neck in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart was beating out of your chest by this point. Your natural fight or flight instincts overwhelmed all your common sense and higher reasoning, even though both \u2018fight\u2019 and \u2018flight\u2019 were useless prospects at this point. The bear had obviously devoured tougher prey than yourself, and compared to them, you were just an easy snack. She overpowered you with such terrifying strength, struggling with all the might your body could possibly muster didn\u2019t even manage to minorly inconvenience her. You knew what she was doing, but you couldn\u2019t do a single thing to stop it, and that knowledge terrified you to a level you\u2019ve never experienced before in your life. You were panicking beyond belief by the time you were plunged a quarter way into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, your arms were mostly pinned against your sides, and you could kick wildly in the air, trying futilely to bash her on the nose or something, though you knew you were just wasting your energy. You were making an sizeable bulge in the bear\u2019s throat, but your head had already disappeared behind her impressive bust, and the rest of you was soon to follow. The amount of saliva covering you was truly incredible, almost feeling like you were drowning in the natural juices of the bear\u2019s body. Now that you were waist deep, you must look like a funny sight; just a pair of legs hanging out of the bear woman\u2019s mouth, your kicks gradually growing weaker and weaker. With a smile, she leaned her head back and let gravity slide you down her throat at a terrifying speed, until she finally clapped her teeth shut behind your feet, sealing you away completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips and rubbed her belly as you were finally pushed through a tight sphincter, being dropped unceremoniously into her roomy stomach. Through all her fat, you didn\u2019t even leave a bulge. It was dizzyingly hot inside her belly, sweltering like a dangerously warm sauna, and the swaddling effect as her tummy swung to and fro increased your disorientation. Being inside of the woman\u2019s stomach was an unparalleled sensory experience; not just the overwhelming feeling of being squished and swung around as she moved, but also the constant sound of her heartbeat, and the gurgling of her guts, as well as the metallic scent of acid. <span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cHehehe! Spying through somebody\u2019s windows\u2026 sneaking into their house\u2026 I think somebody deserves to stay in my \u2018holding cell\u2019 tonight,\u201d</b></span> she laughed, her booming voice heard even through the thick walls of flab surrounding your prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you worked up the nerve to open your eyes as well, only to realize that her stomach was surprisingly well-lit. You could clearly see the undulating pink walls, the puddle forming beneath you, and to your surprise, another boy sitting across from you. <span class=\"cgrey\">\"What are you in here for?\u201d</span> He asked, apparently dressed as a parrot or something, though his costume has long since been ruined by the harsh conditions of the bear\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNothing! I called her!\u201d</b> You vent angrily. <b>\u201cShe betrayed me!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</span> He frowned. <span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cWell, I got caught stealing candy\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d</b> You insisted. <b>\u201cI just want to know what\u2019s going to happen to us in here.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cUh\u2026 I don\u2019t know. The way she talks about it, she might let us out, and she might not. She\u2019s not really clear\u2026\u201d</span> He said awkwardly. <span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cI mean, I\u2019ve been here for a while, and I haven\u2019t been digested any yet, so\u2026\u201d</span> Somehow, that wasn\u2019t very comforting. You didn\u2019t want your fate to be left in the hands of this brutish woman. The possibility remained that she was just toying with you, wanting to feel her \u2018prey\u2019 squirm over Halloween only to digest them afterwards. The other boy watched nervously as you got to work furiously punching and kicking at the walls of your \u2018prison\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you got in return was the sound of a single, long belch from the bear. <span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cHey, knock it off in there! You\u2019re givin\u2019 me gas!\u201d</b></span> The bear cop demanded, slapping her stomach indignantly. <span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cIf you keep that up, I might have to book you on charges of resisting arrest\u2026\u201d</b></span> The other boy looked increasingly nervous when she said that, and tried to beg you to stop; you were in the same stomach, after all, so if you piss of its owner, he gets punished too. Then against, you weren\u2019t quite ready to back down so easily\u2026</span></div></div>",

With a sigh, you calmed down, giving up and letting the bear control your fate. <span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cThere you go. Glad to see cooperative citizens,\u201d</b></span> the bear chuckled, patting her belly smugly. Once that whole business was taken care of, she looked up at the house, reminded of her other responsibilities. <span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cMight as well let this delinquent\u2019s victims know what happened.\u201d</b></span> The bear\u2019s huge paw banging loudly against the door \u2014 a little louder then she herself expected \u2014 and the owners were quick to take notice.

Most notably, a group of anthros sat on a couch, all crowding around a tiger recording a jackal and a canine in a corner of the room. As the bear moved closer, she realized the canine was bent over, her tail raised, with a pair of legs sticking out of her rear end, which kicked futilely as the dog\u2019s \u2018meal\u2019 is slowly pushed deeper by the jackal. The canine was painting and moaning, pushed almost to the breaking point by the bombardment of sensations. <span class=\"cteal\"><b>\u201cJust a little bit more, Reina! Don\u2019t give up now!\u201d</b></span> The jackal insists, on her knees by her girlfriend\u2019s side, helping the canine work her prey deeper and deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOver a thousand viewers, now! We\u2019re in the top 50 vore streams worldwide!\u201d</b></span> The tiger fist pumped the air at the news, and a few whoops of celebration spread through the house. Leonara chuckled and rolled her eyes as she turned away, letting the rowdy, college-aged anthros have their fun. She sat down at a table on the other side of the room, and the bird sat down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cI just wanted to let you know that a human was sneaking around your property illegally, and even snuck into your house for some nefarious purpose,\u201d</b></span> the bear whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYes, I am aware.\u201d</b></span> The bird nodded immediately. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWe actually have his friends here, if you need to question them.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cReally?

The bird smiled slyly, taking another sip from her drink as she turned to the bear. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWould you like us to turn them over to 'police custody'?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cNah, I\u2019m sure y\u2019all can handle them,\u201d</b></span> the bear waves a hand dismissively, before gesturing to her bulging gut. <span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cIn fact, I was wondering if you wanted the two humans I have in here.

Do you have a bathtub or something?\u201d</b></span> The bear asked, and the bird pointed her to the back room. She slipped through the hungry party crowd, eventually ending up in the bathroom connected to that guest bedroom from before. Without bothering to close the door behind her, she sticks two big, furry fingers down her throat, wriggling them around until she finally gags. Pressing this advantage, she leans over the tub and starts coughing and hacking, forcing her prey back up the way they came. Meanwhile, to you, it felt like the bear\u2019s stomach was being turned inside out; before you knew it, the two of you were pressed through that tight sphincter again, suddenly being sent flying up the woman\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, the bear was violently expelled you from her mouth, the two of you landing in a puddle of saliva and other gastrointestinal juices at the bottom of the tub. You gasped for fresh air, coughing up saliva, dazed by the feeling of finally being free from the miserable confines of the woman\u2019s stomach. When the two of you finally managed the strength to stand, the bear hanging you both towels. <span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cGood news!

Thus, you begrudgingly take the towels, trying to wipe all the saliva off yourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were halfway presentable, the bear finally paraded you in front of all the partygoers. <span class=\"ckhaki\"><b>\u201cGot some new treats here!\u201d</b></span> The bear smiled, and every single anthro in the house turned to face you. You shuddered, feeling tiny as you\u2019re stared at by an entire party of huge, creepy anthros. You couldn\u2019t see your friends anyway, but the newly emerging bellies of the canine and the squirrel women gave you some idea of where they might be. You were almost on the verge of tears as you were marched through the house. Previously, they had gulped their prey up as soon as they could\u2026 but with you, they knew they had all the time in the world. Your only hope of salvation had betrayed you. There would be no escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one corner, you noticed that the wolf\u2019s bellyrub seems to have evolved into something\u2026 more. The man was now on his knees, his head buried between the she-wolf\u2019s legs, the woman moaning and panting as she clenched her toned thighs around his head. She seemed to be shuddering and gasping with every movement of his tongue, one hand on her breast and the other hand on the back of his head, pressing the wolf\u2019s snout into her sex. Meanwhile, both the wolves\u2019 stomachs were big and bulging, as they worked on churning at the humans inside. You turned away immediately in disgust, although the image would remain stuck in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the canine and jackal retreated, giggling, into the bedroom, eager to blow off some \u2018tension\u2019 as they gurgled up their prey. You watched, helplessly, knowing that one of your friends was somewhere within the canine\u2019s body. How were you ever going to rescue them? You were going to be the same position soon\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, your only saving grace was that most of the anthros were full, and already satisfied with their meals. However, two anthros still seemed to be interested in you and the other human. Who would end up claiming you?</span></div></div>",

The bird woman and Officer Leonara peered out from the kitchen and spied a curvy fox woman dressed in revealing lingerie. She held a plastic Jack \u2018O Lantern filled with candy and a slew of happy trick-or-treaters stood behind her. She happily announced in a sing-song fashion, \u201c<span class=\"cborange\">We\u2019ve got more party guests</span>.\u201d All of the anthros and trick-or-treaters applauded as the loud Halloween Party Playlist music came booming back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sly grin, the young bird woman glared back at Leonara, nearly giggling, \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">I think we\u2019ll be fine</span>.\u201d Leonara chuckled, \u201c<span class=\"clgrey\">Well\u2026 enjoy your party</span>.\u201d The huge bear woman gestured to the trick-or-treaters who were now conversing amongst the big bellied anthros, \u201c<span class=\"clgrey\">I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy them.

Happy Halloween Leonara</span>.\u201d The bear officer chuckled as she heaved herself off the kitchen chair and started to wobble her way out, trying to avoid tripping or falling over on the small humans littering the house. Patting her stomach she gently responded, \u201c<span class=\"clgrey\">You got that right Alona. A happy, hungry Halloween</span>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter schootching her was through the party crowd she made it to the front door and went out onto the porch, shutting the door behind her. She rubbed over her squirming gut, sighing, \u201c<span class=\"clgrey\">Oof, so full. Well, the night\u2019s still young</span>.\u201d Officer Leonara could feel something rising up her gullet. She puts a paw over her muzzle before tilting her head to the cool, autumn night sky and letting out a deep, gnarly belch. BBBLLOOOORRRRPPPPP! Leonara chuckled, patting her belly, \u201c<span class=\"clgrey\">Forgot trick-or-treaters make me gassy</span>.\u201d Your huge bear captress waddled back to her cop car, squeezing her way in. The car soon revved back to life as it\u2019s headlights were switched on and Officer Leonara drove off into the cool Halloween night. Her belly pressed up against the bottom of the steering wheel. The bear woman didn\u2019t mind one bit, but it was certainly painful for you and the other boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to tell in the dank darkness of the bears belly, but you thought you saw the other boy start to tear up. Then you heard him sniffle, \u201cI wanna go home. I should\u2019ve never come here.\u201d You had to agree with him, and you kind of wanted to flail around and cry too, and beg for someone to come save you from this hungry bear lady. But you knew that wouldn\u2019t yield any results and might even tempt her to digest you both. No, if you ever wanted to get out of here\u2026 see your parents again\u2026 go back to school\u2026 and live the rest of your life, you had to keep it cool. At least until you make it out of this nightmare of a neighborhood, then you could cry all you want. You started to formulate a plan as the VLPD patrol car leisurely drove away into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria and Kevin weren\u2019t having much of a better time either. Maria groaned in disgust and wiggled about inside the dog girl\u2019s butt. It wasn\u2019t as dirty in here as she expected it to be but it sure was smelly. If only there was enough room in this stinky, fleshy tunnel for her to bring her hand up to her nose to pinch it. This certainly wasn\u2019t how she thought her Halloween was going to turn out. She just hoped her little brother Hugo was ok. Fear shoot through Maria\u2019s veins, she left him with a tiger lady\u2026 a tiger of all things. If she was anything like these anthros she definitely was going to try to eat him. She just hopes Hugo was smart enough to run from her and run fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a definitively stinky fart blows past her Maria coughs and gags into one of the fleshy walls of Reina\u2019s butthole. Outside Reina giggled and the anthros around her chuckled, slapping her butt, \u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Sorry sweetie, guess I\u2019m a little gassy</span>.\u201d Enraged, Maria jostled herself about in the dog woman\u2019s butt, trying to cause as much discomfort as possible, \u201c<span class=\"clred\">I can\u2019t believe you shoved me up your butt. Let me out of here you mangy mutt</span>!\u201d Reina chuckled, playfully biting a claw and kicking her legs in the air as she let her human buttsnack settle inside her. Wouldn\u2019t be long now until she ended up in the canines gut and her belly will start to go to town on digesting the little brat, \u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Hmm, let me think about that one\u2026 NO</span>!\u201d All of the anthros chuckle as Maria angrily thrashes about in the dog butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin wasn\u2019t fairing so well either. He lightly wiggled about as much as he could in the hot, cramped squirrel belly. Kevin whimpered, tears in his eyes, \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\">I didn\u2019t think it was going to end like this. I thought candy was going to end up in my belly, I didn\u2019t I would end up IN someone's belly</span>.\u201d April cackled as she rubbed over her fat belly, \u201c<span class=\"cbrown\">Believe it. You humans make for great party food. It doesn\u2019t help that you trick-or-treaters are bite-sized either. But hey, look on the bright side, once I\u2019m done digesting you\u2026 that means no more school</span>!\u201d This only made Kevin squeal and thrash about more. The squirrel giggled, slapping her gut, \u201c<span class=\"cbrown\">Was it something I said</span>?\u201d As Maria wiggled about inside the hot, stinky dog butt an idea came into mind. There might just be a way out of here. It would be risky, and it may not work but\u2026 FFFRRRBBBBTTTTT! It beats being farted on by this dog lady. The anthros laugh and howl as Reina jiggles her butt, \u201c<span class=\"clblue\">How\u2019d you like that one snack</span>?\u201d As the anthros cackled Maria decided to put her plan into action.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve gotten your fair share of laughs and treats\u2026 now, where were the thrills? Halloween should be a time of good ol\u2019 spooky fun, especially since you were alone this year, but you haven\u2019t really done anything scary yet. Thus, you decided to ask the locals for a place that\u2019s creepy, but not <i>too</i> creepy\u2026 and their answer was always Carni\u2019s Dread Acres. It wasn\u2019t the scariest attraction on Vampyre Lane, but it was described as one of the most entertaining, so despite your friend\u2019s cowardly hesitations, you convinced them to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVampyre Lane was a curious place. It seemed to sprawl from horizon to horizon, and yet, when you set your mind to travelling someplace, you find yourself there in seconds, no matter how far away it seemed. From the outside, it seemed like just a little gated community in the woods, but on the inside, it seemed as big as an entire city. How did you never notice this place before? Pushing those thoughts aside, you were glad to finally reach the \u2018Dread Acres\u2019. It was apparently just a farm on the outskirts of Vampyre Lane that the owner re-purposed into a haunted house every Halloween. It seemed fairly popular for how out-of-the-way it was, with a dozen trick-or-treaters lining up to be the next on the hayride, which was apparently one of the funnest attractions in the area. That was the thing you were most excited for, but the line seemed like it would take forever\u2026 maybe you could do a run through of the main farmhouse while you wait?</span></div></div>",

Already she was salivating at the thought of making that bulge a little bigger. But the only thing she loved more than eating sweet little kids was playing with her food. With a smile from ear to ear she sat herself back down and pulled out some cups from behind the counter of her booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, let's play a little game. If you win, I'll cough up your friend and even show you where you can find more candy than you can carry.\" She waited for dramatic effect, watching Kevin and Maria's eyes widen with wonder. \"But... every time you guess wrong, I get to eat one of you. I think I'll start with... you.\" She pointed a clawed finger at Kevin, who squeaked with fear. He cowered behind Maria, who boldly faced the fox down. She'd seen this game before at the fair, she was ready. \"Bring it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox produced a gleaming red bauble and placed it on the table. Next she set a cup over it. \"Just keep your eye on the shiny.\" She said with a smirk as she lined up the three other cups. Maria watched intently as the fox began to swap the cups around. At first it was easy to follow, but the fox went faster and faster. The tapping of the cups being repositioned sped up constantly. The fox's nimble hands almost became a blur, swapping the cups around with lightning speed. When she was done the fox woman proudly presented the four cups to the two frightened children. They had to point one out, but even Maria, who'd kept a steadfast eye on things, wasn't sure anymore of her judgment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was reasonably confident she knew which one it was. But what if she'd been outfoxed? Kevin would be squirming in that belly in no time. And she'd still need to pick the right cup from the remaining three or she'd end up in that fox gut herself. The fox woman patted her belly contently, already imagining how big it would get with more tasty little morsels inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tick tock, I haven't got all day. Unless you want to give up and climb in yourself...\"</span></div></div>",

After that hungry fox lady, she did not want to have to negotiate with another hungry beast to spit out her friends. Even Hugo, annoying as he was, didn't deserve that sort of treatment. Without further incident they arrived at the tiger's doorstep, but before she rang the bell a shiver ran down Maria's spine. She turned back and looked at you and Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys... do you think it's safe to knock? Surely if she sees us so soon again she might realize that we know. I don't want to be anywhere near her when that happens.\" You both nod in agreement. You'd already been stuffed in one belly today, and that's enough to last you a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what?\" You ask, curious where Maria's smile came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've gotta be sneaky. First we need to find out if Hugo is safe. Could be that not all these animal-people are maneaters, right?\" She was always an optimist, but you feared the worst had happened. You mainly hoped the tiger also hadn't bothered to chew her food. Quietly the three of you snuck into the backyard, peeping into every window along the way. All the rooms so far were empty, but the living room was coming up next. Maria peeked quickly and turned back, her face white as a sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I just saw her belly move.\" She whispered. Bravely she took another look, this time keeping her cool and taking note of the situation at hand. Again the three of you huddle together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, the tiger's asleep, but she's got a big belly and I'm fairly certain Hugo's in it. Time to go in and save him.\" She said confidently. You weren't quite so eager yet. \"But how? Have you got a plan?\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to make her throw up. Either we find something gross in her house and pour it in her mouth or we just all hit her in the belly real hard.\" Maria's plan didn't fill you with hope, but given the situation it was the best plan available. First things first though, how were you going to get in? You look around and smile. You point out the open window on the first floor and a nearby ladder. All three of you worked together better than ever before to put up the ladder without making a sound. If the tiger woke up to seeing three kids trying to break into her house, she'd eat you all. You didn't want your last moments to be stuck in a stomach with Hugo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith barely a noise each of you gets up the ladder and through the open window into a tidy bedroom. It looked sober and uninteresting, most likely a guest room. You were inside the tiger's house now. None of you dared to even breathe, terrified to wake the tiger. She'd already eaten Hugo. Or was she just a bit pudgy before? Whatever the case, you were in now and you weren't leaving without your friend.</span></div></div>",

Kevin\u2019s knees wobbled with fear and whispered, \u201cI-I\u2019m scared.\u201d Maria nodded and replied lowly, \u201cWe all are. But we gotta do this.

Thankfully it doesn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to stay a few good feet away from the tigress, big cats like her have acute hearing and you assumed that would make her a pretty light sleeper. You turn to Maria, \u201cOk, so if we get her to barf Hugo up she\u2019s definitely going to be wide awake.

What\u2019s the best way to get him out?\u201d You pondered, peering over at the shapely tigress sprawled out on her large couch, loudly snoring. There was another chair next to the couch the fat bellied tigress was sleeping on, perhaps you three could jump from the couch onto her belly and literally kick Hugo out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your sights to the fridge in the tiger lady\u2019s kitchen. You slowly sneaked in and silently opened the door. You noticed a funky jug of green-tinted milk. You checked the expiration date: \u201cMarch 5th of Last Year\u201d. If this milk doesn\u2019t make this overgrown kitty cat sick you don\u2019t know what will. Maria and Kevin followed you into the kitchen. Maria put a hand on your shoulder and whispered, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d You smiled and whisper, \u201cSpoiled milk\u2026 REALLY spoiled milk.\u201d Maria nodded, \u201cLet\u2019s use that!\u201d Kevin quivered, \u201cHold on! How are we gonna get her mouth open to drink the milk?\u201d He had a good point, you\u2019d either have to wait for the tigress to hopefully open her mouth in her sleep or try to pry her jaws open and hope she downs enough before she comes to her senses. You retort, \u201cW-well\u2026 what if we jump from her chair onto her belly?\u201d Maria cocked her head, \u201cWhat if that\u2019s not enough force? We don\u2019t weigh a lot ya\u2019 know. Even all three of us might not be a match for a few hundred pound tiger lady.\u201d You friends both had good points. No matter what you choose it\u2019s ultimately a gamble.

Determined not to end Halloween in a tiger's stomach you push on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria and Kevin were right behind you, every bit as nervous as you. She was terrified as well, but for her little brother she would push on. He might be an annoying little pest, but she wasn't going to let him become a meal for the monsters in this street. Her nerves of steel inspired Kevin to follow along too. He could've sworn he saw those sensitive ears twitch whenever one of your costumes rustled a bit too loudly. What if she was just pretending to be asleep? You'd all be jumping almost straight down her throat. No, she couldn't fake this, she wasn't toying with him. It was just his nerves. He pushed on, seeing his friends fearlessly move forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couch was large and soft, easily conquered and soon you found yourself alongside you friends standing on the side. Before you was the sleeping tiger lady, her big belly rising and sagging a little with each deep breath. This was it, the point of no return. Whether you could pull this off or not, you were about to be in a room with an angry and upset tiger woman. The same tiger woman that may have eaten one of your friends. You'd already been inside of one of these strange creatures, you were in no rush to repeat that little adventure. You hold out your hand, silently counting down. Three. Two. One.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of you jump in perfect unison, preparing for a heavy two-footed landing right on her belly. But is it enough?</span></div></div>",

Not even looking back you all start to scramble away until you look behind you and see the tiger lady shifting around on the couch, turning over and lazily scratching her fat ass as she continues to sleep. Maria looked confused, \u201cThat didn\u2019t wake her?\u201d Kevin chimed in, a tad happy you three weren\u2019t getting hunted down by a hungry tiger, \u201cIf she could sleep through that she\u2019ll sleep through anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of courage, Maria approaches the tiger and presses her ear to the tiger\u2019s stomach, \u201cHugo?

Strolling out of her patrol car, instead of a human, was a voluptuous anthro fox woman. After being shoved down another fox woman\u2019s esophagus and stewing in her belly for a bit, you\u2019ve had your fill of vixens for a lifetime. Your blood froze and you stiffened up, on edge now. The fox had a smug grin on her muzzle and she was big, like really big. Like most of the other anthros she completely dwarfed you humans in size, she had tree-trunk thick thighs, seemingly a big wobbly butt jiggling behind her, a chubby belly and two watermelon-sized breasts. She was wearing an almost comedically skimpy police uniform, it looked less like an actual uniform and more like one of those \u2018sexy\u2019 Halloween costumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe teasingly giggled at you three as she stepped up to you and lazily twirled her baton, \u201cOfficer Vixy. What\u2019s your emergency?\u201d Before you could talk, Maria blurted out, \u201cThe tiger lady in that house ate my brother!\u201d Vixy raised a brow and stared at Maria with a confused look, like she was insane, \u201cUm\u2026 alright? What do you want me to do about it?\u201d Panicked, Maria started blabbering, \u201cW-what do you mean!? Go in there and tell her to barf my brother up!\u201d Vixy grinned and rolled her eyes, giggling and putting her paws over her gut, laughing like she had just been told a great joke, \u201cOh man, ok\u2026 I think I know what\u2019s going on.\u201d Maria was getting fed up with this, \u201cWhat do you mean? What\u2019s going on? You\u2019re the police! Do something! My little brother is about to get digested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixy held a paw in front of Maria\u2019s face, \u201cHold on! This is your first time in Vampyre Lane isn\u2019t it?\u201d You three nodded up at her. The fox smirked and nodded herself, \u201c\u2026 I could tell. Listen humans, if you haven\u2019t noticed yet, in Vampyre Lane\u2026 you humans are, well\u2026 special\u2026 a bit of a delicacy to be exact. I mean, what can I say, you squirm down our gullets well, you\u2019re oh-so filling, and your kind is full of healthy nutrients for us animals. To be frank, you humans are like natures perfect snack for us and-\u201c She stopped short when she noticed herself drooling and you three quivering in fear. She nervously giggled and scratched the back of her head, \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, unfortunately, it\u2019s perfectly legal for an anthro to eat a human in these parts. There\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was not taking no for an answer, she ran up to the foxes leg and started punching her, making her thick thigh jiggle about, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s not fair! You call yourself a police officer?\u201d Vixy giggled as she pulled out a pair of handcuffs and speedily slapped them onto Maria, restraining her. Vixy chuckled, licking her lips, \u201cAlright, you\u2019re coming with me young lady.\u201d Vixy gripped the cuffs and started dragging the struggling Maria towards the patrol car. You and Kevin run after her. You don\u2019t make the mistake of trying to hit her or fight her and just try to talk, \u201cPlease Ms., um\u2026 Vixy. We didn\u2019t know about any of this, we just wandered in here by accident.\u201d The fox giggled as she opened the backdoor of the car and threw Maria in, \u201cCome on, I wasn\u2019t born yesterday. All of the legends say \u2018humans go into Vampyre Lane\u2026 but humans don\u2019t come out\u2019. And don\u2019t feed me the whole \u2018we didn\u2019t know this was Vampyre Lane\u2019 schtick! The only way for you humans to even come here is by knowing the legend. Face it! You came here, you knew the risks, and now you\u2019re feeling real burnt cause one of your friends got eaten and the other\u2019s about to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeez! That was a mean way of framing it. She wasn\u2019t technically wrong. You did hear legends around school that Vampyre Lane was a place notorious for mysterious disappearances around Halloween, but you never would\u2019ve dreamt it was because the town was filled with man-eating, walking and talking animals. You would\u2019ve believed it was because of aliens or witches or actual vampires before you believed that. Feeling completely defeated you looked up at the curvy vixen, \u201cSo that\u2019s it then? This is how our Halloween ends? With our friends getting eaten?\u201d Vixy absentmindedly picked her teeth with a claw before hearing your whimpering voice, \u201cHmm? I mean, I guess so. Just be happy your friend here is going to be my snack, or else you might\u2019ve ended up on the menu.\u201d With that, Vixy used her thunderous thighs to hip-check you onto the pavement. She quickly got in her car and sped off. Now what?</span></div></div>",

Oh, what ever will I do?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wolf rounds the corner a metal bat smashes into his stomach, making him keel over, \u201cOOF!

A fat, nasty, sloppy belch rang out of his drooling muzzle, echoing in the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, all was silent, just a fat, hungry wolf and the crickets. It was almost 11:30 at night, most of the trick-or-treaters have been eaten, most anthro residents were either heading to bed or the younger set were turning up with full stomachs. Soon the gates would close on Vampyre Lane and the residents would have to wait another year until their next human feast. Although if they got lucky they\u2019d discover a few unfortunate trick-or-treaters who got locked in, they usually end up as a satisfying post-Halloween hangover breakfast. Letting out another juicy fart over you the wolf sighed, \u201cAh, another great Halloween. Guess I better head in. It was nice meeting you three\u2026 and EATING you three.

If the legends were correct, at it looks like they are, that means they\u2019re trapped here. Kevin completely broke down into tears, sobbing onto the musty bottom of the dumpster, \u201cNo, no, no, we shouldn\u2019t have come here. Now we\u2019ll never go home. We\u2019re gonna get eaten, one way or another we\u2019re gonna be nothing but food.\u201d Maria was in a similar spiral of fear and dread but could obviously keep it together a lot better than Kevin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her hand on Kevin\u2019s back, \u201cIt\u2019s ok.

Now they had the insane task of not only saving her brother from the belly of a tiger, but also saving their best friend from the butt of a wolf\u2026 if they even could still save them. Maria and Kevin soon climbed out of the dumpster and surveyed the empty, and eerily quiet neighborhood. Maria started walking down the street with Kevin following her, she muttered to herself, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing my dad was a mechanic and an electrician.

Not by a long shot. The wolf had discovered Maria and Kevin a few minutes after gassing them. He certainly was a fan of hunting his food down and gobbling it up without discrimination\u2026 but that didn\u2019t mean he was a slob, even a ravenous animal like him wouldn\u2019t eat out of a dumpster. He pulled them out and brought them into an alleyway between two houses, the only thing lighting the dark alley was the moon and a small plastic orange light on the side of one of the houses.

He bent over and grabbed their legs, dragging them back to his footpaws. The wolf moved his paws up to each of their chests and pushed down on them, pinning the squirming trick-or-treaters to the cement ground. The wolf brought his foul-smelling, grinning, drooling muzzle down to their faces. Sticky, hot wolf saliva dripped onto their faces, \u201cYou both look SO tasty.

Someone called in about some human\u2019s little brother getting gobbled and I thought there was a Consumption Party near by.\u201d Then the grizzly woman put two and two together and grinned evilly, \u201cWas it one of your siblings?\u201d Maria stepped forward, \u201cYeah. My little brother Hugo. A tiger woman ate him\u2026 in there.\u201d Maria pointed to the tiger\u2019s house and the bear looked over at the fairly inactive house with a disappointed look, \u201cNo party, huh? Crap!\u201d Confused and panicked, Maria asked, \u201cW-what\u2019s a Consumption Party? And are you gonna help or not? My brother is digesting!\u201d A smug look crossed Grizzly\u2019s muzzle, she knelt down on one knee, attempting to get closer down to your level, but the near 12-foot bear still had to crane her neck a good bit, \u201cYou\u2019re newbies here aren\u2019t ya\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou three nodded, making Grizzly\u2019s grin grow wider. She chuckled and started to explain, \u201cLook, I hate to break it to ya\u2019, but I think you\u2019re brother is going to end up as nothing but tiger butt fat! At Vampyre Lane it\u2019s legal for an anthro, like moi, to eat a human like you.\u201d Grizzly giggles as she specifically points to Maria. The girl looked absolutely heartbroken, but the stinky fat bear gleefully continued, \u201cSo unless she\u2019s a bankrobber who swallowed a rare diamond or something, I don\u2019t even have permission to enter her house.\u201d Maria lowered her head and started to cry, tears flowing from her eyes as she silently sniffled. You and Kevin put a hand on each of her shoulders, trying to comfort her. You try to cheer Maria up, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll find a way.\u201d But the fat bear woman has other plans!</span></div></div>",

If that's not the case, I'll just have to take you three to the party. All aboard.\" Grizzly announced happily as she grabbed you and Kevin by the arm. You struggled as best you could, but against a 12 foot tall bear woman it was of little use. It didn't stop you from trying though, as any effort you could make to stop yourself from getting closer to the stench radiating off her body would be worth it. You didn't have the words to describe it, but it would haunt your nightmares for some time to come. She all but lifted you off your feet and dragged both you and Kevin to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrizzly hoisted Kevin up, catching him under her arm to free up a hand to open the back door. With brutish strength she threw you into the oversized vehicle. Your scramble for the exit was interrupted by Kevin crash-landing on top of you. The back of the bear woman's car was pretty much what you'd expect from a cop car. A spartan back seat, a metal frame to stop you from climbing onto the front seats and nothing you could use to save yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please miss Grizzly, we don't want to be eaten.\" Kevin pleaded, but she didn't react. Instead she just leaned forward and pushed her rear against the car, blocking your only exit with her large butt. You and Kevin held eachother, terrified by the strange spectacle before you. She huffed and grunted before unleashing a large fart right into the back of the car. The interior of her patrol vehicle didn't smell too rosy already, but now it had become downright unbearable. Kevin's pleas devolved into coughing as you both struggled to breathe the fetid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was shaken to her very core. First she learned her brother was reduced to tiger food, then the idea that this was all legal somehow, and now this sadistic cop was going to do the same to her friends? She wiped away her tears, sorrow ticking over into blinding rage. She wouldn't let these beasts harm her friends any longer. First she would free you from Grizzly's clutches. Then she was going to march over to that overgrown cat and force her to puke up Hugo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, now that's crowd control.\" Grizzly smugly complimented her foul gas, looking back to see the two tasty humans in the back of the car gasping for fresh air. But where'd the third one gone? Her confusion didn't last long when a sharp pain echoed from her lower leg. The bear woman felt another sting as Maria was kicking her in the shins. The police officer grumbled disapprovingly, but couldn't see the culprit. Her own rotund belly was concealing the pint-sized attacker. All she could do was reach down blindly and hope for the best. Her large digits made contact and in an instant they grabbed hold of the girl that had been kicking her shins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that, you little-\" Grizzly held the struggling girl in front of her face, chastising her. But Maria cut her attacker off with a swift punch to the nose. She was immediately filled with regret when her vision swung over to the bear's looming armpit. As if her natural scent wasn't unkempt enough, the foul pits seem to be in a league of their own. Maria is pressed into the damp fur face first, the bear lowering her arm to completely entrap the girl in the swampy stench. Her struggles quickly weakened as the cruel bear forced Maria to breathe in the contaminated air. The body sticking out from her armpit shook and shuddered. Grizzly released her little prisoner before any real damage could be done, but any semblance of resistance had been thoroughly smothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the bear cop menacingly held Maria in front of her large muzzle, an unsettling toothy grin adorning her face. But with what little strength and willpower the girl had left she swung and punched the bear in the nose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! G'dammit! That's it! You get special punishment!\" She roared as she slammed the back door shut, locking you and Kevin in the back of the car. You could only watch as the bear gave Maria her horrifying punishment.</span></div></div>",

A devious, toothy grin reformed on her muzzle, \u201cNow\u2026 where was I?\u201d The thick, black lips parted in front of Maria, the bears acrid breath blasted in her face, it was even worse than her damp, furry armpits. The bear swiftly shoved Maria into her maw, easily shoving in Maria\u2019s entire upper body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her lips around Maria, only leaving Maria\u2019s kicking legs outside of her mouth. Inside the nasty mouth, the bear\u2019s tongue licked Maria all over, slapping her around the sweltering maw. Teasingly slapping her already fat gut, Officer Grizzly tilted her head back, opening her mouth slightly to accept in the rest of Maria. The girl shrieked as she slid down the bear\u2019s tongue like a slip-and-slide straight into the dark gullet.

Grizzly bumped her fist against her chest as her furry cheeks swelled up, she let out a meaty burp, BBBWWWAAUUURRRRPPPPPP!

You and Kevin quickly tag along, hoping to overwhelm your opponent in an uneven fight. She just smiled and took another blow to the gut, showing a hint of strain. The tiger was making herself look invulnerable, but those hits were slowly whittling away at her. Now you just had to make sure she didn't hit back. Those paws could probably do some damage, but with a cruel smirk she reveals an even deadlier weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Maria's next punch flying in the tiger crouched down, opening her arms wide to welcome the fighty intruder. The blow glanced of her fuzzy shoulder and your friend found herself grappled in a tight hug. \"Gotcha!\" The tiger said victoriously. Maria grumbled and hissed, but the mighty hold of the tiger woman was unrelenting. Soon her flailing began to get subdued by the ferocious squeeze put on her. But with her arms full, the tiger woman still had to contend with you and Kevin raining blows onto her waist and belly. Neither of you hit as hard as Maria, but it was beginning to get mighty annoying. The tiger put her back to a wall to stop you two from flanking her or attacking from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin grew even more enraged, seeing the evil tiger woman manhandling his friend. With a feral yell he lunged towards her, but at the last moment she stepped forward, avoiding his assault and leaving him between the wall and a rapidly approaching tiger butt. \"Too slow!\" She taunted. With a loud <i>SLAM</i> the tiger pressed her bottom against Kevin's head, mashing it into the wall. The pictures in the living room rattled from the impact. To add insult to injury the tiger unleashed a large fart, right in Kevin's face. Muffled screaming let you know he was in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was up to you now to save your friends. Maria looked ready to pass out, the tiger's grip on her never seizing for a moment. Kevin wasn't in much better shape, the tiger's foul attack leaving him squirming to push away the large butt pinning his head against the wall. On the upside, her hands were full and she couldn't move her hips without also freeing up Kevin. If ever there was a time she was vulnerable, it was now.

The tiger bent over and fell onto the ground, freeing Kevin from her bulbous butt. You could see her thick, muscular neck bulge out as Hugo was rocketed back up her throat until BBBLLUUAAWWWWGGHHHH! Bile, stomach juices, digested food and most importantly a soggy Hugo were vomited up by the tiger who keeled over afterwards, shaking in pain and clutching her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA saliva-soaked Maria rushed Hugo and embraced him in a warm hug, \u201cYou\u2019re safe.\u201d Hugo complained, \u201cBig sis, I wanna go home.\u201d Maria nodded with a big smile on her face and tears in her eyes, \u201cWe\u2019re going to, right now.\u201d All four of you froze in fear as you heard the near-feral growls of the tiger lady, now snarling at you four and perched on all-fours on the tiled floor, \u201cYou wish. No human has ever escaped Vampyre Lane. And for good reason.\u201d Feeling emboldened, you charge the tiger again and smash the bat across her head, knocking her out cold.

What about the other trick-or-treaters?\u201d Kevin whimpered, \u201cW-what about them?\u201d Maria shrugged as her eyes widened, \u201cWe can\u2019t just let them get eaten?\u201d Kevin, nearly burst into tears at this point, \u201cWe barely got away from one of those things.

You were stuck in a moral dilemma, if you were about to be eaten you\u2019d want someone to come save you or warn you\u2026 but the fear of failing and becoming an animal-monster-person\u2019s snack jolted a good deal of fearful thoughts into your head\u2026 and safety was so close, just a block or two away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you four were arguing outside, the tiger awoke and clutched her head, a small cut leaked a few drops of blood as her eyes narrowed in anger, \u201cGrrrr, I like my food a bit frisky and lively, but not like this. I\u2019ve never even had food escape from me before. What are these humans teaching their young, military combat training?\u201d Snarling and enraged the tiger limped to her telephone and dialed a number.

That oughta slow down their escape attempts. Should give ya plenty of time to get back at 'em. Go get 'em tiger.\" The mayor chuckled a little at his own pun. Before the tiger woman could protest any further he hung up. She stared at the phone in disbelief. She'd been assaulted in her own house and this was all the help she would get?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, forget it! If you want to get this done, you gotta do it your damn self...\" She growled to herself. Her head still stung and her gut was showing a large bruise even through her dense fur. But with fierce determination she looked around. The scuffle had left a few pieces of your costumes behind, which she eagerly picked up and smelled. Her big nose almost sucked the small scraps of cloth inside, but their scent was distinct. Musty, sweaty and rich with fear. She locked the door behind her and set out on her hate-fueled charge. Her only stop was the garden shed, from which she retrieved a length of rope. No more miss nice tiger for these four. She didn't just want her meal back. She was going to end the brat that dared to hit her with her own bat. The image of her hands throttling the life out of you put a smile on her face as she set off in hot pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany houses further down the street you, Kevin, Maria and Hugo were hiding in a bush. All of you had weapons, mostly tools and utensils quickly stolen from the tiger's house on the way out.

Tell the police, call the army. That's gonna put an end to this for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin liked your plan. At least the part that involved getting the hell out of this nightmare of a street. Maria grumbled a little about being able to take on the tiger woman if she hadn't caught her off guard. Ultimately she relented. Hugo didn't say a word, but quietly nodded in agreement. With your priorities straight you peek out from your hiding place. The street was empty, with the exception of a single large car slowly rolling down the street. The driver side window was open and a strange creature hung it's head out. It was too dark to recognize immediately, but when the car passed a street light you realized it was a cop car. Worse yet, you get a better look at the cop. His strange nose and large, leathery ears give you the idea that he might be a bat. Occasionally he opens his maw and lets out a soundless scream. Your eyes widen in fear and you practically drag the others out of the bush and over a fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" Maria protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a bat. He can use echolocation to see us hiding in that bush.\" You hiss back, urging your friends to keep their heads down. All four of you huddle against the wooden fence, hidden from view. Painfully slowly you hear the car roll by, the cop occasionally mumbling something to his colleague. Minutes tick by with none of you daring to peek over the fence to see if they're really gone. Finally Maria dares to look and confirms the coast is clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou skulk from house to house, terrified of every shadow. Two of you had already been in the bellies of these beasts and Maria came close to discovering what their insides looked like too. Determined to stay out of any more maws you press on. Legend has it the gate only appears during Halloween night. If you're too slow, you might end up stuck here for a year. There's no way you would last that long in a neighborhood full of animals that wanted to eat you. Things seem to be going well. Progress was steady, only occasionally interrupted by hiding from the patrol car. At the last intersection you turned the corner and you could see the gate all the way at the end of the next street. You still had a decent way to travel, but at least the end was in sight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately, there were no substantial openings, cracks between houses or alleyways on the street heading towards the gate. You\u2019d be out in the open and vulnerable, but you had plenty of time, and it was only one town block, you could probably sprint to the end of the block in a minute. As long as you kept your wits about you, you four would be fine. WEE-WOO, WEE-WOO, WEE-WOO. A blaring bright light shines from behind you, you could hear the bat officer yell from his car, \u201cHalt. You four are out past curfew. Do you know how much trouble you\u2019re in? Come here and-\u201c You shriek louder than you thought possible, \u201cRUN!\u201d Without even looking back you four run at top speed. Luckily for you, you were in a running contest with a bat and an overweight gator, as long as you kept your pace you\u2019d make it. You\u2019re practically almost there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnluckily for you, the tiger woman darted out in front of you four, a wicked grin on her muzzle, \u201cAll-aboard the Digestion Express! Momma\u2019s hungry!\u201d All four of you don\u2019t nearly have enough time to stop, you four slam into the tiger at top speed knocking all of you over onto the ground. The tiger grounded, temporarily defeating, holding her head as it seemed to be getting injured every time she ran into you little brats. But she\u2019d get her meal. To make matters worse, the tiger had fallen on top of all four of you. She may look fairly skinny, even compared to most of the other anthros here, but you could attest that she weighs a ton, three tons in total to be exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou speedily worm your way out from under her as the bat and gator start to close in. Your heart is nearly beating out of your chest. You grab Maria and Hugo and pull them out from under the tiger. You three talk in near-blabber language as you talk and scream over each other, \u201cCOME-ON-COME-ON-OH-GOD-IS-SHE-WAKING-UP-LETS-GO-LETS-GO-I-WANNA-GO-HOME-THEY\u00e2 \u20ac\u2122RE-GONNA-EAT-US-WERE-NOT-FOOD-OH-GOD-OH-GOD-NO!\u201d Once Hugo and Maria are free they run ahead and past the gates, back into the safety of the human world. You notice Kevin is still trapped under her gut, you grab his hand, starting to pull him out, but the bat grabs your hand, \u201cYou\u2019re coming with us. You just assaulted this poor lady.\u201d You yelled nearly in tears as you try to yank yourself away from the bat, \u201cShe\u2019s trying to eat me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat grimaced in disgust, \u201cYeah? Well I\u2019m about to eat you if you don\u2019t chill out little guy, now-\u201c Is this really it? Is this really how your life ends? Becoming a snack for some hungry animal? You thought you\u2019d grow up, go to college, fall in love, raise a family\u2026 but nope! You\u2019re just animal chow. It couldn\u2019t end here, you\u2019re so close. In your panicked frenzy you do the only thing you can do. You headbutt the bat\u2019s crotch. He groans in pain, clutching between his legs as he collapses. The gator tries to grab you next but you slam your fist between his legs, eliciting a high-pitched squeal as he too falls. You return your attention back to Kevin who is now waist deep in the tiger\u2019s mouth. Tears stream down his reddened cheeks as the tiger\u2019s black lips travel slowly up his body, \u201cMom! Dad! Somebody, help me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tiger noticed you staring at her in horror, her lips form a grin as she winks at you and slurps a little more of Kevin in. You grab both of Kevin\u2019s arms and start to heave, growling as you literally wrestle your friend out of the tiger woman\u2019s maw. You unknowningly plant your foot on the tiger\u2019s throat to get some leverage, the tiger gags and coughs, allowing Kevin to slip out of her mouth. Kevin was about to collapse and continue crying but you dragged him along with you. It would be no time before the tiger, bat and gator were after you two. You see Maria and Hugo cheering you on from the gate, but you could also hear the tiger growling behind you. You make the mistake of looking behind you to see the tiger sprinting after you. You try to run faster, you could hear your heart rapidly beating and feel your legs pumping like pistons. But\u2026 you make it. You both skid onto the dusty forest floor but you made it past the gate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo huge, black metal gates slam shut behind you, the tiger chasing after you face-plants against the gate, cutting her face in a few places. You four eye your defeated predator. And to think, you four could be stewing away inside her right now. Maria, wanting to gloat, approached the gate and kicked it, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. Don\u2019t mess with us.\u201d The tiger snarled and tried to claw at Maria, although she\u2019s out of reach. Snarling the tiger woman replied, standing back up on her hind legs, \u201cThis isn\u2019t over\u2026 there\u2019s always next Halloween.\u201d Kevin, in tears, blurted out, \u201cYou think we\u2019re coming back here?\u201d The tiger chuckled and winked at him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry morsel, a good predator always gets her prey.\u201d On that mysterious note, the tiger turned her back to you four and walked off into the misty night.</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t really have the time to register it while you were fighting for your lives, but you all looked pretty disheveled, with some cuts and bruises littered across your bodies, and you four smelt like a hot dumpster. Maria groaned, running her fingers through her messy, wet hair, \u201cYuck! I hope shampoo can get rid of tiger drool.\u201d Kevin was the first to leave the group, you got to his house first. He let out a few good cries with you, Maria and Hugo before heading back towards his front porch, trying to figure out what he\u2019ll tell his folks. Now it was just you, Maria and Hugo. As you walked down the now silent and dark streets of your hometown Maria spoke, \u201cT-thanks for helping save me, and my brother. I don\u2019t think we would\u2019ve survived if we didn\u2019t work together.\u201d You had to agree, working together is what saved you four back there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sunk when you three made it to Maria\u2019s house. Her parents were good friends with yours, so there was no way they weren\u2019t going to find out about this. Once inside you and Maria decided to tell them the truth, while Hugo went up to bed. Obviously, none of your parents believed you. They thought you had just went off in the woods and ran into a wolf perhaps or a raccoon, and you were just adding all of these \u2018mystical\u2019 elements to your story. Needless to say all of your parents were disappointed in you four and you were all grounded for a month. They did think it was a bit strange that you kept sticking to your guns about \u2018the Halloween town filled with man-eating animal people\u2019 months after the fact, but they brushed it off as your overactive imaginations or a game you four were playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on November 1st. in Vampyre Lane, as accustom for every Day-After-Halloween in the town everyone was off work to tend to their hangovers and bulging bellies The sun rose in the sky, and between the times of 7a.m. \u2013 8a.m. a symphony of flushing toilets could be heard all across the sleepy town. Samantha Graves, the tiger who almost ate you last night, lay in her bed, glaring up at the ceiling with some bandages across her face and head. She rolled and squeezed a ball of yarn in her paw like a stress-ball. An hour later Samantha stepped out of her house, dressed in a navy blue bathrobe and sipping vodka out of a coffee cup, trying to numb her pain. Everyone else in her town seemed way more chipper than the dour feline. Her neighbor, Emma, a 10-ton rhino from across the street strolled out in a jogging-suit that was clearly a size-too-small for her gigantic body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happily waved at the tiger, \u201cHeya Sam, Happy Halloween! Look! I even got a little decoration for next year.\u201d Emma pulled out a small human skull from inside of her house and teasingly made some mouth movements with the skull and spoke in a high-pitched voice, \u201cHelp me! Help me! I don\u2019t wanna be rhino fat! I\u2019m a little human and that means I have rights and stuff.\u201d Returning to her normal voice, the ginormous rhino cooed and grinned, poking the skull, \u201cAw, that\u2019s so cute you think that Mikey! I bet you still believe in Santa too. But just like Santa, your so-called \u2018human-rights\u2019 don\u2019t exist in a town made for anthros. You\u2019re meant to be food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had stopped paying attention to the rhino, and with a shrug and a growl, Sam skulked back into her house, opting to sleep the day away and try to forget about her humiliating failure. Deeper in the town, both the bat and gator cops who were supposed to arrest you were getting yelled at by their Mayor, Mayor Scale, a tall Komodo Dragon, equally muscular as he is chubby, who seemed to even loom over his fellow anthro citizens. \u201cSo\u2026 you let them go?\u201d The gator stammered, \u201cT-they overpowered us?\u201d A sly grin formed on Scale\u2019s snout, \u201cFour small, skinny, human trick-or-treaters overpowered two trained anthro officers?\u201d The bat and gator nervously looked at each other and returned their gaze to Scale, nodding. Scale snapped his claws at them, \u201cAlright, cool. Good to know\u2026 you\u2019re fired!\u201d The bat, watering up, whimpered, \u201cBut-\u201c Mayor Scale grimaced, \u201cF-I-R-E-D, what does that spell boys? Fired!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a year since you and your friends had gone to Vampyre Lane, and you certainly were not going back this year. As a matter of fact, the whole experience kind of soured Halloween for you four. Your parents thought it was a bit odd you were holding a Monster Movie Marathon at home with your friends when you could be out trick-or-treating but they didn\u2019t press too much into it. Your parents were off to a costume party so it would just be you, Maria, Hugo and Kevin once again. After your folks left, Maria, Kevin and Hugo soon joined you. This was going to be a much better, and more cozy Halloween. They brought their own bags of candy and snacks, and you busted out some horror movies on demand and some video games. As Maria sat on the couch next to you she smiled, \u201cMuch better than last year right?\u201d You grinned and chuckled, \u201cBeats squirming around in a fox belly.\u201d The movie started up, it was a super bloody and gory, new remake called The Creature from Blood Lagoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Vampyre Lane, as the sun was setting, the town was getting filled up with more na\u00efve trick-or-treaters. But four anthros weren\u2019t interested in their town\u2019s festivities. Standing at the town\u2019s gates were a tiger, a fox, a bat, and a gator\u2026 all four anthros had a serious bone to pick with you. Samantha turned back to face the other anthros, \u201cYou guys ready?\u201d The fox wore a look of worry on her face, \u201cI-I don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t typically go TO the human world, usually we let the humans come to us.\u201d Samantha growled and bared her teeth, \u201cYou want your prey back? Then come with me! If not, fine! Stay here, I don\u2019t really care.\u201d The tiger turned back around and marched past the gates into the human world, uncharted territory for anthro folk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three other anthros nervously marched on with her. As happy, smiling trick-or-treaters passed the anthro group, they gleefully directed them towards Vampyre Lane. Once they made it out of the woods and onto a crowded street, they gazed around and saw the crowds of humans walking around in costume. The gator\u2019s mouth watered as he licked his lips, slowly walking towards a group of trick-or-treaters and their parents. Samantha slammed a paw into his chest, \u201cHOLD IT! This is the human\u2019s playing field. If we want a nice, easy night of revenge and snacking we can\u2019t do what we\u2019d normally do at home. We need to single them out and eat them then. I suggest we get back at those four from last year first and then pick off whoever we like, deal?\u201d The other three nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four anthros walked through the crowd of humans they got various compliments for their costumes. One drunk human even smacked Samantha\u2019s butt, \u201cWow lady\u2026 yer really somethin\u2019. Big, beautiful, furry. Dig duh costume! Really lifelike and stuff\u2026\u201d The tiger giggled, \u201cOh, ya\u2019 know\u2026 spent my whole life making this thing. If you\u2019d like, I could show you what the inside looks like if we cross paths a little later.\u201d The young adult groaned, \u201cWoah, really?\u201d Samantha shrugged, \u201cSure, why not, no harm right. But I gotta date with a friend right now, so see you later sweetums.\u201d The tiger blew the drunk human a kiss as she and her group scampered off, she quickly tore a shred of cloth off his spaceman costume to make sure she could track him down if she wanted seconds. Speaking of tracking, she pulled out a few shreds of your pirate costume from her pocket. Sniffing them she quickly picked up on your location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few streets and town blocks later, the group of four anthros were standing in front of your house. The tiger grinned, \u201cHope you four little turds remembered what I said. I good predator ALWAYS gets her prey. Once I\u2019m done with you four, all that\u2019ll be left is little turds.\u201d The anthros walked up to your front porch, ringing your doorbell and putting on their best \u2018innocent child\u2019 impressions, \u201cTrick or Treat!\u201d You paused the monster movie as you got up from the couch. Maria smiled and commented, \u201cFirst hit of the night.\u201d You nodded as you pulled out the candy bowl from the kitchen. Kevin whimpered, peaking out through his eyes, \u201cHurry up, I want us to get past this scary part, and I don\u2019t wanna look.\u201d Maria rolled her eyes, \u201cKevin, you literally made it out of the jaws of a tiger monster last Halloween, and you\u2019re still scared of a fake monster on TV, even Hugo isn\u2019t as scared as you.\u201d </span></div></div>",

Your eyes were wide and your mouth hung open. You weren\u2019t necessarily scared, but angry, surprised and shocked. All four anthros from last Halloween stood at your doorstep with smug grins on their faces, muzzles and snouts. Samantha dug her paw into the bowl, \u201cOooooh, whatta we got here! ButterBars? Milky Maze? Mike-I-Likes?\u201d She pulled out a paw-full, basically half the bowl, and shoved it into her maw, noisly chewing it. Between chewing, talking with her mouthful, the tiger continued, \u201cNice variety of candy ya\u2019 got here kid, but I think you four will taste even better.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to hold back a scream you reply, \u201cH-how did you\u2026\u201d The fox who swallowed you up last Halloween interjected, \u201cGet here? The portal opens between both our worlds on Halloween. Technically humans can go into our world, and anthros can come into yours. It\u2019s just a lot easier for us to let you humans willingly come to us.\u201d The gator added, \u201cBut since you ruined our Halloween last year\u2026 we thought this year we could ruin yours.\u201d You and the fours anthros just stood there, in silence, both parties waiting for the other to react. After the tiger swallowed her candy she leered down at you, \u201cSo? You gonna run? Scream? Cry for help?\u201d It took you a minute for your brain to process all of this before grabbing the door and yelling, \u201cNope.\u201d You try to slam the door closed but Samantha shoves her foot into your doorway, stopping the door. She easily grabs the door and overpowers you, pushing the it back open and knocking you over. As the anthros enter your house and shut the door the tiger screams out, \u201cTrick or Treat, smell my feet, you\u2019ll be something good to eat!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You scramble to get on your feet, but the tiger is pushing herself forward. She's fortunate your house is quite spacious or she would really struggle to move in the narrow corridors. She still had to crouch down to fit, but that was the least of her concerns. All her attention was on the little human before her, struggling to get up and run away. She quickly pounced forward and crashed down on you. It wasn't a graceful sight, but she slumped her heavy body forward, pinning you down and drawing out a pained yelp. Immediately surprised chatter rang from the living room. The fox and the bat looked at the doorway from which the sound came and then at eachother. \"Score! They're all here.\" They whispered at eachother. Though muffled, those voices were clear as day. They tip-toed around the tiger that was laid out in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat paused, looking back to see his gator friend still struggling with the front door. He was the bulkiest of the four, and he just couldn't get his wide shoulders inside. With a resigned huff he called out to his friends. \"You go in, I'll catch any runners. And if you get all of them, save one for me.\" The bat nodded with a gleeful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to call out to your friends, to tell them to run. But the tiger had you pinned and a large paw was covering your mouth. She leaned her head in as close as possible and whispered in your ear. \"I've waited all year for this.\" Her voice was sickly sweet. But as she kept whispering her tone become increasingly spiteful and venomous. \"I've had a lot of time to imagine all the things I'm going to do to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria, Kevin and Hugo were sitting on the couch, all looking at the doorway with a bemused stare. What was all that noise about? Did the first trick-or-treater really scare their friend into screaming? They soon let out their own screams as the door opened and the fox and the bat walked into the room. Immediately Maria and Kevin bolted, running as fast as they could. Hugo was stuck, sitting like a deer in headlights as the bat leapt towards him. With a loud crash he slammed onto the couch, causing it to creak under his weight. He wrapped Hugo in his arms and showed off his needle-sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't eat me mister vampire...\" He whimpered. The bat just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a vampire. I'm far worse. A vampire just wants your blood.\" He put his fangs on the boy's neck, making him freeze in terror. \"I want all of you.\" The bat's maw opened wide and took in Hugo's whole head. Though the fox could give him a run for his money, the bat was the skinniest of the four intruders. Nevertheless he gulped down the boy with alarming speed. His stomach ballooned out, a weakly squirming bulge appearing within. The bat laid himself out on the couch, leaving the fox to chase the remaining two brats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had them cornered in the living room, smiling deviously. \"Do you two want to play a game? It's called 'get in my belly!'\" She lunged forward, but Maria and Kevin both dodged to different sides. The fox couldn't decide who to grab and just caught two big handfuls of air. The two ran as fast as they could to the front door. They had to get out of here, call the police or something. Surely the human police would be able to help them instead of trying to eat them too. But as they entered the hallway, they found the front door to be blocked. The tiger woman sat there, crushing you in a powerful one-armed bear hug as she kept you from screaming in pain with her other hand. Before the fox could catch up they ran up the stairs and to your bedroom. Hopefully the window was unlocked. They heard the fox rush up the stairs after them, cursing the tiny steps and nearly falling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maria ran through your room a stray toy car sent her scrambling to the ground. Kevin didn't stop for a second, still more concerned about your window. Even when Maria shrieked as the fox grabbed her leg and dragged her to her slavering maw he didn't stop. Someone had to survive this, and it would be him. His hands worked manically to unlock the window, turning the latch and pushing it wide open. The hinge creaked, not accustomed to such rough treatment. With at least two hungry predators between here and the front door the boy saw no other option than to jump. The fox made a token effort to grab him, but she was too busy subduing the wildly struggling Maria. With not a second to waste he jumped. His eyes widened when he saw where he was about to land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gator opened wide and braced for impact, showing off his huge, toothy maw. Kevin landed roughly on his big tongue, causing the huge jaws to snap shut like a bear trap. Mercifully none of the boy's limbs were caught on the long rows of pointy teeth. The pudgy gator immediately let out a loud gulp, pushing his squirming prey right up to his ravenous gullet. The fleshy passage opened and half of Kevin vanished in the next gulp. With almost no effort the gator swallowed his prey. He prided himself on being able to gobble up trick-or-treaters fast, but this was a record even for him. He barely got to taste the kid before it went down his wide neck and into his belly. Happily patting his squirming gut and content to have gotten a little petty revenge on the kids that got him sacked last year he stood on his toes and looked through the open first floor window. It didn't look like the fox's victim was faring much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an effort to subdue her the fox had sat down on her prey. Maria cried out in pain from the heavy beast sitting on her back. \"That's what you get for costing me my meal last year. I should've just cheated and eaten you all. But noooo, the one time I decide to play fair and you manage to beat me at my own game.\" She grumbled aloud, grinding her butt on the pinned girl. After a bit more torment she finally got off her prey and held up the girl. Maria didn't offer more than a pathetic whimper before the vixen's maw took in her feet. With every loud gulp another quarter of her body sank down that slimy passage of her through. The fox felt her neck bulge out to deal with her prey and greedily she kept swallowing more of Maria. In under a minute the last of the bulge in her neck sank down, joining her belly. She saw the gator watching and gave him a sly smile. He nodded and smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of enjoying their squirming prey the fox and the bat returned to the hallway. The tiger was still there, and so were you. She had ripped off your shirt and numerous bruises were forming on your chest from her rough treatment. You were laid on the floor before her as she put a heavy foot on your torso. When a dull pop informed her she had broken a rib she relented, listening to your pathetic whimpering. You were too exhausted to scream, worn out from the beating you'd already taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You almost done, Sam?\" The fox asked. Seeing you laying there almost made her pity you, but after last year she didn't have much mercy left in her for you and your friends. The tiger, not noticing her friends until now, looked up with a huge, toothy smile.</span></div></div>",

Oh well, it ain\u2019t Halloween if we don\u2019t end the night with a big meal.\u201d The tiger looked into Maria\u2019s eyes as she licked her face, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d Maria tried her best to shake her head but it didn\u2019t matter, as the tiger\u2019s licking gave way to her opening her muzzle extremely wide, easily wide enough to fit poor Maria in, and the some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger slams her lips down on Maria\u2019s waist, OOMPH! Now the girl\u2019s entire upper half was in the drooling tiger maw. You continued to kick and punch at the tiger, but you were but a minor annoyance to her. Your pitiful attempts to save your friend were cute to her, she let out a muffled cackled as she slurped and tasted one of your best friends. This couldn\u2019t be happening. You could see Maria feet kick about rapidly, but unfortunately she was pivoted in the tiger\u2019s mouth in a way where her feet couldn\u2019t quite reach a sensitive area like her nose or throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could also hear Maria\u2019s angry protests from in the mouth. Typical Maria, you were almost happy and proud, she was always the spunky fighter of your group which is why your neighborhood bullies never started anything with her. If you were in her shoes right now you\u2019d be wetting yourself, not insulting the person eating you. But to your horror, the tiger tilted her head back, lifting Maria\u2019s kicking legs in the air. She started gulping, sending a Maria-sized bulge down her thick neck. She slurped up the legs like noodles before one final gulp sent Maria down the tiger\u2019s esophagus. Maria landed in the tiger\u2019s belly, joining her little brother, making her big belly even larger. The tiger slapped her belly triumphantly and unleashed a rancid, sloppy belch at you. She giggled, jiggling her gut, \u201cSee? Isn\u2019t this better? You get to see your brother again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reply the tiger got was muffled yells and panicked thrashing in her gut, which only mad her more gassy. She pressed her butt even more firmly against Kevin and let out an atom bomb of a fart, it was hot, wet, and stanky! As Kevin protested the tiger laughed, \u201cSorry back there, trick-or-treaters make me gassy.\u201d The tiger grinned evilly down at you, and teasingly flailed her paws at you, \u201cSo? Got any more kung-fu moves you wanna show me kid? I could tell they\u2019re pretty affective, you couldn\u2019t even stop me from eating your friend.\u201d The tiger moves away from the wall, freeing Kevin from the grasp of her big bubble butt. He collapses onto the tiled floor, gasping for fresh air. The tiger looms over you and licks her lips, \u201cDon\u2019t worry just yet, little guy. I like to play with my food before I eat it\u2026 so how about\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Your stay on top of her belly is short lived as her startled thrashing quickly makes you three lose your balance and fall to the floor. The tiger lady heaves and slumps her head off the side of the couch and towards the floor. She grips her muzzle with a paw, glowing yellow eyes bulged as the lump in her belly starts to move up her throat. Then, it all comes out, WWHHUUUAAAUULLLLLL! Her maw opens wide and a torrent of stomach goop, tiger bile and even a quivering Hugo spew out of the tiger\u2019s muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria beams ear to ear as she runs up to her shaking little brother and wraps him in a big hug. He was covered in belly goop and smelt worse than a dumpster, but Maria didn\u2019t care. She was just glad her little brother was safe. The wash-off paint on his face had long disappeared inside the moist, insufferable heat in the tiger gut and Hugo\u2019s tiger Halloween costume was a bit tattered but aside from that he was fine. Hugo nearly burst into tears, \u201cThank you for saving me, Big Sis.\u201d Maria nearly cried as well, \u201cAnything for you, you little pest.\u201d The heart-warning reunion was cut short with a growl. The tiger had come to her senses and was now glaring at you four. Her eyes were wide and glowing, her teeth bared and snarling, and instead of standing upright the anthro tiger opted for walking on all-fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe roared at you four, making you all squeal in terror and barrel out of her house. The tiger rolled her eyes, \u201cI know I said I like fast food, but this is ridiculous.\u201d Now chasing after you on four legs, the tiger could run a much larger distance than she could upright, another advantage the hungry animal lady had on you tasty humans. You four were quickly out of the tiger\u2019s house and into the cold October night. Maria carried Hugo on her back since his short legs would only slow you all down. With your legs pumping and your chests heaving you all ran as fast as your legs could carry you. You just hoped that would somehow be enough to outrun a literal tiger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeal in terror as you could almost hear the thumping of the tiger\u2019s paws as she was gaining on you. You yell, \u201cWe\u2019re almost at the main street, near the gates.\u201d You round a corner and you three run up to the entrance, and that\u2019s when your heart sank. The gates\u2026 were closed! You nearly have a nervous breakdown as you beat against the huge, iron gates, \u201cNo! No! No! What happened?\u201d Kevin checked his watch, starting to cry, \u201cOh no. It\u2019s past midnight guys.\u201d Maria asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d Tears in his eyes, Kevin replied, \u201cIt means we can\u2019t go home. Vampyre Lane only exists during Halloween night. It\u2019s not Halloween anymore. And since this town only appears in our world during holidays\u2026 that means we\u2019re stuck here \u2018til Thanksgiving.\u201d You, Maria and Hugo all shrieked, \u201cWHAT!?\u201d Then, if that wasn\u2019t enough bad news, the tiger lady rounded the corner and starts galloping after you, \u201cDid someone say SNACKTIME!?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Kevin looked up at the fox woman with tears in his eyes, \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re going to eat me?\u201d The fox woman laughed, ruffling Kevin\u2019s hair, \u201cYou bet!\u201d Her maw opened incredibly wide and was upon a screaming Kevin in no time.

She thought she knew where the fox had hidden the bauble, but instead she'd gotten another of her friends eaten. The swollen gut of the fox woman was squirming wildly with its living contents. Her amused smile ran from ear to ear, immensely pleased with the current state of affairs. She flashed her teeth, urging Maria to make a choice already. The girl's shaky finger finally settled on the middle cup. The fox woman laughed and tipped it over, revealing nothing. Her second guess was wrong, and now it was snacktime for the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leapt forward, reaching over the booth and knocking aside the cups. Her hand wrapped around Maria's waist and pulled her off her feet. The fox woman opened wide, showing the horrified girl the huge pink maw and black abyss of her throat. But something else caught Maria's eye. The last two cups were knocked over by the fox's eager assault, revealing no bauble in either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You cheated!\" She called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fox that cheats at a game? Someone call the news.\" The fox woman responded sarcastically, her evil smile curling up high. Maria's futile struggles were quickly cut down when the large maw snapped shut around her. Pointy teeth poked her, but the fox didn't plan on chewing. She simply held the girl in place as her throat began to accept Maria's face. A loud gulp pulled the girl's entire head down the wide gullet. More gulps quickly downed her torso, pulling her legs into the wet cavern. The fox woman's eyes were bulging out, she was struggling to swallow her prey. Maria was the largest of the three morsels, but that wouldn't deter the hungry predator. One last loud <i>GULP</i> sealed the deal, reducing her prey to a squirming bulge sliding down her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox woman was panting heavily, feeling her meals struggle and squirm in her belly. She let out a loud and content BWOAAARP before grabbing a sign reading 'closed' and slapping it onto the kissing booth. She went home, rubbing her wiggling gut and smiling broadly. Today had been a good day. Her house wasn't far and she soon staggered through the front door. She grabbed a stiff drink and laid herself out on the couch, ready to get to work on her big meal. In minutes she'd dozed off, napping for hours. When she woke the fox woman hauled herself to bed, pleased to still feel the odd weak squirm coming from her bloated belly. She fell asleep almost the moment she laid herself down on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning she proudly felt her body, admiring her handiwork. Her paunch had shrunken down considerably and her butt felt bigger and fuller than ever. She let out one last huge, satisfied belch, coughing up a few scraps of your costumes. She wouldn't forget those tasty little morsels anytime soon.</span></div></div>",

All were heading towards the mother at the gate. Then, you peered back over to the gorgeous, young-looking older lady at the steps, and it was no surprise why Ben wanted to see the women closer. By presuming you assume the mid or early thirties, she had long raven black hair with a busty curve figure. The glance of her outfit was significantly more tantalizing than when you first saw her from a distance. The length of her small skirt was riding up to show her black lace panties, and her large ass sticking out the back. Of course, it wasn't your place to notify her of a dress code, with kids running around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, my aren't you three a little old to be trick or treating,\" she said to you all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we aren't! Just give us candy and will be on our way,\" Emma bluntly stated, holding out her pillowcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed the women's eyebrow twitch with angry as she kept on a friendly smile. \"Well now, I deeply apologize for upsetting you. Here have some candy for the trouble,\" she responded, reaching in the bowl, \"Whoops! Guess I ran out again.\" she told, flipping the empty bowl over. \"How's about you, young man? You seem strong? Why don't you come inside and help me get some more,\" she purred, dragging Ben by the arm in her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Emma remained silent as Ben willingly accompanied her inside. \"Lucy! Why didn't you stop her,\" Emma yelled at you standing at the doorway together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" you confusedly responded, \"Why didn't you? You're the one starting a fight with this lady.\" staring into the darkened void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get Ben and move on from here,\" Emma explained, heading inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma!\" you shouted as she disappeared into the bleakness. You weren't enjoying be left alone, so you decided to follow inside. \"Emma,\" you whispered your friend's name as the door behind you slammed shut, causing you to jump with fright. \"Emma come on! Forget Ben this place is creepy,\" you called out again, this time using an indoor voice, as the light of the candles flickered on there own. You imaged them as special effects for the house when you herd the distinct screams of Emma in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook with fear inching your way closer, as dark green lights came from the hall. On the wall, you could see a shadowy figure that flicked with the illustrations followed by some maniacal laughs. You peered into the room from the side, not to get caught. From there, you saw the witch lady facing backward in a kitchen, as green lighting shot from her fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's a treat you want girly. Well, a treat you'll get,\" the women snickered, firing more lightning as you heard Emma shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy,\" Emma squealed as she went quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dropped dead with terror as you silently moved back to escape with your life, only to manage in stepping on a loose floorboard. You nervously sweat as the witch lady came around the door. As you run for the only exit, you hear the devilish laugh behind as a bright green light grew. You let out a painful scream as it hit you're directly in the back. You let out another more severe one as a burning tingle crawled over your skin. Gradually you watched as your fairy outfit grew abundant around you as you fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke within an instant, everything was dark like when you first entered the house, and in the range, you could see the light showing. You crawled out from obscurity, and before you stood the lady standing like a giantess.  She had a wicked grin, as you peered up to her from below her skirt, somehow she had shrunk you. You were tiny, naked, and scared for your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh delightful another delicious snack to give,\" she muttered, bending over to pick you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squealed again, preparing to run, like a tiny mouse only to not get very far and be grasped by her sturdy grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I got you now my little one,\" she giggled, carrying you back in the kitchen. She dropped you down on a table. There was flour, sugar, and a whole bunch of other skyscraper-sized ingredients around you. But, all you could do was wonder what she had intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy,\" Emma called out running towards you. She, along with you, was tiny and also naked. \"What the hells going on? What did this bitch due to us and where's, Ben?\" she tearfully asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Don't worry my little ones. My new boy toy right here,\" she announced, dangling a miniature nude Ben by the leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do with us?\" Emma demanded, holding on to you for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't you see? Teen's make for some sweet candy this time of year. So I kidnap a few that come by my home, turning them into yummy treats for the kids and me.\". The two of you shook as her stomach let out a rumble of hunger. \"Mmmh, I guess the kids won't miss you, little man. I know we will be seeing each other later.\" she laughed as her mouth opened wide, and dangled poor Ben over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear Ben scream for the two of you as she dropped him her mouth. She moaned to your annoyance as sucked on him like a hard piece of candy. \"So good,\" the witch murmured as you then noticed her move her mouth to chew on him. \"You girl's want to see?\" she asked, opening her salivated mouth. Emma looked away as you saw Ben reduced to a mushy blob of gum. \"You see! He's still alive. You all don't die your immortal taffy flavored treats,\" she said swallowing Ben without care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma cried as she witnessed Ben's tiny outline slide down her throat and into her satisfied belly. \"Mmh, he was good,\" she said, licking her lips. \"I could eat another one of you. But most girls go to my thighs,\" she playfully affirmed slapping her large thick self ones. \"I just bag you two up and hand you girls out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you screamed as she tore you both apart from each other's arm. \"Ugh, they always have to cry before packaging.\" she softly said, taking out the plastic wrapping. First up was Emma, as the witch lady squished her down, and moved on to roll up a ball. She wrapped Emma up nice and neat to hand out. Then the witch seized, you dropped to your knees, begging for her to change you back. \"Silly one I can't undo a spell after I cast it on you. But my magic has funny ways of doing other unintended things,\" she explained squishing you up and packing you up to serve. You could Ben one last time from her gut yelling to be let out, as she smacked her belly to be quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch carried on packaging other teen's that had stopped by before you and your friends. When suddenly the doorbell, the witch stood pulling her skirt down enough to fix the previous show. She dumped Emma, you, and all other unknowing teen's into the bowl as she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trick or Treat,\" The kids all said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My look at all of you?

You made your way slowly up the cement pathway to the front door of the house, where Emma took the liberty of knocking on the door for you all. The door swayed open almost immediately, revealing a Seven foot tall elephant woman, dressed up in a chef costume. Your first thought is that this was one massive woman, as with her height she still managed to pack on some pounds, cementing the elephant look she was trying to give off.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Trick or treat!\" You all sang harmoniously, much to the woman's delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh my you're all so cute!\" She cried, peering down over her massive stomach, which the costume made look so lifelike. \"And you, you're dressed like a pumpkin! Oh, sorry let me introduce myself.

At least, it was supposed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>SLAM!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaped out of your chest as you heard a massive steel gate slam shut behind you. Startled beyond belief, you let out the girliest scream you can possibly muster, only to turn around and see your bratty little brother and his friends laughing at you from the other side. You stomp your foot as you calm down, adrenaline still rushing through your veins. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cAw? Did somebody close the gate?\u201d</span> Your brother almost keeled over laughing at the girly scream you had just unleashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cOoo! Maybe it was the ghooost of Vampyre Laaane!\u201d</span> One of his friends teased, waving his arms around in a \u2018ghostly\u2019 manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. <b>\u201c<i>Very funny,</i> guys,\u201d</b> you groan, trying not to give them the satisfaction of seeing you get angry. You grabbed the gate they had closed behind you, trying to push it open, only to realize it won\u2019t budge. <b>\u201cWhat? This thing\u2019s locked\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cHmm! How weird!\u201d</span> Your brother taunted, pointed at a latch on the far side of the gate. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the latch is only on one side\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\u201cWell, if you\u2019re stuck in there\u2026\u201d</span> Another of his friends said. <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re on our own from now on!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny!\u201d</b> You started rattling the gates, realizing what they were planning. <b>\u201cC\u2019mon, it\u2019s getting late!

Maybe we want to go trick-or-treating all night long!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIs that seriously what this is about?\u201d</b> You say, starting to panic. Something about \u2018Vampyre Lane\u2019 was ominous enough; being stuck there was even worse. <b>\u201cListen, we can talk about this. Compromise! Just let me out! There\u2019s\u2026 barbed wire on this thing, for goodness sake!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\u201cAww, what\u2019s the matter? Are you scared?\u201d</span> One of the young boys laughed and pointed, noticing the panic in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cY\u2019know, maybe we <i>will</i> let you out\u2026\u201d</span> Your little brother cross his arms with a smirk. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cFor a full bucket of candy!\u201d</span> The rest of his friends all laughed uproariously at his offer, and your heart sunk. Before you could respond, they were all chanting in unison, <b><span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cBucketful of candy! Bucketful of candy!\u201d</span></b> They emptied the biggest of the orange plastic buckets they had into their other bags, before tossing it over the fence. You wince as the bucket clatters loudly against the street. You tiptoed nervously over to pick the bucket up, before turning around to see the boys skipped happily back down the street. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cY\u2019better have our candy by the time we get back, or you\u2019ll be sorry!\u201d</span> <i>Mom is gonna kill me,</i> you think to yourself as you watch the kids you were supposed to be chaperoning run off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you were alone\u2026 and the silence began settling in. You clutched yourself, nervously, as you looked around. You felt like you were being watched. Halloween was supposed to be scary, of course, but something about this neighborhood was\u2026 genuinely creepy. You should\u2019ve followed your mother's advice and stuck to your own neighborhood; never should\u2019ve let your bratty brother trick you into coming here. This place, \u2018Vampyre Lane\u2019, seemed to be a fenced off stretch of woods with a crumbling road running in a straight line through the middle. Houses were dotted irregularly along the road, as you would expect, but these houses looked\u2026 ancient. If the lights weren\u2019t on inside, you would assume they were abandoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to calm yourself down. It was getting late, and the darkness was just making you paranoid. Once you met the undoubtedly nice people that lived along this road, they would surely put your fears to rest. You glanced down at your bucket, and figured you could probably fill it up with about a dozen stops. You were a little old to be trick-or-treating, but surely when you explained your situation, they would understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe houses unnerved you, somewhat, although you tried to push your fears aside. The first was <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://anokahalloween.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/06/halloween-house-decoration.png\">an average suburban house, covered in an elaborate display of halloween decorations</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://anokahalloween.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/06/halloween-house-decoration.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>. There seemed to be some kind of party happening inside; you could hear \u2018monster mash\u2019 playing faintly within. This seemed like it\u2019d be the most normal house on the street. Just a little further than that was <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.moneybugbuyshouses.com/hs-fs/hubfs/shutterstock_423804.jpg?t=1501601823369&amp;width=1130&amp;name=shutterstock_423804.jpg\">a two-story mansion that looked abandoned</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://www.moneybugbuyshouses.com/hs-fs/hubfs/shutterstock_423804.jpg?t=1501601823369&amp;width=1130&amp;name=shutterstock_423804.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>. There were no lights on inside, and the windows and roof looked busted and ruined\u2026 however, there was a sign outside assuring that the house is open to trick-or-treaters, and you thought you could even occasionally see someone looking at you from one of the windows. This skeeved you out, but the smaller house on the other side   wasn\u2019t much better. This one looked completely normal, but\u2026 something about it was extremely ominous to you. Maybe your mind was just playing tricks on you. Further down, there seemed to be some kind of small deanery covered in religious symbology  . It was similarly dark and abandoned, but something about it was oddly comforting, as it was trying to lure you inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were paralyzed with nervousness, but you couldn\u2019t wait all night. You had to make a choice. The first house was the obvious (and canon) place to start, but you could skip ahead, if you want...</span></div></div>",

At worst, you're going to see these people again! After all, nobody can disappear like this. This time, you hear another kind of footstep, softer, lighter and faster.

At least, you can say it, it was a very well done job, all these details could deceive anyone who could think she was a real monster...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe host led you in a living room near the entrance.

You give a quick look around to check if there is no dangers in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is nothing, it's just a simple bedroom with obviously a bed, some bookshelves, a desk and a closet.<br>\r\nRecovering your calm, you thought it was nothing or once again, your imagination but at the moment you were about to leave the room, something on the desk catch your eyes... something looking like a picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move slowly to the desk, steps after steps, you approach. You took the photo in your hands and saw an astonished scene...<br>\r\nThe wolf girl was on it with still her costume and surrounded by other people wearing several different but similar costumes in matter of details. But you are even more shocked when you realized that another photo nearby show other peoples... wearing these costumes as well... What was the secret about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled a few drawers... and more photo and this time, even more surprising... a photo of the girl when she was a child...<br>\r\nStill the same tail, same eyes, same hairs, same fangs but smaller... What was the point with all of this? Are these costumes special? Or maybe... No It cannot be possible... These people are not wearing costumes at all, this is their real body. Something that would explain everything about the behavior of your host...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre they some kind of creatures hiding there? But what is the point if they are doing anything to convince you to join them? What are their plans? And moreover, since the rumors are starting to be confirmed... what happened to those who lost their way in Vampyre Lane?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not time anymore to think, you have to flee. You have to escape and warn your brother, no matter if you have to mutilate yourself with the barbed-wire, this is not a place for you... But at the moment you closed the drawers in fear, you hear a sound coming from the closet... like if something was inside.<br>\r\nYou moved slowly to it... you put your hand on the handle, ready to unlock and open the door... You take a deep breath and open it quickly. A corpse has fallen... and he was still alive. An eight-year-old boy tied up with tape on his mouth. <br>\r\nIt was definitely worse than you thought!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked and spooked but you quickly tried to calm the boy down, thinking about the consequences if the wolf come back. <b>\"Hush, hush, lad... I'm here, It's over... It's over... Calm down.. It's going to be okay...\"</b><br>\r\nRelaxing the boy was hard but you had to do your best even if you can bet this one had some bad times... At the moment you freed him, he said : <span class=\"cgreen\">\"They wolfed them all... all of them... She kept me for the final...\"</span><br>\r\n<b>\"-Calm down.. I'm here now...\"</b> You said while giving him a hug to help him to calm down... <b>\"Listen, I know you get through a terrible nightmare, but we are still not saved. We will try to get out of here, but you need to trust me and above all, keep calm... Okay?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child nodded. <b>\"Fine, I'm going forward and you'll follow me.\"</b><br>\r\nYou had absolutely no idea how to get out... but the bum you think you've met told you about some statue... If it wasn't an illusion, there should be something useful there. You hoped to find out something like a weapon, or something to defend yourself until you reach the exit. For sure, you two have to leave in a way or another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor sure, the chances she had candies were finally low... and she certainly had other plans in mind... Maybe some poison or something similar to knock you out? You don't want to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now going down, always giving signs to the kid when he can follow.<br>\r\nOnce you reach the dining hall, problems were incoming... You saw an handle turning.<br>\r\nYou had the time to quickly move your arms to order the child to hide, and facing the incoming person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Ho! You're there! hehe...\"</b> you stepped backward while talking <b>\"You were long, I feared that... I dunno, you fell on the stairs or things like that! You know, there are many accident in dark night...ha-ha...\"</b> You spoke with a forced smile, having hard time to speak straight. You do your best to hide it but deep inside, you are afraid of her. Now you know what she is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\"No worries\"</span> she said <span class=\"cgrey\">\"I just had to open crates, I have just a few candies actually, here, take it!\"</span> she presents you a small bag of candies with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Err... thank you!\"</b> You grabbed with an hesitating hand the bag, sliding it into your pocket. <b>\"Well... It was all fun and all... but I need more candies to calm down my brother... and the night is short.. looked at the time! Ten minutes past already... It's time to go!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are talking to her, you keep moving backward while she unlike you, move forward. The child you saved manage to sneak being her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\"Well...if you want to go, the entrance is here!\"</span> She answers pointing at the door leading to it.<br>\r\nAt this moment, you gave a quick look above her shoulder, seeing the kid doing some gesture, warning you to don't do it, then imitating some animal, with claws... and finally, moving his hand like if it was a sandwich...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear, if you come back to the entrance, an ambush will happen and you'll get caught.<br>\r\nYou've got to think fast. Of course you could try to attack first and hope it will give some time to the boy so he could escape... but the best would have been to be both saved. What excuse or lies you could choose?</span></div></div>",

They\u2019re\u2026 not a good influence.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your sister asked you supervise her son and his friends while they went trick-or-treating, you thought it was a marvelous idea. Perhaps this would be the perfect opportunity to just wind down, forget your problems and enjoy the fun, \u2018spooky\u2019 atmosphere of Halloween. Perhaps you could vicariously relive your childhood memories of dressing up on spooky autumn nights and collecting candy with your long-lost friends. Perhaps you could even get your hands on some candy yourself. Unfortunately, your night hasn\u2019t been particularly relaxing so far. While you expected Jordan\u2019s friends to be rowdy, you didn\u2019t expect this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like you were being ripped in half trying to keep track of them all. Every time you took your eyes off one of them, they got up to something or another; be it roughhousing, tormenting poor Jordan, or even, at one point, dumping a carton of rotten eggs onto somebody\u2019s windshield. You had to waste an entire half hour of precious Halloween time resolving that one. Jordan was always such a little angel, which is why you were shocked he would keep this sort of company. As their delinquency continued, though, you were starting to piece things together. Jordan definitely didn\u2019t approve of what they were doing, but he was too meek and shy to stop them \u2014 they had somehow brainwashed him into believing they were cooler than him or whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse still, they seemed to be trying to ditch you to head to some place called Vampyre Lane, supposedly more \u2018dangerous\u2019 and \u2018real\u2019 than another other neighborhood during Halloween. Well, they could ditch you if they wanted, but you weren\u2019t about to let them bring poor Jordan along. <b>\u201cC\u2019mon. Why don\u2019t we continue trick-or-treating together \u2014 just the two of us?\u201d</b> You whispered, kneeling in front of Jordan while his friends were distracted. <b>\u201cThey haven\u2019t even let you have any candy, for goodness sake.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry, t\u00eda, but\u2026 if I don\u2019t come with them, they won\u2019t want to be my friends anymore,\u201d</span> Jordan frowned, looking guilty but persistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhy should they be your friends? They don\u2019t seem to treat you very kindly.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYeah, but they don\u2019t mean it! They\u2019re just joking around!\u201d</span> Jordan tries to explained. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI-\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cHey, dickweed! You comin\u2019 or what?\u201d</span> The oldest of the boys, Walter, interrupts. He was sort of the ringleader of the group, and was the one who constantly escalated their bullying. He tried to make himself look older than he was, with a black baseball hat and bomber jacket atop a white undershirt and jeans. He even had the faintest makings of a \u2018stache, a fact he frequently boasted about. When he saw you kneeling in front of Jordan, holding your nephew\u2019s shoulder reassuringly, his face twisted into that familiar, unbearably smug grin.  <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cAww. What\u2019s the matter? You need your precious aunt to take care of you?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cN-no, I\u2019m coming!\u201d</span> Jordan insists, pushing your arm away and rushing back to his friends. Walter gives you a mean look before he turns away, leading the group towards the so-called Vampyre Lane. He was the one who egged that car when you had glanced away for only a moment; you shudder to think what he would get up to when left to his own devices. You follow stubbornly along behind them as they tread through the forest towards the \u2018lane\u2019, although you knew they were going to manage to slip away any second now. You\u2019ve already called each of their parents at least once by now, and none of them care. Boys will be boys, they all say. You were going to have to take care of these delinquents all on your own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong their ranks was <span class=\"corange\">Travis</span>, Walter\u2019s younger brother and lap dog, who tries his best to get into his sibling\u2019s good graces, and continually fails. There was <span class=\"clblue\">Daniel</span>, batter for the local junior baseball team and second-in-command of the group. Finally, there was <span class=\"cred\">Doug</span>, who continually got into fights at school and loved to roughhouse \u2018til somebody\u2019s bleeding. While Jordan was dressed in an adorable werewolf costume, the rest of his friends weren\u2019t dressed up in costumes whatsoever; they were too <i>mature</i> for such a thing, of course. They just cared about the candy and the pranks \u2014 the <i>tricks</i> and the <i>treats</i>, you suppose, were the essence of Halloween.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you grew bored. Was Vampyre Lane a real place? Were they actually going anywhere, or were they just wasting time? As you followed them down the forested path, your eyes eventually drifted up to the moon. It was a full moon tonight. Fittingly spooky for Halloween. You chuckled at the thought\u2026 but continued staring at it. There was something\u2026 enchanting about the full moon tonight. It absorbed your focus completely, and soon you could hardly take your eyes off it\u2026 at least until you heard bushes swaying all around you. You turned back to the group, only to find that they had disappeared! You hear movement in the bushes as they ran off, as well as Walter\u2019s unbearably smug laughter. They had ditched you! <b>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</b> You groaned. You knew they\u2019d try this, but you were hoping you\u2019d be able to catch \u2018em. They were smarter than you gave them credit for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huffed as you started walking back through the forest. Let \u2018em leave \u2014 who cares? If they get up to any trouble now, you weren\u2019t going to be around to bail them out. They weren\u2019t your responsibility anymore. You felt bad for Jordan, but\u2026 he needed to learn his lesson, too. You were so wrapped up thinking about your hatred for Jordan\u2019s friends that it took you a few minutes to realize you had no idea where you were going. They had just stranded you in the middle of the woods! The forest here was huge; you could be lost all night! You bury your face in the hands, to muffle the sound of you screaming in anger and frustration. You didn\u2019t care what Jordan said \u2014 next time you saw those boys, you\u2019d be giving them a piece of your mind! And you\u2019d be making sure they couldn\u2019t bully your poor nephew any longer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to compose yourself. All you had to do was pick a direction and stick to it. You\u2019d only been walking for 15 minutes; it couldn\u2019t be that hard to find your way back. Your plan seems promising at first, but you eventually realize that, in the darkness, you couldn\u2019t tell if you were travelling in the same direction or not. Your surroundings all blended into itself. It didn\u2019t help that there was something genuinely creepy about travelling through these woods so late at night on Halloween. You shivered a bit, clutching yourself as you venture deeper and deeper into the unknown\u2026 until you hear a howl in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood runs cold. A wolf\u2019s howl. That\u2019s how they communicate with eachother in the wilderness. That must mean there\u2019s a pack nearby. Were they out hunting for something? You knew wolves didn\u2019t usually attack humans, but if they were starving, you would seem like an all-you-can-eat buffet. You try your best to stay calm as you walk at a gradually increasing pace, panic rising in your chest. You hear a second howl  \u2014 sounding like it was much closer this time  \u2014 and before you knew it, you were sprinting through the woods at full speed. No matter how fast you run, you can hear the howls growing closer and closer, as if the pack was hot on your tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something huge jumps into the path in front of you. You stop dead in your tracks, staring at its silhouette in horror. The creature stood at eight feet tall, towering over you as its glowing yellow eyes pierce through the darkness. As your eyes adjust, you realize it\u2019s some kind of hulking wolf creature, standing up on two beefy legs, with thick grey fur shielding it against the cold October breeze. For a moment, it almost seems friendly, gesturing towards you as if trying to tell you that it\u2019s safe to come closer. The second you take a curious step towards it, though\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i><b>\u201cAaaaaugh!\u201d</b></i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 the monster leaps at you, and the last thing you see before you lose consciousness is its sharp fangs ready to wrap around your head\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2504\u2504\u2504</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you\u2019re unconscious, you\u2019re\u2026 transformed. You\u2019re not human. Not anymore. Now, you\u2019re something else entirely. Eventually, you\u2019re awoken by the sound of someone\u2019s voice...</span></div></div>",

W-where are you?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a worried voice calling out through the forest roused you from your deep slumber, feeling yourself lying on your back on the forest floor. Your first surprise came the moment you opened your eyes; all of a sudden, you could see in the dark! The colors were much dimmer, but even in the darkness, you could discern movement with superhuman ease; you could see every single errant twitch of the tree leaves in the breeze, with crystal clarity. As you woke up more and more and sensations returned to your body, you realized everything else was similarly\u2026 off. Your sense of hearing and smell were incredible, first of all, but on the downside, your body felt wrong, somehow. Moving around felt weird, as if you were heavier now, and your joints had changed positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you felt covered, you were actually completely naked, your clothes lying in broken scraps all around you. What felt like clothing was actually a thick coat of grey fur that covered every inch of your body, wrapping around you like a wool blanket. Despite the fact you seemed heavier now, you were also much stronger; and after some confusion, you were finally able to sit up. For a moment, you thought the forest had gotten a lot smaller\u2026 until you realized you had just gotten a lot bigger! You were about 10 feet tall now, give or take, about twice your original size! You were afraid you might have sustained some brain damage. The reality was much more alarming. You were\u2026 some sort of creature! A werewolf, similar to how you\u2019d always imagined one, though with some\u2026 unexpected features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally managed to stand up shakily without falling over, and pause for a moment, exploring your new body. In addition to your increased size, your body was just disproportionately more voluptuous now, with breasts each about as large as your human form\u2019s entire head was, thighs so thick you could crush a man\u2019s skull between them, and a belly so  pudgy someone could use it as a water bed. Despite your unbalanced increases in size, you were still able to balance yourself easily with your immense strength, though walking was a little difficult at first. You look behind you, noticing you had a long big, fluffy tail partially covering your rounded butt, which wagged involuntarily whenever you were excited. You also noticed your hands now had soft paw pads, and long, sharp claws. Finally, you run your new paws over your face, realizing you now had a long snout with sharp fangs, and big, fluffy ears peeking out of the top of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so overwhelmed by these new sensations and emotions, you didn\u2019t quite know how to feel. Quickly, a single sensation dominated your mind\u2026 hunger. You had already been feeling a little peckish, but apparently, as your belly grew in size, so did your appetite. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever felt this hungry in your life! You were wondering how you could possibly stop by a restaurant in this state\u2026 until you heard that voice again, reminding you that there was someone nearby. Surely enough, you saw movement in the distance with your peripheral vision, and immediately ducked into the bushes just moments before he otherwise would\u2019ve spotted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being such a huge, lumbering beast, you were able to become completely silent as you peeked at him from the dark. With your innate night vision, you could clearly see Travis pointing around a flashlight as he trudged through the forest. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cC\u2019mon, guys, this isn\u2019t funny!\u201d</span> He calls nervously, trying to find his friends. Apparently, they ditched him too. You got the feeling they didn\u2019t like him that much. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cCome back! I-I don\u2019t want to get lost out here!\u201d</span> You felt a pang of sympathy for him\u2026 as well as a pang of hunger. As you realized he was in the perfect position for you to pounce, you ran through a furious internal debate in your head, trying to judge how you should treat this situation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour human morals and ideals have, for the most part, faded away, replaced with an instinctive sense of survival of the fittest. Travis no longer looked like just another one of Jordan\u2019s annoying friends; he looked like delicious prey, vulnerable and separated from its pack. Your increased size called for larger meals, and he definitely fit the bill. Even your human side partially wanted to get the ultimate form of revenge on him for all the times he\u2019s tormented poor Jordan. On the other hand\u2026 you couldn\u2019t just devour a human being, could you? Even though you were a werewolf, people still can\u2019t be treated like food! No matter how satisfying the idea seemed to you on a primitive level, you knew, on a rational level, that it wasn\u2019t the right thing to do. You should just wait for him to pass\u2026 or even ask him for help! Surely, he\u2019d understand\u2026 right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these options run through your mind in less than a second. It\u2019s not longer before you have to make your final decision...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You licked your lips involuntarily as you stared at Travis from the bushes. Even though your rational mind insisted it was wrong, every inch of your new body was telling you that it was only natural for wolves to prey upon the weak. Besides, it can\u2019t be considered cannibalism \u2014 you\u2019re not human anymore! You\u2019re something different, now. Something more powerful. Something higher on the food chain. Indeed, it would only be the natural way of things for you to just gobble him up. Survival of the fittest; he obviously wasn\u2019t fit enough to survive on his own in the wilderness, so he could at least make himself useful as a tasty treat for an actual, competent survivalist. Indeed, thinking of all the things he\u2019s done to poor Jordan, this was just karma, right? You\u2019ve wanted to get rid of the annoying brat all Halloween\u2026 and now you finally had the perfect opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body seemed to move on its own accord, as your instincts led you to assume the perfect position to pounce. You had abandoned all planning or higher thinking, instead relying solely on your wits. You could feel tension rising in your chest as the time to pounce approached, your animal instincts predicting his every movement with almost supernatural clairvoyance. Eventually, he was in range for a pounce, and turned away from you, pointing his flashlight idly into the distance. Your body screamed at you that the perfect time to act was now. There was no turning back at this point\u2026 so, with a terrifying growl, you let your muscular hind legs propel you through the air, as you leaped towards him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around far too late; he only caught a moment\u2019s glimpse of your huge form as you flew towards him, before he found himself pinned to the ground. He froze up like a deer in headlights as you pinned his shoulders against the ground with your powerful paws, staring at the creature on top of him in a mix of awe and terror. He was too shocked to even scream. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cW-what are-\u201d</span> He was about to ask, but was interrupted when you sent your long, canine tongue gliding over his face, getting a feel for a human\u2019s flavor. While Travis coughed, his face now covered in saliva, an idea occurs to you. You originally expected to be devouring your meal\u2026 messily, but after hearing your belly gurgle once again, your instincts give you another idea. Maybe\u2026 you could really fill your belly, after all. Your maw was huge, after all, and you were like twice his size. Would such a thing even be possible? Only one way to find out\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lick over his face for a while, savoring the unexpected flavor of human, and for a moment Travis believed that the huge wolf-creature atop him was just curious, and meant no harm. This optimist delusion ended the moment you wrapped your jaws around his face, immediately wrapping your tongue around his head, pulling it into your waiting maw. You giggled a bit, his hair unexpectedly tickling the top of your mouth, as you quickly press his forehead against the back of your maw before he could even register what was happening. By the time Travis finally called out, his voice was too muffled by your throat for anyone to possibly hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour throat stretched around his wide shoulders with similar ease, as if you had been biologically designed to devour your prey in such a fashion. For you, there was nothing even remotely uncomfortable about the seemingly difficult process; in fact, it felt natural. Despite the fact that your Halloween \u2018treat\u2019 was currently squirming and struggling with all its might beneath you, you felt like you could just take your time and savor this new experience. Despite your mouth being stretched beyond all belief, you managed to smile a little. You imagined just how happy Jordan might be once he learned you got rid of one of those bullies. Sure, he seems to like them for some reason\u2026 but once you explain the situation, he\u2019ll surely realize Travis is better belly fat then he is a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if Jordan did find out what happened here, he would freak out, as anyone would. But that possibility didn\u2019t even strike you, your new species making you so far removed from basic human empathy. You couldn\u2019t see how anyone could possibly find fault with what you were doing, even as you were in the middle of shoving an entire, wriggling human down your esophagus like a savage beast. The only moral code you followed now was the code of the wild \u2014 and as you committed acts most humans would find abhorrent, you felt like you were ascending humanity, and becoming one with nature, your true home. Your body accepted your huge meal readily, and you knew this was what mother nature intended for you. You didn\u2019t want to sit around savoring the moment any longer, though. You were eager beyond belief to have Travis curled up in your belly completely\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was into his elbows, now, and his arms were pinned against his sides, leaving him to kicking futilely. You lifted him up into the air, although you remained on all fours, letting your stretchy throat wrap around him like a snake. It was surprisingly fun to slurp a whole human up like a noodle. You could still breathe just fine even with this huge obstruction in your throat, making your meal even more comfortable. That\u2019s what this felt like to you, really; a meal, just like any other. A particularly squirmy meal, perhaps, but more than tasty enough to make up for that, and fun to eat! You almost made a game out of taking another gulp when Travis least expected it, pulling him deeper just when he thought he was making progress on his escape. Your throat was almost like a hammock for your prey, the bulge swinging back and forth beneath you as he wriggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, he up to his knees in your throat, and with a contented snort, you finally felt comfortable standing up on two feet. Standing flipped poor Travis upside down, disorienting his escape attempts; it was also a lot easier to swallow from this angle, too, as gravity assisted with his descent down your throat. These two factors considered, it wasn\u2019t much longer before only his feet remained, wriggling on your tongue as you finally closed your sore jaws. You let him linger there, enjoying the feeling of a lively meal in your throat while it lasted, before finally leaning your head back and taking one big, final swallow. The bully that had so tormented you and your nephew quickly disappeared into your stomach completely, bulging your belly out significantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second your throat was cleared, you looked down at your gut with delight, feeling almost ready to scream with excitement. It was so wonderfully big and round now, and growled with satisfaction as it was finally filled up with a meal. You could feel every move he made in there, and giggled as he wriggled around, imaging your body as a makeshift prison for your captive. You sat down, leaning against a tree as you rubbed all over your belly excitedly with your huge paws, the skin pleasantly sensitive now that it\u2019s so stretched out. This was definitely one of the most fun and pleasant sensations you\u2019d ever experienced. It was almost\u2026 maternal, in a morbid way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had crossed the moral event horizon, and realized it didn\u2019t really feel all that bad being on the other side. It was actually kind of\u2026 exciting. Like you could do whatever you wanted, and nothing could get in your way, not even basic ethics. You had once felt so powerless in society, and now, your will was absolute. The people who used to have authority over you could now just be churned up into fat at your leisure. Your boss, your ex, your landlord\u2026 all of them were defenseless against you now. Like you said, you were the new top of the food chain, and anybody\u2019s right to life was now up to your judgement. This is the way things were meant to be \u2014 powerful predators asserting their will over helpless prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of fat, you were beaming with excitement at the new layer of pudge your meal would undoubtedly bring you. Travis was pretty scrawny, so you doubt he\u2019d add much to your figure, but surely you\u2019ll have many more \u2018meals\u2019 like this in the future. As you sit there, you fantasize about devouring every single human in the small little neighborhood you came from, filling your belly up to the brim. Multiple whole, living people converted into nothing but fat on your new, perfect body\u2026 what a thought! In fact, why not start now? You realized that your belly wasn\u2019t even nearly full yet. Sure, Travis made an impressive bulge in your gut, but you\u2019re sure you could make it that bulge an order of magnitude larger until you were finally, unarguably <i>full</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact\u2026 those other bullies would be the perfect candidates. They\u2019d be much more useful as pudge, anyway, and surely Jordan would applaud you for taking care of his fake \u2018friends\u2019 so efficiently. He might even give you a nice, relaxing bellyrub while your big meal gurgled away. Indeed, even when your belly was filled with an entire human, your gluttony still made you hungry for more. You felt light-headed at the thought of having all four of them locked away in there like your prisoners, stretching your stomach to its absolute limit. Your ears perked up as you listened attentively, and sure enough, you could hear them far in the distance, all stomping loudly through the forest and yelling at eachother, making themselves far too easy to track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvercome by excitement for the hunt, you lean back and howl into the cool night, the full moon watching over you like a guardian angel. With its guidance, you run off towards one of the noises in the distance, ready to devour your target no matter who they turned out to be. Eventually, you recognized their voice yelling in the distance...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was it! This was the night. You\u2019d finally be able to pull off the pranking spree you\u2019ve been planning for months. People at school tend to call you a lot of things: class clown, a prankster, not funny. You certainly were a bit of a goof ball. You carved out quite the reputation for yourself at school as a troublemaker and a jokester. You remember last year when you glued your teacher\u2019s seat, getting her butt trapped in it when she sat down. Or when you let out the biology lab\u2019s snake, Leonard, into the halls. You even recall your very first prank, when you replaced your teacher\u2019s lipstick with a stick of Elmer\u2019s glue that left you out of school for a week. You may not be the most popular in school but you certainly had your group of friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight, you would pull some crazy pranks in the notorious Vampyre Lane. Everyone said it was haunted, or from another dimension, and that anyone who stayed there after midnight was trapped in there forever. Of course you didn\u2019t believe those stories. That\u2019s impossible. Vampyre Lane was just a gated community for rich people who wanted to be left alone, so it was clear why the neighborhood was off the beaten path in the local woods and very few people ventured there. You made sure that all your supplies were ready. You had your handy-dandy slingshot, some fresh eggs from the local supermarket, some old fish wrapped in newspaper, dozens of toilet paper rolls, whipped cream, and then some. You were set and well equipped for your night of debauchery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled out your ninja costume your mom bought. You told her you really wanted to be a ninja this year because you really liked Kung-Fu movies. In reality, the entirely black fabricated costume would blend perfectly into the darkness of the October night. No one would be able to spot you. You just had to be smart and quick on your feet. You left your house as the sun started to set with a trick-or-treat bag in hand. Although, the bag was already filled with all your supplies. You ran down your street and towards the local park, there you met up with your friends, Tori, Blake and Priscilla. They\u2019ve been your best friends since you could remember. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were all dressed up for Halloween. Your plan was to cause some mischief in Vampyre Lane and then go back to your own neighborhood later that night for the real trick-or-treating. Tori was a bit of a tomboy and enjoyed roughhousing with you and Blake since you first met. There were actually a couple times she\u2019d tackle one of you in football. Tori was dressed as a black cat. Blake was a bit of a nerd; he was incredibly smart but had his own weird sense of humor and mischief to him as well. You two met at a trading card tournament and have been good friends since. Blake was dressed as an army soldier, hoping the costume would blend in with the bushes. Finally, Priscilla was a born prankster herself, she was kicked out of her old school for hiding the school\u2019s lab mice in her principal\u2019s desk. Ever since she was transferred to your school you\u2019ve become good friends. Priscilla was dressed as a swamp monster, her green and sickly brown face paint would vanish in the dark woods without a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached the three with a grin, \u201c<b>So, everyone have their supplies</b>?\u201d Everyone held up their own trick-or-treat bags, obviously filled with pranking materials. You nodded, \u201c<b>Great. Let\u2019s go then. Show these rich folks that Halloween isn't all about the treats</b>.\u201d The sun was just barely visible as you four trudged through the local woods. The big orange ball slowly descended behind the horizon, turning the sky a dark blue as stars became visible. Just as it started to get dark out you came upon Vampyre Lane. A huge, black, metal fence surrounded the community and seemed to go on forever on both sides. The fence stood at an imposing ten feet with barbed wire and spikes decorating the top. Written in cursive on the open gates was \u2018Vampyre Lane\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill ran up all four of your spines, but you wouldn\u2019t let that deter you. After all, everything inside seemed much more festive. Sounds of chainsaws, ghoulish yelps, monstrous growls, spooky music and trick-or-treaters walking about came from beyond the gate. Tori was the first to march onward, \u201c<span class=\"cindigo\">Come on, scaredy cats, are we doing this or what</span>?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Priscilla and Blake all nod, \u201c<b>Yeah, let\u2019s go</b>,\u201d you say. You three follow Tori into the gated community. Once you four enter and look around you hear a creak behind you and then a metal crash, CLANG! You turn around to see the open gates had just shut themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriscilla gasped, \u201c<span class=\"corange\">What</span>?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake chuckled, \u201c<span class=\"cgreen\">They must be trying to scare us. Good trick</span>.\u201d You four take in the scenery. There were various blocks of large three-story houses with lavish lawns and expensive, sprawling decorations. These people were clearly loaded. So many blocks, so many houses. Where to begin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriscilla asked, looking around in awe, \u201c<span class=\"corange\">So\u2026 where to first</span>?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake chimed in, \u201c<span class=\"cgreen\">I say we do a full street first. Maybe don\u2019t prank every house\u2026 they might catch on\u2026 but prank a few and then move onto the next street. Make sure they don\u2019t notice us</span>.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori nodded, \u201c<span class=\"cindigo\">Good idea. So which street will it be</span>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed a few options. There was once street you noticed called Bog Street. There were large tufts of thick fog rolling down the block. It was dimly lit, with no streetlights and only the lights of the houses decorations to illuminate the street. This street looked to be the scariest. The decorations were gory and bloody, with lots of zombie and demon props. Grave stones littered lawns, robotic zombies clawed out of the ground and grunted, and projections of evil demons swooped and spun around the cobweb-covered houses. All of the lights shining out of the houses were distinctly red, giving the street an eerie glow. However, you noticed on almost every porch there were giant bowls of candy. If you were younger, this street might\u2019ve been too much for you, even now it creeps you out a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next street you saw was called Maple Street. This street had a much warmer tone to it. All of the houses were well lit, and had a nice cottage-theme to them. This block seemed to be heavily frequented by trick-or-treaters and the decorations seemed more silly than intimidating with inflatable witches, grave stones with funny names scrawled on them, and speakers playing cartoonish Halloween music and ghost sounds. However, despite being more inviting than the last street, there seemed to be less places for you four to hide when pulling your pranks. It may be too risky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final street you saw was Haunted Road. This street was set in a much more wooded area than the other two. Instead of having houses incredibly close to one another like your average suburb, the houses were spread apart from each other and had fewer decorations. These houses seemed very stripped back and only had a small slew of skimpy decorations to even insinuate that they were celebrating Halloween. The houses too, although large and extravagant, seemed a bit strange, having old Victorian designs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also noticed there was a large park straight down Maple Street that was teeming with activity. There seemed to be a large Halloween party going on in the park. That could be a cool place to stop by too. In a large crowd you could pull some pranks on the individual townspeople and then easily slip away into the crowd. Plus, they won\u2019t know what you really look like since all four of your are dressed up. You turn back to your friends, \u201c<b>So, what are we thinking guys/b}?\u201d</b></span></div></div>",
