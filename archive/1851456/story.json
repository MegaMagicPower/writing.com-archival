He lays there on his bed weighing out his decisions on what he can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why is it that I have an important job to do. demigods are thought as half gods, and that isn't true we are God's followers. Yet my father keeps trying to make my life a living hell, when I need to keep the balance between the human and the mythical realms.\"</i> Sartana thought  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartana gets up and trip over some stuff in his cluttered room Which is normal for a teenager. Sartana looks in his mirror to see his battered face yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mirror, he see's his his hair which was as black a coal, His carbon colored right eye which was as dark as the night, an eye patch over what was once his left, and lastly his scowl  which has been there for days because if him dreading the fact of him going back to yet another school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartana's father walked in baring his dagger shaped teeth pale skin and towers over Sartana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what day it is don't you?\" Sartana's Father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartana smirks and responds\"Tuesday\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give me a jackass answer boy. Because today is the day to start going to that school\" Sartana's Father replies.<br>\r\n\"and What if I don't want to?\" Sartana asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you don't, I get to take your other eye.\" Sartana's father responded. Holding up his claw to make Sartana flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said Sartana grabbed his instruments and clothes and ran to the path towards the school as fast as his legs could carry him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just you wait father I'll get back at you yet</i>. Sartana thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sartana got to the woods, he found a van stuck in the muck. It's there he sees a hippie and two dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey do you  need any help?\" Sartana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like yea, Me and my pal were trying to get to a new school.\"the hippie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You too?whats your name dude?\"Sartana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Norvle Rogers,but you can call me Shaggy\". Shaggy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like also this is my dog Scooby, and his nephew Scrappy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large great Dane and the pup walked up to them, barked and wagged their tails at him to welcomed him.</span></div></div>",

Doesn't look that bad, Sartana thought. Maybe he just judged it wrongly.<br>\r\nBut he was wrong and was in for a shock. After opening the door, he stood in front of what seemed to be the aftermath of a tornado. The wallpaper was streaming down its walls and the windows weren't exactly closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tannis...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are you sure this is my room?\" the demigod stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTannis paused in sucking her thumb to reply. \"Of course. This is the only room left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be some mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Grimwood is never wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right...\" Sartana fell into an uncomfortable silence as he paced around the room. His arm was beginning to be a bit tired. In result, he hoisted her onto his other arm. She didn't seem to mind at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like it, do you?\" Tannis asked. Sartana didn't say anything at all. She continued, \"Well, there's always the basement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This school has a basement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the catastrophies, of course. You can always live down there.\" Her innocent eyes registered a calm expression on her face, all the while sucking her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh! I think I like it up here. More light.\" Sartana inwardly sighed as he glanced around the room once more. Being a demi-god and a room-checker isn't easy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a look around, he got used to its unstable appearance. He could give it a home makeover of his own when he had the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out, he almost bumped into Miss Grimwood. \"Miss Grimwood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Sartana, it's a pleasure to see you've gotten used to the room now. Maybe you'll like it here,\" the teacher said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks pretty good,\" Sartana replied with a small smile of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope Tannis was the least of your troubles. This school isn't exactly fit for a man,\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Ms. Grimwood! She's as fine as a lamb. I'm sure this school will be right for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, we'd better take you on a tour of the school. Tannis would love to be your guide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTannis continued sucking her thumb as the three departed from his room. </span></div></div>",

It might make him feel better.

Tanis returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have never really celebrated it either but it doesn't mean we can't give it a try with some help from out experts on Christmas I mean Phanty and Elsa celebrate and they have fun and heck Sartana works for the man it's all about.

May I just add one reason why I would like to throw a party other than to spend time with the people I care about I never got invited to JC'c Birthday party so I don't have anything else to do and because my family will be at the party I have no family to spend it with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait How did your dad get invited? Tanis asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no he would only get invited if hell froze over and if Lucifer kiss my shiny demigod butt. My ancestors are also Demigods it runs in my blood which is why I have my grandads job to protect to mythical realm from harm and to bring back peace between monsters and humans.  again off topic Sartana said shaking his hand in the air to change the subject.

Sartana said pointing at the fathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fathers nodded and looked outside to see the sun would rise soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(And with this the Fathers said their goodbyes with the sun about to come up and Sartana thinks for once that things will be alright something he hasn't felt in a long time He begins to plan the next step to demigodhood and coronation to become the next king fixing his dad's mess.)</span></div></div>",

That's like having the blood of Will or thrown on to you or the Blood of Al thrown onto her.\" I mean it's bad enough to see her die from giving birth to my niece and goddaughter but to be humiliated like that  by the student body let alone by your best friend who by the way never came to find me once I calmed down from that It's because she was afraid of what I could do Winnie.\" Sartana explained shedding tears with each part hurting bad for never hearing the words sorry out of his best friend. \"Sartana I know it's hard to forgive people when they do things that hurt you but as a leader and as the good guy I know you really are you have to be the bigger man and sometimes confront your pains instead of running and give the actual reasons.

He was trying to figure out how he was gonna break the news to her about their relationship and how the others were not very supportive and somewhat jealous. He then knocked on the door and Phanty opened the door. \u201cWhy hello, Johnny. What a splendid surprise.\u201d She said. \u201cHi Phanty; listen if you have some time, we have to talk.\u201d \u201cTalk about what, Johnny?\u201d She said as she welcomed him in. \u201cIt turns out that Sibella was eavesdropping in on our conversation the other night and was upset.\u201d Phanty was furious at what he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that bat would do that to us, she\u2019s supposed to be my friend.\u201d She said aggravated. \u201cThat\u2019s not all; Winnie is also upset about our relationship and is also not happy about it.\u201d Now Phanty was starting to get concerned about what was happening. \u201cYou know Johnny, I wasn\u2019t coming onto you, I think that you\u2019re cute and I thought it was not gonna cause a riff between all of us. What are we gonna do?\u201d She asked worried. \u201cWell, we have a school dance coming up and Winnie said for me to make this all go away was so that I have to dance with Sibella.\u201d Phanty was not comfortable with this idea. \u201cJohnny, I really don\u2019t want you doing this. You said you liked me the most, remember?\u201d She asked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Phanty, but I don\u2019t have any other choice. If I don\u2019t do it, I will be killed.\u201d Now Phanty was really getting worried. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the audacity of those two. If you ask me, they are real jealous.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not their fault, Phanty; I guess this is sort of my fault. I spoke out of line the other night.\u201d He said. \u201cYou mean you never had feelings for me?\u201d She blasted out. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that, I do have feelings for you but I guess I spoke too soon.\u201d Phanty now had tears running down her face, she almost felt like she was used. Sartana put his arm around her trying to comfort her. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Phanty, I can\u2019t stand it when you cry.\u201d He said continuing to comfort her. \u201cI just can\u2019t get over what they are making you do.\u201d She said. \u201cLook, don\u2019t worry about it; hopefully, this will all be settled and we can get back to where we were.\u201d He then got up and left her room. Phanty was now looking at herself in the mirror and was hurt, but she knew Sartana was in a real pickle. If he didn\u2019t go along with this plan, he would be killed and worse of all in front of their families. She now knew that she had to go along with the plan so she could save him from certain doom. The next morning everyone got downstairs for class the class they were in today was Phys.Ed. Everyone was told to warm up with 4 laps around the school and the game of the day would be swimming everyone actually had fun for the most part however it was awkward when everyone wanted to talk with all the tension still built up. afterwards everyone hit the showers. The girls were quiet when the entered not wanting t talk to each other because of everything tat lead up to today. They started getting washed up and Sibella  learned something she was out of conditioner. \"say Phantasma could I possibly use a bit of your conditioner I am all out.\" Sibella asked. \"uh yea sure um Sibella?\" Phantasma stuttered. \"What is it Phanty?\" Sibella asked. \"What are your reasons to get with Johnny I mean I really like him too and I'm really hurting knowing that you girls are basically forcing him to dance with you for protection in return. I mean shouldn't we help him anyways no matter what?.\" \" I understand what you mean.\" Sibella returned. \" but I want to make it up to him for the last memory he had of me I don't want my best friend to hate me.\" Sibella returned crying a little. The girls hugged from forgetting about their grudge and remembering it's about helping and caring about your friends. The girls then heard a wail from the air ducts they huddle around and heard Sartana crying. \" Oh man what am I going to do they shouldn't have to protect me I'm supposed to protect them.  Dammit. My will was broken once and I just can't find the anger to face him. to make matters worse now their mad at each other they were best friends before I was here just because I am a guy and they like me I am flattered but I can't allow that friendship to break up you only find a group like that once in you lifetime and once they are gone it spark dies like my friendship did with their brothers after the last performance the surviving members quit and we have been hating each other since. Why can't they work something out I mean Sibella's still my best friend but I really like Phanty now but remembering everything that we have been together my body is telling me I still like <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSibella.The girls  were astonished hearing all this and vowed that Sartana didn't have to know about this little intervention and that they would try to work something out.</span></div></div>",

As we traveled the world, we became more popular, things changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTannis: Like what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartana: I will tell the details when your older.<br>\r\nTannis pouts for she receives that answer a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartana: We decided that we needed a break from playing gigs for awhile, so we decided to do a final tour before a vacation.<br>\r\nSartana then frowns sincerely .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartana: It was on that performance that someone assassinated your brothers for personal gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to react fast and I was only able to save Alacard Francis and Phantasmos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhantasma: How did you save him,  Nth metal it would destroy the body of a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartana: But not his core its safe next to my soul to keep him alive. If I can find a way to make a new body for him he could be revived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhantasma: That's brilliant.<br>\r\nPhantasma then laughed hysterically at the thought of having a brother.Winnie and Tannis were upset that Sartana couldn't save their brothers too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartana: Don't think I'm not going to revive Tittus and William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were perplexed on how they could revive the others<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartana: I plan on melting off the silver , and putting his fangs back in to revive William. I also plan on using these golden scarabs to revive Tittus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls then smile to know he had a plan all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartana: Now can I call the guys.?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls then agree to him getting the guys for his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the parents walk through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartana: Miss Grimwood whats going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Grimwood: you willingly told them the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartana: They had to know.Plus they took it well seeing that I plan to revive all of my friends<br>\r\nSartana then turns around to see the parents opening there arms to the girls.<br>\r\nWhile seeing a touching moment of the parents and daughters hug he sees upset faces from the parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartana Then looks to Miss Grimwood and says go ahead and make the portal<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Girls: What about Francis and Alacard<br>\r\nSartana Then looks back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartana: I don't want to put them in the middle of my fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parents look perplexed about the comment.<br>\r\nDracula, Frankenstein, and The Phantom walk over and they ask What he is talking about. Sartana looks down takes a deep breath then back up.<br>\r\nLooks at the girls. Notices how sad he looks and notices how their watching him.<br>\r\nHe thinks for a minute and flips back his hair to reveal his eye-patch.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
