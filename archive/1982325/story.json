A normal changing would leave his or her pod within a few weeks of the pod's creation, but a certain pod which was well know to the other changlings, to have been there for at least a year. The pod, was made by the leader of the Hive, Queen Chrysalis and had been quietly sitting with the other pods as time went pass. Many of the changlings wondered if the child was dead but none would touch the pod and disobey their queen since the Pod was marked as her replacement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the wait, Queen Chrysalis had another changling pod made, this one to test if her recent changlings would take longer to form. Alas, this changling emerged from his pod with a confident smile on his face in as little at a few days. From that point on he was groomed for his spot on the throne that belonged to the first pod, which waited quietly and watched the events in front of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis changling male was named Metamorphosis, and he was loved by all other changlings. As he grew in the upcoming months, the changlings saw what he truly was. He was brash and ill-tempered, adopting his mother's most unpleasant traits as his own as well as her beliefs. He hated the creatures who roamed in the daylight, being so cheerful when his own changlings were suffering to survive. In this time period, the changlings were forced to starve in order to appease the alicorn known as Celestia of the Sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this is not about Metamorphosis. And as the story went, it was only on a red moon a year later that the pod which had been laying quietly for so long finally split open and a young and small changling female crawled out into the night. The once famous podling was now nothing more than the unwanted remembrance of a failure, but Chrysalis accepted the changling as hers to grow into the weapon she needed against the world that loomed over their heads. This changling was never given a true name but was named Ceka as it was the first word she was able to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is her story, what she will face is horrible and will test her limits. Pick how you will see her story told.</span></div></div>",

From the day Chrysalis accepted Ceka as her own, Ceka was put to work like a serf in pony history. Every day she would work her tiny body with no assistance from the moon rising to the sun rising later on. Every day was a struggle for her but it was required of all changlings to aide in the survival of the hive, this was the code of a changling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the truth was that ever changling worked, except for the royality. So Chrysalis and Metamorphosis watched the others work to promote their daily lifestyle, which would feed a normal pony town for weeks. Ceka noticed this and asked why this was so to Chrysalis and Metamorphosis, but both simply got angry at her for questioning the order of the hive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only did the young hatchling work, she was also treated as one of the servants, constantly being treated like scum and never like the princess she is. Her brother Metamorphosis was the one who promoted this concept, using his sister as his personal assistant for everything he wanted. When Ceka once declined to serve him since she was tired, he slapped her and told her that she should be grateful to serve the \"purest\" of the changlings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as all stories begin, they certain grow into something more.</span></div></div>",

The Ponies of the nation have fought bravely to defend their home and have been able to hold back the Changling Empire from taking over Equestria. The Changlings have taken over two areas towards the south and captured their citizens and made them into sustanities. I do not recall how the war began but, when the princess of Equestria, Celestia, declared war on the changlings, Princess Luna's son and Celestia's alicorn nephew, Hypon Moonstone, vanished from the castle and has not been found since. Many have feared the worst, but Luna knows that her son is alive, but keeps it secret from the others, not wanting to cause chaos amongst her people and dear sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Prince Hypon, who was also the head of the royal gaurd, gone; Celestia chose to appoint one of her strongest gaurds as the head of the Equestrian Military who was named as of now Commander Blitz Lighting, a very stubborn white pegasus mare with a blue and gold mane whose pink eyes frighten most of her old guards. She has lead the Equestrian Military into battle and has defended the cities expertly,  but boasts herself stronger than the lost prince who fled from Canterlot because he did not want to go into this war and also spread the rumor that Hypon committed suicide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a watcher of what has happened, I cannot say if anything that has been true or lies, but all I can say is as the weather begins to change from summer to fall and then fall to winter, a grand storm of events shall come; the only question that needs to be answered is: will it be in the favor of the changlings who seek to conquer, or in the favor of the Equestrian nation, who seek to take back their homeland and bring back prosperity?</span></div></div>",

The changlings guards watched from thier towers and blew their horns, signaling the troops of an attack. The changling army then fluttered over the walls of the hive and began to meet the charging pony army...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went on, the endless slaughter of both kinds, pony and changling, continued and shattered all the silence of the southwestern plain. The blood of the warriors poisoned the once fertile ground and the corpses of both groups laid. The pony warriors fled before nightfall rose over the mountains far away. As they watched their opponents run away, the changlings chuckled as they saw their enemies run in fear and left the corpses untouched as a warning to the other attempts to take the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>In Canterlot, with Blitz Lightning</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud sound and shout rang through the barracks of soliders, \"Their is no words I can say that would be appropriate for this time. We have lost less than a quarter of Equestria to those scum and no kind has brought aid to our cause. The Griffens stay in their kingdom, minding their own business and we are alone in this war with only our own citizens.\" Blitz Lightning began to pace in circles around the map that laid in the center of\u00a0the room. As Blitz paced, one of Luna's top gaurds; who was named, Ranger, and one of the very few who believed their prince still trots pondered, \"If our leader wasn't one who was illtempered, we would probably be able to seek aid from the other kingdoms. It was not he who was able to gain the help from the Crystal Kingdom, it was Princesses Luna and Twilight. Our captain has done nothing but fail our people with innocent blood shed across the once fertile fields.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Back in the outskirts of Appleloosa</b><br>\r\nThe soliders carried their wounded on the backs of the buffaloes who helped aid the pony nation. </span></div></div>",

Quickly, Ceka said to her gaurds, \"Turn back and head to the hive, I have to use the restroom, I shall not be long and I will rejoin you soon.\" Knowing not to question the royalty, the guard walked down the path towards the hive. Ceka then headed towards the strange and bright light inside the forest, trying to be as quiet as possible. Ceka used the shadow of night to evade detection from any eyes the light may show. Ceka then noticed as she got closer that the light that it was a small campfire and someone either very brave or foolish was resting near the outskirts of the Changling Hive. Ceka had her small dagger if she needed to defend herself, but saw no one inside the area of light yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a small rustling and light humming as someone who was coming from the other side of where she was. Ceka saw a black hooded figure appear out of the shadow and humming ceased as he began to monolog, while heading to his stone seat near the fire. \"Where is the horse and the captain?  Where is the horn that was blowing? Where is the bright mane of a young mare flowing, and is the harp on the harpstring? Where is the springtime harvest and the tall corn that grow?\" The figure then sat down onto the stone seat and continued,  \"They have passed like the rain on the mountain and like the wind that crosses the meadow; the day have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow. How did it come to this?\" The figure then summoned a nearby wooden pipe and puffed lightly, only to gently place it down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeka recognized the voice of the figure but without a face, she couldn't put a face on this figure and she took one back step to only to hear the sound of a breaking twig. The figure then spoke again, \"If you come to kill me, it shall lead to no avail, but if you are friendly; come into the light so I can see who has approached my camp and honor you like a guest.\" Ceka did not know what to do, but after a quick glance of the camp; she did not see any weapon that the figure could use to hurt her, so she slowly stepped into the full light of the fire, not expecting what would next. Then the figure then said, \"Evening, young princess of changings, Princess Ceka, it has been many days since we last met, but that was on better terms. You must be hungry.\"</span></div></div>",

After of the events that transpired after the failed peace summit, I flew toward the snowy mountains of the west, where the first summit amongst my kind was held and searched the grand library of the Ancients, where one book talked about a hidden place where only few can enter. What was in it was not told, but I knew that it had something special about it. I fled north and entered a region near the dragon's cave and enter a cave that the book foretold. I entered into the cave and fought the beast that almost destroyed the first summit, a band of windigo spirits with all that I could muster.  I then saw a grand and wondrous sight, something no book nor legend nor tale could describe. After I defeated those spirits, a white tall alicorn stallion found me in his cave and brought me into his sanctorum. This pony did not tell me his name or his title, but he was very skilled in magic. He already knew of what I was going to say about my predicament. He trained me, cleansed me of my wounds from the spirits, and told me of what I must do to save Equestria's ponies, the Changling's, and all the other nations that live near us. And for that, he made my coat white and made look different to remind me of my mission. Even my cutie mark which was a blue shield and blue crescent moon was changed into something new and this form I must take until my mission is a success. Hypon never died, he was reborn into what you see, Ceka.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Star then got up from his stone seat and walked over to a nearby bag, revealing that his cutie mark was changed as well.

To my knowledge, you have one major hive that covers less than 2% of Equestria. Equestria holds about approximately 4 million square miles and about 10% of Equestria is tundra and has little inhabitants. However, 30% of Equestria is unmapped forest and has no city near for about 50 miles.

Hypon then stopped in the center of Ponyville and looked up at the clear midnight sky, saw the moon and cracked a little smile and said, \"The moon has risen and my mother is watching over the dreams of her subjects.\" A slight breeze was blowing through Hypon's mane a slight buzzing was heard and then Hypon added in a sigh, \"Only if we all knew peace,\" Hypon then turned around to see the face of someone we consider a rival, Prince Metamorphosis, now a fully grown changling prince, and then heard his rebuke, \"If we all knew peace, then all would be treated fairly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon then smiled at Metamorphosis and said, \"But if all were treated fairly, the Equestrian Economy would plummet and the nation would be in shambles.\" Metamorphosis then growled, \"Better a nation be in shambles than serve hypocritical leaders who offer peace and show only chaos.\" Hypon knew that Metamorphosis was trying to anger him and calmly responded by saying, \"But which is better, the false leader or a tyrant?\" Metamorphosis then snapped when he heard Hypon's final word and knew he was referring to his mother as the 'tyrant' and then charged at Hypon who kept his smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon then sidestepped against Metamorphosis's attack and then gave a swift kick to his side, causing Metamorphosis to fall over and get angrier when he got up and charged at him again, only to end up locking horns with Hypon again as Hypon added, \"You are very predictable, Meta.\" Metamorphosis then brashly grinned and then retorted, \"Were you expecting this?\" Then a small green spark from Meta's connected to Hypon's, giving Hypon a quick, but powerful shock that made him fall over into a paralytic state and then Metamorphosis then quickly said, \"You shall regret what you said,\" and gave a powerful kick to Hypon's face, knocking him out.</span></div></div>",
