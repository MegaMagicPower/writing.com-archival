It is called a Death Note, and according to it, if a person's name is written in it, they will die. You test it out...and find its power to work. You see this as a chance to rid the world of evil...but there are men out there who call you evil and will stop at nothing to stop your perfect world. Your greatest threat? A enigmatic and unseen detective who calls himself L<br>\r\n<br>\r\nL: As a child, you were found to have incredible genius and insight. You soon become the world's greatest detective, easily solving mysteries that have plaqued the world police organizations for decades. Now criminals are suddenly falling dead, and all their autospies have been declared heart attacks. But you find this strange...why would all these criminals suddenly be dying of heart attacks? You surmise what few fear...someone is passing judgement on these criminals, believing themselves to be a god. But you know they are no god...just a delusioned person who calls himself Kira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only differences with genders is how people will react to you.</span></div></div>",

Curious though, you open the book as you walk and read the instructions written down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human whose name is written in this note shall die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the cause of death is not specified, the subject will simply die of a heart attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter writing the cause of death, the details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone really has too much free time...\" you think with a sigh, as you wait for the subway train. Just then, you look up to see a TV with a news bulletin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We bring you this special report! A hospital is under siege by a mad gunman!\" shouted the anchorwoman. \"He has taken refuge into the Saint Michael's Hospital, and he has taken several workers and patients hostage. We even believe there is a pregnant woman among the hostages,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, thinking this is how the world is today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mad gunman has indentified! It is 35-year old Shawn Richards,\" said the reporter, as a picture of a bald man was shown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the Death Note and figure since its a joke, it could be good for a laugh. Besides, if the guy did suddenly die, people would be safe. You take a pen from your jacket and write down the name, Shawn Richards. You ponder as you write: should he die by a heart attack or an accident?</span></div></div>",

You promise to yourself that if you see anything strange you will help out. Suddenly, you hear a loud scream from the alleyway behind you. You run and turn into the alley to see a 7 foot tall, 300 pound bald white guy standing over a blonde, buxom beauty in a red dress. \"Help!\" she cried as the man tried to force her clothing off. \"I'M PETER VANDON, AND YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME!!!!!\" the huge man shouted. You whip out the Death Note and write \"Peter Vandon\" as fast as you can, then write, \"Will attack nearest male. Will get beaten up. Will get taken to a hospital and will die 8 days later of a heart attack.\" You think to yourself,  <i>Might as well get some brownie points with the girl</i>. Suddenly, Peter turned around. \"HEY!!!! WHAT'RE YOU LOOKING AT?!!\" and charged towards you. For 2 minutes, you and Peter fight. He can't even touch you, and you beat the crap out of him. As he collapses to the ground exactly 2 minutes later, you call an ambulance for him and he gets taken to the hospital. You walk over to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" you ask. Now that you have more time to study her, you realize she's about 5'11\" and weighs about 120 pounds. You quickly realize why the man was trying to rape her. She had DD boobs, shoulder length, straight blonde hair and dazzling blue eyes. Her ass was Jennifer Lopez size, and she was stunnigly beautiful. \"I-I-I... I'm fine.\" she says nervously. \"My name is Jason. Do you want me to call you a cab?\" you ask politely. The woman looks up at you. \"N-n-n-no need. My apartment is nearby. C-c-c-could you walk me there?\" she asks, still sobbing. \"Sure.\" you say, and pull her gently to her feet. She then clings to your arm and slowly walks north, the way you were going anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 3 minutes later, the woman had composed herself. \"Thank you so much for saving me. He said he was going to rape me and then kill me.\" she said, as you stop outside the apartment building next to yours.. \"My name is Jennifer, by the way.\" You looked at her and said, \"It was no problem. Any decent man nows he has to help a damsel in distress.\" you say, and wink. She giggled, then started nervously,\"Well, if you would like to, I'm free tomorrow night. We could see a movie together...\" You looked at her. \"Definitely. I'm always up for the movies!\" you said. She replied, \"Great! Meet me here tomrrow night at 5, 'kay?\" then winked at you and walked into her apartment building. You smile. You know you aren't too bad-looking yourself at 6'4\", 200 pounds of pure muscle, dirty blonde hair, and bright blue eyes, you were surprised that such a beautiful woman like that would want to go on a date with you. Shrugging, you turn and walk to the next building down, turn into the lobby, and go up the elevator to the top floor, the 21st. Your room was a fairly expensive penthouse that you bought with your large salary from your job as a lawyer. You set down the Death Not and pen you were using and go on your laptop and order yourself a nice digital watch. Then...</span></div></div>",

Yatsui stumbles, obviously in pain from the knife sticking out from his back. He kicks the friend who's still alive in the groin, takes the gun and shoots him in the head before collapsing to the ground dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk briskly away, Death Note under your arm, laughing to yourself quietly as you distance yourself from the \"group of hoodlums [who] kill eachother over dispute\" as the next day's paper puts it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a rush of adrenaline as you sit in your room looking over what you've written in the Death Note and think about what has happened, a sense of power showering you in bliss.
