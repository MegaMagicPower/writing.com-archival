You're standing at a gate at the airport, waiting for a flight to Miami. You don't have a ticket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're at the gate because of the watch, which isn't a watch at all, but a size displacer. You've been helping Professor Martin with it this year--your junior year, to be specific. He left for spring break two days ago, and that's when you realized that rather than heading back to your hometown for a dull break, you could use this to fly your way down for a free vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut having used it once to get through security, now you're not so sure. You flip idly through the sizes and options, wondering whether to go through with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be boarding flight 409 to Miami shortly,\" comes the voice of a stewardess, and you decide to go through with it. What the heck, you made it this far, right? Now all you have to do is decide who to sneak onto the plane with--without getting noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could shrink yourself to three inches tall, and sneak into the briefcase of a distracted businesswoman, you think. She's so distracted with her blackberry that she'll never notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you could go a bit smaller and sneak on with the family--mom, dad, bored-looking teenage girl, hyperactive boy, young girl. The teenager's purse is laying open and you could go for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr if you really wanted to be daring, you could go really small and hitch a ride on one of four pairs of flip-flops belonging to four gorgeous coeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where to?</span></div></div>",

You feel the weird sinking feeling of the device activating.  When you open your eyes, the world is once again enormous, and you quickly dash underneath the giant benches, and start heading for the briefcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the case, and look up at the nylon-covered legs of the businesswoman, and can't help but smile.  One foot swings aimlessly, leg crossed over knee.  Delightful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head for the briefcase, and wonder to yourself if she's heading home or heading off to a meeting.  It's then that you notice her carry-on bag.  You could find out if she's going or staying, you suppose.  And it might be safer than the briefcase--what if she wants notes while on the plane?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, the carry-on isn't open.  You'd have to find a way inside....</span></div></div>",

It is with trepidation that you approach, careful to remain watchful, in case to need to jump away.  No telling when she may re-cross her legs the other way, stamping her foot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time you reach it, discovering as you do so that to get inside you'll have to climb up to reach the zipper, and then somehow move that aside to allow you egress.  No problem, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho'd have thought it was so hard to climb a purse.  The material is soft and easy to grip, but also slippery.  Several times you almost fall, and all the way through you are sure that the woman will look down at any moment and spot your feeble attempts to stow away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you reach the summit.  You keep telling yourself not to look up at the giantess - it would only scare you.  Instead, you bend all the force of your will to somehow opening the bag.  To no effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're puny at this scale, with muscles that a mouse would scoff at.  A simple zipper defies you, and you feel utterly pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been here too long.  The woman's hand approaches, merely to grasp the handle, but she's sure to see you if you don't move NOW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill you abandon this project and look for an easier mule, or see if the woman is willing to be a partner in crime?</span></div></div>",

And while this woman may be hot, you're not sure that you can trust anyone to be one hundred percent helpful to a three-inch tall man.  You know that you yourself certainly wouldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you roll away from the bag as the giantess' hand firmly grasps it and effortlessly hauls the structure into the air.  Easy come, easy go.  Scuttling back underneath the chair, you look around for a better target, and ponder the need to change your size at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree inches is a safe height, but also a very noticeable one.  Should you try reactivating your watch to reduce your stature yet further?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf your dimensions aren't bothering you, then you've already seen another likely group of people that may unknowingly help you.  Clustered around a small table, laughing uproariously, a mixed group of slacker-types - male and female - are engaged in a game of cards to pass the time while they wait to board.  Their bags are pretty bulky, and are likely to have much hiding space inside them.  Of course, one need hardly mention the dangers involved with associating with them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the way is a small duty free shop, where a few people may be stocking up before their trip.

You hesitate, and the decision is made for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flight 409 to Miami is now boarding. All passengers please proceed to the gate.\" The stewardess's voice comes through the PA system, somewhat louder at your current size. You watch the businesswoman's head jerk up, and then her massive hand reaches down to pick up her purse and briefcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gape for a moment, than quickly grab the zipper pull as her hand pulls up the handle. Even so, you nearly fall off as the purse jerks into the air. You hang on desperately, experiencing a motion that feels like a super fast elevator on steroids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe businesswoman places her purse on her lap. You have a moment to catch your breath and gaze in awe at her massive torso as she sticks a few documents in her briefcase, closes it with a large SNAP and latches it. She then turns her massive gaze towards the purse to put away her blackberry and catches sight of you. Her breath catches in her throat and her mouth falls open in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...?\" she breathes out, staring. Before you can think of anything to say (how to deal with being discovered 3 inches tall not being taught in college), the purse rockets into the air again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you rise into the air, this time right up to the woman's face, she wants a better look. You get the chance to take in her face as she simply stares. She has nicely tanned, smooth (although at your size NO makeup can hide those small blemishes) skin, full red lips, blue eyes and medium length brown hair. She's only a year or so older than you are, in fact. You're musing is interrupted, however, when she whispers, almost to herself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you real?\" Her question prompts an immediate response:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am indeed, my name's Mike.\" you inform her in a fairly loud voice. She nearly jumps out of her skin in shock at your voice-and almost sends you plummeting down towards her lap- and starts talking, forming incomplete questions that you can't understand, and blasting you with her voice and breath (which is actually fairly aromatic).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally collects herself after the pained expression on your face registers. She fixes you with a stare from a large blue eye and asks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you? And why are you on my purse\" Impressed by her composure, you decide to go with honesty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her that you're a college student on break who shrunk himself down to stow a ride, and that you had thought that her purse would be a good place to stow away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips quirk at your tale, almost smiling. A number of expressions pass over her face; you can't tell what they mean. Before this can go any farther, however, the voice of the stewardess again rings out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All passengers, this if final boarding for flight 409 to Miami. All passengers please board immediately\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe businesswoman looks up again, an urgent expression on her face. She looks at you again, considering. You're a little nervous as she decides what to do, still looking at you intensely. Finally, she makes up her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand brushes past you as she reaches over and pulls the zipper of the purse partly open and places her blackberry inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, get in.\" She tells you, gathering her possessions and dealing with you in an efficient, businesslike manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to believe you're luck, and not wanting to miss this chance, you quickly climb into the purse. You barely have time to glimpse lipstick, makeup and various other items before she zips the purse all the way closed, leaving you in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there nervously as she gets up and approaches the gate, purse around her shoulder. A number of items knock into you as you tumble around the purse, giving you little time to think. The businesswoman gets through the gate and boards the plane, with you in the purse under her arm. She makes her way to her seat, stows her briefcase and...</span></div></div>",

You're clearly now on the plane itself, which is half of the plan you'd devised in order to get to Spring Break for free. The problem (or advantage, its hard to tell at the moment) is that your current host is aware of your presence and you confess to not knowing how or what she might do with you when she has the opportunity to do so. She's certainly confused, that much was clear - but whether that will turn to pity, rage or anything in between you can't say. She might be impressed at your scheme - or she might scamper it all and turn you in when you least expect it. Or worse, keep you all for herself and make you do who knows what for her cruel pleasure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne saving advantage you do have over her - she has no idea how you're able to change sizes, and if the need arises you can either grow back to full size or shrink further to aid you in a possible escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance up to where the tiniest pricks of light emerge from the small holes between the Zipper, realising that its likely that the woman above you is likely doing much the same thing as you are. All at once though you suddenly feel the bag lift, though with a care which suggests that she is concerned about your possible injury by makeup, which is somewhat encouraging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bag stops moving you realise that you're now clearly on the Businesslady's lap, the distinct difference between a floor and covered flesh just about noticeable. The zipper opens halfway, and glancing up painfully into the sudden light of the aircraft outside you see her head and eyes loom over you, spotting you quickly. They disappear, but in all of a second her smooth hand enters the bag and forms a palm, inviting you to hop on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to give the giantess some trust (if you didn't didn't get on she'd probably just pick you up, or even leave you inside, and to be honest you don't want to be stuck in this musky bag for hours) you climb onto the pink flesh of her plam, susprised at how soft her skin feels - she's clearly the manicuring type, you gather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your form on her hand it rises up out of the bag, her fingers moving up to form a barrier, which after the initial worry you realise is simply her attempting to prevent anyone else from seeing you - a smart thought, though you gather that she's in First Class and she appears to be sitting alone. You feel a little unsteady as you are brought up to her face, which has a warm smile on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you?\" She whispers, partly out of worry that speaking normally might hurt your ears, and other out of a desire to avoid being heard herself and drawing attention. \"Sorry if the journey in my handbag was a little rough, but I wasn't sure where else to put you short of embarassment.\" You realise she's probably talking about various pocket or even interior areas of her clothing, and from her looks this is a logical enough thing to say as she is extremely pretty, even in working clothes. You get the impression she's the type of woman who could wear any costume and make it look sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to introductions. You said your name was Mike? Well I'm Rebecca Summers, taking a well deserved break to Miami from my job as Assistant Director of Evenligh Ltd (which you have vaguely heard of). I have to say I'm pretty impressed at the way you've snuck onboard, not to mention that you choose me as a travelling companion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give your best smile. \"Well, I thought you needed the company, since its unfair that someone as pretty as you has to travel alone.\" You inwardly think that sucks as a reason but it seems to make Rebecca happy and you breathe a sigh of relief. You looks like you've been good to risk it by talking to her as she presently seems unlikely to rat you out. Once the intiial safety checks are done and the stewardess have passed, Rebecca finds the best place to have you for the duration of the journey is..</span></div></div>",

Plus there's no way of knowing where this girl is off to, whether or not she's staying at the same resort or not as Rebecca. You rest for a few hours and you might find that you've already departed the plane.

There's nothing wrong with your size displacer and there's no way of knowing how long till the bimbo fishes you out. So why not shrink small enough so you won't be found but still not too small to slip out? With any luck if the girl opens the bag - hopefully whilst you're on the plane still - she'll be trying to figure out where you are. In other words keeping that bag open for a good while. Maybe you can even run across her giant sized hand and up her arm until you can find somewhere secure to make a move back towards Rebecca! Of course if you're already elsewhere you'll have additional problems, though Rebecca did tell you the name of the hotel where she'd be staying - somewhere you'd definitely want to be right now, especially if you get to spend your time with your new sexy giant-sized friend - so there's a focal point you know where to head for if that's the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to go for it - there's no way you're going through that treatment again. Activating the size displacer you find the hankerchief growing around you until you estimate you've shrunk down from three inches tall to just one eighth of an inch. It's still pitch black in here bar the tiny amount of light you can gleam from the displacer when it's activated, though your eyes are adjusting enough to distern shapes amid the handbag including what you assume is lipstick and tub of sealed nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's time to play the waiting game, you figure as you sit down on the hankerchief, rubbing your shoulders to get some feeling back in them in case you have to move fast. Whilst you let yourself rest, you will yourself not to drop off - there's no way of knowing what you happen in a matter of seconds in here lest you get squished by a falling item or a wandering hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is... how long will it be before your unknowing captor searches for you in here?</span></div></div>",

Stretching your three-inch tall form out, you contemplate just lying here and resting,  Mission accomplished, right?  The rest of the flight can pass in peace, the stern eyes of her father and passing stewardesses keeping Maggie from playing with you too openly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery now and then the bag's entrance peels open to reveal a watchful eye, checking you're still there, a deep blue vision of an absent yet ever-present goddess.  You're safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sleep, to forget your original chosen carrier, and acclimate yourself to this new being who runs your life. Why ever not?  As you drift off, you hear a faint giggling, the girl taking some delight in your doll-like form curling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever much later, you wake to a log being mashed into the side of your ribs.  \"Wake up,\" Maggie whispers as she withdraws her finger.  You have moments to scramble upright before the bag flips, departure from the plane causing the girl to carry in beside her rather than in her lap.  Gigantic personal items tumble around, and you throw yourself as clear as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walking motion of the giantess keeps a low-level shudder to constantly rumble throughout your surroundings, but not enough to bring any objects crashing upon you.  Scuttling to the side, you keep yourself still and pray that this continues.  Ignorant though you are of the outside world, you can make a good guess that you have successfully completed your illegal trip through the friendly skies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClose to an hour passes before the sky parts, and Maggie's hand snatches you up, too quick for you to resist.  She lifts you before her face again, smiling.  \"So glad you made it through safely.  But like I said, it's all gonna be worth it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spins around the room with her arms outstretched, and while the whirling motion is sickening, you can get an idea of the sheer size of the room she's standing in.  To you, it's bigger than a small town, but even scaled up you'd place it as somewhere close to the entire floor of a tower building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last she stops, and through spinning eyes you can make out the luxurious upholstery about the place, a lengthy bar centrally placed, and a lake-like heated pool steaming up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour captor paces away from all of this, toward the edge of the room; it may as well be the edge of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning on the waist-high glass barrier, Maggie clutches you to her chest as she looks out across the city below, the people mere insects at this distance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always liked this view,\" she confides in you.  \"Daddy took me up here when I was young to show off, and I've always liked imaging that those people down there really are that size, really are tiny little bugs before me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more you are brought before her face, and you can see the unbridled excitement there.  \"With you, I don't have to imagine anymore!  We are gonna have sooo much fun together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strides away from the balcony, casually activating the hidden stereo system to pump some thumping pop music across the area.  This adds a dancing sway to her step, and she swings you ever more wildly.  \"This'll do!\" she announces, and you are off for another ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, she is stooping, and you view of her chest is replaced with one of her solid brown boots.  She's standing by the poolside, and you can see her other hand cupping an ashtray, in the shape of a familiar leafed plant.  She deposits you into it, and then it is placed upon the surface of the water, a simple wash of her arm sending your boat floating away toward the centre of the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone'll be here soon, so I've gotta get ready,\" Maggie tells you.  \"Sit tight, and I'll be back soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must take her some time to actually settle upon an outfit, as minutes have passed before she strolls back in, tanned skin covered only by a skimpy white bikini.  As she does come back, in what form does she find the shrunken man she left behind?</span></div></div>",

Even one of those toes could smash the life from you with but a single movement - do you really want to wake the woman up and be thought of as a bug to be crushed?  It may be endlessly amusing to Caitlyn, but would prove quickly fatal to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Caitlyn wouldn't be abandoning you, would she?  She must have planned something, to rescue you seconds before the end?  Or does she not care for you at all, seeing you as nothing but a toy to annoy her mother with, to be discarded when its time is done?  Perhaps you should rebel against her, and merely sit - still and content - upon her mother's foot until the flight is over?  It looks to be a relatively safe place, and none of the other people (or feet, as far as you can see them) sitting in this row seem particularly restless either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, the warm flesh beneath you is reminiscent of the tender embrace of Caitlyn's fist - this truly wouldn't be a bad place to sit out the trip to Spring Break...</span></div></div>",

You'd rather go to neither of them, but they had size, strength and currently control of you. Your present capture twisted to kick the girl, his barefoot abandoning a sandal on the ground. While he did it, you could tell a mischievious idea had formed.

In an instant the sweat had soaked your front through to the skin. The giant's skin felt warm and smooth to you, despite that the grooves in the skin were large enough to get a fist between them. The odor though, wasn't as positive, nor was your site with giant wads of goop lining the skin in your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could try and escape, an enormous weight came against your back, with a lot of work you turn your head to see its the boy's flip-flop. His titanic toes wiggle as he slips it into place, the half-inch tall structures nearly crushing your head. Your next sensation is of being pulled towards the flip-flop, but stuck in place along with a sensation of fast motion. The instant it passes, the crushing weight of the boy's foot comes down on you and its not even taking the force of his body, its like being pinned under a military tank. All you were saved by was the plyability of the skin and fatty flesh underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before the plane-ride, this was a little boy and everything about him was little to you. No weight, no strength, no height. Now he was just enormous and dwarfed you in every way.

The only way out though, was to get smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fought against the tight spaces and got your watch up to where it could actually be seen and began to adjust the settings. When at last it was set, you slam the button down and immediately your wold pushes out. As your shrinking, you notice that your feet feel wet, when at last your free of the foot's weight, you find your shoes and socks were snagged on something farther back. Your microscopic feet slipped out and were pulled with you, everything biological would be, but the shoes weren't a physical part of your body and didn't come with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, there you stood, so small a bug probably wouldn't even bother chasing you for a snack, might not even be able to see you for that matter.

You were certain though that you'd never seen anything bigger than this or even capable of offering up a challenge to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden series of what you can only call Kid quakes rocks the flip-flops, the mass of muscles overhead as large as any tectonic plate. You were thrown to the ground and nearly fell into what you could only call a sink hole, one of the billions of holes in the foam flip-flops, it was enormously wide and infinitely deep. You held on and eventually the quake ended. In the far off distance, you saw a pair of enormous black objects, your shoes. It was a challenge to see across these enormous holes, and often, you could not, but from the looks of things, those shoe laces dwarfed many of them as a gigantic bridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcretely this settled that even to something an inch tall, you were a speck almost too tiny to see. That spoke measures about how big this kid was. You hadn't quite escaped yet, two of his titan toes composed your world until you got out of there or he managed to throw you out. Of course, weighing less than a speck of dust, throwing you wouldn't be hard.</span></div></div>",

When at last it stops, you find yourself in a few miles deep valley stretching out of sight and appearing to curve in the distance. To your horror, you realize its a single groove of a foot-print, specifically at the toes. You can't see the flip-flop's sole from here, so there's no telling where your shoes went, not that you'd be wearing them anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, you decide to try and figure a scale of things, more or less for the hell of it. In the end, you conclude that a single milimeter is 30 miles, every inch 750 miles,  the boys foot 5000 miles and his whole body upwards of 30,000 miles, looking around 35,000 but it was hard to tell as you didn't have his exact height.  To scale that put him at almost 5 times the size of the Earth if you went only by height.

Below a huge chasm opened up and that was the last you saw before landing. Luckily, you lived through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom overhead, light beamed in, it was dim but all you could see by. It was the boy's backpack, you could see toys hundreds of miles tall, even to the smallest action figure you were a speck. Even in this nano world there was still life though. For now, you avoided the toys, sticking to the clothe, like webs and forests. There you examined all the life you saw. It was your hope that the boy was more interested in toys than whatever clothe continent you were on.</span></div></div>",

Once it dies down, you can't help but notice his feeble moustache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My instruments all appear to be wrong, telling me a bunch of crazy altitudes.

I can SEE the damn' clouds - I know just how far up we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lightning.  Could that have somehow interferred with the device when you activated it the second time in the restroom?  Instead of shrinking you down to avoid the guards, it somehow shrunk the whole jet?

We're doing nothing you say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain seems disturbed by your sudden outburst.  You presume so at least, from the way he begins massaging his facial hair.  \"Why do we need to land, son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all gone horribly wrong,\" you gasp.  \"We're in terrible danger, and it's all because of that watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's babbling now, captain.

That couldn't be good for you, at this size, a grain of sand quite easily dwarfed you and a drop of water would spell your doom. There had to be a way out, then you remembered how you got in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief glance up revealed the titans headed this way and really all over the area. The black-dirtied bottoms of the five year old's feet loomed overhead as he sat on a bench waiting on the others to be ready. They just dangled there but were mils off the ground, as if to tease your microscopic stature even further. Just a small movement from them left you surrounded in hurricane force winds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground suddenly quakes and you look up to see the teenage titan toes fill your horizon, farther up, you see they are dressed for...</span></div></div>",

In the heat outside, its the only way to go without feeling like you were walking on fire. There were flip-flops and sandals, but not everyone liked them. Either way, your intention was to stay here and grow once they left, even if it meant a bit of fiddling with the watch, something which could strand or make you smaller, not that anything here could get much bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around, there's sudden movement. The five year old just leapt forward and yanked one of his brother's socks off his feet and then began running around the room at speeds quite greater than the speed of sound. A second later, the BIG brother has tackled him to the ground, the kid's enormous body is right over you, his brother's foot a few miles off and threatening to crush you as he stands over the 'little' kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world is dropped to darkness as the sock, perhaps up to 5 miles long is dropped on you. At this size of course, the many small spaces in the weave and thread itself are too numerous and large, leaving you to fit right through them. An instant later, you lifted with the sock and get a toe-point view of the way into the shoe. Looking around at the enormous structure, you felt like this was a ride into a gigantic city, it was certainly big enough to hold a fair part of any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, you were plunged into darkness, the temperature skyrocketed and the humidity was unbearable. At last, the enormous forces of walking came in, global distances covered in a handful of steps. The question now seemed, could you escape or would you have to wait?</span></div></div>",

There was the watch, but could it work? It had never been tested this close to the user and certainly not under conditions as such the plane had suffered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurredly, you feel through the darkness to find the buttons and are overjoyed that this is a real LCD screen and it lights itself up. As your working, the G's suddenly stop and your sense of up and down is twisted until your unsure what direction is which. At last however, bright sunlight streams in as the titan gets his shoe off to take care of a small mountain of a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as your best shot. Too bad it was also the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as your about to hit the button, some huge girl skates by and catches the foot. It sends you lose of the weave your barely holding onto and onto the kids foot, bumping around on the way down.

The thing was, its easy to shrink something, but there is only a finite supply of energy with which to grow it. When the device found you could not grow the giant, it could have instead chosen to harvest energy, by shrinking. It was also possible the buttons were bumped on the way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt ends with the kid your former size and now he's just as big to you as earlier. With some very rough math, you deduce that a normal inch now stands in the hundred-thousand-mile area, making it such that an inch-tall action figure was 10 times the size of a planet to you. A kid's body would have the gravitational force to hold you and perhaps a micro-ecosystem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen-titan you were on, was now just realizing his situation looking up at his sock sitting on the boardwalk miles away where it had fallen after he dropped it while shrinking.

The problem with her is that she's unlikely to hear you with that device clamped to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat of the lemonade cart?  Under its impressive mass you can see a pair of feet in pink and white trainers, matching socks leading bare tanned legs up to shorts.  By the size, its clearly an adult, but working a lemonade stand she's probably younger than this mother and the socialite on her phone.  If you walk between the customers, you could get to the lemonade seller.  There's no risk of her wandering off any time soon, which you can't guarantee for either of the other options!</span></div></div>",

The feet of the mother are way too near to Caitlyn so you decide to stick to the original plan to use Kelly for shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously you approach Kelly's gigantic toes. Your first intention is to hide between them or under them but apart from the danger of being crushed under them it wouldn't be a hiding spot for too long because after her next step you were in the opening again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to climb them. Maybe I can slip between her toes! But...I am a little bit too big...!\"<br>\r\nWith these words you use your watch and within a few seconds your size changes to 1/4 inches. \"Now she shouldn't feel me anymore!\" you say to yourself and in a hurry you climb up her second toe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Kelly has way smaller feet than Caitlyn because of her age you manage to reach the toenail in no time. Looking up you can see that the three giantesses are still argueing but that can stop in any moment. So you run up the toe and with a manfully jump you find yourself between her second and third toe. Gently you squeeze in the gap and surprisingly it is kind of comfortable here. \"Good choice I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute the argue seems to be over because Caitlyn stomps angrily back into the bathroom and shuts the door behind her. With a great lurch the foot you are hiding on starts moving and Kelly leaves the apartment with her mom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You grunt and moan as she accelerates to a standing position, then bounces you around inside the pitch-black purse. You scream nonstop until the purse comes to a rest, but she doesn't seem to notice.

If you don't go now, she'll become more restless before long and your chance will be gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you're not tied to this girl; if the stewardess is bringing food down the aisle then any other one of the individuals on the flight will be just as capable of providing you with sustenance.

Those behemoths could react at a second's notice, smashing into or onto you with enough force to kill you.

So, if you walk along this immense leg, you should be able to reach the edge of the tray, and from there pull yourself up on top of it.  Hopefully she'll be too fixated on her meal to notice you pinching tiny amounts of it for yourself.  You will be taking <i>full</i> advantage of the free in-flight meal while you're here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl fidgets only a small amount as you walk along her, but even that is enough to make you drop and cling tight to her dark trousers - her merest motion is enough to throw you back to the floor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even with the occasional quake, you reach a point whereby you can hook your fingers over the tray's edge and - with a grunt of effort - pull yourself even higher.  At normal size, you'd never be able to heft your whole bodyweight up by your fingers like this, but at your reduced scale it's childsplay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out across the field of food, a form of ready meal with each type of food - the meat, the vegetables, the gravies - compartmentalised in a plastic receptacle like the foundations of a house.  The clear wrap covering them has been torn clear, and steaming pools the size of jacuzzis lie before you, heat and an incredible, amplified aroma wafting clear.  Sure, the food is probably quite cheap and lacking in nutrition, but to you it's the food of the gods!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd one of those gods makes her presence known immediately, her massive hand swooping down from above, spearing into the side of a lump of chicken with a deadly, plastic fork.  The sound of tearing meat is terrifying, and you follow the journey the food takes, turning your neck to watch waaay up there as it is pulled irresistably into the maw of the girl.  There it is crunched and chewed between her teeth, gone forever more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet as her hand and fork dangle above the tray, her eyes never look down in your direction.  Turning away from her again, you see that there is a mega-sized video screen built into the back of the seat in front of her.  To a regular person it's fairly scrawny, but it's the greatest screen you've ever seen!  There's no sound - the girl's headphones taking all of that - but the quality is incredible.  In-flight entertainment has never been so impressive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you could dig into the food, confident that the girl won't see you, but there's still the risk of her blindly stabbing down onto you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could be safer just sitting to enjoy the movie, if you don't mind doing so on an empty stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr if neither of those options appeal, you could get down from here, and head back down to safety.  You little coward.</span></div></div>",

Not too far away towers the titan form of a ten year old boy, from the family of five you'd seen earlier. There were a few problems with this option; to start, that kid was your neighbor, second, you knew him for being evil, and lastly, his enormous feet were caked in mud and grass still a bit wet from playing outside before coming here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is far, far from ideal but  you just need to get on the plane, if you can last that long, you'll be fine. Bolting forward, you quickly cover the open distance between him and you, at his feet, your first problem is the inch tall rubber heel four times your height. Before he can step away, a leap and hurried climb gets you onboard, but he isn't yet boarding, just pacing in the line. While he circles, mud, grass and sweat rain down on you as the sides and straps of his sandal loomed overhead as if to tease your stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting here would be a death-sentence anyway. There was nowhere to go when someone stepped on the shoe, especially the hell where you were and if the kid kicked at anything it'd send you flying as you couldn't anchor down to anything. It appeared there were two routes to take; up on top of the foot or behind the strap and next to it. Being that close to the underside of a ten year old boy's foot wasn't something you'd do normally and certainly not with that foot dwarfing you at the length of a football field, 20 ft or so at the toes and probably a hundred by the ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best way up was right in front of you, the straps. On the right side, of the right foot at the heel you stared up an immense black wall for a strap, starting at 70 feet wide with a round gap in the mid-bottom that the boy probably couldn't get a finger through. The back end was just the right thickness for you to wrap your body around it and climb. Jumping on and inch-worming up at signifificantly less than an inch covered, you moved towards the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of your climb was the first of a few obstacles, the heel strap. Here, your perfect climbing spot turned and went horizontally around the foot to the other side of the heel. With a look at the materials making up the side, you swung your tiny feet out to land them on a clothe outcropping meant for decoration; its top where it jutted out was plenty large for your tiny feet. A few minutes later, and after much struggling, you were standing against the flat side of the top of the side piece, not far from the actual strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping up, you latched your fingers to the stitching for another outcropping and pulled yourself up, sticking your feet in the weave for support, reaching a hand up and climbing it. At the top, it all went bad. Despite the tiny size of your feet and the enormous-cable like size of the threads, you got a foot caught. Ripping away hadn't done any good and your brand new skating shoes remained trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to reach some safer spot than here, shoes or none. Lifting up, you slipped out of the shoes, losing your socks to the steel-like weave as well. Unfortunately for you, as soon as you set foot on secure ground, barefoot, the shoes fell free to bounce against the heel below. What rotten luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings under you now felt odder and in some places you were poked by incredibly sharp clothe, but were pretty much fine as you walked across the enormous velcro-secured strap and dropped to the huge foot. Your feet were immediately buried in mud when you touched skin, it came up just past your ankles. As you walked clear of that, the warm skin felt weird beneath your barefeet, it was certainly an unusual experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you realize the giant has stopped walking, now having an easier time to do so yourself. Looking up you see he's looking at his foot as if a fly or something was walking around and disturbing him. Quickly you dive under a pile of mud and he eventually looks away, not having spotted you. When you continue, he stops and looks again, then you see the enormous toes of his left foot looming in the skies and coming in to scratch away the itch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you gotta hide, either get a lot smaller or go over the edge, off the foot but on the sandal.</span></div></div>",

Running to the edge, you tried to wait out the shrink, but couldn't or for that matter get the chance. Parts of the mud had solidified, you were standing on a small section that was crust at the skin but still wet on top. A slight twitch of the enormous muscles of the foot and the mud slid free over the side. At this point you were a quarter inch yet as the device was just starting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything shot by as you slid down the foot, kind of like skating down a steep hill. On the way down, you blacked out. A while later, at least, you assume its a while, you come to, stuck against the mud. With some fighting, you pry yourself off the mud and look around to see an enormous environment all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great distance away you see a peach-color wall with a great deal of brown material is present, but entirely out of focus, across from it and you a black monolithic structure stretches to the sky and splits to go out of site above and to the sides. There could be another structure connecting to this one farther down, but you can't say for sure. What light streams to you comes mostly from a hole in the nearer of the structures, the peach and brown wall seems to be lit i places from beyond the monolithic structures, but all of that is beyond focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour immediate surroundings form from a mile long crater at the least that curves around at the corners, but is mostly box-shapped, though narrower at the far end. At the near end, the walls are much lower and beyond you can see five more craters, but much, much smaller. In places, there are great lakes though you are unsure just what makes them up; it looks like water, but doesn't seem like it. The last thing is just beyond your present crater, two things actually on either long side. They are just longer than your current home, one has strings crossing it before dropping to a farther off area, though nearest is a huge hole with a black conduit emerging. The other object simply is a black wall of the same shape into the sky, but has numerous grooves and shapes cut into and out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, it clicks in. This was your footprint from before shrinking. Your watch settings had been to be small enough that there'd be a gravitational field strong enough to cancel out the effects of the boy's movement. This however was a slight overshoot, you must have bumped something in your hurry as a quarter inch made 7 miles and an inch nearly 30. The boy here, would tower into the skies and probably space at 1530 miles tall, and this was just a ten year old. You didn't want to imagine a teen or older, you were smaller than anything else in existence to either a little boy, pre-teen, teen or adult. A single piece of muscle was at least a city, you couldn't move anything more than a nano-particle.</span></div></div>",

It would be quite a trip upwards, but at any point where you got tired you could always shrink down to a smaller size and rest in one of her pores.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo,which is it to be?</span></div></div>",

It felt good to be normal sized (or close enough- you may have added a few inches for good measure). In shock, the girl stumbled backwards, bumping into a nearby dresser. Panic in her eyes, she fumbled around and grabbed a nearby lamp, holding it out in front of her like a weapon. \"Who- What- What the fuck?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her what was hopefully an apologetic smile. \"Hey, sorry about the disruption.\" Rubbing the back of your head, you continued. \"I didn't mean to spend this much time here, really, but way leads on to way, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh,\" you began. \"I guess I'll just be going.\" She didn't move, except to keep her protective lamp firmly between her and you. Carefully, you walked toward the door. You turned the knob and left, making sure to close it behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was easier than you'd thought. You gave your wrist a quick check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrinking watch was gone. Fuuuck. The shrinking watch was still in the room. How the fuck did it get loose? No, how the fuck were you going to get it back? God, this was going to be such a pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Knock knock knock</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all of your genius, all you could think to do was to ask for it back. After a few seconds, the door opened just enough to let you see the face of the girl. She still looked a bit out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi again,\" you said. \"I left my shrin-something in here, and was wondering if I could maybe, perhaps, hopefully grab it reeal quick like?\" You gave a cheesy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't respond for the longest time. Just as soon as you were convinced you'd broken her, she spoke in a voice that was little more than a whisper. \"People can't shrink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot what you were hoping she'd say. \"You're right, of course. People can't just change their size. That'd be silly. But, I really need to get something. It'll take just a sec, I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe locked eyes with you. \"It's your shrinking device, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your turn to be surprised. \"Sh-shrinking device? What, that's just, no. Nooo nooo nooo. It's a, uh, watch, that's all. Family heirloom. Worthless, really, but it means a bunch. My grandpa owned it. Priceless to me. Yeah.\" <i>Fuck me stop talking.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lying, and not well.\" Her earlier shock was fading, and fast. \"I found your watch. It's high tech and fancy and labeled on the side 'Shrinking Watch\u00a9'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can... Can I have that?\" Your mouth was dry. This was going all so wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me why you were in my room.\" She was beginning to look angry. What were you going to tell her? The truth? It sounded bad, to be honest. But could you really make up a believable story? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" she said. \"You gonna explain?\"</span></div></div>",

If one or two grainy videos were taken, it'd be no problem, but the high resolution devices in that upscale hotel could be used to trace the watch back to you. You're practically dragging her through the parking lot, but finally has enough and stops you before you're off the property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, big boy. You're not going anywhere with me until I know exactly how this works.\" She begins to fiddle with the knobs, before giving you a devious look. \"Otherwise, I guess I'll just go back and figure it out myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace. Looking around, all you see in the way of cameras is one dinky little thing by the door, over four yards away; not ideal, but this place'll do. \"Alright, first things first. What you have there is a very potent, very rare, very <i>valuable</i> piece of tech. It's not a weapon, it's not a toy, but it is dangerous. If you still really want to do this, I want to know the risks. Shrinking looks fun, but it's goddamn dangerous and scary. Harmless pets become giant monsters, normal people turn into moving mountains, and every little thing can suddenly kill you. Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles. \"Is that supposed to frighten me, Mister I-Tested-The-Device-Out-In-The-Room-Of-Four-Gorgeous-Coeds. I'll be careful, at least as careful as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDammit, that<i> was</i> supposed to frighten her. \"Alright, as long as we're on the same page. Now, the watch has a lot of different controls. This here adjusts molecular stability, that modifies power drain, here we can change the field of effect, and that changes the screen color.\" You pointed out each knob and dial as you went, impressed by how much you remembered. The professor would be proud, over looking the whole theft thing. \"However, the most important controls are that knob there, which adjusts size ratio, and that button there, which'll activate whatever sequence you put it. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm. What's this here do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That lets you 'share' the shrinking effect with whatever you're holding. It's set right now to just shrink your clothes with you, but can be upped to affect whole buildings or vehicles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Perfect. Set it so you'll shrink with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\" you said. Every time you thought you knew what this mad woman was thinking, she'd go and say something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, shrink with me. I'm not doing this by myself. I just met you; what if you try and mug me after I shrink, or you had just lied to me and the settings you provided will turn me into pink goop. Make it affect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grimace, you comply. \"There. It'll shrink whoever you're touching. Happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very,\" she says.

Nah, I've got a better idea, after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a wink, then drops you into the palm of her other hand, where her fingers wrap around your half-inch form in a loose fist.  The world is sealed off by an all-encompassing world of flesh and bone, hot blood pumping noisily behind every whorled surface around you, the pitch darkness no clue as to what is causing the rolling thunder around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, the bright world wakens you up as fingers uncurl, and you sit up in Ali's palm.  The girl is standing in one of the bedrooms of the hotel, facing a bed whose occupant has herself buried under the covers, only a mass of blonde hair showing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, where are your earrings?\" Ali asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D' you know what time it is?\" the blonde mumbles.  An immense arm emerges from under the sheets, waving vaguely at the side table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli strides over to a small box on top of a suitcase, her own gigantic hand popping it open and rummaging around.  As she crouches, her other hand - the one in which you sit - lowers to the ground and tilts ninety degrees, dumping you onto the thick carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you bolt for it, you glance up at the mass of Ali, and she is looking back, tilting a smile across one side of her face.  You freeze, and then her fingers slam down ahead of you briefly returning to the sky and leaving the earrings before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're in the shape of songbirds - in cages.  Those cages are well-sculpted and realistic, and while the birds are cheap, lumpy plastic, those are thick bars there.  Still more than enough space for you to slip between them though, not a cage that could hold you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're examining the earrings, Ali's looming shadow disappears.  You turn, to see that she has used the watch again, shrinking down to your level.  Well, almost.  When she stops shrinking, she still towers twice your height, making you a child in comparison.  Her heavy hand slaps you heavily on the shoulder.  \"Say hello to your new home, perv,\" she smiles, forcefully marching you toward the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are powerless to resist, and go along with her when she strides over, boosting you into the cage before pulling herself up.  You ponder the shoddy quality of the bird as she joins you, remarking: \"You do know I can just climb out of here whenever I want, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At your current size, sure,\" she laughs, her hand landing on your shoulder yet again.  This is followed by the familiar 'click' of the watch, and the world shrinks around you as the two of you grow again, the woman doubled over as, between you, the two of you and the bird almost totally fill the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure is released as Ali unclasps her fingers.  \"See you shortly, Jiminy,\" she says, her voice decreasing in pitch as she shrinks again, to leave you trapped as she slips out of the bars.  Unless you're quick enough to grab her!</span></div></div>",

Even if the trousers weren't so well-fitting, the damage you sustained in her grip has left you too weak to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you recoup your strength, feeling the immense power of Ali's muscles as her thigh shudders at every step she takes.  Talk takes place way above you as your captor chats with her buddies, and then even more travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose track of time, and not only because Ali has your watch.

No, you'll reason your way out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli smiles widely.  \"Good morning for it.

If you manage to stick it out with us, we can talk about what to do next with the watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYikes.

These you treat to a shit-eating grin, while Ali takes the time to condescendingly pat the head of each muscled man she passes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock passes, and soon people are snapping pictures of you both, running alongside to take selfies even. Those that jog to keep up with your pace you indulge, but woe betide any that try to get you to stop, or ask you to participate.  They get shoved to one side rudely, and with the strength that you and Awesome Ali possess now, that send them to the ground in a heap.  Some laugh along with you, others shout abuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose latter are the next to feel your importance.  Anyone foolish enough to mock you for your height is lifted easily fro the ground, and dumped into the nearest bin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, any crowd that may be following the pair of you does so silently, and from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Awesome Ali share a grin, and stoop to enter the \"All-U-Can Eat Seafood Shack\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, fish-nets hang from the ceiling, which the pair of you still can't stand up straight under.  So Ali plops down cross-legged by a table, and after throwing aside the childish chairs you kneel opposite her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terror on the face of the staff as they approach is delicious.  Hopefully the food is just as tasty.  \"Two, please,\" you tell them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn light of your condition, the staff agree to bring the food to you, and soon tiny doll-house plates are piled between the two of you.  You both tuck in ravenously, the puny portions disappearing all too quickly into your mouths and stomachs, doing little to satisfy you.  The shit-glasses of drink to wash the fish down are barely enough to quench your thirst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you begin feeding each other, finding delight in the size of the portions against each others' teeth.  And when Ali places in your mouth one end of a squid tentacle that she has pursed between her own lips, a kiss is the inevitable conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSavouring the moment as long as possible, you realise that it may be time to move on from food, and instinctively raise a hand, pulling away from Ali's lips long enough to say \"Cheque, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly as the waiter steps up with the bill do you realise that you can't actually pay.  Your currency is all too big, and your card is similarly too large to be read.  Sheepishly, you look to Ali, but even as she licks your taste from her lips she treats you to a devilish wink.  \"I've got this,\" she assures you, hugging you and reaching for the watch.  She...</span></div></div>",

She must have touched the watch, as soon she's growing in size again, becoming just big enough to straddle your penis, her weight bringing its end down again and giving you a shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scooches along, her tiny fingers stroking and rubbing against what veins she encounters.  It's with a tenderness impossible in a larger woman, and you bite your lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ali crests the head, she flips herself around to look up and catch your eye, before bouncing herself up and down with glee.  Then she lowers herself, bringing her head down to the slit, where you can feel her - yes - yes, she's, yes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind unable to think, all power goes to ejaculating, but your dick suddenly sags under an even greater weight, and you eyes ope to look into Ali's your size!  She's grown again, skilfully fitting her vagina around your penis, perfectly complimenting your scale with her own!  Although spent, this surprise re-invigorates you, and as Ali drags a kiss out of you your dick re-hardens and heads on for round two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli's not done with the size change, and as your tongues wrestle hers begins to grow, and soon she has a subtle size advantage, dominating your embrace as your overworked dick comes again and again, the both of you pulling away to scream your ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt ends all too soon, a sweat-soaked pair of tiny people grinning wildly and gasping breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could possibly disturb this beautiful moment?</span></div></div>",

She was no doubt heading for a beach, and you would take no hesitation in meeting her there. She was a bombshell, a tall, perfect, titaness, blonde bombshell. Although it strayed from your original objective, there was nothing wrong with hanging out in her suite and... enjoying one of the many wonders, of spring break. You break the plain of the bathroom and step onto the gray, small square tiled floor and take the corner. Only one stall is occupied, and in that stall was a pair of feet, swaying back and fourth playing with the baby blue flip flops hanging from the thong in between her toes. That was were you were headed. You run forward, and under the enourmas vinyl wall. There she sat, and her purse on the ground, just under the kicking zone as her legs sway back and fourth. Her purse was undoubtedly a far safer stow away spot, than her flip flop. You scale the crumpled wall of hard leather and past the enourmas emblem. The main pocket was unzipped and ready for a passenger. You save your temptation to look up and dive in. You land on a hard plastic surface, and before you had time to identify the immense block of plastic, it lit up and words scrolled across a blinding white screen. An ear piercing ring blarred through the confined space and continued in a terrible melody. Her ringtone. Almost deaf by this sound you had no time to react to her hand snatching it out of her purse and sending you further down into the depths of the bag.The noise stopped and she began conversing with another, by the context it was more than likely one of her friends. She dropped the phone into the bag and gave you not even a seconds warning for you to dive out of the way. She zipped it closed and sent you into darkness, unaware of what could be happening outside. The only thing you knew, was that she was moving. With every step the bag swayed over her shoulder, sending items flying at you in an unorganized and disorderly manner. The phone was sliding back and fourth and that was the largest threat. You needed a light and you had an idea how to get it. Most phones have a button on them, and that button will turn off the Idle mode, and thus activating a light. The only problem with this plan was seeing the button, and pressing it before being run over. You knew she would have to turn her phone off soon, so you had little time to become acclimated to your surroundings the easy way. At the next availible point of semi-stillness you would ram the thing that feels closest to a button and hopefully activate a light. Almost on cue, she halts. You run forward and slam into a piece jutting from the phone. It was definately a button. The light goes on.<br>\r\n\"Alright, surroundings. What do we have?\"<br>\r\nAround you there was a melting Three Musketeers, opened, and half eaten. A pack of tissues, some crumpled and used. Lip balm, lip gloss, eye liner, lip stick, a hair brush, a compactable mirror, numerous make up \"essentials\". There was a small pack of emergency tampons, it was no longer a rumor that they did always carry them around. A small camera, a watch and a wallet. All strewn carelessly into the purse. You needed a safe spot for when she was moving, but there wasn't one. You were forced to dodge these obstacles until she boarded. Upon a second glance of the surroundings, the phone went idle and went dark. it was just to your luck that she was opening the purse to turn it off. You weren't sure if you should remain hidden or make her aware and possibly more concerned for the stow away in her purse. She may not react as wanted, and rationally.  Her hand began to reach in and her manicured fingers began to dangle before gripping the phone. What were you going to do?</span></div></div>",

After pushing a multitude of buttons, you received a horrible message.<br>\r\n\"Battery Low, Please Try Again Later.\"<br>\r\nFantastic, they've invented shrinking technology, but it's too much to ask for a longer lasting battery. You find a new ploy, and start sprinting the other way. Obviously, you got nowhere, and all the blonde had to do was bend down, and pick you up. She sat down on the bed, straight up, either unaware of the fact she was more than half naked, or didn't care. <br>\r\n\"Alright little dude, here's how it's gonna go. You're gonna do what we say and ask and we'll reward you with food, shelter, friendship, and all that good stuff. If you don't do what we ask you to, then your punishment will be worse than the job. I'm sure your aware that you're no match for two giant goddesses like us,and that's what we are to you, goddesses. If we so feel the need, we can torture you with out really doing anything, and we can kill you in at least a million ways. Now if you decline this friendship, Bethany will drink you down with her next Vitamin water, accept, and you'll be glad you did.\"<br>\r\nYou didn't feel like dying, so you accepted. <br>\r\n\"Good, now I'm sure you overheard our first plan, and that's what we're going to do, now work involved, just have fun, and get used to them, because you'll be working down there alot. Strip down, you're goin' swimmin' with these hot babes!\"<br>\r\nShe began laughing and wiggling her feet. You were going to be giving her a massage...fantastic... you were now a slave. 5 minutes later you find your self in the cold water being pushed back and fourth by the numerous jets. 15 feet under was the ground, which was moving up and down for the massage, creating waves. You looked up as the still 3 quarters naked blonde lowers her silky smooth foot down. You moved out of the way so that you wouldn't be held under and drowned. Her feet, were huge. You heard her sigh as she wiggled her toes in front of you creating huge waves that took you under. She looked down and smiled.<br>\r\n\"Kiss 'em, make love to them, they're gonna be your friends for the next few hours.\"<br>\r\nAt first you thought she was joking, but then she pushed em closer to you, and began to repeat herself.<br>\r\n\"Come one, lick those sexy toes.\"<br>\r\nYou did. You stuck out you tongue and licked the bottom of her pinky toe and felt the smooth wet skin against your tongue, and yet she continued.<br>\r\n\"I wanna feel it, make love to them, make love to them like you would me, do it right, and that'll be your reward, do it wrong and you'll be making out with toes the rest of the week.\"<br>\r\nSo you were in a strange situation. You began to kiss and lick her toes, over and over.<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, he's actually doing it! I think he deserves a fun night. I would make out with him normal height. You hear that little guy? You hit normal height, you and me are goin' out!\"<br>\r\n\"Julia! You're making him bang your toes and do slave shit! Your gonna go out with him? Crazy bitch.\"<br>\r\n\"He clearly likes me.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah...Little dude, got any friends?\"<br>\r\nYou had no friends around, but you could shrink someone else. But you kept quiet. Apperently you had a girlfriend.<br>\r\n\"Hey, guy, you can stop now... You can watch movies with us... \"<br>\r\n\"Thank God!\"<br>\r\nYou could finally get out of the water, the cold cold water. She plucked you out and giggled.<br>\r\n\"So you liked that?\"<br>\r\nYou didn't respond.<br>\r\n\"You can sit...here.\"<br>\r\nShe reclined and set you just under belly button, just above the thong. She stuck her thumb under the elastic and giggled.<br>\r\n\"Don't slip now...\"<br>\r\nAs you were staring into the dark abyss that was the depths of her panties, her finger came up behind you and pushed you in. She snapped the elastic down and giggled.<br>\r\n\"If you want out you'll have to make me shout. Don't be afraid, you have my permission to do whatever that little dick of yours desires.\"<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\"<br>\r\n\"Jules! Did you just drop him down your pants?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yep, I was horny for some tiny man.\"<br>\r\n\"You are such a slut!\"<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh! I'm a virgin, and I'm not sure this counts as sex, it's almost like masturbating, but the dildo has a brain...\"<br>\r\n\"No, it's sex...\"<br>\r\n\"Then I guess I have a boyfriend now...\"<br>\r\n\"Congrats, your now dating your sex slave.\"<br>\r\n\"Someone's jealous...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"</span></div></div>",

You watch forlornly as the titanic figures become marginally less huge as they recede into the distance.  Looking around, you see that both the family and the businesswoman have also gotten up and gone to board.  No chance of making spring break now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you do have a shrinking machine.  Maybe you should catch a lift with one of the many other people around, go somewhere else for a holiday.
