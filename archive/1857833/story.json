It was a long drive but he was finally home for the summer. It had already been a year since it happened, since he had lost his mother and sister. It wasn\u2019t in a car accident or because of cancer. Instead, it was a pandemic that robbed the entire world of its mothers, sisters, girlfriends, wives, daughters, etc. Every single woman on the face of the earth, all gone in a matter of days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one really knew where the pandemic came from, only that only the women were affected. Things were so different now, how businesses ran and everything. Aaron could still hear his mother nagging in the kitchen or the sounds of his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loss of those you love was hard no matter what the circumstances, but even the deepest cuts will heal with time. However, even with time and strong hearts like Aaron\u2019s father who would say, \u201cAs long as we keep their memory alive, they will never be really gone,\u201d there was still emptiness in the world that every living thing could feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked through the house, he can\u2019t help but smile as he passes pictures of his family when it was whole. The once unbearable pain had dulled over time; he could now talk about them and smile. He then looked out the window to see his father in the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked outside and his father greeted him with a smile and a hug. \u201cHey the garden looks good this year.\u201d Aaron says <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I even expanded it a few feet to make it wider, added some corn too.\u201d He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the afternoon went by as usual; whenever Aaron would come home they would grill out and catch up. Ever since it happened they had gotten a lot closer. However, eventually the conversation leads to the current state of the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo... How long do you think mankind has?\u201d Aaron asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(How does he respond?)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, there will not be enough people to stimulate the economy and then it\u2019s all downhill from there. There really isn\u2019t much we can do about it, so I guess all we can do is treasure the memories we have of them untill the end.\u201d He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Aaron remains silent, and then he raises his beer. \u201cTo mom, and Katie, and Aunt Donna\u2026\u201d he says. John then joins in naming his sisters, other relatives, and friends. This went on for some time and before long, the two of them had finished their beers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they finished eating, they said good night to one another and went to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Aaron woke up and walked down to the living room where he found his father watching the news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Dad.\u201d Aaron says to his father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey morning. There are some biscuits on the stove if you\u2019re hungry.\u201d He says <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome.\u201d Aaron says, as he makes his way to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron then picks up a biscuit, pours himself a glass of orange juice, and walks back into the edge of the kitchen so that he can see the TV.</span></div></div>",

He dropped his orange juice and fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's going on?!\" he yelled to himself, not noticing the increasing octave in his voice. His body felt like it was changing, like his body as clay and someone was molding it. He felt his rear and bottom half start in inflate, as well as a growing sensation in his chest. Something long and silky touched his neck, and he felt his frame getting smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Aaron picked himself up off the ground. He looked up to see his father on his knees, staring at him like he had been gone for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatie?\u201d he says desperately <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Dad are you\u2026\u201d Aaron says quickly noticing that wasn\u2019t his voice. It wasn\u2019t just that, his whole body felt different. He quickly looked down and gasped. The first thing to catch his eye were the two perky mounds that were now filling out his once loose t-shirt. He jumped back in shock only to land on something bouncier then he was used to. He reached back to find that the something bouncy was now his butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn rushed over to help him up and then gave Aaron a big hug, \u201cOh sweetheart, I missed you so much\u201d He says as tears of joy fall down his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was in shock, trying to figure out what was going on. When he heard his dad talk like that, he quickly pushed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, what are you talking about? It\u2019s me Aaron!\u201d said Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you look just like\u2026\u201d John tries to say as Aaron rushes to the nearest bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What do you look like?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And not only that but 100% of them were found to now be genetically female!\u201d he says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that every viewer at home went silent for a moment.

At which the affected will receive full medical examinations and identities which will allow them to gain legal possession of any previously owned assets or certifications. I have also been told that the government will be offering to clearing the records of all those who register, so that they may receive a fresh start with their new identities, no student loans, bad credit scores, mortgage, ext.\u201d he says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen more information becomes available, you will all be informed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zack felt like dying from fatigue. Every single fiber of his being begged him to stop, but he simply refused. His muscles may tear and his tendons may rip of from his bones, but by grief he swore that he would make those damned 100 pull-ups if it killed him in the process! Yet he knew words and promises would not aid his impossible task. His breathing was laboured, pin-pricks tickled his agonized arms and a cramp that felt like a gator was busy gnawing his side was growing ever more painful in his ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in a military aircraft-hanger which had been converted into a giant under-roof bootcamp gym and training facility. Timed Training courses, gym-equipment and shooting ranges covered its divided interior. Zack was currently in a small, privately enclosed, cubicle where around 13 men in green-camouflaged overall uniforms sat on the cold concrete floor, along with a Sergeant and Captain whom stood watching him. There was none of the usual jeering and insults hurled at him as soldiers usually do when they mocked their struggling comrades whom were less fit than they. Instead, all those present just kept a respectful, solemn silence a he struggled pathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack finally reached his utter limit at the 57th pull-up. The \"Will-breaker\" as the soldiers of bootcamp called it with their usual logical slang, was a mere 2 meter high U-shaped pole structure implanted up-side-down into the ground. It sole purpose was to break the stamina of ensigns by forcing them to complete sets of a specific exercise which was one of the most difficult tests of agility and endurance known to the human body. Or in short: the humble Pull-up. Zack needed to complete 100 sets of them consecutively in order to avoid being discharged from his unit with which he had spent the last 3-years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was failing. His arms started shaking, his lungs burned as if brimstone was within him and his fingers began slipping from the horizontal iron pole. With a final monumental effort he pulled for all he was worth...and for a moment it seemed as if his chin would surpass the bar. But then, as if all his strength was sucked from him, his hands let go of the pipe, and he fell onto the floor. There he sat exhausted and defeated, his life drained from him. For the first time in his military career, Zack's will had been broken bay the fabled Will-breaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergeant Mortiz put a hand on his shoulder: \"It's Okay, corporal. You did your best; there is no shame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looked up, breathing raggedly, with the tears of exhaustion streaming down his pretty pristine face: \"This isn't fair...\" he squeaked in his high soprano voice.<br>\r\n\"No son, it isn't.\" Moritz said to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly half of the entire world had been inflicted by the sudden mass gender-flip, and that had included the entirety of the American military armed-forces. Total anarchy had reigned in bases as Admirals and Generals spontaneously had started to sport breasts within conferences and troops became female in mid-training. Panic had broken out as woman with ill-fitting male overall-uniforms began to pop out everywhere. The greatest wedge against order had been that so many commanding officers and senior personal had gender-flipped into new unrecognizable individuals that it took a long time to re-establish the majority of the chain-of command.<br>\r\nBut the Iron-discipline of the American-military held, and after the broadcasts explaining the situation on TV and radio had been aired, a certain, albeit unstable, calm had settled on the understandably disgruntled feminized soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack had been one of the youngest recruits to have successfully completed the rigid training regime required to join the anti-terrorist Delta-forces. He was the top in his class. His marksmanship had been excellent, his dexterity legendary. He had broken many records of previous delta members. His future seemed bright as an operative of the special forces. Even after the horrific tragedy that had robbed him of his mother and sisters last year, he didn't abandon his post.<br>\r\nThe problem was, he wasn't a he anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the event took place he had turned into the almost spitting image of his lost sister, Katie. He had panicked like most and when he grew bored of panicking he started to find answers. He didn't even have the luxury of wearing a bra for comfort, as he couldn't find one for his newly formed sizable bosoms as there had obviously not been any female-personnel on base for the last year. Plus he had to straggle around with baggy overalls which threatened to fall off from his slender lithe figure. He was significantly smaller as a girl and had lost a good foot of his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greatest blow had come when his Captain had informed him that he faced discharge because of it. The Delta-forces held the most strict regulation for its members to be fit and strong for combat, short of the seals. Terrorists could not be kept at bay by weaklings; and the rest of the squadron could not be allowed to suffer if a new weak-link in the chain were to become present. If Zack couldn't complete the minimum required 100-Push-ups, which was a basic test to gauge the allowable fitness of soldiers, he would not be allowed to stay.<br>\r\nBut Zack had been cursed with a female form which was much shorter and much, MUCH weaker than his old self.<br>\r\nAnd Zack had failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the rest of his squad had made it bearable. They made it clear they still viewed him the same light, despite his discharge. Any asshole daring to come up with a snide remark of his new-found gender or taking a pick at him by calling him 'Zoey' as was becoming the norm, soon had their teeth re-arranged by his team-mates whom would not tolerate the degradation of their friend's dignity. Zack was eternally grateful to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on man! Don't leave us hanging!\" said Paul when the rest of Phython squad were back in their cabin. \"You've only been kicked from delta, not the military! Just redo bootcamp and the Tanzee-training and you'll be back with us in less than 2 years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not leaving the army.\" said Zack, packing his belongings into the small duffel-bag issued to him \"I'm just taking leave. I'm going to visit my father and my brother, Aaron, back in my hometown for the Summer vacation. Clear my head. Then come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll hold you to your word, Zack.\" said Sven, his bed-mate who slept above him in their double-bunk. \"Don't give up on us just because of this insignificant little incident.\" Zack smiled at Sven's usual use of Euphemisms. \"Don't smile at me you bitch! I know where you live! And if you don't come back, I swear to the almighty I'll come and get yer ass right back. I'm serious, Zack. Please. Don't go moping in a corner. We're all cheering for ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a general murmur of agreement and encouragement from the other men in the room.<br>\r\n\"You heard him man, just come back, Okay?\" came Paul again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack almost cracked up right then and there, but stopped himself. This stupid girl-body of his and its spiralling emotions... <br>\r\n\"Thanks guys, that means a lot. I'll come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA general collective of \"Nah!\" and \"Don't mention it.\" and \"Just get your worthless ass back, man.\" resounded throughout the room as the rest of his squad-mates attempted to project a callous demeanor.<br>\r\nZack wasn't fooled by them. He could see most of them avoiding his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a male, Zack had been lean, strapping, barrel-chested 6-footer 25-year old. But as his girl-self, he was fragile, petite, vulnerable and not to mention tiny at just above 5-feet. He looked the image of a 17-year old school girl. Where most in the armed-forces were gender-flipped into women of at least proportional size and strength similar to that of their male-selves, Zack had been particularly unfortunate as it seemed he had been placed beneath a shrink-ray as well. He was drowned in his original Khaki overalls and his sleeves went well past his hands, giving them the appearance of being amputated. His immensely long brown hair was tied up in a snaking ponytail -  there had been so may newly formed women in the first day to the barber to cut their hair, that all the shears and scissors had broken or been blunted before all could be serviced. Now a lot of the new girls, like Zack, had to walk around with their  lengthy hair which labelled them plainly for all to see as the transformed females, much to their obvious embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack wasn't stupid. He knew he was a source of obvious attraction for his sex-starved comrades. Soldiers get lonely easily and there hasn't even been girls around for over a year to hang out with in their R and R. Zack knew his pretty presence didn't ease their longing. He had stared at his own nude reflection in barely containable lust last night for several hours. Yet he knew out of sincere respect for him, they avoided looking at him entirely, so as not to make him the center of their love-crazed stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, they had been the most loyal of comrades. When he had to take a shower, they would all exit dutifully and give him the time and space he had needed. They had allowed him to sleep in the corner bunk. And so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was done packing the measly amount of his possessions.<br>\r\n\"Well...so long. I'll see you guys whenever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zack walked (or waddled in the oversized, baggy, frumpy Khaki's he wore on his miniscule body) to his escort jeep, he wondered if either his brother or father had been affected as well. The outside civilian world seldom had contact with soldiers currently servicing within special forces, for obvious reasons, including the keeping of military secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hobo was sent sprawling backwards across the pavement the same way a skier went down on a slippery ice lake; sliding several meters before coming to a standstill due to the aftershock of Zack's powerful punch to his face; his busted nose trailed by an arc of red blood. He moaned once then sagged into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack waved his petite hand the way one did to quench a lighted match, as if that would heal the soreness caused by the hobo's dense head. Then picking up his backpack which he had discarded during the excitement of the struggle, he walked onwards; trying to still his irritation at the thought that he had to keep one of the straps between his 2 over endowed breasts to keep it from falling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, breasts were a nuisance, Zack thought bitterly. Utterly useless organs that did everything in their power to make his movement inefficient and sluggish, and life a nightmare when it came to dressing. It was even less pleasant to have them bounce and bob and quake at the least provocation of motion. Jogging sucked, hard. And having the stares of oversexed morons glued to two things that wobbled like jelly on his chest was proving to Zack the greatest test of his self-control not to strangle random whooting ass-hats with their own stinking guts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack breathed deeply to calm himself. Or herself. Zack had found it impossible to refer to himself in the female pronoun. He didn't like it. And he liked it less when others referred to him as female. And when they kept doing it, they found themselves in the same scenario as the hobo Zack had just creamed with the mother of all uppercuts.<br>\r\nZack pulled his face grimly. This has been happening for the last 40 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans were utterly disgusting creatures. You might think that the preservation of our species or the revival of our kind would be the first priority after the event that had gender-bender precisely half of mankind in womankind, securing our salvation from extinction. But no. Oh no.<br>\r\nIn less than a day the police departments across the nation had their hands full with riots on an unprecedented scale breaking out. Rapings and attempted rapings ravaged the population as testosterone fueled cro-magnon morons assaulted the newly formed girls that had repopulated the streets of cities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe national guard had been called to tranquilize the civil unrest plaguing the capitals, but little could be done for the chaos raging through rural areas. Even the coast guard, the fire-and-rescue departments and the intelligence agencies were called upon to restore order upon the ensuing anarchy that was busy engulfing the nation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRadio's and televisions had blared out the message that the newly formed women should stay indoors behind locked bars until the barbarity that went on in public against the new females could be brought to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tazers and cattle shock-sticks industry found themselves becoming billionaires overnight as the new women tried to buy protection from the physically superior male gender trying to overpower them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not the environment of the army, where iron discipline, absolute respect and complete order ruled the soldiers. There weren't as many capable men as those in Zack's Python squad that would stand up for the new women. Here in public the strongest was usually the bullies, the gangsters, the lowlifes. Men who exerted power over their fellow beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, things have quieted down greatly since the initial outbreak of entropy. The president and the ruling elite had taken a stance that this neanderthal behavior would not be tolerated, and that all transgressors of the law would duly be punished. The prisons were overflowing with the scum of the streets and the scrap of society. But there were still stray corrupt freaks, like the hobo Zack had just floored, that fancied themselves an easy rape to cute little things like Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hobo had been the 3rd to have tasted Zack's knuckles. They all obviously had never learned that size was not a guarantee of power; and as Zack had proven with his lithe minuscule body, the addition of a delta-force training program had made him into deadly weapon. Zack was the absolute wrong girl to screw with. And those that had tried to screw him/her had themselves incapacitated from walking for the next foreseeable several weeks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack reached the phone booth. This moment he dreaded. Selfishly he hoped at least one of his family members had also suffered the gender-bending event so that they would in the very least dot judge him, discard him as a freak, or could associate with what he felt and experienced. Huh, the moment of truth. Heart beating. The ringing gave way to a click, the click was followed by a melodious voice trepidly answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeh? <br>\r\nWhat the blazes? Zack's logic hit a cul-de-sac. Was that Katie??? His younger sister? How could she be alive? How?? A thousand and one questions raced through Zack's head faster than a Nascar event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" the familiar high voice repeated: \"Is someone there? Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Katie!\" Zack breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was the voice on the line's turn to succumb to silence. Thinking the connecting to be cut, Zack shouted urgently: \"Katie! Katie! You there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are...are you Katie!?\" The hell? Why would his sister ask if HE was Katie? Zack thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Zack said: \"You're Katie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfusion seeped from the received and from Zack alike as the two correspondents regarded each other with suspicion and mistrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just who exactly is this?\" they asked in almost perfect synchonizing unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Aaron!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Zack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the puzzlement disappeared from Zack as the puzzle fell into place. It was Aaron! He had been turned into a girl just as he had. Zack had declared that his reflection had resembled his lost sister's. It was only logical that his brother Aaron, seemingly also turned into a girl had also been made to resemble and sound as their sister so closely. Hence they both thought each other had been Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you too?\" asked Aaron's voice, sounding metallic across the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" was all Zack said, all that needed to be said. \"I...err...I've taken some leave from the army for a few weeks. And...err...I'm hoping to come visit you guys...those of you that still are...you know if I'm still welcome...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Aaron blurted: \"Were you dismissed?! You know, because you are...you are...\" Aaron couldn't dare say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah!\" Zack lied; not mentioning his discharge from Delta after being gauged as now inferior in terms of physical prowess as a girl: \"I'm just taking a little vacation. Taking some time off for...err...stuff...\"<br>\r\nMan, this was THE most awkward conversations Zack had ever endured! When had dreamed of being reunited with his brother after 2 years he sure as damn was a curseword didn't think that they'd both be doing it sounding like chicks and sporting bosoms. Ugh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you're always welcome here, Zack. Dad will also be glad to see you. I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he...&lt;sigh&gt;...you know?\" Zack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, its only me. Actually, he also thought I was Katie when he first saw me. I myself also thought I was Katie. Closer...inspection...revealed otherwise. Guess this is us if we were born girls in the first place.\" said Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack only grunted as he remembered seeing his nude form. He didn't want to be reminded of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess-\" said Aaron again: \"-guess we...we're sisters now, heh?\" Aaron laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack scowled. He didn't want to hear THAT from Aaron of ALL people. He still couldn't hear himself in the female pronoun with a straight unmurderous face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I. Am. Zack.\" he said stubbornly and forcefully, the way a toddler would take a stance over an insignificant issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you are...sis!\" Aaron joked; making Zack's eye twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if remembering something important, Zack asked urgently: \"Were you ever attacked or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I was safe. Dad kept me safe. Our neighbourhood kept a watch. I was in a safe sector.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone...did anything...I'll pull out their guts through their throats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron sighed. Not unhappily so. His late brother Zack always was a violent one - true he was a natural at protecting others at the cost of his own self-preservation - but the military had been his obvious destination in life. Disconcertingly however, was that Zack was the type whom would carry out the promise of his threats quite literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing happened. I swear. I'm okay.\" said Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so...\" said Zack, uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When will you be coming?\" Aaron switched the subject-matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My flight will be there in 8 hours.\" As if struggling whether to ask, Zack added: \"Do...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spit it out?\" Aaron admonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all his self-esteem out of the window, Zack asked with a face that resembled the morning sum: \"Do...do you have any bras where you live?\" Zack felt like he could swallow himself whole at the sound of Aaron's hysterical laughter. Or maybe jump off of a cliff. A high one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving caught his breath, Aaron said: \"Oh man sorry, that was too funny.\" he apologized. Zack could just visualize his smug gloating face.<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Zack inquired impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. We had a rundown mall with woman clothing and lingerie shops nearby. What size are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell should I know?!!!\" Zack raged dementedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron sighed a second time: \"Nevermind, I'll just take a bunch. Anything else? Some panties? We've got some nice silky stockings and white cottons. Or maybe you want a bathing suit? Oh I know! I'll get you some-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack slammed the receiver into the handle with brick-breaking force. Sometimes Aaron could be like fly stuck in his ear.<br>\r\nAt least he won't be alone in this in a while.</span></div></div>",

I mean how many men do you think will just volunteer to become women?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell in most of the Western world we will have a handful I'm sure that will come forth, but in other parts of the world women have been looked down on for centuries. I doubt we are going to have any step forward there. It's simple math. There won't be enough to save the human race.\" Dr. Simpson, the facility director states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Jacks rubs his forehead and says, \"It gets worse, the virus will only work with roughly 50% of the population, maybe more. For the rest it would not be much more than a cold. There is no way to tell until they're infected if it will work on them or not. So out of the few volunteers we may get the virus may only work on a minority of them. But I have another idea on how to make it work\". Dr. Jacks says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimpson and others look at Jacks and Simpson asks, \"What are you suggesting, Jacks\". Jacks knows this will probably not go over very well, but it is the best solution. \"Well we created this virus using the base code of the original virus that killed off all of Earth's women in the first place, so it's just as contagious. It will be difficult to contain it after release, so I propose that we don't even try. I say we intentionally release it and let nature decide who is transformed and who isn't. I've run the numbers and have picked the locations for release where it will be most effective.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of shock comes over the faces of the others in the room. Dr. Simpson stands up and says, \"Jacks, you're probably right, but the world would have our asses for doing such a thing\". Jacks shrugs and says, \"I have considered that. The Venus virus though is based on the other virus. We can simply claim that it was a natural mutation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Simpson sits down and says, \"Let\u2019s do it, may God have mercy on us all\". He then looks at Jacks and asks, \"Is there any way we can be immunized against the virus\"? Jacks shakes his head and answers, \"No, we're all in this together\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the next few hours several trucks leave the facility with a very special cargo. Inside the facility Dr. Jacks stands in the room with the others and says, \"It's only fitting that we're the first\". With that he lifts the lid off of a vacuum sealed canister. There is a hiss as an invisible gas spreads throughout the room, then out to the rest of the facility, and then outside. Some in the room try to hold their breath, but it's really no use. It starts as a tickle in the back of the throat. Dr. Jacks closes his eyes. He knows what will come next. Over the next few hours the fever will set in. After which some will be transformed into women and others will simply get over it and retain their male gender. The human race will be saved. Jacks laughs to himself as he thinks of another ironic side effects of the virus is that not only will it turn men into women it will turn them into very beautiful busty women. That has to do with many factors. The world will be populated by women with supermodel or rather porn star bodies and men who have been without women for over a year.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The scientist didn't know how exactly the transformation would begin, unfortunate for Aaron and his father however they weren't transforming on the outside as quickly as they were on the inside. Which in turn caused them a great amount of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Same to you.\" Aaron's father said weakly.  the pain the felt form the transformation began to worsen as they both began to get chest pains as they felt that area had started to feel bumpy.

They were both still wearing the clothes they had wore the previous day but had looked completely different. Aaron had red hair, his eyes were now green and of course he or rather she was quite busty in chest area. it took Aaron a bit of time to get up as he was still weak from the transformation. It was then he saw another woman with similar red hair to his, but with blue eyes and was even bustier than he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Dad?

The changes are not reversible though the effects of the pheromones will start to decline within a few weeks. We did make a miscalculation on what percentage of the population would be effective. Our target range was 50/50. What we didn't count on was that our target group was all under thirty years of age being interns and the like. With this demographic we met out target. What we hadn't factored in was testosterone decline in older men decreasing their resistance to the change induced by the virus. Starting in mid to late 30s the affected percentage of the population begins to rise exponentially. At around age 60 the effectiveness of the virus is nearly 97%. The plus side to this is that they have been restored to youth.This unforeseen complication means that there are far many more women than men now. To maintain population numbers and genetic diversity we recommend, no insist that the remaining men take several partners. This should be done before the effects of the pheromones wear off to insure the acceptance of the new women.\" The message then repeats itself. Aaron sits there stunned by the news. \"This was done on purpose\", Aaron says out loud. Aaron can see the cold logic in this, but still. The part about multiple partners catches him. The world has gone from no women to having too many women. Not to mention that all these women are exactly like his dad, horny and cock hungry. The thought of it causes Aaron's cock to stir again.

The only thing that keeps him in control is the desire to make Dickerson big for it. \"Aaron, what the fuck are you doing in my house\", Dickerson whines? Her voice says one thing, but eyes fall right on the bulge between Aaron's legs. \"I came to check on you, to see if you were ok. Is there anything you need\", Aaron says and then whips out his cock?

You know this would feel so much better in you pussy than your fingers. All you have to do is say it and you can have it. Just say you want my cock\", Aaron teases.

Her face contorts and she says, \"I want it.\" Aaron smiles, steps closer, and says, \"I'm sorry, what is it that you want?\" Dickerson begins trembling with desire as Aaron inches closer and says, \"I want your cock.\" Aaron mind begins being bombarded with desire for this woman before him, but he manages to stay in control. His desire to make Dickerson beg for it keeps his desire at bay. \"What would you like me to do with my cock\", Aaron ask bemused? Dickerson eyes adopt an almost animalistic look and she blurts out, \"I want you to fuck me with it. I want to fucked, used, and filled up with your cock. Make me your little bitch!\" Dickerson is shocked by her confession. She is even more shocked because it's all true. The world got really strange yesterday. First she awoke to find herself a young woman. On top of that she found herself to be a very horny young woman. Everything is so confusing. Then Aaron, the young bastard from next door shows up in her house swinging his dick around. Strangely, it clears some things up.

She smiles and crawls on top of him. \"Let's see if I can work you up an appetite\", she purrs. She's become very skilled at getting Aaron's boxers off. Within a second she's sliding her clit across the shaft of Aaron's cock. \"I love morning wood. Well, afternoon wood, evening wood, nighttime wood\", she says guiding Aaron's cock into her. \"Oh baby\", she moans. Aaron responds the best he can, thrusting into her. It still is in the back of his mind that this young woman riding him used to be his middle aged father. Now she could pass for 20 something and has his baby growing inside her. \"This is so messed up\", Aaron thinks to himself. It also feels good being with a woman on a regular basis. He closes his eyes and runs his hands up her body feeling every curve. \"Twist my nipples, Aaron, Gawd, I love that. Oh fuck, I'm going to cum\", she screams!

This looks like a good one for her. \"I can feel you filling me up, oh fuck\", she screams as her whole shakes with a second orgasm. As it subsides she collapses onto Aaron's chest. \"That was so good\", she whispers in his ear. After a minute she gets up, grabs her clothes, and says, \"Eat you breakfast.

Then again a year ago things were much different. Half the world\u2019s population hadn\u2019t been wiped out yet. The months since then had seen the population reduce even more due to wars, suicide, murders, accidents, and just plain natural causes. It\u2019s widely believed that to maintain some semblance of order the governments of the world have been lying about how close the human race is to extinction. Most of the world\u2019s economies have been decimated. Civil war has broken out in a lot of places. Here in the United States martial law has been effect for nearly a year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Emergency Powers Act has allowed the President to serve a third term with no new elections announced. Most have seen this latest move to be a major overreach of power. It\u2019s been officially called the Human Species Recovery Act. Most though have called it the Bitch Act. The few demonstrations that have been attempted against it have quickly been squashed. Those involved were arrested and moved to the front of the line. The conversions have been scheduled to start next week for them. It doesn\u2019t really make a difference to most since they will still be required to serve out their sentence. In addition to the conversion they will also be inseminated. The government is turning criminals, or anyone they call a criminal into breeding stock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aaron and his dad drive through town they look around. The streets still have some life on them, but not like before. Aaron is pulled from his thoughts as his dad pulls into the parking lot of the post office. As for the past few days he pulls the mail out of the box and starts flipping through it looking for the letter that will change Aaron\u2019s life. Aaron's dad lets out a sigh of relief. The letter isn't there, this week.\t<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll have to report, or they'll come after me. I'll be arrested, converted, and inseminated pretty quickly. They have already made a few examples. What I've found is something to help you get out of it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat has Aaron's curiosity up and he asks, \"How could you find something that can help me, but not you\"? Mark leans closer and says, \"The law has just a few holes. One of them is that if you're married and in a productive relationship you will be exempt. They did this to encourage traditional couples. The Conservatives put that one in there. They didn't believe inseminating everyone and having single parent households would be good in the long run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot following Mark's train of thought Aaron throws his hands up and asks, \"And who am I supposed to marry? If you haven't noticed there is a shortage of girls around and the ones that have already been converted are in prison already knocked up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smiles and leans in a little closer, \"You're going to marry me, we can do it today since they started allowing same sex marriage in this state even before the virus. Then in a few days I'll go ahead and report for conversion. After that we'll have to ahh, umm, get me pregnant sometime within the next 6 months. You'll be temporarily exempt as soon as I'm converted. After I get pregnant you'll be permanently exempt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron nearly falls out of his chair laughing, \u201cOh wow so let me get this straight, you want us to get married and knock you up?\u201d he says, \u201cThat\u2019s a good one man, I needed a laugh with all that\u2019s been going on.\u201d He says, \u201cI\u2019m serious, and this isn\u2019t just for you, as soon as I\u2019m converted i basically become breeding stock, and id rather have some choice in the matter then have the government set me up.\u201d He says, \u201cLook man, I\u2019ve known you for a long time and I know worrying about this draft is killing you, so as messed up as this is, will you marry me?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After that we can discuss when we'll get started on the next step\".

But he couldn\u2019t help but think that this really isn\u2019t fair to Mark. He would have made a great lawyer, but as a woman there is a chance he\u2019ll just become breeding stock, I mean the government will probably expect more than one child; he may not get to finish Law school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes more sense for me to be the one that gets converted,\" Aaron murmurs to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stops the car at the red light. Going straight will take him home. Turning right and going just two blocks will take him to the nearest conversion center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I stick to the plan, or do what's right by Mark?\" Aaron wonder<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aaron turns right without really thinking about it. Maybe it was the drinks or that his mind is still spinning trying to wrap around the fact that he and Mark are now married. He tosses these thoughts out almost as soon as they form in his mind. The truth of it is that it's the right thing to do. Mark has always stuck up for him since the first day they met in the second grade. That first day he pull Billy Johnson off of him. He gave Aaron the chance to get away and got a blackeye for his trouble from some of Billy's friends. If it wasn't for Mark he would have never passed Math in high school. Aaron thinks of another dozen things as he pulls up and parks at the conversion center. He knods his head at the cops as he walks by. His legs feel stiff as if the have a mind of there own and just want to turn around and run in the other direction. Kevin is almost ready to give into them just as a man in a white coat comes up to him. \"Hello I'm Jack Thompsom, what can I do for you\", he asks? Aaron just stares at him for a few seconds before choking out the words, \"I'm here checking out the conversion thing\". Jack smiles and says, \"Well, we don't officially open until tomorrow, but I can help\". He leads Aaron over to a desk, offers him a seat before sitting down himself. \"Ok, what kind of questions do you have\", Jack asks? Aaron attempts to calm the butterflies in his stomach and says, \"I and my friend just got married today and I from what I understand If I get converted he'll be excluded from the draft\". Jack lets out a little laugh and responds with, \"Ah yes, the marriage exclusion. That is correct. He'll be given a temporary exemption for six monthes or until you become pregnant. Not many people know that. I happen to think it was a great thing to put in. It's important that everybody be willing to continue to enter into relationships if the human race is to survive\". Aaron near pukes at hearing pregnant part. \"Can I really go through with this\", he thinks to himself?</span></div></div>",

Jack shrugs and says, \"Sure thing, let me take down some information and then I'll go over the process with you\". Jack takes down Aaron's information, gets a copy of the proff of marriage, and then asks a few health related questions. Jack types away on the computer and says, \"Well, your letter was sent out today. You would have probably gotten it in the few days. Everything looks good here. You friend Mark is now exempt. If he shows up at any conversion center in the country he'll be turned away. Now let me explain the process. You'll be injected with nanites coupled with a targeted retro-virus. Your Y chromosome will be converted to an X making you female. The nanites will accelerate the pysical changes by converting some of your mass and doing away with excess\". Aaron gulps and says, \"That sound painful\". Jack smiles and says, \"Not at all. You'll be sedated the whole time and placed into a solution tank. You will not feel a thing. When you wake up you'll be a new person. I tell what since we're not officially open yet and not that busy I'll do something that may make things easier. We have the ability to select how you'll look to a certian degree. I can't do anything to radical, but I can change some things. Would you like to do that, or just go with a standard conversion\"? Aaron sits there pondering this. It's strange enough that he's going to be turned into a woman, but now he's being giving the choice of what he'll look like as a woman.</span></div></div>",

That's not hard. It's actually already be taken into consideration. It's part of the basic program. If we're going to save the human race we might as well make improvements.

Now it's filled with what seems like hundreds of semi-clear cylindrical tanks with hinged lids. \"Wow, you guys built all these in a year\", Aaron asks amazed. Jac replies with, \"No, they were built sometime ago for a different purpose along with the technology we're using for the conversion\". He then lowers his voice and says, \"The government was attempting to create super soldiers. It fell out of favor because they had no way to control them. This stuff was mothballed\". \"Well, I guess it's a good thing someone found it\", Aaron states. A couple of other people in scrubs show up. Aaron is then stripped down, placed into one of the tanks, and hooked up to all sorts of tubes, IV's, and wires. Jack comes up and says, \"Ok, you'll start falling asleep soon. If the tank starts filling up before you do don't worry. It is a special breathable fluid. Just breath it in like you would air. You will not drown. See you in an hour\". Aaron starts to feel a little panicked as the lid shuts. \"What the fuck am I doing\", he says outloud? The tank begins to fill with fluid and Aaron's panicked feeling increases. Just as it hits his waist the seditive kicks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Aaron awakes an hour later confused from the seditive. He coughs fluid up as his eyes try to adjust to the lighting. He then senses people trying to help him. They rinse him off, dress him in a hospital gown, and take him to a recovery area. It takes several minutes for Aaron to come around. He moves his fingers and toes first. \"Everything feels normal\", Aaron thinks to himself. He had expected to feel different somehow. \"Maybe something went wrong\", he thinks. After a few more minutes he slides out of the bed. He gribs the bed as his balances adjusts. It's then he notices he has boobs. He reaches up and brushes back long strands of blonde hair out of his face.

You can play with them if you want. I'm Janice; I'm here to help you with your adjustment. Please come with me\". As Aaron follows her through some winding hallways she explains how she was in the first wave of conversions and volunteered to help they then arrive to what appears to be a large warehouse filled with women's clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", Aaron exclaims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice laughs and says, \"That's what I said when I first saw it. The government gathered up all the women's clothes after stores started getting rid of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I have already picked out some clothes for you so please find something you like and try it on\". Janice tosses Aaron a bra and matching panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron just looks at them for a second; Janice motions her to put them on. Aaron slides the panties on under her gown. She then looks at the bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"34DD? I told him no bigger than a c-cup. I knew these things seemed big!\" Aaron exclaims! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice sighs and says, \"Ah Jack, I've told him not to make promises about custom conversions. They can try to tweak it, but for the most part it's a crap shoot\". Aaron is annoyed but there is little she can do about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice turns as Aaron slips off the gown and tries to get the bra on. After some struggling Janice offers to help. Aaron reluctantly accepts. Janice explains the different bra types and methods of putting them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe helps Aaron fasten in the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't feel right,\" Aaron states. \"Pull your breasts up get them into the cups\", Janice replies. She then does it for her. It feels weird having someone else touch her new breasts and Aaron squirms a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice smiles and asks, \"Did you ever play sports and wear a cup?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", Aaron answers. \"It's the same concept\", Janice states plainly as if touching Aarons boobs wasn't a big deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron finishes putting on the rest of the clothes and looks at herself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I can do this,\" Aaron murmurs. Janice hears and says, \"Ah well I\u2019m sorry but it's a little too late to turn back now and not even possible\". Aaron shakes her head and explains the whole situation with Mark getting married, everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end Aaron says, \"I'm still a guy. How can I sleep with and have a baby with another guy\"? Aaron sits down and Janice sits down beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice puts her arm around her and says, \u201cYeah a lot of guys have been losing sleep over that one but think about it like this, things are different now, it doesn\u2019t matter that you use to be a man, and I guarantee guys are not going to be thinking about that when you\u2019re on the beach in a bikini, this sends chills down Aaron\u2019s spine and brings a very funny look to her face which causes Janice to laugh hysterically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not like you will be hitting the beach tomorrow.\u201d She says, \u201cBut you get the idea, and besides you\u2019re not wearing a costume, these bodies are fully functional and full of female hormones so the physical attraction thing is no problem. Aaron didn\u2019t exactly know how to feel about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I know what you\u2019re thinking, a mind that doesn\u2019t want it and a body that does, but it is what it is, take your time with it. If you want to fight it for a while, fight it, if you want to go nuts and pull out the Kama Sutra, go nuts. It\u2019s all you.\u201d She says smiling, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But hey you're lucky, since you came in today you beat the big rush. So I'm going to set you up with a whole new wardrobe, makeup, everything. This may be a man\u2019s world now more than ever but you going to drive them all crazy.\" Janice says as she proceeds to load Aaron up with bags of stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets some guys to carry it to Aaron's car. After she's done Aaron looks in the mirror, to see the kind of girl that he has been dreaming about staring back at her. She should be turned on but instead she didn't exactly know how to feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, is that really me\", Aaron thinks to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecurity escorts Aaron to her car even though no one is around. Aaron is soon driving down the road. The streets are nearly empty as curfew will be coming soon. She doesn't worry as she has a pass in her new purse along with her new ID. They gave her a choice of picking out a new name. She decided not to get to creative and just changed it to Erin instead of Aaron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I go home or go see Mark\", Erin wonders?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looks around and realizes she didn't bring any of the boxes in. \"Oh, fuck it\", she stammers and takes off her bra. Erin wonders how girls can stand to wear those things all day. She's only had it on a few hours and barely could breath, not to mention it was getting hot. Without thinking Erin cups, lifts them, and runs her hands over them feeling relieved. Her nipples go hard and she catches her self. \"Whoa, this is too wierd\", she mummbles. Even though it's been over a year since she felt up some boobs feeling her own is just a little strange. Erin throws on a t-shirt and looks over at her computer. \"Might as well let Mark know just in case he was planning on doing what I've done\", she says to herself. She sits down and logs on Skype. After a few minutes Mark appears on screen. His expression is at first confused and then changes to shock. \"Aaron, what have you done\", Mark states? Erin explains what she has done and why. \"I don't know what to say, thanks\", Mark replies. Erin feeling buzzed smiles and says, \"You want to see the rest\"? Mark shrugs and knods his head. Erin stands and backs up so Mark can see the rest of her. \"Wow, you're hot\", he stammers. Erin laughs and says, \"It's been over a year. You would think the lunch lady from our old high school was hot\". Mark laughs back and replies with, \"Naa, really, you're hot. Could I see your, ahh, tits\"? Erin frowns for a momment. Erin knows where he's coming from. God knows the last year has been rough for everybody. Aaron's was reduced to watching old porn and outdated skin mags for relief. Mark and him had even exchanged some just to have something diferent. \"Ok, but you only get a glance, nothing else\", She replies. Erin takes a deep breath and quickly pulls her shirt up and down. As she does she hears a click. \"Did you just take a still shot\", Erin shouts? Mark's face turns red as he just got busted. \"I guess I can't blame you. Just don't let me know what you're going to do with it\", Erin says holding up her hand. Mark looks relieved and says, \"Come over tommorrow and we'll talk about the next step\". The screen then goes blank. Erin falls back on the bed and imagines what Mark is probably doing right now with her picture. \"Now that I'm a chick I'm going to have to be more careful\", Erin mumbles. She then looks down at the massive rack that is probably now providing Mark with entertainment.</span></div></div>",

She looks at herself in the mirror and lifts up her shirt as she did for Mark a few minutes ago. She then begins running her hand up her body. Her skin is so smooth and sensitive. She becomes arroused quickly. \"How far do I want to take this\", she says to herself. She's feels a little conflicted. Sure, as a guy especialy over the past year she's played with herself, but now, as a girl it's different. No, that's not right. What's really bothering her is what if she enjoys it. What would that mean? \"Oh fuck it, I'm a girl now. I might as well get used to it\", Erin murmurs. She then looks down at herself and says, \"If I'm going to do this I might as well go all the way and have the full girl experiance\". She curses herself for not bringing in any of her new clothes. She then remembers that her sister's room has been untouched since she died. She slowely opens her bedroom door and peers out. If things are how they usually are her Dad is passed out in front of the TV. Just in case she tip toes over to her sister's room and slowely opens the door. She cringes with every creak afraid of what her father would say if he caught her. She steps inside and locks the door behind her. She starts looking through her sister's things. She was starting to go through her reble phase that last year and dressing slutty. There are plenty of outfits to choose from. As Erin is pulling one out to set aside she finds something hidden underneath. She pulls it out and looks at it. It's a 12\" long realistic looking dildo. \"Damn\", Erin murmurs! She never thought her sister would have had one of these. She changes into one of the nighties she set aside and lays back on the bed. She starts slowely exploring every part of her body. \"Ahhhhhhh\", she moans while playing with her nipples. She then looks over to the dildo. \"Why not\", she thinks to herself. She take the dildo and looks at it in her hand. It's huge compared to her dainty little hands. \"I'm a little slut\", she moans and licks it's shaft. She then takes the head into her mouth while fingering her pussy. She then moves the dildo to her pussy and gently slides it inside. \"Oh shit\", she stammers amazed. Erin had now idea that it felt this way for a girl. It's wierd having something inside you. She begins working it back and forth. \"Oh yes, oh yes, fuck that pussy\", she moans and picks up the pace. Suddenly she climaxes. \"Oh yessss\", she nearly screams catching herself at the last second not wanting to wake her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Erin lies there for a few minutes recovering and basking in the afterglow. She then gets up, grabs her t-shirt, and sneaks back to her bedroom. There she collapses on the bed not even bothering to change first. She feels wierd about what just happened, but at the same time feels a sense of relief. All the tension is gone.</span></div></div>",

She looks over at the dildo and says, \"It's not wierd. I'm a girl now, so it's normal\". She then suddenly remembers what Ami said back at the transformation center. Once she accepted being a female having sex with a guy would seem normal. She looks at the dildo in her hand and says, \"Oh crap\". She stands there for a while with the water washing over her. \"This was the plan. It's not like I can turn back now. If I don't through with it Mark will be transformed and we'll both be pregnant together\", Erin thinks to herself. It's not that she finds the prospect of having sex with Mark revolting. It's just the opposite. The frightening part is the more she thinks about it the more turned on she's getting. It's like Ami said, last night when Erin masturbated accepting that she was now female it was like a switch was thrown in her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Erin gets out of the shower and stashes her toy without using it again. She's scared, excited, and horny as hell. She tries to distract herself by grabbing the boxes of clothes out of her car. Her Dad is already left for work and she's missing his help. A day ago this wouldn't have been a problem, but that was when she was Aaron the guy. Erin starts pulling out clothes trying to decide how to dress for Mark. \"Should I just dress skimpy, or would that freak him out. Maybe I should go casual\", Erin thinks outloud.</span></div></div>",

It's a scene of that reminds her of the entrance of Disney World just with people getting arrested. \"Idiots! Don't they know that an arrest means immediate transformation and insemination\", Erin says to herself? After she gets past she looks into the other cars to all the new women. She giggles to herself as more than a few are checking themselves out. \"That was me yesterday\", she laughs to herself. She wonders how many of them had Ami's help. By the looks of it not many. Erin turns her attention back to the road and drives towards Mark's. \"In another nine monthes the future of the human race will be born to those new women\" Erin muses. Erin's hand moves to her stomach and says outloud, \"And to me\". The gravity of everything hits her again. At this point though there is little to be done about it. She's set a course that has no side streets. She will have a baby. The only question is whether it will be Mark's or some random sperm donor. Not wanting to go through all this alone she detirmines it will be Mark's. \"He's my husband and I'm his sexy wife\", she says outloud trying to accept it all.</span></div></div>",

She's not sure why she's even hesitating. As Aaron she would just walk in and now as Erin she is Mark's wife. With that thought she knows why. Through that door is her new life. The person inside is no longer Mark her buddy and lifelong friend, but Mark her husband, soon to be lover, and father of there children. Erin feels her knees buckle and butterflies erupt in her stomach. \"What the hell have I done\", she thinks to herself. Up to now it's all been speculative and somewhat unreal. Now at his door it's very real. Erin feels the urge to turn and run, but to where. Just then the door open and Mark appears. \"Erin, Hi, I've been waiting for you all morning\", he says with a smile. You attempt to smile back. He takes her hand and leads her inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once inside she looks around. Mark has been cleaning. Erin shakes her head and says, \"Wow, trying to impress me\"? He blushes and shrugs. \"Shit Mark, I know how you are. Remember I'm still Aaron not some unsuspecting female you have to put up a front for\", Erin states. Mark seems relieved. \"So, how are we going to do this\", he asks nervously? Erin knows what her means. This is just as strange for him as it is her. Each of them just stands there waiting for the other to make the first move like a couple of virgins.</span></div></div>",

I accepted that the moment I step into the center. On top of that I'm your wife. We've known each other nearly all our lives. I don't think taking any more time is going to reveal much more. Also, we don't have six monthes. You need to read the small print. We have six monthes to have a viable pregnancy. Read the their definition of a viable pregnancy. They are looking at me to be 16 weeks pregnant at six monthes. That's nearly four monthes. That only leaves us two monthes to get the deed done. In that two monthes there are only two weeks that I'll be the most fertile, when our chances are the best. The first week is immediatly after the transformation, which is now. So, we only have the next few days until we have to wait until next mounth for our next shot.

She sits there gripping Mark tightly trying to hold on to the feeling. Mark's pulsing rod fills her. She can feel the warmth of his love juice spreading inside. Afterwards Mark........</span></div></div>",

He had no easy answers anymore...No promises of things will get better, or perhaps things my turn around. After losing his daughter and wife on the same night even he was beginning to lose hope..  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno son...Maybe a couple years..\" He said looking over to Aaron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the last year the riots and looting were getting a lot worse. It was commonplace for almost anyone to have a gun on them now as martial law had been in effect for the last 6 months. At the current rate of loss and with little sign of hope it was a bleak outlook for mankind. As now only without the women they regularly complained and joked about, did they realize how much they truly meant to them in the end....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Several Hundred Miles off the coast in a secret military missile testing site)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IS IT READY!?\" The young scientist called as he ran through the hallways with his partner as the blaring red alert sounded above them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had stolen the launch codes to the missile they needed to launch their device which would surely mean their death at this point but it was their only chance to save mankind. The footsteps of the soldiers were not far behind them as raced towards what the now rogue terrorists who had gained control of the longest range missile ever created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the launch site they quickly locked the door as the younger of the two scientists looked over to his partner who was carrying a small device in his arms as he begun attaching it to the missile. As he finished attaching the small device he looked over to his younger partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm inputting the launch codes hold them off a little longer!\" He called out heading to the small terminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying they are trying to override the door locks!\" The younger called out trying desperately to keep the door closed by scrambling the security sequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've almost got it!\" The elder said as the launch bay door began to open as the countdown to launch began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>One minute to launch...</i>\" The overhead called out as the scientists sighed with relief knowing their device would launch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it work?\" The younger said as his friend and partner walked over to him knowing it was over them but just beginning for everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes..I just hope those affected will see it as a blessing and not a curse...\" He said holding his friend's hand as the guards began to open the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been frantically searching for a way to grow a human female but with no live human wombs to work with their was little hope for humanity. However through genetic sequencing they had figured out how to alter an existing XY chromosome into an XX by exposure to a certain kind of radiation. They quickly realized that this special kind of radiation therapy was two small to affect the world on a grand scale so they searched for months until they realized there was only one source of radiation strong enough for them to use....the sun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey new that by exposing the entire worlds population to this radiation would change all males to female which would not fix the world's problem. So by tweaking the exposure levels they made it so it  would only affect those people were certain blood types. Roughly half of the world's population would be affected bringing balance and hope back to mankind. However they knew the risks of forcing half the men of the world to change their gender was no easy thing to ask so they built their device in secret and hijacked the only missile ever built that could travel close enough to the sun to release their device. Once released the device would alter the sun's ultraviolet radiation for a limited time but enough to expose everyone on Earth to it changing those with the chosen blood types.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two scientists watched as their device raced towards the skies the missile heading into the clouds as the door opened behind them as the security guards quickly shot them down where they stood... They were two late however as the missile rushed to the sky heading straight for the sun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Falling off the missile the device opened itself as what would look like a huge net with special pink plastic in-between began opening out of it spreading outwards like a giant contact lens. It began spreading wider and wider until finally reaching it's full size as it began activating itself as the pink material began glowing doing it's job of filtering the Sun's radiation to the people of Earth.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back at Aaron's house at the start of the story)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aaron listened to his father he couldn't help but sigh knowing it was true in his heart. As he turned around he was suddenly interupted by his father's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that?\" Joe said looking up at the sky<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron turned around seeing that somehow the sun had turned pink....Bright pink...no different than the color painted on countless nails of so many women back when they were around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad...Whats going on?\"Aaron said as he felt strangely warmer for some reason...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea  sun but I don't think we should be outside...\" Joe said taking his Son's hand and pulling him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll over the world people looked at the pink sun which lasted an entire day of Earth's rotation as a full moon appeared that night giving off a pink glow as well. Aaron could help but go outside several more times during the day and night feeling warmer in the pink glow. Like a tingling all in his body he couldn't explain. Once the day had passed the device stopped working as the normal yellow sun rose the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning Aaron woke up as usual as he looked outside his window and saw the normal bright blue sky and yellow sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it was a just a weird passing effect...\" He thought to himself as he woke up brushing the hair out of his eyes...wait...WHAT?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron normally has really short hair as he stood up and walked over to the mirror as saw his hair had grown overnight down to his ears...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" He said looking to himself as he looked down as saw his body looked normal except that his body hair had almost all fallen off over night. He saw piled of it in his bed as Aaron rushed to the shower trying to calm himself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shower as he scrubbed himself he saw chunks of his body hair just falling off...The more he wiped the quicker it fell off his body leaving nothing but pure smooth skin...Aaron's eyes widened as he looked down seeing how his body was now perfectly smooth like the day he was born .Save the now longer hair on his head which he could have sworn looked a bit longer now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping of the shower he looked at his smooth body wondering what could have caused this as he paniced for a minute realizing the pink sun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I have cancer now? Or something worse?\" He thought to himself as he dried off feeling a slight stinging in his nipples. Looking down they seemed bigger than before and a bit swollen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed he wore a long sleeve shirt and pants to cover himself as he combed his hair as best he could to desguise it. Downstairs his father was eating breakfast like normal when he saw Aaron and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dad?\" He asked looking around <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Joe said looking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that pink sun could have actually done something to people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows? We will have to see if was just a weird effect or something. My guess is it won't do anything. Hey you might wanna consider cutting your nails sometime it looks kinda girly no offense kiddo.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said pointing to Aaron's hands as he looked down his hands which normally had barely kept and often chewed nails looked a bit smaller and the nails were a bit longer and looked almost kept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...yeah...thanks..\" Aaron said playing it off normally as he made himself a small breakfast not feeling as hungry right now. Not sure how to the handle this he wasn't quite ready to share anything with his father yet till he had an idea of what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's your plan for today?\" Joe said looking over to Aaron<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron looked back remembering he had made plans as he tried to remember them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he walked by a neighbor's house he saw his father's friend George who lived with his young son Abel since the virus took his mother away. George was carrying Abel in his arms with a blanket covering him as he rushed to his car as a panicked look was on George's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad...I feel weird..my tummy hurts...\" Said a light almost girly voice from the blanket...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay son we are getting some help just hold on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron looked over and saw what looked like a skinny young feminine arm reveal itself from the blanket as a Abel turned his head revealing his now long flowing hair...His father quickly put him in the car and drove off before Aaron could even say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching his friend's house Aaron knocked on the door as he adjusted his pants. They felt weird almost longer then they should but tighter around the hips...After a few moments his Doug answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man...\" Doug said looking over to Aaron noticing something off. Since the virus and loosing his mom Doug and his brother lived with their drunk uncle who was rarely ever home..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dude what's up?\" Aaron said looking around for Doug's brother Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam is being weird, he won't come out of his room and hasn't all day. He watched that pink sun all day yesterday and now won't leave his room...You okay, you seem different...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen...can we talk as we go something is...happening...I think that sun gave off some weird radiation or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure man wanna check out the old mall?\" He said as they went outside together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mall downtown was the main hangout spot for them back in high school where they wasted almost all their free time hopelessly trying to pick up chicks or get caught sneaking into R-rated movies. Now it was abandoned, all the female stores closed over night and when the looting and riots took place later the city had it shut down. Now it was just a hall of memories for Aaron and George as they walked downtown sneaking into the mall together looking at what was leftover. As they walked to the mall they saw more and more ambulances going by as people covering themselves all seemed to be heading to the public health center a few blocks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder whats going on?\" George said looking over to Aaron who was now leaned up against a wall panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you okay man?\" He said as Aaron gripped his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...its my hips...it feels like something is pushing them out from the inside...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he held his sides Aaron's eyes looked down as he felt a sudden popping feeling from his body as he saw his hips widening a bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats going on with you man your starting to look a little....different...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine....I just think the sun did something to me...\" Aaron said panting as his whole body starting to feel hot..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Are you getting sick or something?\" George said as he began to get a little freaked out as he swore he could see Aaron's hair starting to get a bit longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine I just need to....<span class=\"chotpink\">AAAHH!</span>\" Aaron cried out in a voice that was not his but that sounded very...female...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling over Aaron felt a sharp pain in his legs like they were burning as he kicked off his shoes as his eyes widened...His feet were smaller and much more petite. They reminded him of his sister's feet...They were girl's feet. Panting Aaron reached for his waist as he pulled down his pants as what he saw shocked him. A pair of beautiful female legs hung from his body. Perfectly smooth and slender with small dainty feet at the end....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge looked over to Aaron not sure what to think as he looked down at the sexy female legs his best friend now had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what's going on?\" He said nervously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know....I think it has something to do with the sun turning pink...\" Aaron said as he suddenly gripped his stomach as a sudden tightness and heat hit his body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think its spreading...\" He said struggling to hold on as George had to figure out a way to help his friend...</span></div></div>",

In his heart he knew what they were but he was unable to admit it, even to himself. As he tried to stand he felt himself off balance as if his body was much heavier than it was before. His new legs were not as strong and not used to his upper body weight yet. As George rushed over to help his friend he couldn't help but notice what he looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude....are you turning into a chi...?\" He asked before Aaron shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO....I'M JUST...SICK...I WILL BE OKAY...!\" Aaron interrupted him not even wanted to think about that possibility right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to lie down...get some rest...\" Aaron side rubbing his chest as his nipples felt more and more sensitive as he couldn't see yet under his shirt that they were swollen and larger. Reaching down Aaron tried to put his pants back on but they were much to large and long in the legs now as he seems to have lost almost a foot in height as he was now a barely 5'7. He struggled with they but they would not fit on him comfortably enough to walk in as he stood there in his boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man can you look around and find me something to wear?\" He said in an frustrated tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked together as George came by a closed female clothing store that had been forced open most likely months ago by looters looking for money or valuables inside. Walking around the shelves and items were all in disarray but he found a nice pair white short shorts and some pink flip flops that looked about his size.  He knew Aaron would hate this but he wasn't going to let his friend's stubborn denial stop him from getting the help he needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the mall Aaron had found an old restroom and without even thinking walked into the female side as he needed to get a view of these changes....Looking in the mirror he saw his hair was now past his ears in length and tickling the tops of his shoulders. It also seemed a bit lighter then before, his natural light brown seemed to be getting more blonde. Taking a deep breath he dropped his boxers as his eyes went wide with terror....While his member was still there it looked like that of a toddler. It was tiny and totally smooth as he lifted it up and noticed something he knew shouldn't be there...A line...A vertical line, that looked the beginning of a slit. His thoughts began to swirl like a whirlwind inside his mind. How could this have happened...am I really turning into a girl, is there a cure? These questions plus a million more pounded against his head as a sudden familiar heat and pressure returned to his body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...god...please...stop...\" He grunted as he felt the pressure center in his ass as he turned around as saw his flesh beginning to move as he leaned over the counter and spread his legs trying to relieve the tension but it didn't help as he saw his ass began to swell and change as it took on a perfect tear drop shape in the matter of minutes....He now had a perfectly rounded and shaped female ass as he was almost completely female from the waste down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man WHERE ARE YOU?\" sounded George from the hallway as Aaron pulled up boxers and went to find him. As he walked his hips had an almost natural sway to them that he didn't even notice as he walked. Finding George it only took a moment to see how much more Aaron had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen man..I know you don't wanna hear this but I think your becoming more like...a girl...whatever is happening we gotta get you to a hospital now..\" George said seeing Aaron nodding lightly with his head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here these should fit...I know they are not what you want but its all I could find.\" George said as he tossed Aaron the shorts and flip flops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron looked to them as he couldn't believe what he was suggesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...just...turn around okay?\" Aaron said as he sighed waiting for George to turn around as he pulled on the shorts surprised at how well they fit. The flip flops fit well too as Aaron looked down to himself. If know one could see him from the waist up he would look just right an attractive young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\" George asked as Aaron walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets just get out of here before this gets any worse...\" He said not knowing that this was just the tip of the Iceberg....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the boys left the mall they made an emergency call to Aaron's dad who was watching everything unfold on the news. It was everywhere men turning into women all over the planet. The news team was trying to best to showcase the chaos but with several of their own members starting to change it made it hard to even broadcast the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the call came in from his son Paul's eyes widened as he realized what must be happening to him. Rushing out he saw the boys by the abandoned mall as rushed by in his truck to pick them up. Looking at them thankfully George looked just fine but when he saw his son his eyes went wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...Aaron...are you okay?\" His son barely looked like himself. His hair was longer growing past his ears as his entire lower frame looked female now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad...What's...what's happening to me?\" Aaron said as tears began to fill his eyes. He was scared and unsure about how to process this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry son we'll get you some help, I saw the news apparently this is happening all over.\" Putt the boys in the back of his truck he quickly sped off towards the hospital but when they got within several miles a massive roadblock greeted them. A massive traffic jam at least several miles long as the view of people abandoning their cars and beginning to run towards the hospital. Aaron and George looked out the window to see people trying to rush to the hospital as it looked like they were all turning more and more feminine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on boys...We're going on foot...\"Paul said looking to boys in the back as Aaron was gripping his chest panting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad..I don't think I'm gonna make it...I'm starting to feel...hot...\" was all he could say as he looked down pinching his legs together then at his hands were were smaller and more petite as his fingernails seemed longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on dude I'll help you...\"George Said put his friend's arm around him as they got out of the truck together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three began to walk towards the hospital past what seemed like hundreds of other guys all struggling to hold back the change. However as they walked farther and farther they began to notice something odd. The more they walked the less people they saw walking. More and more people were slowing down or falling to their knees as they reached the final stages of their transformation. That's when they saw it....Women...Actual women fully changed and passed out with their families looking over to them. It seemed like the final stage of the change forced to the victim to lose conciseness as they saw countless new women alseep on the road or in their cars. Those not quite there yet were moaning in what almost seemed like pleasure as Aaron looked around seeing other people moaning and groaning as they clutched their chests and crotches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot willing to just give in yet Aaron clutched his chest as he felt his pecs were softer and starting to swell a bit. His hair was now tickling his shoulders as he finally saw the hospital on the horizon.</span></div></div>",

People the world around turned towards one bright spot in the sky; the spot outshone the moon and was even visible during the day as a pink torrent of light emanating as if from a pulsar,the lighthouse of the cosmos. It was a beacon and all who witnessed it wished it to be one of hope. Then as the wave of pink light approached and enveloped the denizens of Earth the fear set in like the excitement of reaching the top of the track on a roller coaster. The world stood still.<br>\r\n    Then the wave ebbed and the excitement abated only to be replaced by panic at what was revealed after the pink haze cleared. All around them every man could see that he was surrounded by women and every guy thought he had perhaps died and gone to some sort of paradise. That was of course the story for a small time gardener named Joe. <br>\r\n    \" Oh my god Aaron it's your sister. Come quick look\" <br>\r\n      \" Really\" replied the woman standing next to Joe. She turned around to face him.<br>\r\n       \" Wwww...hat\" gulped Aaron<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Both of the newly formed women stared at each other in shock.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Alright everyone, now in the majority if not all of my stories so far, a single person or small group of people are aware of the transformation and its circumstances. So I thought it was about time I tried my hand at a large scale transformation, similar to the famed Great Shift, except this story will be a worldwide gender change instead of body swap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story is set in the near future in which a deadly virus of unknown origin has killed every female on Earth, and without the possibility of reproduction the remnants of mankind have been left to a slow lonely death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the world\u2019s greatest minds secretly ban together to give humanity a fighting chance. Cloning wasn\u2019t an option, the lack of genetic diversity would set humanity back generations, and simply cloning another generation from the current one would lead to even more issues. The world needed women that\u2019s all there is to it. So after exhausting all other options they found a way to turn certain men into women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if they were to openly announce their plan the public would be critical and any of the few early volunteers would be shunned and ridiculed, so they figured their only choice was to overload their machine and use it on the entire world at once, without warning, just as the pandemic had taken, they would restore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow pretty much anything goes but try and keep it relevant to the idea, and please:<br>\r\n1. When adding content make it meaningful and try to make it at least a solid paragraph, if it\u2019s just pointless fillers it\u2019s gone. <br>\r\n2. No mental changes, they are still guys on the inside that is what makes the adjustment interesting<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I want to see my stories grow but if I\u2019m the only one writing it\u2019s no fun. So if you have any comments or suggestions please feel free to send me a message, I would be more than happy to take requests. So please add, and help me make this story a success.<br>\r\n</td>",
