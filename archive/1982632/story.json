The vision continues and shows a crowd forming around Chelsea, pointing and laughing at her, calling her cruel names. Finally Chelsea can't take it anymore and breaks down crying, a few seconds later the vision ends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven was shocked to learn that one of her classmates was about to wet herself, but she isn't really surprised by the fact, that Chelsea of all people was the one who was about to have a very embarrassing  accident, after all  her best friend always had a rather short attention span. In fact Raven even still remembers that Chelsea used to have wetting accidents very often as the both were still in pre-school. She just always assumed that her best friend had outgrown that habit over a decade ago, but right now she wasn't so sure about that anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Raven only knew too well, that right now wasn't the right time to think about it if such embarrassing wet accidents were still a regular problem for Chelsea or if was only an one time thing, since she had to prevent her vision from becoming true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then an interesting idea formed in Raven's mind, maybe it was for Chelsea's own good to wet herself in front of the crowd, yes maybe her best friend needed to experience that humiliating hair-raiser in order for her to finally learn the importance of setting her priorities right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end Raven decided to<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Raven also remembered the time Chelsea had made fun of her after she had wet herself at a movie theater, needless to say, 2 and a half hour movie plus very large soft drink(along with a large bottle of water beforehand) equals full bladder, Raven would've got up if the movie wasn't so good, so she resigned to crossing her legs and grabbing herself as tightly as she could, somehow she actually made it through the whole film, by the end she felt like her entire body was drowning in urine, she waddled her way to the ladies as fast as she could, but the line was just too long, she almost considered going into the men's room, but it's line was nearly as long.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate and in a panic, Raven had wandered outside the theater, trying to find a spot, any spot to go, she saw a large trashcan, Raven had given up on modesty by this point, as she had already let lose some spurts into her underwear and shorts. She quickly yanked down her shorts and moved into position over the trashcan, she went to remove her boy shorts next but the flood had already begun, a massive jet of urine gushed out between her legs and through her panties like a garden hose, her pee went on for well over a minute, her longest by far(beating her record from the last time she went trick or treating on Halloween, she'd accepted a dare to hold it in until they were done gathering treats, fortunately for her, the last person whom she visited was gracious enough to let her use her bathroom).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven's piss stream finally subsided and she moaned in relief, Chelsea couldn't help but laugh, \"hey look, it's Old Faithful!\" she chuckled, Raven turned every shade of red imagineable, then hopped off the trash can, trying to wring the urine out of her panties as best as she could, she then grabbed some tissues to wipe herself off, then slid her shorts back on before anyone saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the present, Raven ultimately decided not to help Chelsea, it was for her own good and it she needed a dose of karma.  Raven then realized the location of the vision, it was at the talent show tomorrow, Chelsea had been planning to show off how double-jointed she was with some exercise poses, it would be very difficult for her to hold herself without anyone noticing, making it very likely she would wet herself in front of the entire school. Raven wondered, should she go out of her way to make Chelsea desperate, or just do nothing, or take a third option?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Raven gasped in shock, in her vision, Alana had just wet herself in front of everyone in gym class!  It was a massive accident as well, with pee shooting from between her legs right through her purple running shorts, her face had turned every single shade of red imaginable and she looked like she was on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Alana and her two sidekicks got on Raven's nerves, she still hadn't forgotten about the good times they had together as friends, and she wasn't going to let Alana get humiliated like that.  Lately Raven had tried not interfering with her visions since they usually either came true anyways or turned out worse, but that hadn't worked out either, she'd had visions of both Nikki and Serena wetting themselves and decided against interfering. The former was still unpleasant to her even after Raven turned down an opportunity to totally humiliate her with that picture(though the poison ivy still got her good), and she couldn't help the latter even if she wanted to, as Serena had finally given up on trying to prove that she was psychic, and trying to help her would've only aroused more suspicion, which she did not need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGym class was coming up next, and Raven had to warn Alana ASAP, she rushed into the women's locker room, it didn't take her long to spot Alana, who had just finished off a 40 oz water bottle, she was shifting her weight slightly to indicate her desperation.  Raven quickly walked over, \"Alana!\" she yelled abruptly, causing the latina girl to jump in surprise and quickly clutch herself, \"what the hell is your problem?!\" Alana snapped.  \"Girl you like you really \"gotta go\" if you know what I mean, so maybe you should \"go\" Raven replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlana retorted \"Not that it's any of your business, but there's no way i'm using a public bathroom, you have any idea how many germs are on those seats?  I always hold it til get home.  \"say what?\" Raven replied in surprise.  Muffy and Loka quickly chimed in, \"Alana's got a cast-iron bladder, she once had two Mega Gulps and made it all the way through Titanic\".  \"But\" Raven stammered, I saw you wetting yourself in gym in front of everybody!\".  Alana groaned out loud, \"Aye Chica, not this psychic nonsense again, I already got that crazy Puta Serena harassing me about you, I don't want to hear anymore of this\", she then stormed out of the locker room with Loka and Serena following behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Raven do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
