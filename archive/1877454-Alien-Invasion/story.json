Oh and note that there will not be a listing for the alien species, so you can just put in an alien species that is attacking and say they are from star wars, mass effect, or say you just made it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSize Diffrence: The invading aliens are significantly bigger (Or smaller) than humans<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTechnological diffrence: Either the humans have equal or more advanced technology, or they are primitive (More primitive, as in things like the cavemen, medival, classic, etc, anything lower than what we have today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZombie invasion: The humans are already at war with zombies, so the aliens have to take care of them first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFallout: Self-explanitory, the world is in wastelands, there are factions everywhere, there are guns and energy weapons, and there is alot of radiation and mutants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The point of this was to demonstrate the ability to co-operate with each other in a combat situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivate (PTE) John Porter was 19 years old, joined the Army as soon as he hit 17. John was assigned to B Company, 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. He was a good shot, all though his firearm was a standard EF88 Austeyr, he was capable of firing weapons such as the HK-417. John's company had returned from a simulated combat scenario against a USMC company. He, like everyone else, was knackered and went to sleep as soon as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was a typical Aussie bloke, he had light brown hair, blue eyes and was 6\"2 with a muscular build. All his life he had wanted to be in the Army, after his father before him, and his father before him. In the middle of his sleep, he was woken by the Staff Sergeant, who went from room to room, waking everyone up and informing them on briefing in five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the rest of the young males in his room, he got up and threw on his boots, shirt and prepared his bed.<br>\r\n\"Another night ops...\" commented one of John's mates, Bryan Pearce. Bryan was a Lance Corporal, but was a chilled individual, and only wanted to be addressed as 'Lance Corporal' went a senior NCO or CO was present. He had ash blonde hair and brown eyes, with a prominent jaw. Bryan was around the same height and build as John. <br>\r\n\"Not enough beauty sleep for ya'?\" asked John with a grin on his face. Bryan smirked and jokingly told him to \"bugger off\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a briefing, the entirety of B Coy was in Bushmaster PMVs and moblised to react to an intrusion that was said to be within the training facility. All though the ammunition that was supplied were live rounds, the men of John's Squad spoke while riding in the Bushmaster, and came to their own conclusion that it was just an exercise. </span></div></div>",
