How you hated school could be compared with you being gifted a Volkswagon Bug wile your younger brother got a convertible  Corvet. And he wouldnt even be able to drive! Thats the hatred you expierienced. But since you really wanted a good collage you kept yourself up all night for extra credit crap. <br>\r\nAfter your day of torture as you were driving home, you saw a nice looking completly black van a few cars behind you. You foolishly made it no attention but went along and pulled into the driveway of your parents condo.<br>\r\n\"Mom! Dad! im home!\"you souted at the walls. no answer. You walked in the kitchen to grab a snack and noticed a strange not on the island. \"Hi honey. went for groeceories be back soon love you.\" You read a loud. Hmmmpphh mom never talks that way...Or leave notes for that matter. But you headed this secound warning no attentioneither and proceeded to play call of duty instead. After mowing down zombies for a few minutes there was a hard nock on the door. \"Yeah? who is it?\" you shouted engulfed in your game.<br>\r\n\"Goverment officails!\" the gruff voice shouted. \"Now open this damn door!!\" <br>\r\nNow they had your attention. You quickly run to the door and yank it open to be met with the barrel of a shotgun. \"Y-yes h-how can i help you officor?\" you mumble to the shotgun.<br>\r\n\"You can stick your hands in the air and walk to the chair.\" he replied. You were all to ready to obey the gruff voice. Once he and several others where in the room surrounding you, a couple sniggering at your high score. \"Why are you guys here?\" you ask friendly enough. \"We came here looking for a Myth ya seen one?\" the same gruff voice asked.<br>\r\n\"Whats a Myth? you mean like centaurs and medusas? or dragon type Myths?\"<br>\r\n\"Stop playing with us!\"Another shouted.<br>\r\n\"Honestly i dont know!\" You pleaded.<br>\r\n\"Fine. They are mythica animals that can look like humans but can change on there own thoughts.\"<br>\r\nyou chuckle slightly. \"Sounds pretty stupid to me.\" you chuckle to the room.<br>\r\n\"Fine pretty boy.\"Another said from the doorway.\"But this meter says your what we want.\"<br>\r\n\"What!?\" you exclaim. \"I cant turn into anything!\" But the room refuses to believe you.<br>\r\n\"Sure pretty boy, sure. We all believe you. right boys?\" said the man in the door.<br>\r\nthey all mumble there assent but with a certian sarcastic tone. \"To prove it we will let you get back to what you were doing and forget all about this. OK?\"<br>\r\n\"OK.\" you mumble watching his every move.<br>\r\nthey left soon after without a word. Leaving you with thoughts of what you actually are...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The conversation this morning dominated your thoughts all day, distracting you from your classes, but you still couldn't get what he mentioned out of your head. Your grandfather was old and probably senile, so he probably had no idea what he was even saying. A minotaur, really? How is that even possible? You weren't Greek, your father wasn't a bull, and most importantly: minotaurs don't exist. Still, you couldn't help but wonder why you kept ruminating over this nonsense conversation so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been walking back from classes, and without practice to go to or friends to hang out with, you only real course of action was to head back home. Something in the corner of your eye knocked you from your thoughts: a large, black van, which you realized had been following you since you left the high school. It was so stereotypical it was almost funny. The van suddenly swerved, rapidly making a u-turn into the parking lot you were walking through, causing its tires to squeal and numerous honks from nearby drivers. The van's driver didn't seem to care, though, as it continued barreling towards you. You take this opportunity to book it; you have no idea why the wannabe CIA is chasing you, and you honestly don't want to find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you run into a nearby alleyway, you hear the van come to a screeching halt, and quickly look behind you. Four people with heavy gear and weapons you don't recognize jump out of the van, clearly intent on pursuing you. As you face forward, you hear one of your hunters shout \"don't let him get away!\" and you attempt to pick up your pace, hoping to have enough of a lead to lose them somewhere along the line. They wouldn't want to reveal themselves by chasing a poor, innocent teen through a shopping district, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently not. As you make your way out of the alleyways, you hurriedly turn into the first store you see, diving underneath the front windowpane and praying you are out of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper gives you a quizzical look and starts to ask what you are doing, before noticing the armed men running past the large display window. He pauses, then gestures his head back, signaling you to head into the store's back room. You just barely make it inside and manage to close the door before one of the faux Secret Service members starts interrogating the shopkeeper. You place your ear to the door and try to listen in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, welcome to -\" smirking, the shopkeeper sarcastically tries to introduce the store with his usual sales pitch before being interrupted. <br>\r\n\"Have you seen a teenager running through here? Male, young adult, Caucasian, short brown hair, wearing high school dress code: a gray polo, and black dress pants.\" The agent's voice was completely monotone, but still imposing and demanding.<br>\r\n\"That might just be the most generic description I've ever heard. You pro'ly just described half the kids in town. Do ya mind being a little more descriptive? Was he armed? 'Cause you clearly are.\" The shopkeeper continues smirking, his tone still deadpan, but a touch more serious. <br>\r\n\"Sir, if you aren't willing to cooperate-\"<br>\r\n\"You'll what? Arrest me? Who are you working with anyway? I don't see a badge, and I highly doubt you have a warrant.\" The store owner's face changed completely: he was now glaring at the agent and spoke sharply. The agent deeply inhaled and quickly exhaled through his nostrils. Realizing that the owner wasn't willing to be agreeable, he decided arguing with the old man would be completely fruitless. <br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir. I'll be on my way,\" he said acerbically, clearly unsatisfied with the encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're clear, kid,\" he whispered, keeping his eyes on the agent the entire time as he left the shop. Crawling out of the backroom, the owner looked at you with a scrutinizing glare, as you did the same, finally taking in the chance to observe where you ended up. The shopkeeper was an older man, likely in his mid-fifties, tall as well as muscular, he looked like he was more fitting in the army than running a store. Looking around, you finally notice that you were in a glass and pottery store, and are somewhat surprised nothing was damaged in the whole ordeal. \"You know what he was doing?\" You turn your attention back towards the shopkeeper, vehemently shaking your head side-to-side. \"Ya lyin' to me?\" You continue shaking your head. He sighs, then begins talking again. \"I ain't a fan of teenagers, but I'm even less a fan of the feds, and he looked way too dangerous to be chasing some kid around.\" You breathe a sigh of relief. He begins to walk out of the back of the store and mentions to you that it'd probably be safer to wait here for a while, until they've completely cleared out, before going back to tend the wares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting a few hours, you finally figure it's safe enough to head home. Before you leave the store, you grab a business card, which reads: \"The Kiln. Handmade glassware and pottery. Hector T., owner.\" You stick it in your wallet before quickly sprinting through the shopping district towards your house, carefully watching to see if you're being followed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally arrive back at home, exhausted and confused, and decide to...</span></div></div>",

You were an athlete, and a good one at that; fast, a bit strong, and a good aim. There was no reason you should ever feel weak. Yet here you were, waiting outside your grandfather's room, after nearly having been hunted down with no explanation, having the slight notion that his ridiculous story might actually be true. <br>\r\n\"I am, Stephen. What's the issue?\" You sigh. On one hand, you have absolutely no idea how to explain what happened to you without it sounding completely absurd. On the other, it's your grandfather who mentioned the whole minotaur thing, so there's a vague hope has some insight into what happened.<br>\r\nYou slowly open the door and look around. It's not a large bedroom by any means, but it's sizeable enough. Granddad is sitting on his bed, a book on his lap he was reading with the light from the lamp on the nightstand. You take a deep breath and explain everything that happened. Watching his face as you describe your ordeal, you notice his expression quickly change from puzzlement to dread. You hear him curse under his breath before looking up at you, a look of pity in his eyes. <br>\r\n\"I'm so, so sorry Stephen. I was hoping you might be able to avoid all this, but I guess I was wrong.\" The confused look on your face told Granddad how little you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A long, long time ago, our family was cursed. Every few generations, the firstborn son would be not fully a man, also an animal, specifically a bull.\" You stand there completely dazed. You're hearing what he's saying, but you're not quite comprehending it. Curses? Bull men? This goes against every single thing you know about reality. \"That's why I'm not, but I know so much about it. My brother Simon, your grand-uncle was. I saw him change, I saw what he could do, and it was incredible.\"  You listen but are more concerned with who the stranger-danger posse in the black van was. \"The Knights. They fancy themselves as dragon slayers, making their goal to completely eradicate any monster that looks like a man.\" He emphasizes the last part oddly, obviously mocking their mantra. \"They weren't all that scary when I was younger and helping my brother, but I guess they must've been able to commandeer modern technology into their hunting regime.\" He pauses, sighing wistfully and shaking his head softly before continuing. \"That's how Simon died. Not a car accident, but the Knights finally finding him.\" He looks as if he as more to say, but is unable to speak the words. You let the silence linger for a bit, giving your grandfather a moment to collect himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you mention that while this all sounds awful, being hunted for your life for something you had no choice over, but are confused because earlier he sounded so enthusiastic about it. \"Because part of it is! You can do astounding things, amazing feats of strength and power.\" He was almost awestruck, obviously recalling what he had seen years ago. \"But I didn't know the Knights were even more dangerous. I had hoped that they just...went away. Gave up and moved on with their lives or some such nonsense.\" You roll your eyes. That was naive, and honestly a bit stupid of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, I guess it's time for me to give you this, then.\" He says, tossing the blankets off his lap and getting up to look in the nightstand drawer. Shuffling around a bit, he pulls out a small, partially transparent bag, within which you can see a small brass ring. \"It'll help you control your powers, letting you decide when to change. I'm not quite sure how it works, unfortunately,\" he mentions, placing the small bag in your hands, clasping his own around yours. \"Listen to me,\" his voice completely serious. \"These people want nothing more to see you dead and your head over their fireplace, but I believe - no, I know - that you have the strength, the power, to destroy any enemy that comes in your path.\" You nod as he takes his hands away, utterly unsure of how to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head to your room down the hall, you...</span></div></div>",

Shane couldnt say anything because of the muzzle on his mouth. The knight said \"Ah yes, sorry about the muzzle, but you dragons are unpredictable when it comes to using an array of breath attacks\" Shane had a confused look on his face which made the knight chuckle  \"You dont know, do you? Alright let me fill you in, you my friend are a mythical creature or myth for short, your ancestors were myths who could shapeshift into humans, and as each descendent was born into human care they eventually became unaware of the power they held within themselves and many lived their lives never finding out.\"<br>\r\nHe took the cuffs and shackles off of Shane, then removed the muzzle.

Shane thinks for a moment and then nods. \"This will only hurt slightly\" the knight says as he takes out a vile and injects it into Shane. Shane feels woozy and says \"What did you do?\" The knight replies \"Dont worry, this will just speed up your transformation\" The knight steps back as the transformation begins.<br>\r\nShanes eyes change to reptillian eyes then his body begins to grow and his bones begin to shift. A tail grows from his spine. Spines grew out all along his back town to his tail. His legs shift and he falls onto all fours, claws grow out from his hands and feet. His face lengthens and his teeth become razor sharp, two horns grow from the back of his head. Two leathery wings grow out of his back and flap weakly.<br>\r\nBefore the knight was a ten ft tall, fifteen ft long pale skinned dragon, then right infront of the knights eyes, red scales grew out all over the dragons body, the underbelly was yellow.

Daren had been out of college for almost two years and already he was landing huge roles in many new movies slated for 2120. One of those movies was based on a video game series known as Fire Emblem. Ages ago another series was inspired by Fire Emblem, but it was based in a world that is almost the reality that Daren lives in now minus ufos or alternate dimensions. Daren was getting ready for his next movie called Fantasia: Rise of the Dragons. Fantasia was said to be an upcoming video game series that takes place in the far future, where a couple of knights discover a civilization of dragons. His girlfriend Laurel Mc'King is an out of town actress who just recently moved to the area and had been dating Daren for a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There that should do it.

Your subjects have also found a lost civilization of dragons and are inquiring on what action you plan to take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silver Knights? Didn't they exist a long time ago when knights used to fight off creatures of myth such as dragons, fairies and other monsters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what Laurel told me.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Long ago in medieval times, there were mythical creatures living in harmony with humans. They traded &amp; coexisted together. Mythical creatures then started to gain abilities to transform into humans as well. But there was a confrontation between the humans &amp; the mythical creatures. The humans started getting greedy &amp; stealing treasures from all the myths. The myths then started to retaliate &amp; attack the human settlements. Humans started to be determined to wipe out all the myths so that they will no longer be hunted by the myths. Some myths started hiding in their human forms to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn modern day, mythical creatures still exist but are hiding in their human forms. There is also an anti-myth group known as the Silver Knights. They use high tech devices to locate &amp; exterminate myth creatures. Some myth creatures are not aware of what they are due to being raised in human societies.</td>",
