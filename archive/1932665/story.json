It jolted you awake, but you tried to fight it and return to the realm of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that a 'no', little man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo......!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I don't want ya to end up with bruises like last time. You know it's a little hard for me to pick you up when I'm still reeling into sobriety after waking up.\" A thud slammed down far, far away, sounding like a 'click' of a fingernail hitting something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiiine...\" You grumble, sitting up and rubbing your eyes. \"Could've let me sleep at least a couple more hours, Calpernia...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one in the afternoon.\" The sultry, booming voice echoed from high above, each vowel deafened by the sheer magnitude and the distance between the source of the goddess's voice and you. You sit up, stretching and yawning, gazing high, high above, the enormous shadow of some vast figure looming, so massive you couldn't take in all of it, only blurry fractions here and there. You looked out and around your 'bed', while in actuality it was simply a thread of clothing fiber, so thick it was like a plain to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't have much to do...\" You retort by yelling up with all of your might, always hating to strain your voice so but you were used to it by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course ya do.\" The enormity shifted, revealing the glorious sky of a woman's face staring down, some of her white-blonde hairs like gigantic pillars spilling over and slamming down with erupting force nearby, their impact making you jump in the air slightly. She huffed, a fog of greyish-black clouds like an oncoming storm blotting out her face. Really had to convince her to stop smoking one of these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" You crossed your homes. \"What's so important ya had to wake me up from my beauty sleep?\" You joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalpernia snickered and rolled her eyes, and even though you couldn't see it, you could hear it, like a thousand rollercoasters going off in the distance. \"Well, wise-guy, today...\"</span></div></div>",

Whilst you definitely appreciated everything she had done for you over the years, few things were less appealing than going inside her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I promised I wouldn't swallow!\" she countered, as if that made everything okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saying that doesn't fill me with confidence. Besides, it's not being swallowed that I'm worried about... it's the smell. You smoke a lot, so it's not exactly going to be pleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad breath? You're worried about bad breath? Boy, get in there!\" she practically ordered, opening her mouth as if to devour you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered you past her red lips and onto her slimy tongue, where you were instantly hit by the stench of her breath. Then the tongue moved erratically as her voice boomed. \"IT'S WAY IN THE BACK THERE, ON THE RIGHT. MY RIGHT THAT IS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe you should have said that before putting me in your mouth!\" you responded, picking yourself off the floor. You figured you should get this done as quickly as possible. The smell of smoke lingered in the air as you began to trek to the mountainous molars at the back of Calpernia's mouth. At least she was leaving her mouth open slightly so as you could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you made your way back there, you realised how crazy this whole ordeal was. All for a bit of food scrap stuck between her teeth... Though Calpernia gave her word she wouldn't swallow, it was definitely a real possibility now that you were in her mouth. You knew you'd survive the experience if it came to it, but a prolonged stay in Calpernia's stomach was not your idea of a nice time. You didn't even want to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalpernia's tongue was like the surface of an alien world. The bumpy surface coated in moisture undulated under your feet. It was going to be some time before you reached the place she wanted you to check. Damn it, couldn't she have dropped you closer? This was probably payback for saying her breath smells. Being in her mouth really amplified the distinct smokey smell.This was not your first time inside of Calpernia though. You had been inside both ears several times, her nose exactly once (which was more than enough) and her mouth twice before today. You had never wanted to venture any deeper into her, or anyone else for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou became a bit more nervous when everything went dark due to Calpernia closing her mouth. What was she doing out there? You began to panic more as the tongue started to shift. Was she about to swallow?</span></div></div>",

The tongue itself was tipping, causing you to slide down it at an alarming rate. \"Calpernia, wait! Don't swallow!\" You called out in vain. It was too late. You were caught in a deluge of sticky saliva and swept into her gaping gullet. There was a loud GULP as Calpernia swallowed you. You fell down her throat, calling out to her as you entered her esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell this was a first. You hadn't been eaten by anyone before. You never thought it'd be Calpernia that did it. This was definitely going to be an interesting experience. Part of you was actually kind of glad and excited to see what it was like inside Calpernia's belly. Falling through her food pipe, you travelled down through her chest and into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived in her stomach, dropping down into the gross remains of breakfast. The stench was atrocious and the heat staggering. You picked yourself off the mountain of sausage mush and looked around Calpernia's colossal stomach. It was gigantic beyond words. The noises of digestion drowned out practically everything else, but for Calpernia's heart beating up in her chest somewhere above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a loud but muffled voice, unmistakably Calpernia's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NO... I SWALLOWED HIM! SORRY ALAN! BUT DON'T WORRY, YOU'LL BE SAFE INSIDE ME! IT JUST MIGHT TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE YOU COME OUT OF ME...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that was going to be the likeliest method of escape. You knew you were going to go all the way through Calpernia's digestive system... For now though, you were in the belly of the beast. Calpernia's stomach. Might as well have some fun with this situation, eh?</span></div></div>",

You and Alan have decided that the best place for you to live on him is in his deep belly button. There you have enough room to put a mansion to your scale and still have about enough room to put two football stadiums next to one another. Besides being very spacious, the lint in his navel is abundant, so you had plenty of clothes, fabrics, and bedding from Alan's lint. The smell didn't get so bad either (not that it matters with your use of body oder). Your family even got you a lot of electronics, furniture, art, and other things to make you feel normal and cozy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay sis! To my belly button you go!\" Alan said as he licked his index finger and places it on top of you. With you stuck on his finger, Alan pushed you all the way to the bottom of his belly button. You being used to it peeled yourself from the swirl of wrinkles and folds that is the bottom of his belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks bro!\" You responded. You continued to walk in the fleshy cave you know as both your brother's navel, as well as your room. You undressed and put your clothes in your hamper. Completely naked, you continued to walk to your wardrobe, taking out a pair of silky lint panties, fleece lint pj pants, and a cotton lint robe.

Must have been something I ate.\" Alan held his belly with his other hand, feeling the immense discomfort from within. \"Something isn't right in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll just have to sleep somewhere else tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that's one option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed his god-like face change it's expression. Another guttural rumble came from down in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Well what else am I gonna do?\" you ask, curious as to what his alternative was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go inside me and fix my stomach ache...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely awestruck by this suggestion. Never had such a thought occurred to you and you never believed you'd hear such an idea from your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go... inside you?\" you utter aloud, watching him nod sheepishly. \"Like... into your stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're small enough to go in and fix whatever is upsetting my stomach.\" he elaborated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I have to go inside your stomach... that means you'd have to eat me.\" you continue to verbalize your train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah. I'll eat you and then you'll land in my stomach and can start looking for the problem. Once you've fixed it, you'll be able to go back to sleep and I'll feel a lot better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched his giant mouth move as he spoke, observing it in a way you had never done in the past. You took a moment to compose yourself before you spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... so let me get this straight. I've got two choices. Either I sleep somewhere I'm not used to, probably out in the open and exposed to unknown danger, or... I take a trip down your throat and wander around in your belly looking for something I don't know how to fix...but I'd be safe, with you... or in you... and it's probably going to be really gross, but also... kind of cool. Um... okay. This is not how I thought my evening would go... Right. Okay, I've made my decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched his antsy expression change, his eyes flickering with a strange excitement. He spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what's it gonna be sis?\"</span></div></div>",

You would soon be going in through that mouth, on a journey into the grossest place currently imaginable - Alan's upset stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Thanks sis, I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, he opened his black-hole of a mouth and moved his finger toward it. The closer you got the warmer you felt. Darkness fell as you were plunged into his maw and shaken from the ridges of his fingertip. You landed with a wet splat on the middle of his tongue, which seemed like an alien landscape at your nigh microscopic size. You watched his monolithic finger retract from the mouth and what little light you had vanish as he closed his mouth. You were overcome by his powerful breath, giving this new environment a very distinct atmosphere. The organic floor squelched beneath your feet as you tried to adjust to being inside Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could do much else, a great rush of saliva surrounded you and swept you into Alan's throat as he quickly swallowed you with a powerful gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah. Down you go, good luck sis!\" he said to his still gurgling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you were falling through his esophagus, passing through his chest cavity as he said those words. All around you, the sounds of his breathing and heartbeat resonated powerfully. After a lengthy fall, you entered the rancid chamber of his gargantuan stomach. There, you fell further until you landed with a tiny splash in a sea of gastric juice and Alan's still digesting dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly surfaced in the gross, burbling pit of your brother's stomach, looking around for any sign of what might be causing his discomfort. It is dark, incredibly loud, extremely smelly and difficult to gather much information. There was a lot of activity, which was probably why Alan's belly was rumbling. You struggled through the gross swamp-like pit, clambering onto a (relatively) small island of partially digested food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you were able to get your bearings a little better. \"Hmm... indigestion perhaps? That doesn't look right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had noticed that part of the stomach was bubbling a lot, working away on something Alan had eaten earlier. Alan didn't seem to be digesting it very well, so you figured that was probably the cause of his tummy trouble. The entire stomach rumbled and you heard Alan groaning in discomfort, his voice echoing from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOHHHH.... MY STOMACH...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaped into the stomach bile once more, swimming to the source of the disturbance. As you got closer, you found it harder to approach the problem food due to the bubbling liquids that surrounded it. The stench that surrounded this area was also way stronger. You circled around and decided to plow through the barrier of bubbles and gurgling stomach juice. It was rough going, but you were actually small enough to climb on the bubbles and approach the mushy island. Digging your hands into it's surface, you started to pull the thing apart piece by piece, breaking it down so that Alan can hopefully digest it more easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the mush was mostly torn apart, the stomach gave a prolonged groan and there was a powerful explosion of gas as Alan belched. The stomach seemed to calm down after that. Alan's voice came from above.<br>\r\n\"THAT FEELS A LOT BETTER... OH YEAH. THANKS SIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... I actually did it.\" you say to yourself, looking around Alan's stomach. \"Now... how do I get out of here?\"</span></div></div>",

Alex, who was in the colon, could feel her brother get up and then sit down on toilet.

Of all things she had ever said or done, this one had rendered you utterly speechless. Staring wide-eyed at her impossibly gigantic form, you struggled to form a coherent word. \"Uh...w-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think about it. You\u2019re so small it\u2019d be like a great adventure inside the human body! Like, can you imagine what it would be like inside my belly?\u201d she said, placing one hand over her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 yeah! Full of deadly acids, completely gross, really hot and probably stinky too! I am so not okay with this!\u201d Your protests fall on deaf ears as Saturday just leans in closer. A huge and sinister smirk spread across her gargantuan face. \u201cOh yeah? And what exactly are you gonna do about it pipsqueak? We\u2019re doing this and there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop me. Besides, it\u2019ll be fun! Going on an epic journey inside my body, exploring my insides, going where nobody has ever been before. And you\u2019d probably come out okay on the other end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait what? No way! No, this is crazy. It\u2019s not funny any more Saturday, quit talking about it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday smiled. \u201cSure. I\u2019ll quit talking.\u201d Suddenly her hand reached over and formed a massive wall on the table behind you. The wall started to move at an alarming rate as she tried to sweep you from the table and onto her hand. At this size though, she was more likely to crush you with her giant hand. Not wanting to be bulldozed to oblivion, you ran as fast as you could to the edge of the table and leapt off just as Saturday\u2019s hand almost reached you. You landed with a soft thud in her other hand, which was waiting at the edge of the table to catch you. As you struggled to regain your bearings, there was a strange feeling like being on a plane during take-off. Saturday\u2019s hand rose up to face level as she stood her full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of you, across the fleshy plains of her palm, your field of vision was filled by her mouth, which currently formed a giddily excited grin. \u201cWell Alex, I hope you have fun inside me! Bon appetite!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth opened wide, giving you a view inside the enormous cavern as her warm breath washed over you. Things started to get real when her hand tilted, forcing you to slide down and into her mouth. The descent was fast and you landed with a wet splat on Saturday\u2019s tongue. Darkness shrouded the area as Saturday closed her mouth, trapping your minuscule self inside. You stood slowly, finding it difficult to adjust to the soft and bumpy surface of her tongue. Your eyes began to slowly adjust to the darkness inside the cavern, but it was still difficult to make out  whereabouts you were due to your insanely tiny size and the lack of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOkay Alex\u2026 don\u2019t panic\u2026 you\u2019re in Saturday\u2019s mouth\u2026 It\u2019s not the worst situation in the world\u2026 just keep calm and try to look for a way out\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

You started to move, walking across Saturday's massive tongue before realising you might be wandering further inside of her. Maybe it would best to let your eyes adjust first? Things became clearer after a while. It seemed you were pretty much in the middle of Saturday's tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor began to move and you suddenly found yourself being whisked away toward the gaping black hole that was Saturday's throat. She was preparing to swallow you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could do nothing to stop it. You slid down into her gullet, completely engulfed by the crazed teen. With a loud gulp, you were gone. So began your journey to the centre of Saturday, a journey you weren't looking forward to. You had passed the point of no return and knew that the only way out of Saturday's body now was to let nature run its course. Just thinking about that made you shudder as you plummeted down her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling through the spacious (to you) esophagus, you could hear the trickling of saliva and the mighty beating of Saturday's heart. It was beating fast, probably because of the adrenaline rush Saturday was likely experiencing from having swallowed you whole. She was likely giddy with excitement, thinking about your fantastic voyage into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling further still, the heartbeat became more distant and instead you could hear a guttural groaning from down below. That must be Saturday's stomach gurgling, you thought. A few more seconds and you would be inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou passed through the cardia and were hit with the foul stench of Saturday's digesting breakfast. The horrible warmth in her stomach was oppressive as you fell further, before splashing insignificantly into the stomach sea. Surfacing quickly, you found yourself afloat in a vast ocean of who knows what. You'd arrived at last in Saturday's belly. Gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you could see the remnants of Saturday's breakfast floating in there with you. Thankfully you weren't being digested by Saturday's stomach acids, which you kind of surmised based on your enhanced durability from being so damn small. Still, it didn't make being in Saturday's belly any better. It was disgusting and you wanted out. Who knows how long that'd take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday's stomach was immeasurably big. You could kind of make out the fleshy walls in the distance, pulsing and undulating with life as the stomach churned. You could still make out the beating of Saturday's heart, the pace still slightly accelerated. You wondered what the hell she might be doing out there. She was probably rubbing her belly, a huge grin plastered on her face as she relished in eating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach would groan and gurgle often, but a particularly loud and prolonged series of gastric noises signalled something big as Saturday's tummy rumbled.</span></div></div>",

Sure she had been crushed under this girl's feet more times than she cared to name, but being pinned under her enormous posterior would certainly be a new experience. Not to mention that Saturday was being awfully forward about her intentions. Usually she at least pretended what she did was an accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I was just thinking 'If Alex feels so good under my feet, she would probably feel great under my butt too!'\" Saturday replied, grinning from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex could hardly believe how casually this girl was talking about crushing her beneath her butt. Alex knew she was powerless to stop the girl from having her way with her, especially since Alex was already on the couch in the prime position to be sat on.\"Saturday please reconsider. You have no idea how unpleasant it is for me to get squished under you like that.\" Alex entreated, hoping to appeal to some sense of decency within the young girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she had no such luck. \"And you have no idea how good it feels to squish you! Besides, it's not like you actually get crushed. And who knows, you might even enjoy my butt!\" Saturday replied, turning her back to the tiny girl, effectively ending the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex knew she had no chance of escape as the jean clad ass of the giant 13 year old came plummeting towards her. Resigned to her fate, she allowed herself to fall down onto her back, hoping at least to find the least unpleasant position to be squashed in. Being stepped on countless times had taught her that impacts that compress the spine vertically always proved more painful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Saturday's enormous posterior struck the tiny girl, she found herself pinned beneath the rough denim surface that covered the giant girl's right butt cheek. The material scratched her skin as Saturday slid into place on top of her, giving her a number of small cuts and bruises but as always doing no permanent damage. From Alex's tiny perspective, every tiny movement and shift of Saturday's weight was like an earthquake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Alex I can barely even feel you under there! You're supposed to make my seat comfier!\" Saturday squealed, impatient. She began to lightly bounce in her seat on top of the girl, trying to motivate the girl to be \"comfy\" for her, as though that were something Alex could consciously decide to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Alex, this bouncing was analogous to being struck by a meteor over and over again, as though some sick being were rewinding the scene and playing it over and over for their twisted amusement. However, just as the bouncing was beginning to become routine (though still just as painful as the first blow), it finally stopped. As Alex lay in the ass shaped crater, barely visible to the average person, Saturday got up and looked down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Alex I can't even feel you under me.\" Saturday whined. Alex breathed a quiet sigh of relief, happy that Saturday didn't seem to enjoy keeping her under her butt. Any relief she felt instantly subsided as she realized that the giant girl was now working her jeans and panties down her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\" Alex screamed, though she had a feeling she knew exactly what the giant girl planned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my pants are getting in the way of me feeling you. I bet you'll feel way better against my bare butt!\" Saturday explained before leaping into the air, sending her butt plummeting down towards her neighbor at breakneck speeds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds Alex once again found herself crushed the mammoth cheek of her cruel neighbor, though now there was nothing separating her from the warm doughy flesh of her ass. Without the jeans to constrict it, Saturday's flesh seemed to flow around Alex's tiny body, forming a vacuum seal of sorts around the tiny girl. Luckily, she needed very little oxygen at her tiny size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh.... much better.\" Saturday sighed, twisting her butt on the tiny girl to maximize the pleasure she derived from feeling the tiny form wriggling beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile no longer being scratched by denim, Alex now had to deal with the oppressing warmth from the girl's body heat, making her feel like she was in a panini press. And from the sound of Saturday's words, it seemed like this was going to become a regular occurrence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex had no idea how long she spent under Saturday's butt, but when Saturday finally stood up Alex found herself going with her. Heat and pressure had adhered her to the enormous buttock, preventing her from escape. At the very least, she was happy to have the unbearable pressure of being sat on relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday burst out laughing upon realizing that Alex was stuck to her butt. She almost looked like a tiny star fish stuck spread eagle to her mountainous ass. \"Seems like you're enjoying yourself.\" Saturday snicked. \"Well, I wouldn't want to interrupt you. Feel free to hug my butt for as long as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex wasn't quite sure what this meant, though it became apparent as an enormous shadow slowly enveloped her. Looking over her shoulder, she saw the enormous wall of Saturday's panties rising behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saturday don't you da-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was cut off as Saturday released her panties, allowing them to snap against her ass and knock the wind out of Alex. While it still wasn't quite as bad as being sat on, the pressure of the panties on her back was immense, keeping her face pressed into the seemingly never ending booty. An extra few pascals of pressure were added as she pulled her tight jeans up over her ass again, laughing all the while. Satisfied with her toy neighbor's position, she began to address her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Alex I have to say I think this may be my new favorite place to keep you.\" Saturday taunted, patting the tiny speck through her jeans, focusing on the near imperceptible form squirming for freedom. \"Anyway, I hope you won't mind....</span></div></div>",

That was the last place she wanted to go with this gargantuan teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer world began to shift and even jiggle slightly as Saturday started walking. Alex was helplessly sandwiched between the thick cloth of her panties and the seemingly endless plain flesh that was Saturday's cheek. The oppressive body heat and constant movement made her nauseous, as if being plastered to the butt of a bratty thirteen-year-old wasn't enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the trip wasn't to long, as Saturday lived right next door. \"Finally!\" Alex thought as she heard the front door open. She wanted to sigh in relief but didn't to avoid a mouthful of soft skin. Her relief was short lived as everything went horizontal again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saturday, please don't-\" Alex was abruptly silenced as she was crushed yet again under tons of warm flesh. Feeling this weight again her almost long for the sensation of Saturday walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired teen giggled as she felt her tiny neighbor underneath her relatively huge rear. \"Best.

Saturday had a good idea where she was and dragged her fingertips upward, catching the smaller girl between two soft walls of skin. Alex took a deep breath of fresh air as she was pulled out. Oil and sweat kept her adhered to Saturday's finger as she was lifted to the monolithic girl's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, that felt awesome!\" Saturday said cheerily, \"I'm definitely keeping you there all the time!\" She sat back down on the couch before playfully setting the mite-sized Alex on the tip of her nose. She went cross-eyed as she focused in on Alex. \"Why do you insist on torturing me?\" Alex tried to balance on Saturday's slightly up-turned nose. \"Oh c'mon. I'm just having a little fun with my little friend.\" She giggled, nearly throwing Alex off her perch. \"With friends like you, who needs enemies?\" Alex thought as she pulled herself back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday, seemingly losing interest in the conversation, turned her attention back to the movie she'd been watching. Alex sighed as she turned to the TV. Up on Saturday's nose, she took in the vastness of the everything around her. She hugged her knees as she observed astronomical size of the girl she was sitting on. The walls and furniture seemed blurry due to the miles upon miles of sheer distance. \"You can do this Alex,\" the small girl told herself,\"Another hour or so and the dress is yours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she the movie ended Saturday's phone began to ring. \"Yes! It's gotta be Calpernia!\" Alex thought as Saturday answered the phone. \"Hey Ms. C,\" the incomprehensibly large teen boomed, confirming her thoughts. Saturday went on gushing about how much fun they were having. At one point her eyes lit up in a way that filled Alex with dread. \"Can she spend the night?\" She watched helplessly as a mile-wide grin formed below her. \"Thanks Ms. C, I'll take care of her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tipped her nose into her palm, sending Alex tumbling. She looked up at Saturday from her plushy, pinkish palm. \"We're gonna have so much fun!\" Saturday beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Something tells me I won't be having too much fun.\" Alex thought to herself as...</span></div></div>",

Light peeked in from the sides, illuminating the otherwise pitch-black space. She heard muffled booms and roars from her warm enclosure before she was suddenly thrown around. The soft skin around her cushioned numerous falls as she bounced around in the closed hand. Eventually, it stopped and the gargantuan fingers uncurled, exposing Alex to an unbelievably large, grinning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright so I need you to hang out in here for a little bit.\" Saturday gestured to her bedroom. It typically furnished, the light blue walls plastered with posters. \"But where should I hide you?\" The monstrous teen said, more rhetorically than actually asking Alex. The tiny girl watched helplessly as the giantess giggled as she picked up a blue, fuzzy slipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saturday, don't even think about it!\" Alex shouted,  attempting to sound stern. Her attempt failed miserably as the thirteen-year-old leaned in and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what are you going to do about it tiny?\" She raised her hand over the opening of the slipper. She snickered as she tilted her palm, sending Alex plummeting. Alex tumbled through the darkness uncontrollably before slamming into the soft interior. She craned her neck to see Saturday's enormous eyes. \"I'll bring you some food later, just stay here til I get back.\" Saturday set the slipper down before leaving the room, her footsteps booming in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex sighed miserably as she sat in the dimly lit slipper. She could do nothing but sit there and sulk while breathing in the cheesy scent of Saturday's feet. The slipper itself was twice the size of a domed sports arena. Alex knew she could never climb the impossibly high walls. \"Well, it's not the worst place I've been today.\" She thought, surveying her smelly prison, \"Then again, there aren't many places worse than a giant butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there for almost half an hour until...</span></div></div>",

She tumbled and rolled until she landed into an uneven mass of soft skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helloooo, Alex!\" The goddess-like teen sang in a booming manner. Alex looked up, fearful of her next experience at the hands, or butt, of Saturday. \"Sorry I couldn't take you to dinner but I did bring you this,\" She held up a very small piece of...chicken? Between her fingertips it looked like little more than a crumb but to the mite-sized girl it was like a small house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday dumped the chicken and Alex on her bedside table before going to take a shower. Alex felt it was very demeaning, being fed leftovers. \"Hmph! Thinks she can feed me table-scraps!\" She stood with her arms crossed. \"She basically kidnaps me, now she gives me soft, tender...barbecue?\" Her stomach growled as she turned to the towering morsel. Her mouth watered as she observed glistening sauce, its intoxicating aroma gripping her. Her feet seemed to drag her forward against her will. \"Maybe one bite wouldn't hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex licked her fingers as she sat cross-legged. She'd barely put a dent in her \"little\" slice but she was stuffed. \"So much for pride.\" She said matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooming footsteps filled the room as Saturday returned. She was wearing her pajamas: a pair very short green shorts and a pink t-shirt cut off about an inch above her bellybutton. Her long, black hair was still damp and pulled into a thick ponytail, which hung over her slender shoulder. Alex groaned for what must have been the millionth time that day as she was approached by this monolith of partially exposed, budding curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm pretty tired.\" Saturday said, holding out a soft fingertip. Once her speck of a neighbor was secure, she plopped down on her bed. It was pretty hot so she would sleep on top of the sheets. \"The question is, where will you sleep?\" She asked, more rhetorically than to Alex. Her butt would be fun but she didn't want her to suffocate. She might get crushed or lost in most other places. Eventually she had the perfect idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex struggled to stay upright as Saturday cut off the light and laid on her back. Her finger-copter gave her a brief flyover featuring twin mountains (actually a rapidly developing chest) and a vast plain before coming to a stop in the center. The fingertip tilted allowing her to fall toward an incredibly deep dark pit. She braced for impact only to have her descent cushioned by soft skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex stood to find herself trapped in an abyss of pale flesh. \"Of course.\" Alex said realizing this inescapable, musky-smelling cavern of despair was Saturday's bellybutton. She approached the wall and found it was far too smooth and steep to climb. Defeated, she laid down and decided to get some rest. She rubbed her face against the doughy flesh, finding it was actually pretty pleasant and warm. \"Wow, this is where I am right now,\" she laughed to herself, \"Curled up in Saturday's bellybutton like a piece of lint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Alex.\" Saturday said, her words rumbling around the smaller girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight.\" Alex replied, knowing she couldn't be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Saturday was so thrilled that she got her way that she started dancing and jumping around with glee, causing huge tremors for Alex as her butt jiggled and wobbled from the motion!

Occasionally Saturday's ass would \"pinch\" (smash) Alex and the shaking would throw her back up, but down you went, slow and torturous. As she ended up <i>underneath</i> Saturday's ass, and the shaking didn't end there. The girl started walking. Then she started skipping. Or possibly just walk up some stairs. It was a bit of a guess from where Alex was right now.<br>\r\nTrampolined and bounced between the teens ass and panties, Alex kept moving. Forward.<br>\r\nAfter about a million bounces, smashes, gratings from cotton threads wider than her body is tall, and a traveling a relative distance of hundreds and thousands of miles, it goes quiet for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smelling off sweat and body oils, Alex tried to keep it together after being shaken for so... honestly, less than two minutes.<br>\r\nStill feeling some flesh pressing back on her, and her face now pressed into the fabric of the panties. Grating, but a welcome change. Breathing was a little bit easier, but not by much. Then the fabric started stretching backwards and to the sides, no longer tossing Alex around as she was before, but still rocked from one side to the other, stuck to the panties, tough, rubbery skin rubbing her in. Then light dropped in, and Alex felt herself drop down. Fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday had entered her room, but something was wrong: She couldn't feel Alex anymore. Not that it was a lot, but she could definitely feel her move before.<br>\r\nMaybe she just wasn't focusing enough, but it could never hurt to check. If she fell out and got lost, Saturday would have to waste maybe her whole night looking for her when she could be playing. Also it would be irresponsible or something...<br>\r\nClosing the door of her room, and the curtains, just to be sure, Saturday lowered her short to her thighs, and started rummaging through her panties, looking for her 'friend'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned on your back, hoping to draw Saturday's attention, though she was not sure what that would accomplice, she faced a curly black forest of immature pubic hair, each strand still easily twice as wide as she was tall. Barely hiding behind it, almost directly above Alex, was a gigantic mound of skin with a cleft down the middle. Alex looked away, up at the light, rather not thinking where she would end up if Saturday would pull up her panties right now.<br>\r\nSpeak of the devil...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only a couple of seconds, but Saturday had again managed to spot the dust speck of a woman in one go.<br>\r\n*Phew* \"Though I lost you for a second!\" she sighed. \"Glad i didn't leave you <i>behind</i>!\"<br>\r\n\"Very funny.\" Alex muttered to herself. \"CAN YOU <b>PLEASE</b> GET ME OUT OF HERE?\" she yelled at the teen keeping her hostage.<br>\r\nIt was quiet. Figures; she can spot you from miles away, but can't hear you even from halfway from her own body.<br>\r\n\"You know what? I'm not gonna be mad at you!\" Saturday \"But you were a nice seat pillow...\"<br>\r\n\"SATURDAY! LET ME OUT!\" Alex tried again. \"WE'LL PLAY WHATEVER GAME YOU WANT! JUST PLEASE LET ME OUT!\" she started waving her arms, and tried to stand. She couldn't get a footing, but could balance on her knees a little.<br>\r\nSaturday squinted. She might not be able to hear Alex talk, or even see her face from down there, but she could see the speck moving...<br>\r\nA giant thumb and index finger dipped into the panties and, surprisingly, managed to pick up Alex in one go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short and abrupt trip upwards,  Alex felt the pressure release, and, other than the familiar \"subtle\" movements of a hand being as still as possible.<br>\r\nAlex stood up, apparently on top of Saturday's index finger, looking up at a single eye.<br>\r\n\"... Saturday, please -\" Alex started talking. Either Saturday could hear her from her, or was at least pretending she could. \"- I'll play any game, just don't put me drop in your pants!\" <br>\r\n\"PantIES.\" Saturday corrected, her finger trembling just from her talking. At least she could hear her from this close.<br>\r\n\"... Panties.\" Alex repeated \"It's humiliating and... Mean!\" Alex really didn't want to go into details about this, and hoped Saturday doesn't either...<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" Saturday spoke, sounding way to upbeat for Alex's tastes. \"It's just a little teasing between friends! And I already know what were gonna play, but it's a surprise for you! So be patient a little longer! It'll be <i>great</i> fun!\" Alex couldn't believe what she heard, and seriously began to question if Saturday really understood just how small and helpless she was... or at least how careless she was, handling her like this.<br>\r\nBefore she could reply, or even think about it a little longer, Saturday's finger started moving again, Alex trying to keep her balance, before trying to hold on to the rough bumps of the girls fingerprints, but it was no use, she couldn't get a hold of ridges that huge.<br>\r\nAs she plummeted down, Alex got a look down. To her relief, she was caught by Saturday's left hand. To her horror, the hand then started to tip over, as her right hand held open the waistline of her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday let go of the waistband and pulled up her shorts. Alex was still there, safe and close, and she was hers for the whole evening. Maybe she convince Calpernia she'd be a great babysitter for Alex. Or would that be tinysitter? Anyway, that'd be fantastic; she's got way more time and attention for Alex anyway!<br>\r\nNow then... What was she going to do? She did just promise Alex some great fun, but she hasn't actually had time to think of anything yet...<br>\r\n\"Saturday! Dinner!\" Saturday's mother yelled.<br>\r\n\"On my way!\" she replied. She would think of something while she ate. \"Note to self, feed Alex.\" Saturday told herself, already distracted by trying to think up ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Alex -</span></div></div>",

She let out a breath of relief as she stopped falling, but quickly gagged as she breathed in the stale, musky air! The sweat was still dripping, and being mushed between the two huge globes wasn't making breathing very easy for Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This girl's gonna be the end of me!\" she shouted to herself, knowing that Saturday wouldn't hear or care about her tiny screams. Saturday just happily walked off to her room, unaware of Alex's exact location! As she walked down her hallway, she reached behind her, grabbing the waistband of her panties and pulled them tight, thinking it would pin Alex to her butt cheeks harder; this caused the poor, tiny woman to feel the fabric behind her shove her forward! Alex put her hands up to brace for the impact with Saturday's body, and when she hit something, it was oddly wet! \"What the heck?\" she said to herself, not fully able to see in the dark crack of the 13 year old's ass! She reached for the surface of Saturday's flesh again and rubbed around, feeling a slimy, wet, slippery surface along with a bit of wrinkles, just before feeling the flesh surrounding her jump a bit as Saturday felt something tickling her back door! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm? How did you get in there?\" Saturday said to herself as she closed the door to her room and reached down to the back of her panties, sticking a finger into her deep crack through her panties, feeling you getting mashed into her tight pucker, making her jump once again! \"That feels weird, but cool! Keep doing it, Alex!\" she chirped happily. Alex gagged as she realized where she was, and feeling Saturday's massive finger pressing her into the greasy pucker didn't help much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would Alex do?</span></div></div>",

Saturday was having the most pleasing experience of her life, while Alex was, to say the least, in hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Alex, this feels so good, don't stop!\" Saturday said while still rubbing Alex's face against her asshole. All the words Alex could get out of her mouth while being practically smothered against the asshole in front of her were, \"MMMMMMMM,\" and despite Alex's best attempts, Saturday could not hear Alex, and even if she could have Saturday would have not done anything to save or help Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Saturday's anus relaxed and opened a little bit and because of her smashing of Alex's head against it, her anus swallowed Alex's head.

Millimeters? Closer, but not by much. Micrometers, even to say as drastic as Picometers to describe such feats of teeniness and tininess. Two twins were born one day, their mother passing quickly after, leaving them to the world. One is normal, another not so much but miraculously found at their puny scale. Yet, strangely, seemingly in another scenario it's the same setting, but reversed, one twin big yet the other small. Either way, it's going to be a small life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nSynopsis<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally just another interactive of extremely small scale mega-micro along the lines of my 'Your Life Smaller', I just can't get enough of it! However, this story is fairly different and personal to me, since most of it and it's characters are partially based off of myself and people I've known in real life. I've just needed an outlet, and this helps, given how I would like to think of myself. It's really, really dumb, and I'm just gushing, but I just like to think of myself as somebody with a small soul, and this is a good way to express it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nCharacters<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Alan Smallson<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nPersonality: Actually fairly optimistic given how small he is, and tries to be kind to everyone. Does tend to be naive about things, but hey, what can you do?<br>\r\nAppearance: Average build, lithe and slightly athletic. Caucasian. Has brown hair, cut into a mohawk, but usually wears it down instead of up. Gotta have those rebellious years while they last.<br>\r\nBio: Born less than a millimeter tall, Alan is the smallest of the small, the world far too large to understand an even a person like some great astronomical being. But hey, it's a small life, and he'll live it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Alex (Alexis) Smallson<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPersonality: Headstrong, bold and brave, ready to take on the world if it wasn't for her height. Of course has her shy moments, but being this small gives a complex, no?<br>\r\nAppearance: Fit and lean with a curvy body, but she can't show it off. Brown hair, normally tied back into a bun.<br>\r\nBio:Born less than a millimeter tall, Alex is the smallest of the small, the world far too large to understand an even a person like some great astronomical being. But hey, it's a small life, and she'll live it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Note</b>: Depending which main character you pick determines who you will be able to interact with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>For Alan</b>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Calpernia Monell<br>\r\nAge: 42<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPersonality: A bit on the rough side, but has a heart of gold under that tough exterior and a soft spot for her tiny tenants. Takes no bullshit, and when she gives it she makes sure its sent to the right place.<br>\r\nAppearance: (This should generally help get a good definition base of how she looks<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://nyom87.deviantart.com/art/Vue-giantess-14-312046696,\" target=\"_blank\">http://nyom87.deviantart.com/art/Vue-giantess-14-312046696,</a> with this <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://nyom87.deviantart.com/art/Naughty-evening-Page-114-443670745\" target=\"_blank\">http://nyom87.deviantart.com/art/Naughty-evening-Page-114-443670745</a> and this <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://nyom87.deviantart.com/art/Naughty-evening-Page-112-443670456\" target=\"_blank\">http://nyom87.deviantart.com/art/Naughty-evening-Page-112-443670456</a> helping) Stands as a tower of a woman at 6'8, with hefty jugs that seem to defy the bra cup system and are simply labeled as 'huge', like two fleshy round orbs that seem to bounce and protrude from her body, almost outsizing an average person's entire torso. How this woman even exists is unreal. Has fair caucasian skin, a bit on the lighter side and showing signs of age lines, but she handles it incredibly well and looks great. Has bleached blonde hair cut short, and is usually messy.<br>\r\nBio: Originally a nurse, one who helped deliver the twins, but was surprised to find the tiny one. Quit after that, finding it too weird, but upon hearing that the Smallson's mother died shortly after birth she had become their caretaker. She's fairly good with taking care of them, if she wasn't so tough sometimes, and she should really quit that nasty smoking habit of hers.<br>\r\n(Fun side note, her voiceclaim is Jennifer Hale.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Tessa Mac'Tir<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPersonality: Incredibly shy, hardly saying a peep to most, but is incredibly kind and sweet.<br>\r\nAppearance: Small, standing hardly 4'9, the definition of a shortstack. Slightly chubby, but her bust and butt are hardly something to scoff at, fairly huge in comparison, almost too big to be on her shorter body. Of course to Alan she's still as godly titanic as the rest of the world. Pale, almost ghostly white skin, but it's smooth. Has tons of cute freckles across her face and cheeks to match her short cut-bob fiery red ginger hair. Likes to wear fairly simple clothing, like tees and shorts with flip-flops.<br>\r\nBio: One of Alan's closest friends, and a girl who has a heavy, heavy crush on him. Alan does have a crush on her as well, which he likely does on most of his female friends, but this one he would actually like to return. For now, they're really just good friends, too afraid to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Alice Lees<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPersonality: Extremely optimistic, and surprisingly cheery to boot. This is somewhat offset by her lewd personality and flirty ways.<br>\r\nAppearance: Mid-sized height around 5'5-5'6, but with plenty of heft in her curves and 39DD bust, her large butt almost comparable to Tessa's, but still outsized by the ginger's stocky big round one. Dark, ebony skin, almost fairly black in regards. Has dark brown hair, and sometimes wears glasses.<br>\r\nBio: Another friend in Alan's circle, much more likely to tease him and take advantage of his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Hayes Gray<br>\r\nAge: 17<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPersonality: Bubbly, eager, but a bit on the snarky side.<br>\r\nAppearance: Thin and lithe, in a wiry, cutesy way with nice slight curves. Takes on more of an 'emo' appearance with black bangs over her eyes, a streak of red in her hair, belaying her semi-sweet personality, with plenty of piercings over her face and ears. Normally wears black, with boots and red plaid to complete the look. Around a B-cup chest.<br>\r\nBio: A close friend of Alan. Their relationship is normally fake play-flirting, and some powing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>For Alex</b>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Nathalie Mckissick<br>\r\nAge: 33<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPersonality: Stern when it comes to teaching her students, but surprisingly laid-back and very chill, giving off one of those 'arty-hippie' vibes.<br>\r\nAppearance: Mid-sized height and a decent body for a woman her age, D-cup chest and average form. Has black, straight hair to around the midpoint of her neck and always wears a big smile. Usually wears paint-stained clothing and smocks.<br>\r\nBio: An art teacher at the local high school who's become somewhat of a protector/mentor for Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Saturday Jones<br>\r\nAge: 13<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPersonality: Always chipper, but has a mean streak if she doesn't get her way. She's just beginning to mature, but that doesn't mean she won't resort to childish ways.<br>\r\nAppearance: (Partially based off of <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/art/Soft-skin-to-climb-516459793\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.deviantart.com/art/Soft-skin-to-climb-516459793</a> and <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://super-ego.deviantart.com/art/towering-colossus-513508961\" target=\"_blank\">http://super-ego.deviantart.com/art/towering-colossus-513508961</a>) Fair and lean, but with a budding figure for her age.  Saturday has a mass of curly black hair she likes to keep together in a ponytail.<br>\r\nBio: A neighbor to the Smallsons and constantly amazed by their tiny stature, particularly taking an interest in Alex. While her intrigue is tended to goodwill, her ambition is incredibly unwelcome. She's not very gentle with handling the tiny girl, and always ends up losing her or ending up 'playing' with her on 'accident', as she does it giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Aoi Higashi<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPersonality: Holds and intelligent air about her, and with good reason for her near perfect GPA and wide array of knowledge in many subjects. Comes off as cold sometimes, but really she hardly opens up unless it's to people she knows.<br>\r\nAppearance: (Sort of like <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7130/7426097460_18b954127b_c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7130/7426097460_18b954127b_c.jpg</a>)<br>\r\nBio: Alex's best friend, having met her early on in school and grew up together, never really parting. Aoi is a top of the class student, her family coming to the states in an attempt for a better life for them and Aoi. While she may seem quiet and stoic, she seems to enjoy the fact her friend is so small, almost...lording it over her. As they spend time together, it isn't made a secret that Aoi sort of harbors feelings for Alex, tossing casual comments and flirting the tiny gal's way, which she hopes are reciprocated one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Ian Chrise<br>\r\nAge: 17<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nPersonality: Pretty preppy, but a nice enough guy.<br>\r\nAppearance: Tall, fair, dark-haired and handsome.<br>\r\nBio: Alex's crush , but hardly notices her, really having only spoken to her a couple times, so she views this titan from afar with a romantic sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Just have fun!<br>\r\n2. All chapters, unless choice chapters, are to at least be a single paragraph long, that's 3-5 sentences people.<br>\r\n3.
