I'm not meaning to offend anyone, you can write what you want. This just came into my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No crossovers.<br>\r\n2. Stay on topic.<br>\r\n3. This story is rated E-- that means no explicit sex, no (explicit or not) adultery, pedophilia, incest, bestiality, or rape, no gore, no cussing.<br>\r\n4. This story is called Cartoon Characters <b>Stay the Same</b> -- This means no transformations, no OOC writing, no shipping with non-canonical partners, and no drastic changes to the character's personality/lifestyle. This applies even to the character you're not focusing on.<br>\r\n5. Other than that, go wild.</td>",
