But why?  Why do you have this feeling in your gut that if you look at something wrong, the whole world will fall apart.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMaybe you need to lay off the weed when you're programming.  You're a 19 year old code writer, not Heideggar.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou've heard the faintest whisperings of the hack gods: morpheus, trinity, and most recently neo.  You've seen their handiwork scouring the databases of the most complex systems.  And now you're trying to follow in their footsteps, find what they found before seemingly disappearing without a trace.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter wiping the bead of sweat from your forehead, getting some of the salt drenched liquid in your squinting eyes, you stare back at the entry page to a site called, \"matrix protocol: new york scenario.\"  You are about to hack your way in when...\r<br>\n\r<br>\nKNOCK!!!  KNOCK!!!  KNOCK!!!\r<br>\n\r<br>\nGroaning, you minimize your linux window and put on a client operating system to hide your tracks.  Windows ME...God, you have to be really desperate to plug that on to your computer.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou walk over to the door where the incessant hammering at your apartment continues.  Taking off the six locks, you open the door, revealing three men in black suits and sunglasses.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Mr. Jeffries?\"  the head of them asks.  \"Or should I say, \"tiny?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"How did you...\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Grab him!\"  the man shouts.  A fist comes out of nowhere connecting with your jaw like a steamroller pushed by a wrecking ball.  You fall backwards and hit your floor with a thud.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n*               *                *\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou wake up in a bland white room with the three men sitting across from you.  Your hands are bound behind you, your mouth taped with something resembling duct tape.  Your eyes focus, letting off an aire of calm fury.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Mr. Jeffries, you represent a dangerously growing segment of this city's population,\" the head of the men says in a deliberate \"narc\"-ish way.  \"Too many of your kind have questions about who and where they are.  You just can't be content, can you?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nDear God, you think, this guys some kind of religious nutball.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Now, we could just tag you and let you on your merry way.  But, due to recent...events...\"  The man drifts off and the other two look at each other with a kind of suppressed rage.  You have no idea what the hell they could be rambling on about.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Mr. Jeffries.  We are faced with few options.  We could either exterminate you...\"  With that, the three men pull out guns the size of christmas hams.  Your eyes try not to bug completely out of their sockets.  \"Or...You can simply be made to no longer represent a threat to or program...\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"And since it's soo hard replacing good fuel cells these days, we have decided to keep you alive.  But we have to declaw you, take away your fangs, make sure you don't come after us in the future.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou feel your flesh melt off of your body.  You try to scream, but you can't.  Instead you wake up...</span></div></div>",

Instinctively, you slap for the snooze button as you ponder how freaking weird your dream was last night.  But instead of hitting the alarm, you hit the bed.  You stand up on your mattress and look round.  Your alarm clock is miles away.  You're tiny.  Literally.  No more than a millimeter.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Man,\" you say to yourself.  No more words follow.  Just \"Man.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou try and figure out what the hell happened, but no plausable ideas come to mind.  It had to have something to do with those guys in the suits, but what?  What could do this?  What could melt off inches and inches of height?  And what did that \"new york scenario\" bullshit mean?\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou have to get to your computer.  You have to figure out what is going on.  You just hope that no one has turned the power off your desktop.  If they have, there is no way to make up all that work at this size...\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou haven't realized that your alarm has been going off for the last 2 hours.  Time flies when you're lost in thought ( and your bed sheets. )  You look across your apartment as the door is slowly opened.  Standing in the doorway is...\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJennifer, the landlady's daughter.  She's about 17 or so, going to Stuyvescant High School.  She's pretty cute, reminds you of the girl you took to prom.  You've let your alarm go for hours before, and have given them permission to come in and turn it off if you leave before you do it yourself.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nOn her way over to the clock, Jennifer stops at the computer.  Sighing, she says, \"God, his electric bill could have been through the roof...\" and...presses the power button.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWell.  Shit.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJennifer makes her way over to your bed, with her backpack over her shoulder, on her way to school.  She puts her backpack on the floor by the bed and sits down on the mattress to turn off the alarm.  When she sits, the relatively massive weight creates a dip in the mattress and you find yourself rolling towards the giant girl.  You grab out blindly, trying to regain your balance.

You have plenty of time to think over the possibilities as the woman begins to walk away, her hand held upright at waist level now.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA few minutes later, somewhere safer, presumably, she lifts you up again, but keeps you far enough from her face that her whispered voice does not blow you away to your doom.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'You're lucky that I happened to find you, Tiny.' she whispers.  'Who knows what other plans those Agents had in mind for you?'\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThat pretty much confirms your theory then.  Your opinion of yourself suddenly grows when you think how powerful you must have been to pose a threat to the Agents.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'I know what you're probably thinking - yes, I am Trinity, the Agents managed to get almost perfect replicas of all of us working on that movie.  The story is all but totally true too - if it were presented as a fiction on screen, people would be less willing to accept the possibility of a world outside the Matrix.  Now, I have an important 'phone call that I must answer, only there's one thing i was supposed to do first.'\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe smiles, although there is little humour in it.  She looks tired.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'I just don't know how I could get you, in your state, to take a pill.'</span></div></div>",

The real Neo (just as the real Trinity) looked amazingly like the twin of his movie counterpart, Keanu Reeves. In Neo's sunglasses, you could see the reflection of Trinity's palm, but you couldn't see yourself. Neo and Trinity must have had super-strong vision to be able to see a man who was only one millimeter tall. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nSuddenly, the palm underneath you shifted. You began to slowly slide down the side of Trinity's palm and into Neo's larger and firmer palm. You really aren't very pleased about this. Trinity's hand was warm, soft, moist, and had some sort of faint scent, like that of some kind of lavender-scented body wash. You immediately tumble into a deep crease in Neo's palm. \"Well, 'Tiny'\", began Neo, \"Looks like someone wanted to make you live up to your name and get you out of their way.\" Although Neo spoke in a low murmur, his baritone voice still resonates quite powerfully, almost making it difficult for you to understand any of his words. You then notice that his other hand had withdrawn a tiny, glass vial from the pocket of his leather trench coat.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nNeo placed the tiny vial next to you on his palm. It was laying on its side, with its opening facing you. \"Climb in, it's for your own good.\" Neo urged, in his usual sombre and somewhat flat delivery. You are able to climb over the lip of the opening and walk inside the vial. As soon as you are inside the vial, Neo stops it with a tiny stopper with tiny holes--microscopic to the regular-sized, naked eye--allowing air inside the vial. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nNow that you are safely contained in the vial, Neo places it back in the pocket of his coat. Trinity and Neo then proceed together to Morpheus for further assistance. As Neo walks, you bounce along inside the glass vial in Neo's coat pocket, feeling the thunderous pulsations of Neo's heavy leather boots as they slam against the concrete sidewalk with each step, wondering what it would have been like to ride with Trinity...  </span></div></div>",

You are suddenly shifted around the slippery glass walls and look forward to see the end of the pocket rapidly approaching as Neo bends to avoid to bullets.  You prepare yourself for the inevitable, but it is suddenly stopped as Neo places his hand to his chest, closing off the top of the pocket.  You breath a sigh of relief, but realize it was premature as you are suddenly jolted off your feet and rolling a great distance before coming to a quick stop.  After a brief moment to gather your bearings, you look up to see a mesh of black hair lightly touching your glass ceiling.  You quickly deduce that Smith must have caught Neo's hand movement and succeeded in knocking him to the ground, causing your vial to roll out the top of his trenchcoat, but before you can react to your new situation, you see a hand decending through the silk black strands, but who's is it?</span></div></div>",

My best friend since grade school, we've collaborated on hundreds of different projects.  We'd even tried going to college together, but school never really was my cup of tea.  I admire her gusto, though, and it's time to call in that favor she owes me for that program I wrote for her last term.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Boy, this place sure looks different from this perspective,\" I mutter, climbing atop the cap of an abandoned beer bottle.  From there I pull myself even higher, then await my chance.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nOn a busy day such as this, I don't have to wait long.  A giant pair of neon green tennis shoes comes by and I jump.  I barely manage to grasp hold of the laces before toppling over the other side.  The shoe's owner doesn't seem to notice me and I strap myself down for the ride.  The university's downtown and I can only hope I'm going that way.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nI'm in luck!  The shoes take me straight there.  We pause at the Student Union entrance to smoke a cigarette (\"What a nice deal,\" I think to myself, \"I'm too small to breathe in all that damn smoke!\"), then continue on.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nI only dimly remember the university, but the smell tells me all I need to know.  I check my watch, partially surprised to see it still there (Where'm I going to get a new battery?) and I note the time: 1:15.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hey, Morgan!\" Green Shoes shouts.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nI stand up, holding onto the pantsleg.
