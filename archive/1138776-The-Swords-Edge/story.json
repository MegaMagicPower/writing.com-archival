Instead, Kian thought, his forehead rested against the cool glass and breath fogging over his view, instead I think of Dunnagan ships on my pristine shores.  He sighed and ran a hand through his dark hair, unbraided from his bath earlier that night, stepping back from the window and pacing anxiously across his floor.  The news had unnerved him greatly- his cousin, Alcuin of Donnagal, was challenging the authenticity of Kian's blood and staking his own claim to the throne of Gwynvyr.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was absurd.  Ridiculous.  And, if Alcuin had not been King of a land in his own right, it would have been treasonous.  Kian would've had him locked up in the darkest gaol somewhere, and the whole business would've been done.  But, no, the claim had been declared legitimate by the Druids and war was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBastard blood.  All of this trouble because his mother had been a mistress.  Kian had been Gryffd's only son, legitimized, and declared heir to the throne by his sixteenth birthday.  Now, closing in on thirty, naught but six months after the death of his father, Kian's mother yet again came to haunt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what about Gryffd's wishes?  The former King had worked very hard to ensure Kian's ascension to the thrown.  Even the Druids had declared Kian suitably royal!  The Druids, Kian thought.  Maybe they were in on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo.  No, they were following their dictates.  A legitimate claim to the throne had arisen and it had to be approved.  Stupid laws.  Stupid, stupid laws that did nothing for the good of the Kingdom.  It made Kian want to spit.  May he <i>should</i> spit.  Maybe it would make him feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit all,\" he muttered.  Kian loved his Kingdom, felt the Land within his very soul.  He wished that he was better with a sword; oh, like any man, he was proficient with a weapon, enough to keep him alive if need be, but Kian's skill was in administrating, in ruling, not in leading battles.  Not in war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeric.  Kian needed to talk to Aeric, and quickly.  He made to ring for a servant, but stopped.  Mayhap he should travel to Aeric's residence himself.  It would surely lend weight to see the future (maybe) King of Gwynvyr standing at his door in the middle of the night.  But would leaving the palace be too dangerous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing was ever easy.</span></div></div>",

This matter was too important not to handle personally. Kain could never risk handing the lives of his people over to Alcuin, but Alcuin would never relinquish his claim. War was unavoidable, preparations had to be made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully slipping through the halls and down the stairs, Kain could not help but go over both the consequences of the impending war and of surrendering to Alcuin. Even if Alcuin accepted certain conditions with the surrender, Gwynvyr could only be worse off with Alcuin as king. Perhaps the soft touch Maegyn would be able to sooth the fire within her husband and help to protect the people of both nations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of one the side doors Kain stopped and closed his eyes breathing in the fresh air and clearing his mind. Kain took a step forward and opened his eyes. In so doing, he walked right into a similarly cloaked figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty.\" The figure kneeled and his voice was unmistakeable. \"You should not leave the palace walls, especially alone, especially at a time like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you've heard about Alcuin's claim. Aeric, your insightfulness never ceases to asound me. I was just coming to see you about our current situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That conversation is best left for safer quarters.\" Kain nodded in consent, and together they made their way to Kain's chambers to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can we do Aeric? A war would be devastating, but the alternation is no better. I am in dire need of your advice Aeric. You are much more knowledgeable when it comes to matters of war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeric thought for several minutes. \"The best thing to do right now is to wait. I'll send out some scouts to evaluate our strengths and weaknesses and the condition of Alcuin's forces. We can begin work on small things, but until we hear more we must avoid drawing any attention to ourselves.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maegyn sighed, chin resting in the palm of her hand as she listened to her husband ramble on about the truth of his claim on the illlustrious throne of Gwynvyr.  She never doubted that Alcuin's blood-claim was true- he was fastidious in his research of Royal Geneology and, if there was a tie between the D'ahra Clan and the Cistain family, Alcuin would've found it.  However, despite the verity of his statements, the claim was so tenuous that Maegyn hoped that the Council would see that her husband was grasping at straws and deny his claim.  But, along with his keen eye for detail, Alcuin had a piercing voice and a persuasive presence that loomed over the ancient members of the Throne Council.  Instinctively, Maegyn knew that Dunnagal would soon be off to a war that it didn't need and likely wouldn't win.  Thousands of its citizens, her people, would die to satiate the blood lust of its king and his advisors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen.\"  Maegyn looked up and into the eyes of her husband, even and sparkling as he looked down at her with a tender expression and hand extended.  \"Shall we retire to our chambers and share our meal together?\"  Smiling, Maegyn took Alcuin's hand and stood, allowing him to escort her from the room and down the corridors of the famous Dunnagan Castle of the Ages.  Since coming to the castle as Alcuin's wife, Maegyn had learned to love the ostentatious show of wealth and prestige so evident in the opulent fabrics and paintings adoring the walls, the floors laid with marble quarried hundreds of miles away.  For a small nation, Dunnagal was the only challenger to Gwynvyr's hegemony, though the two kingdoms had long been allies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Council has agreed and acquiesced to my requests, wife.  Soon you shall grace the emerald shores of Gwynvyr, and it will be all the better to have your temperance and mercy governing it.\"  Alcuin smiled, and his beautiful face lit up, blue eyes sparkling with good humour.  Maegyn nodded, brushing a lank strand of coal black hair behind her ear, and fought to return the smile.  If Alcuin weren't so distracted by thoughts of war, he would've noticed his wife's disquiet and Maegyn's thoughts would've betrayed themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to do something.  But what could she, Queen of the nation across the Great Sea from Gwynvyr, a woman in a nation of patriarchical power, do to stop something like this from happening?  Once her husband had made up his mind, there was no gainsaying him, or swaying his opinions.  The Cistain family, though often thought weak for the pale skin and white hair, was nonetheless a powerful entity of opinionated, emotionally strong individuals whose tenacity saw their vision through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir progress through the corridors was quiet, husband and wife both sucked into their respective thoughts, but Alcuin drew himself together and whispered a soft command into the ear of a valet as the couple slipped into their chambers and sat at a table laden with food.  Alcuin poured Maegyn a glass of wine, which she took greatfully and sipped at graciously.  The war was bound to happen, she reasoned, but Alcuin could not bear to leave her behind while he spent what could amount to many months overseas.  Once she got to Gwynvyr, maybe she could mediate and something could be done.  Maybe Alcuin could sit on Gwynvyr's Council, giving Dunnagal a voice in matters of trade and religion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere must be something that could keep her people alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, dear wife.  Beautiful, beautiful, seductive wife...\" Alcuin's voice was silken as he whispered into her ear, rubbing a hand up and down her side.  Maegyn turned her doe-eyed dark stare to Alcuin's light-featured gaze and smiled.  She loved her husband, and wanted to see him happy.  But, above all, her people were her care and, if Alcuin's ambition overstretched his bounds, she needed to do whatever she could to act as a Voice for the common man.  They should not be subject to the whims of their imaginative, empassioned King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maegyn...what are your thoughts on the war?  You've been quiet since the meeting with the Council.  You know I value your opinion...\"</span></div></div>",

Most likely he would leave two shattered nations, neither one capable of protecting its people, to be picked over by the carrion eaters of the world. She had to find a way to avoid this, even if it meant betraying the man she loved.

He had expected something that this when a grim-faced messanger in Kian's personal livery had knocked on his door at naught past dawn ordering him to the palace immediately.  Expected, maybe, but hoped that he really wouldn't have to hear the actual words.  And here he was, the sun just above the horizon, gazing at the man who relied on him to save the Kingdom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready I have to plan a battle force and I haven't even broken my fast.  What a time for those damned Dunnagan to announce their intention for the throne!  Couldn't have waited until the afternoon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aeric?\"  The Prince's obsidian eyes sparkled in fear.  \"What are we going to do?  I'm not so skilled in fighting as you.  I never have been.  And this is certainly not the time for diplomacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling ironically, Aeric shook his head and wiped a tear from his emerald eyes.  A pit had slowly developed in his stomach; everything seemed slightly tilted now, somehow different than the world had been last night.  Darker, more shadowy, as if Alcuin de Cistain had sent demons to converge on the corners of Castle Achain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have two months at least, before Alcuin has raised a force large enough to conquer Gwynvyr.  If he has just received approval...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKian nodded.  \"Yes.  He has just received approval.  Our spies in his court keep us well updated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeric gave a quirked grin and looked down at the marble floors of the throne room.  Maegyn no Cistain, the wife of the King of Dunnagal, had turned against his bid for Gwynvyr's throne and offered to aid Kian's cause.  The irony of the situation never failed to amuse Aeric, and most of Kian's court, for that matter.  A joke ran through the ranks that, should Alcuin not survive his usurpation attempt, Kian would have to marry Maegyn out of gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  Two months at least.  Then, given the unpredictability of the seas at that point, we could have a long time before Alcuin even begins to threaten our shores.  It gives us plenty of time to raise an army.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKian pursed his lips in thought.  \"Should we...maybe send an emissary over to the Fae?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The OtherWorld?  Are you mad?  Why on earth would they help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, if Alcuin wins the throne, the Manna will revolt.  And the Fae have a big stake in the Manna.\"</span></div></div>",

It will be near impossible to change them of their ways now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKian nodded and sunk a little in his seat.  Aeric raised his chin up a little, knowing how much this coming war would take its toll on his friend.  Kian was not a fighter, that was clear.  He was a peacemaker, he was a simple man, and he was a lover.  His upbringing had made him that way.  He was born out of wedlock and therefore none had rightfully seen Kian as the king's son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There must be something we can offer them,\" Kian tried again, his voice quiet.  Aeric smiled warmly at the man, knowing that Kian still had the ideals of a child.  He simply could not believe that anyone could turn down someone who was truly in need.  That's what Aeric loved about him.  It had been what first attracted Aeric to Kian's friendship.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is not much the Fae want that they don't have,\" Aeric said simply and before Kian could get discouraged again, he added, \"But perhaps we could send a party to the Fae Queen to negotiate an alliance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKian perked up at that and nodded.  \"Perhaps I should go,\" Kian said.  \"It would show them great respect if I showed up in person asking for their favor.

The truth of the matter was that Aeric had no desire to meet with the Fae.  No desire to meet <i>any</i> of them, let alone the Queen.  The Fae were a dangerous race.  They were tricksters and seducers and on occasion could be cruel murderers.  And if one were weak of spirit and mind, it would be easy to become fooled by the Fae's Glamour.  For the essence of the race was based on illusion.  One could never be sure they were seeing what was actually real when dealing with a Fae. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would not trust any other with this task,\" Kian said and Aeric nodded again, knowing that he had no choice but to go now.  Kian was far too trusting, but Aeric found himself wanting to do everything possible to earn and keep that trust.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then by your leave,\" Aeric said and bowed again, to which Kian mirrored the act, and then left.  He would need to assemble a small party of warriors to accompany him.  One would be a fool to go into the realm of the Fae alone.  If the Fae didn't get you, then some vicious beast would.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeric knew exactly who he wanted to bring with him.  One man in particular he knew he could not go without.  Gryffin Moorwood.  The son of a blacksmith and the best weapon crafstman Aeric knew.  He was also a good friend and a well trained warrior.  How could one make a truly great weapon if they didn't know how to use it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGryffin lived in a cottage not too far away from Aeric.  It didn't take long to get there and, much to Aeric's luck, a few of the personal guards that Aeric trained were visiting with Gryffin, making orders for their new weapons.  Aeric entered the cottage without knocking, as was accustom with him now that he'd become good friends with the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the guards were seated around a table, eating a meal that Gryffin had prepared for them.  Gryffin was in the back, already setting to work on the orders.  All of them looked up as Aeric entered.  Gryffin smiled a little and set aside what he was doing, wiping off his grimy hands on his tunic before coming towards the front of the cottage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aeric,\" Gryffin greeted him.  \"To what do we owe the pleasure?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is no pleasure,\" Aeric said, shaking his head.  \"I need you, all of you, to accompany me on a trip.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A trip to where?\" one of the guards asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Realm of the Fae.\" </span></div></div>",

You better not be daydreaming again, boy!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the book and jumping nimbly to his feet, Gryffin Moorwood stared through the trees and dashed between them without thinking, green eyes flashing impishly as he danced across the stone bridge over the creek and into the forge nestled within a glen at the center of the forest.  It was odd that Donnor had chosen to build his business so far from the outskirts of town- it took a full day for the average visitor to reach the Moorwood cottage- but his skill with metal was so undeniably a gift from the Gods that he could've set up shop in the middle of the Ocean and customers would trek out to visit him.  Eccentric and talented, it was said that Donnor had been touched by the Fae, captured and taken into their Shining Lands, from which he escaped physically, but not spiritually.  Villagers whispered that Donnor's location, so deep within the woods the Fae loved so much, had as much to do with this as his legendary fear of other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGryffin's talents, it was also whispered, outshadowed his own fathers; at eighteen years old, it was he from whom First Knight Sir Aeric Glaswyd had accepted the gleaming broadsword everyone now saw hanging at his side.  The boy, himself, was as odd and unexplainable as his extraordinary talent; his features were unmistakeably Fae- beautiful and otherworldly, more perfect than any pure-blooded Mortal in Gwynvyr.  Green eyes flashed with an otherworldly glow, and his body moved with a grace uncharacteristic of so many boys his age.  Everything about Gryffin seemed to dull the world around him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuther whispers, of course, suggested that this was the reason Donnor lived so far into the forests.  Like all sensible theories, it was discarded as too obvious and those who believed it were obviously delusional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father, I wasn't daydreaming.\"  Brushing an offending lock of golden hair out of his face, Gryffin smiled and stared around the forge.  \"I was reading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonnor looked nothing like his son.  Where Gryffin was slender and delicate, Donnor was like a grizzled old black hair, dark featured and looming with a certain cynicism and gruffness that came with age.  He wore a look of grim resignation on his soot-covered face, his black eyes slipping to the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGryffin's smile fell, replaced by a frown and a furrow of confusion, as he peered into the shadows of the room.  \"Hello, Gryffin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Aeric!  What do you here, sir?\"  Gryffin's smile returned and a slack-limbed ease enveloped his entire form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Knight stepped from the shadows, his powerfully structured face and blue eyes sparkling with fierce determination.  \"King Alcuin of Dunnagal has staked his claim for the Throne of Gwynvyr and sails here with a mighty force to overtake Prince Kian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why? Kian is heir to the throne!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grim smile from the Knight dashed Gryffin's own lightness away.  \"Kian is the bastard son of King Gwyffd, and Alcuin believes that, as cousin to the D'Ahra clan, he has a better claim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGryffin's frown returned.  \"Then you're going to fight...Do you need me to repair your weapon, sir?  Perhaps a new one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to come with me, Gryffin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Gryffin froze, looking from the Knight to his Father.  Donnor was uncharacteristically silent, and refused to meet his son's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're being conscripted into my service, Gryffin- as the blacksmith to myself and my personal guard.  We leave on the morrow for the Unnyn Pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeric sighed.  \"I'm afraid you must come, Gryffin.  Your Kingdom needs you, your Prince needs you, and my men really need you.  You're one of the most gifted young blacksmiths in the land.  We need your skill if we're going to have a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why cannot my father go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonnor spoke now.  \"You know I'm tied to this Forest, son.  I cannot leave it.  You have to go.  You have no choice.  Sir Aeric says you must go, and so you must.  Get your things, son.  Get your things.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     Something in Gryffin's spirit would not let him walk blindly into indentured servitude.  The young blacksmith searched for any chance to evade this onus.  There, on the anvil, was the brand new blade his father was working on when he ventured into the woods in the morning.  An amber glow told him that it had not yet cooled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"NO!!\" Gryffin cried out as he dove for the sword.  His desperate ploy startled the veteran knight for merely a moment.   Aeric knew that while the boy had no equal in crafting such weapons, his proficency in their use was slight.  He drew his own weapon from its scabbard and waited patiently for Gryffin to make his move.  He felt it was a shame that he would have to disgrace the lad this way but the need for his services was too great to let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Make his move Gryffin did, but not the one expected of him.  As he went through the motions of circling Aeric, he reached his true target.  Turning suddenly, he thrusted the sword into the dry hay which served as his bedding, embedding the tip in the ground beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     When the older men realized what he had done, plumes of smoke were already rising from the smoldering straw.  Both knew that if they did not put out the flames quickly, the entire house would soon be engulfed.  As Aeric and Donner grabs buckets of water that were kept near the forge,  Gryffin sprinted for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It took only minutes to drench the flames, but when they were done, Gryffin was gone.  Without saying a word, Aeric took off into the woods.  He would not fail at such a simple task as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I knew his spirit could not be tamed.\"  Donnor muttered to himself.  \"Just too much of his mother in him.\"  The old blacksmith fell back into a chair as he reminisced about that fateful day of his youth when he stumbled upon the fey lands.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">In the kingdom of Gwynvyr, the throne sits precariously on the edge of fate as two armies struggle to gain control over the magickally proliferant and strategically situated land of the Gods.  Any who sits on the throne controls the most powerful nation ever to exist, and will control the manna of the world, as well as have dominion over all trade routes for the entire continent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who will end up controlling it, and will the winner be right for the throne?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKian D'ahra- Prince of Gwynvyr, and rightful ruler of the nation now that his father has passed into the Summerlands.  He is the Choice of the Manna (as interpreted by the Druids), and the best choice for the Land.  Since his family came to rule the nation, it has experienced nearly a millenium of prosperity.  However, Kian is only a bastard son of the King and, thus, the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaegyn no Cistain- Queen of Dunnagal, and wife of Alcuin, distant Cousin to the former King of Gwynvyr.  It is Alcuin that has declared war on Kian, stating that his claim to the throne is stronger.  Maegyn disagrees and wishes that her husband would be content with Dunnagal, and plans to help Kian end this war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeric Glaswyd- First Knight of Gwynvyr, whose loyalty to Kian is unquestioned.  Kian is not the best fighter, being trained more to the manna and diplomacy, and it is thus Aeric and his warrior skills that will win or lose the war for Gwynvyr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGryffin Moorwood- Son of a blacksmith who is conscripted into making weapons for Aeric and his personal guard.  He is simple, barely educated, but good-hearted.  Could his actions help the usurper off the throne of his beloved country?  Maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManna = magick, for those who aren't clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake this as dark, sexual, perverse, and gory as you please.  It is GC for that reason!  Just please...write in depth additions that <i>really contribute</i> to whichever storyline you add to.  Also, I really, really despise doing things strictly for shock value, so please...try and keep this thing dark, perverse, sexual, etc without making it so very apparent.  And keep the grammar nice!  Thanks!  Write on and have fun.  Also, please write in THIRD PERSON!  None of this, \"You did this\" or \"I did that\" or I will delete your addition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit- One more note.  Please write your posts in past tense.  None of this \"Maegyn takes her husband's hand and holds it close.\"  Please do this: \"Maegyn TOOK her husband's hand and HELD it close.\"  Please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, I reiterate.  If you do not follow these rules, I WILL delete your chapters.</td>",
