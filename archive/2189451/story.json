            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things were relatively quite at the Cracked household but things were going to change. Tobias was like nearly any other boy his age in high school but there was annoyance he has in life, his twin sister Clea. He was a bit below the average weight for a boy his age while his sister was on the fatter side. Clea weighed in at a hefty 250 pounds compared to his 110 pounds. But that was near nothing compared to their 500 pound mother. There were two things Clea loves to do, eat and tease Tobias. They have an older bother named Clint but the only time they spend time with him now was when he manages to slip away from their mother and her insatiable hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are bones. Why don't you fatten up a bit and you could get a wonderful girl like me.\" Clea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I want to date a glutton or be one?\" Tobias said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mad because I'm beautiful at this size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias tried ignoring her for he knew her antics. It was true that Clea was the most beautiful girl in school at her size but that doesn't change his opinion about fattening himself up. There wasn't a single blemish on Clea's body and she liked it. Boys adored her and girls ignored Tobias with the exception of those who were terrified of Clea. In the end, he was still single dealing with the crap that Clea brings him.</span></div></div>",

It's delicious!\"  shouted Clea while placing out the paper plates and forks for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll eat some of course, barbecue ribs and mashed potatoes are my favorite anyway Clea,\"  said Tobias while choosing his seat to sit down at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll see how many of the ribs you eat.  You really should gain some weight!\"  said Clea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough for now Clea, let's eat everyone!\"  said Cliviea hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everyone sat down at their place at the table and everyone but Tobias greedily grabbed what they wanted to put on to their plate.  Tobias only grabbed four ribs and two spoonful's of mashed potatoes.  He doesn't like green beans so he left them on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tobias, I knew you were hardly going to eat anything!  This is why you're so skinny!  What the heck Tobias?!\"  shouted Clea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough Clea, let's continue to eat now instead,\"  said Clint who sometimes sticks up for Tobias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He knew that this was ticking Clea off but he didn't care at this point, that's how she always is toward him anyway, even if he were to get more she'd still be on his case.  All of the barbecue ribs and mashed potatoes are now gone, and a little bit of green beans were left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well everyone, anyone up for dessert?\"  asked Cliviea hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"  said Clint holding his plate out for some pie and ice-cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Include me in on this too!\"  said Clea doing the same thing Clint is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, just a little piece of the pie now, and no ice-cream,\"  said Tobias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All Tobias, the ice-cream won't make you gain weight!  Have some!\"  shouted Clea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough Clea.  Here you go everyone!\"  said Cliviea handing out the pie and ice-cream to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ma,\"  said Tobias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everyone had a second or third large piece of pie and ate all of it and the ice-cream.  Tobias just sat there watching them scarf everything down after he finished eating his small piece of pie.  Since Tobias was always first to finish eating, Cliviea made Clea do the clean up.  Sometimes Tobias helps her and sometimes he just goes to his room so he doesn't have to keep hearing her harass him about not eating like the rest of them did.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think my weigh is fine,\"  said Tobias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you should gain just a little more.  Anyway, I bet you can't get a date by Friday this week.  I got one for Monday and Friday night.  Monday it will be with Jake and Friday will be Phil,\"  said Clea boastingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy for you Clea,\"  said Tobias a little on the jealous side anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why not join a sport such as basketball?  You'll meet a girl that way if anything.  Or join the band!  That's an even better idea!\"  said Clea confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about this tonight and on the bus I'll let you know what I decide,\"  said Tobias not too thrilled knowing that he should consider Clea's advice and having to choose something to do just to have more of a chance to meet a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tobias went to his room afterward and thought about what he should choose to do.  Since he didn't weigh much, he thought that maybe it wouldn't be such a great idea to join a sport, especially one such as football.  He thought that joining basketball would be alright, but then he thought about being in the band instead...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
