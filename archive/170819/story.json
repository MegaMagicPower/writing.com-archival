Before you were welcomed into the world, your father died in a plane crash.  You now live with your mother, Marie, and your 15 year old sister, Julie, in a beautiful 2 story house.  You wake up one morning in a dollhouse that your mom gave you on your 10th birthday.  You step out on the hard floor to hear a loud thundering noise.  It's your mom coming to wake you up.  She can see you and hear you, but to be safe, you better find higher ground.</span></div></div>",

You climb, sometimes having to hug her leg like a tree when she moves it slightly. You climb up to her hemline. This was not easy. Miss Rose is the size of the Burj Khalifa to you. You almost fall off when you climb off her bare leg and onto her skirt. You cling to the material, taking a breather, and you trek up the skirt to her blouse. This did not take long at all.

You hear her footsteps as she walks to a table in the back corner of the room, with you in her palm. She takes a chair from the table and turns it to the front of the room. Still an hour and a half left in this class. The video dragged on about volcanoes. She sits down and crosses her legs. \u201cI'm going to set you in my blouse pocket, is that okay? I just feel like you\u2019d be safer with me. Especially after someone hitting you with that rubber band.\u201d Miss Rose says to you, holding you up to her face. You shake your head.

A long time passes with you chilling out with her.

You leap onto the fly's back--it buzzes and that gets Miss Rose's attention.  She looks down into the pocket and sees the fly near you and almost inside her blouse--she gasps a bit and begins to swat the fly.  This causes it to start flying--with you on its back! While the students are watching the video, Miss Rose watches as the fly begins to head toward one of the ceiling tiles (she thinks you're still in her pocket).  You call out (barely audible to Miss Rose): \"Miss Rose!  Help!  I can't hold onto the fly's back.  She looks around the room, hearing your voice, then sees the fly.  She gasps again (in a whisper).  Trying not to draw attention in the back of the classroom, Miss Rose gets an idea--she grabs a Kleenex box in the back of the room and tries to talk (in a low voice): \"Jump into the box!\"  You don't want this fly to suddenly move to one of the students, so you let go and make an almost perfect 10 dive into the Kleenex, then you climb out of the tissue to see Miss Rose's worried face.  At this point, the students have noticed Miss Rose holding the box and question her.  She responds that to the class that she thought she felt a sneeze coming--the students return to watching the video.  Then, Miss Rose looks down at you. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d She asks. You nod. You take comfort by cuddling close to Miss Rose's fingers.  You find comfort in smooth things for some reason. Miss Rose holds you close to your palm and heads to the front of the classroom--the video is almost over.  It shows a lava flow in Hawaii.  Finally class ends. Miss Rose brings her palm up to her eyes.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you had an encounter with a rubber band and a common housefly.\u201d She says in a worried tone.  \"I'm glad you are alright though,\" she adds in a comforting tone.  \u201cThanks.\u201d You say. \u201cWant me to be your \u2018partner\u2019 and go around with you this semester? This is surprisingly the only class period I teach during the day. After that, I just help out others.\u201d  You think about her potentially lifesaving offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also are thankful that she saved you without causing a commotion in the back of the classroom.</span></div></div>",

She stands up as you walk into the hallway. But before you can go any further, a student nearly steps on you. Then another, and another. You dodge shoes back into the room, and in fear you run and hug an enormous red low heel pump.  The one you are not hugging begins to tap in a \"I told you so\" manner.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThats what I\u2019m saying, buddy. You\u2019re gonna get hurt.\u201d Miss Rose booms, looking down at you. You stop hugging her pump and look up. Miss Rose backs up a little.

THUD.  \u201cNeed a hand?\u201d Miss Rose jokes, lowering her palm to you. You sorta admire her positivity in the wake of scary things, like nearly getting stepped on and riding a housefly. She is just so friendly. You quickly board her hand, and she raised you back up. \u201cOk, so your next class is art, right?\u201d Miss Rose asks. \u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d You reply. Miss Rose smiled at you. You seriously admire her kindness now. She takes the Kleenex box used to catch you from before, and places it on desk. She walks over to her desk and pulls a sticky note pack from a drawer, and puts it into the blouse pocket, then places you into her pocket, with you standing on the trailer sized sticky note pack, allowing you to see out of her pocket. She looks down at you, and smiles. You seriously start to like your giantess teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Rose walks to the door. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.  She takes her keys from her skirt pocket and locks the classroom door, turns off the lights, and starts off down the crowded hallway. She walks into the Art section, and walks up to a set of two classrooms. One of which is your class, which she doesn\u2019t know. \u201cWhich one is it?\u201d Miss Rose asks. You look at the doors from her blouse pocket. They are labeled 12 and 14. You know your class is one of these two, but forget which one as well.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You do consider the mother for a moment, but the sight of her huge black pumps, nearly identical to the ones you just spent nearly an hour inside, raises to much of an aversion. Your nostrils still are filled with the smell of your mom's foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you turn and head over to the little girl who's looming (although not nearly as high) over in the distance in the corner. She's wearing blue overalls and a light green shirt, with braided blonde hair in pigtails. The back of her head and the broad expanse of her back, leaning away from you into the corner she's kneeling in, are about all you can see of her, she\u2019s humming to herself quietly to herself and seems to be playing with something on the floor in front of her. Hopefully something you can join in one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou haven't had much experience with little girls, or anyone else for that matter, except for Julie, and that didn't give you much insight. When Julie was a little girl and was made to \"play\" with you, it usually involved her sticking you somewhere... unpleasant, often trapped on a piece of used gum, rather than letting you play with her previous toys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought did make you a bit nervous and you slowed down on your jog towards the corner for a second, but you steeled yourself- nothing bad would happen while the girl was in the room with her own mother, after all. Besides, today was supposed to be your first day of school, and you were supposed to be meeting new people. If you couldn't meet someone your own age, at least you'd meet this younger person, a chance for a real meeting not supervised by your often overbearing Mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl loomed larger and larger, filling the world in front of your 2 inch body. Finally you stopped just behind her, her butt leaning back on her heels looming overhead, body blocking out all of your vision in front. Just as you draw in a breath to yell, you experience a moment of pure terror as her butt suddenly comes hurtling towards you, faster than you can blink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a very undignified squeak and fall backwards as the massive, rounded blue wall lurches towards you. You land on your rear and start crab-scooting away, but it\u2019s her but has already stopped moving towards you- the girl had just sat up and leaned back a little, taking a break or something. As your heartbeat pounds, gradually slowing, you realize your foolish error- Mom and Julie were always careful in your house (relatively, at least), knowing the possibility that you might be around. This girl had no idea you were there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had already spent too long today trapped in your mom\u2019s shoe- you aren\u2019t about to risk spending more of it trapped underneath a little girls\u2019 bum. Time to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeling yourself and drawing in breath again (from a slightly safer distance), you let out your loudest yell:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey! Down Here! Hello!!!\u201d You\u2019re yelling at the top of your lungs, and your voice can be quite piercing if you try, so within moments the head far above you jerks and starts looking around wildly. Encouraged, you begin gesticulating wildly with your arms:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDown here!!\u201d You scream again. She finally starts looking down and around her, and very quickly her eyes lock on your tiny form. They squint, for a moment, then widen, quickly into 2 huge Os. She\u2019s still for a moment, and you try to seize the initiative:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, My name\u2019s Mark, what\u2019s your-\u201c Your words are cut off as a giant hand shoots out and encircles you, crushing you into her sealed fist. You\u2019re surrounded by her flesh, although unharmed- her squeezing is just enough to totally immobilize you, not enough to hurt. You have just enough time to start doubting your choice of person to approach before you rapidly feel the bottom of your stomach drop out. You can tell you\u2019re zooming into the air, but of course can\u2019t see or hear anything, which is extremely disorienting. Julie and mom usually pick you up far more gently than this, and ask first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as your roller-coast began, it ends. The hand opens up; blinding you momentarily, then you find yourself looking out across the boring office room at a considerably greater height than previously. You shakily get to your feet, stumbling a little from your dizziness and the slightly yielding surface of the palm below you, and slowly turn around \u2013 only to be confronted by the girl\u2019s giant nose right in front of you, and still-rounded eyes looming directly overhead- the girl has her palm right up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock is too much, and you fall over again, although the palm is much softer then the floor was previously. The girl lets out a few giggles at your apparent antics, air blowing too and fro over your body and ruffling your clothes to a great degree with her nostrils so close. Suddenly, she stops giggling, and her nose starts to wrinkle. She takes another few, more delicate sniffs and her face screws up entirely. Before you can say anything, she suddenly thrusts her hand away from her face, disorienting you yet again as you hang on for dear life to the fleshy surface below you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeld now at a safe distance, you try to muster yourself to speak again, despite this poor first impression. Clearly, the foot smell that still fills your nose was also quite detectable by your current holder. Not a good start, but you think it shouldn\u2019t be a problem, although you ruefully admit it might have been better to stay with your mom bored on her desk. As the girls\u2019 face smooths out again and she looks towards you again curiously, it finally occurs to you to wonder exactly who this girl is, and how she\u2019s going to take meeting a 2-inch person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is this girl, and how\u2019s she going to interact with you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked you over with he brown eyes. You thought peering down might make you feel better instead of lookign straight at her. You however forgot the state her top was in because when you looked down you saw right to the floor inbetween her breasts. She saw you looking down and looked down too.<br>\r\n\"You little...\" Was all she said. She was so shocked at you that she let go. You fell right down her shirt and came out the other side. When you were sure you were gonna die from hitting the floor you felt a hand intersecpt your fall. The hand raised you back up past her shirt.<br>\r\n\"Perv I knew...\" Courtney said. <br>\r\n\"Its your fault, you need to think where you put a boy Court. You could have killed him, and life is more important than you privacy.\" You heard behind you. You quickly turned around to see who saved your life. You saw Isabel's face staing down at you. You were happy she saved you so you bent over and kissed her hand in appreciation.<br>\r\n\"Tehehe. You don't have to do that Mark.\" She told you. \"I think you better keep him Amy, he knows you best.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah. Thats what I kinda want to.\" You say shyly hoping not to offened the other 3 girls.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Amy says cheerfully happy you picked her. Isabel slides you onto Amy's open palm. \"While were all here how about we decide how to carry Mark if we find him lost or something.\" Amy suggests.<br>\r\n\"Well, we could just carry him in our bags or something.\" Kalea piped in.<br>\r\n\"That isn't an always solution. What if we don't have our bag?\" Amy responded.<br>\r\n\"How about in our pocket.\" Isabel put fourth.<br>\r\n\"Well, neither Isabel or I have pockets with us right now.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n\"How about down our shirts. I'm sure he'd like it.\" Courtney said pointing at her chest.<br>\r\n\"That may work for you, but us 3 don't quite have large enough boobs to pull it off.\" Amy said shyly.<br>\r\n\"Well then how about thats best to worst scenarios and if we can't meet the first three we can...\" Amy said. She put you in her mouth and put you up against the cheek using her tounge. \"Do this.\" She finished before spitting you back out onto her open palm.<br>\r\n\"I disagee with the last 2 ideas entirely. First of all I'm not a pervert and second being eaten as a last resort is not on my list of things to do.\" You say to them.<br>\r\n\"Okay, Okay scratch the last 2 ideas.\" Said all 4 of them in unison hanging their heads. \"Its okay.\" You say to them. \"I didn't mean to make you sad. I was just adding input into the conversation.\" You say making them all feel better. Well for now I have my bag we can discuss this at lunch. Mark and I have class is 15 minutes. <br>\r\n\"Hey, can I hold him Amy?\" Asked Kalea seeming to be less shy now that she was used to you.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Said Amy sliding you onto Kalea's open palm much like Isabel did earlier. <br>\r\n\"How about I do this.\" Kalea said. pulling the braid from her hair letting it fall down to her waist. She put Mark inside the braid and started to do Amy's hair with it.<br>\r\n\"Tehehe.\" Amy said. \"It feel weird having someone in the braid when you hair is being done up.\" When the ponytail was finished Mark was dead in the centre of red and black hair.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure hes fine up there.\" Courtney said. <br>\r\n\"Off the class than.\" Isabel stated. <br>\r\nTrapped inside the prison of hair you heard them say this. You felt the braid move slightly as Amy walked to class. All of a sudden you feel heavy movement around you and it hurts a tiny bit. You feel Amy's hand lift up from under and lift you to her face.

You don't know if you should be thankful for or furious at that strap, because by the time you reach the school you're covered in dirt all over, and you're panting as if you were in military school for two hours.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<i>How am I going to make friends like THIS?</i> you think miserably to yourself.</span></div></div>",

She reaches in and lifts you out and places you on top of her vanity table. You stand there among her giant girl stuff - giant bottles of nail polish, perfume, makeup and other various items. \"Now you wait right here; I have a special surprise for you,\" Heather says.</span></div></div>",

I also found some wonderful doll furniture.\" \"Heather you can't keep me in a cage,\" you yell. Heather reaches down and shoves you with the tip of her index finger and you fall into the cage. \"This will be a wonderful home for you.  Look you have everything you need. A little toy chair, a little toy table, a food trough, a water bottle, and an exercise wheel.\" \"Please Heather, you can't keep me locked up in here like some sort of animal.\" \"It's for your own good sweetie. I can't have you running around the house. You might accidentally get stepped on. It's for your own protection. Little creatures belong in cages,\" she says to you. \"Are you hungry?,\" she asks. You nod your head. You haven't eaten all day. \"Good,\" she says \"I'll go get you some hamster pellets.\" You look at her in shock. \"I'm just kidding. I'll bring you some scraps from my plate when I'm done.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe leaves the room and you pace around in the cage.  You can't believe what is happening.

You wonder whether molly will be nice to you, or return you home. Just thinking about home makes you think about Julie. The thought of her selling you makes you think. \"And only for 5 thousand dollars!\" you mutter, angry. You eventually reach her house. You peak over the top edge of her pocket.

It is made for 6 inch dolls, making you toddler or baby size. You sigh, then you realize that it is better than walking around in Molly's bedroom, made for normal sized people. You walk into the hallway, and then get a shock. Molly's enormous face is right in front of you, her nose an inch away from you chest. You jump. Molly withdraws her head some.<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she says \"I've just never seen anything in there move on its own.\" she seems sorry, so you calm down some. Suddenly her mom yells:<br>\r\n\"Molly, it is time for dinner!\" Molly looks out the door, than back at you. She says:<br>\r\n\"I'll bring back some for you, you can stay hear and explore.\" With that, she gets up and walks out, her massive footsteps making the dollhouse shake a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You turn back to the hallway. This is the side of the house that's open, giving you a view of Molly's bed. The size of a football field to you, it has a blue blanket. The table the house is on is right across from her pillow. You decide to go to the kitchen. You walk down the hallway, passing a staircase. You enter the kitchen. The table is above your head, and you are level with the seats of the chairs. You walk around the table, into the \"working part of the kitchen. The counters are all over your head. The fridge is in front of you. You walk over and on a whim try to open it. To your surprise it does, but it does not have anything but plastic food. You try the cabinets. They all open to, revealing utensils and pans that would look normal in a real kitchen. You begin to appreciate the detail that went into making this house. You still have some time, so you walk into the hallway and climb the stairs. Each stair is half your height, so you have to pull yourself up. It opens onto another hallway, leading away from the open wall. You take the first door on the right. It is a study, with books lining the walls. You go to one of the bookshelves and take off a book. It is \"Tom Thumb\". You put it back and find \"Thumbelina\". You chuckle at the irony. The next book you pull off is \"Robinson Crusoe.\" You open it up on the floor because it is too heavy to read while standing. You are astonished, it is an actual miniature reproduction of the real book. You smile, then drag it over to one of the chairs. It is purple, for a change. You struggle with the book, lifting it onto the cushion. You climb up after it. You sit down, pull it onto your lap and begin to read. You manage to get through the first chapter when...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The view of eyes the size of your body looking at you like that is a bit disconcerting, but you yell back:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's great.

The chair you are sitting on is really cushioned, instead of fake as you have seen in your infrequent visits to other dollhouses. \"My parents said to take care of it and I do. This dollhouse belonged to my grandpa, who was in a business selling them. It is one of his finest works.\" She smiles, thinking about old memories. \"Anyway, I brought you some food.\" she draws back and outs her hand in the kitchen. While she is doing that, you climb off the kitchen and make your way downstairs. In front of the dollhouse you see Molly's shirt, her arm in the kitchen. You walk into the kitchen. It reminds you again that the house is the wrong size for you. She is using her hands quite delicately to put stuff on the table. You smell broccoli, bread and beef. You walk over to a chair. You lever yourself up, then go to the table. You are in a bit of a quandary, because you can\u2019t lift yourself that far. Suddenly, you feel Molly grab hold of the back of your shirt and lift you into the air. She sets you down on the table. You look up at her. She smiles back. \"Just trying to help\" she says, her breath smelling like the stuff in the kitchen. You decide to thank her. \"Thank you,\" you say, \"this house is a bit big.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You walk over to your dinner. As you suspect, dinner is beef, broccoli and bread. There is even a thimble of milk. It is all a bit big, but you manage. There is a plate and a napkin on the table, with fork and knife. You sit cross legged on the table, which stretches out in a disturbing way. You eat your dinner, with Molly watching you the whole time. Finally, you finish and she offers you dessert in the form of a chocolate bar. She is still on the bed, watching you. She opens up the wrapper, making a large crinkling noise to you. She takes off a tiny piece of chocolate to her and puts it on your plate. It fills the whole thing. You break off chunks of it while Molly eats, her titanic molars ripping through enough food to feed you for a month with ease. You try not to shudder. You finish your chocolate and climb off the table and chair. She reaches in and takes the plates out.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to wash these later,\" she says. Her warm breath smells a lot like chocolate. It doesn\u2019t smell too bad, actually. Then she gets up and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She puts her other palm over it, interlocking her fingers and blocking out the light. In the darkness, you worry. This could be a very embarrassing scene. The heat her hands are giving off is making you sweaty. You hear a voice.<br>\r\n\"Molly, time for bed.\" her dad says from outside her hands.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take a bath.\" She says. Your heart skips a beat. A bath, with HER?! You grow very scared. When she reaches the bathroom, she puts you on the counter and closes the door.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take a bath in the tub, you are going to take one in the sink where you can't peak.\" She says it very sternly. You feel relieved. If you can't peak, neither can she. She fills the sink halfway with hot water, than turns it off. You walk over to the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her sink is bowl shaped, with a terrace under the edge but over the water. You slide down the white surface. You can't see over the edge into the room, but you can see Molly standing over you. She drops a piece of soap into the water, and puts a bit of shampoo larger then your head next to you from a bottle. She also puts a bit of tissue next to you, for drying off You look up and thank her. She smiles, then  turns away. you can hear the thunderous sound of water running. You make sure by listening that she is in the tub, then you get in yourself. the water is hot but it feels good after the cold day in the cage. You swim around for a while, then you get up and towel off with the bit of tissue. you dress as fast as possible. You then pull the plug of the drain using a connected chain next to you. The slightly soapy water whirlpools away and you shutter. Just then, you hear Molly getting out of the bath, toweling dry and getting dressed.

You nod \u201cI was worried for a moment, that you might want us to share a tub.\u201d She laughs. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Come on, its bed time.\u201d With that, she walks back into her room and sets you in front of the doll house again. You walk back into the oversized living room and make your way to the stairs. Molly has turned off the overhead light and has turned on a lamp on her other side. You squint, the light is behind her big body. \u201cThe bedrooms are upstairs\u201d she says as she lays down, putting her head on the pillow. You say \u201cThank you for rescuing me.\u201d She smiles back \u201cit was the least I could do, my classmates and teacher were being so mean to you. Now get to bed quickly, my mom will be up any minute to tuck me in.\u201d You hear this and scramble up the stairs. <br>\r\n   The hallway leads away from the open wall. The bedroom on the left is a baby\u2019s room. You ignore it and walk into the far right room. It is a regular room with a bed that you have trouble getting onto. You manage it by climbing the side table and jumping on. The bed is really oversized, made for dolls three times your size. However, the blankets and sheets are soft. You go to the pillow and get under the covers. You too hot. You get back up. You make sure that Molly can\u2019t see in, then you take off your shirt and pants, leaving on your undies just to make sure. You scramble under the covers again. The pillow is very big to you, so you get under more. You feel the bed tremble and molly\u2019s mom comes in. She walks over to Molly. You are grateful that you managed to get up here in time. <br>\r\n\u201cGood Night sweetie pie\u201d her mom says.<br>\r\n\u2018Good night mom\u201d molly replies. You feel a bit homesick, but you know that you\u2019ll get there tomorrow. Molly turns off the light, and you both go to sleep. The next morning\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is all too big, but you sleep anyway. You gradually return to consciousness after a long sleep. You heard a click and a rumble, but your foggy mind dismisses it. You don't really want to get up, but you do, so you open your eyes, and end up staring at Molly's enormous blue eye, which is right in front of the room.<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\" you shout, startled.<br>\r\n\"Good morning mark!\" she says brightly. You are confused; you thought this room was not an open one. \"Its time to get up.\" she withdraws her head and reaches for your blanket.<br>\r\n\"Molly, please don't!\" You yell at her, panic filling your voice. You really don't want her to see you in your undies.<br>\r\n\"Why!\" she asks, curious. Her massive hand has stopped, but it is still too close to the bed for comfort. \"Please, just turn around.\" You say, trying to keep your head only over the covers. She is confused, but then comprehension spreads across her face. She blushes as well, and then stands up turns around, her massive back filing your view. You reach for your clothes and scramble into them. \"You can look now\" you shout at her. She turns back around. It is morning, and she has changed out of her pajamas, and brushed her teeth from the mint smell of her breath. The wall that you thought was a permanent fixture was the one that looked out onto the room. Across the sea-like blue carpet you see the massive door, big even at this distance. Molly got back on her knees, at a comfortable distance so you can see most of her face.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Mark\u201d she says, sounding apologetic. She sounds sincere, and she probably didn\u2019t know what you were in anyways. You stand up. Your weight does not make much of an impression on the bed. You use the blanket as a short slide and get off the bed. You only come up to the wooden frame. You would not even have to duck very far to get under the bed. You sigh and walk over to the edge of the of the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You look down. The floor is a very long way down. But right below you there is a thin strip of table, which is not as big of a fall. You look back at molly. She has blue eyes and brown hair which comes to her shoulder. She has good, even teeth and a nice smile, which makes you feel better just looking at it. She has lost most of her baby fat, but she looks all of her 8 years.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to the wall?\u201d You ask, already guessing the answer.<br>\r\n\u201cGrandma made all four walls and the ceiling removable. This house seems a bit big for you.\u201d She says the last with some curiosity tingeing her voice.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m too small. The dolls must have been at least 6 inches tall.\u201d You speak this comment, hoping she can hear you this close. To your relief, she can. You were getting a bit hoarse from yelling to be heard.<br>\r\n\u201cThey were. I put them in storage before I went to get you from school. I didn\u2019t think you would like being around them.\u201d She was right. Whenever Julie brought some to your room as a joke, you always felt even smaller than usual. Thinking of your sister made you frown. Molly did not notice. \u201cI\u2019m going to get breakfast; I\u2019ll put this wall back also.\u201d With that, she reached over to the bed on her left and picked up the wall that you had thought was stationary. She brought it in front of you and slid it in place. You could here her locking some kind of bolt. You watch out of the window-that was made with real glass-as she gets up and walks out the room, closing the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have to sit down on each stair and drop, which takes a while. You eventually reach the bottom and head into the kitchen. It is like it was the night before, with oversized chairs and table. You decide to get out the utensils while you are waiting. You walk into the cooking section. The counters are very tall, and all the utensils are in drawers and top counters. You look around for something to climb. You try one of the chairs, but it is too big and you can\u2019t budge it, much less drag it over to the counter. You look at the lower cabinets. You pull one door open. Inside there are pots and pans. The Cabinet is divided in half by a wooden plane, on top of which are more pots. The plane is about chest level. You climb up, and then stand up. The counter is still above you, but you use the handle on a drawer to pull yourself up. You reach the counter. It is white, an imitation of marble. You start checking things. The \"breadbox\" and the \"spice rack\" don't help, but you try the drawers. You lie down on your belly and pull one open. It has knives, forks and spoons, all metal. You pick these up and set them next to you. Then you encounter a problem. The plates and cups are above you in cabinets, but you can't reach them. There is nothing you can stand on that will elevate you. You finally give up. As you are thinking about getting down, you hear the door open. Molly comes in, the house shaking ever so slightly as she walks. She sits on her bed and starts looking for you. She looks to the upper story, giving you a view of her rounded, and massive, chin. <br>\r\n\"Mark?\" she calls,  searching the second story for your tiny form.<br>\r\n\"Down here\" you yell.

She looks at you, then nods. Suddenly, her hand comes into the kitchen. You scoot back on the counter, surprised. Her hand picks you up, and then moves back. It lets go. You land on your butt on the kitchen table. It actually hurts some. You get up and start rubbing the painful area. It is sore from a fall that looked like an inch to her but was like three feet to you. She notices, \u201cSorry Mark, I was trying to help you out.\u201d You nod, and then she picks up the utensils and plates that it took you ten minutes to get and puts them in front of you. She withdraws her hand from the kitchen. She is sitting down with her knees over the bed, looking in at you.<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I brought you some breakfast.\u201d She reaches in and puts some food on your plate. There is scrambled egg, a bit of bacon and some pancake, all of which are tiny to her but more then enough for you. She puts a thimble of milk next to you.

This is a sore spot for you, but she is obviously curious and she really deserves to know, since she rescued you from that cage. You look up at her, than begin. You tell her about your life, and how opn the first day of high school for you Julie sold you to Heather, Amy\u2019s big sister. You tell her about how you were treated, as no more than a pet.

It is some bread, water and some peanut butter, as well as some more chocolate. She also has something else, which she puts down outside of the house.

The house still has enough light coming through the windows to see by, so you go into the living room. You are curious to see what Molly set outside, so you walk out the front door. You are greeted by a view of Molly\u2019s room. The blue rug extends to the horizon, going to Molly\u2019s door, which is blue. To your right is her bed, and to your left is her dresser. A window is above and to the left of the Dollhouse, giving you some light. Also, there is a light bulb set in the ceiling, which is, unsurprisingly, blue. It also has clouds painted on it. You realize that with those clouds and the color, the ceiling is made to look like a noon sky. You think it is clever; whoever painted it is very good. You can even see the shapes in the clouds. You tear your gaze away and look towards the bed. Near the bed at the right corner of the house is a bottle cap. You walk over. Leaning against the wall of the house is a scrap of paper bigger than you are. You read the writing. It is block print, a bit rudimentary. It says \u201csorry.\u201d You are a bit confused, so you climb into the bottle cap. Your foot gets in a ways before it hits a yielding surface. You get your other foot in and look down, there was a yellow substance. You reach down and pick up a handful. It is sand, fine, soft sand. You suddenly realize what it is. The note said sorry, so Molly was obviously apologizing for this. It was your privy, or-more honestly-your litter box. You feel a little nauseous. This was obviously why Molly blushed. You grit your teeth. Molly was obviously thinking ahead, and she was sorry. You steel yourself, than do your business. You quickly cover the soiled sand, then get out as fast as you can.

Then at the last moment, they throw you out of the house to fend for yourself saying that you're not worth their time. You then got picked up by a group of women who began quarreling over you, offering up large sums of cash to - well no one seeing as how you're alone - so they can have you. When the woman with the most money gets you, she puts you in a cage and parades you around the country as 'The Incredible Tiny Freak!' or 'The Fantastic Insect Man!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly the woman's show changes to involve her performing in front of a live audience showing them how much pain you can withstand; she does things like squeezing you, stepping on you, sitting on you, smashing you with her breasts; then there are other things she does like making you smell her feet, farting on you, defecating on you. She even goes as far as to use you to pleasure her. But eventually she runs out of juicy ideas and the show's audience starts to decline. She then decides to have one final show involving killing you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are laid on the floor of the stage and she lifts her foot over you and stomps you. You don't die, she just crushes the lower half of her body. She then lifts you off the ground and says to the audience that this shall be your final performance and tells you to take a bow. She says that for your last act, she'll make you disappear. The audience applauds as she lifts you to her mouth and lowers you. You look at the audience and see your mom and sister, laughing with delight, the same way they were when you saw them earlier that day. Your last sight is entering the woman's mouth, then her throat, and then darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up screaming. You look around seeing that you're still in Molly's arms. You thank God it was only a dream. But then you think, why should you thank God? God is the one who made you like this! Who made you in this flawed two inch body! He's the one that birthed you to a family that gave less than spit about you!!! God didn't care about you either. You start crying...but not tears of sadness. Tears of Rage. Why should you be subjected to this miserable life? Why does everyone else get to be normal and lead happier lives?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit there angry, only one thought enters your mind; Revenge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They all deserve to DIE!!!\"</span></div></div>",

At first you think someone found one of those game fairies.  But you open your eyes and see Heather.  \"Hey, sleepyhead I got you some eggs and bacon\", Heather tells you as see places the plate in front of you.  \"Thanks\", you say happily and eat away.  Once your done eating Heather comes and takes your plate.  \"Heather\", you say, \"What's on your mind.\"  Heather asks in response.  \"Do you know when Julie is coming back?\" you ask.  \"In a month or 2\", Heather says \"But right now can you help me find out what movie we're gonna see\".  \"No problem\" you say, \"As long as it isn't to loud\".  <br>\r\nFor about an hour the two of you talk about movies and reviews.  Finally the two of you decide to see a comedy.  \"Stay here for a sec Mark I need to get out of this cheerleading outfit\".  Heather walks over to her closet, goes inside, and closes the door.  5 minutes pass and Heather emerges from the closet.  \"What do you think\" Heather says pointing to her clothes.  Right now she is wearing a sleeveless white shirt with a short wavy skirt and open toe sandals.  You are speecheless.  \"Beautiful\" is all you manage to say.  \"Aw you're sweet\" Heather happily says, smiles and picks you up.  \"You can sit on my shoulder Mark\"  Heather tells you then places you ontop of her right shoulder.  You try your best to grab on as Heather walks down the stairs.  As she walks down the street you look at her.  Heather then looks at you.  At first you want to look away, but you don't.<br>\r\n\"You nervous?\" Heather asks you.  \"No just lost in your eyes\" you say.  Heather laughs, picks you up, and holds you up to her face.  \"Alot of boys say that to me\" Heather tells you.  \"Sorry\", you say \"I just think you look Beautiful today\".  \"But it's working WELL for you.\" Heather whispers to you and puckers her lips.  You do the same and for the first time you kissed Heather.  \"You are a good kisser\" Heather compliments.  You then blush.  <br>\r\n3 minutes of silence later the two of you reach the theater and buy the tickets.  You and Heather find a seat in the middle of the theater and you sit on the arm rest.  The movie soon starts and loud music starts to play.  You cover your ears and Heather sees you struggling.  Then you feel her arm go around to comfort you.  You look up at her and you can tell by her face she's saying \"It's okay Mark\".  You get used to the noise and move on with your date.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking at the red stain on her sole, she smiles and raises her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom,...\" she started before her mother stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Julie, I already noticed when you yelled, it was an honest mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Julie through the rearview and smiled. \"Maybe it was for the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie smiled back back, and then removed her sandal. She pressed her barefoot onto her now stain of a little brother and she thought to herself \" Stupid bug, maybe I should've sold you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed her foot into the floor until not even the stain remained.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yet in spite \r<br>\nof the continual distraction, you do now and them \r<br>\nmanage to return to your survey, and even to \r<br>\nfinish it (the questions were that easy for you), \r<br>\nand have probably done at least as well as any of \r<br>\nyour peers.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMrs. Andrews calls on the class to pass in their \r<br>\nsurveys.  After her feet return to her shoes and \r<br>\nyour head returns to reality, she walks around her \r<br>\ndesk and reaches down for your paper.  \u201cHmm,\u201d she \r<br>\nsays as she looks at your miniscule scrawl, \u201cI\u2019m \r<br>\ngoing to end up with glasses by the time my year \r<br>\nwith you is over.\u201d  As she says this, the bell \r<br>\nrings, and the class gets up to leave.

We just have to set your desk on a secure \r<br>\nand level table of the right size and shape.  \r<br>\nWe\u2019ll have it here for you next time.\u201d  Your face \r<br>\nmust betray your immense disappointment, for she \r<br>\nregisters surprise.  \u201cBut honey, isn\u2019t that what \r<br>\nyou wanted?

After all, we mustn\u2019t subject \r<br>\nyou to such distractions -- at least not during \r<br>\nclass time.\u201d  As she says this she slips off one \r<br>\nof her shoes, and holds her foot out so close to \r<br>\nyou, that you have to look way up to see her toes \r<br>\nwiggling above you.  \u201cBesides, this pretty little \r<br>\nTootsie may be fetching, but don\u2019t you think she\u2019s \r<br>\na little big for you?  She\u2019s three or four times \r<br>\nyour size.\u201d  She slips her foot back into her \r<br>\nshoe, which exposes to her your wide eyed, open \r<br>\nmouthed expression.

She carries you and the food on \r<br>\nthe tray over to a table of her friends, and sets \r<br>\nthe tray down.  She begins skimming her food with \r<br>\na fork and scraping it in front of you on the rim \r<br>\nof the plate, as she says: \"How's about a little \r<br>\nof ... this, and a little of ... this, and ...\"  \r<br>\nHer friends all lean forward toward you and giggle \r<br>\nwith delight as they watch you obediently eat what \r<br>\nshe sets before you.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hey, so what's the joke?\"  The girls sit back and \r<br>\nlook up.  There they see Craig Bradley and two of \r<br>\nhis pals standing at the table.  Craig now notices \r<br>\nyou.  \"Hey, you guys, look: she's got the shrimp!\"  \r<br>\nHe bends down for a closer look.  \"Man, he's even \r<br>\na shrimpier than I thought.  Hey there, shrimp!\"  \r<br>\nElissa scoops you up and presses you close to her \r<br>\nbosom.  \"Man,\" Craig cries, \"What is your problem?  \r<br>\nEver since last night you've been acting like an \r<br>\nass!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Last night, you were the one acting like an ass,\" \r<br>\nshe snaps back.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hey, you know, I don't treat just any girl like \r<br>\nthat.  That's the way I treat my girl.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh, that really makes me feel sooo much better!\" \r<br>\nshe sneers.  \"So from now on, maybe you can just \r<br>\ncut out the 'my girl' stuff, okay?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What -- like you got someone else?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah, I do.\"  She pauses for a moment.  Her eyes \r<br>\nthen light up, and suddenly you feel this rush of \r<br>\nwind, as Elissa whisks you away from herself and \r<br>\ninto Craig's face.  \"Him.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Him?  Quit actin' like an ass!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well it's true.\"  She holds you up to her face.  \r<br>\n\"Didn't you tell me that you're my boyfriend now?\"  \r<br>\nThen she whispers for only you to hear: \"Nod your \r<br>\nhead yes.\"  You do so.  \"See?\" she says, \"He just \r<br>\nsaid yes.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah?\" Craig growls, \"Well then the shrimp's dead \r<br>\nmeat.

I'll take you now over to Beasley's, then \r<br>\nyou get a student to take you to Lorenzo's.  But \r<br>\nonce Lorenzo\u2019s class is over, don\u2019t move.  You \r<br>\nwait for me there.

I get you!\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cI hope so.\u201d she says, as she drops you into her \r<br>\nshirt pocket and walks you to your next class.  \r<br>\nThere she finds another desk your size waiting for \r<br>\nyou on the teacher's desk.  She pulls you out of \r<br>\nher pocket and holds you up to her face again.  \r<br>\n\u201cRemember, after Lorenzo\u2019s class you wait for me \r<br>\nthere.  You wait for me there.\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d you cry,  \u201cI'm not an idiot.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Then stop acting like one,\" she says.  She looks \r<br>\nat you pensively for a moment, kisses you lightly \r<br>\non the head, and puts you in your desk.  \u201cSee you \r<br>\nlater,\u201d she says, and as she walks out the door, \r<br>\nadds, \u201cand quit the goofy stuff!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nOh, at times like this, how you wish you could be \r<br>\nseven feet tall instead of two inches tall.  How \r<br>\nyou wish you could tower over your sister.  Then \r<br>\nmaybe she wouldn\u2019t be so bossy.  Then again, you \r<br>\nthink to yourself, maybe she still would.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou don't mind sitting atop Miss Beasley's desk, \r<br>\nsince there is enough clutter on it to keep you \r<br>\nfrom being the center of attention.  Besides, as \r<br>\nsoon as the plump and aging Miss Beasley appears, \r<br>\nyou realize that looking for fifty minutes at her \r<br>\nbloated feet would not be the most thrilling of \r<br>\nexperiences.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThat thought triggers in you a return in thought \r<br>\nto Mrs. Andrews.  Soon the drone of Miss Beasley's \r<br>\nvoice fades into the background, as you fall deep \r<br>\ninto a daydream.  Mrs. Andrews is at your summer \r<br>\nplace in Hadley Beach, wearing a two piece bathing \r<br>\nsuit, sunglasses, and straw hat.  She walks across \r<br>\nthe sand, spreads out her beach towel close to the \r<br>\nwater, and sets herself on it.  After she applies \r<br>\nan ample amount of lotion on her skin, she lies on \r<br>\nher stomach and falls asleep.  You creep up to her \r<br>\nfeet, and meditate on her exposed soles.  You dare \r<br>\nto climb up one of them and roll down, which must \r<br>\ntickle her, for her other foot comes over to brush \r<br>\nyou off.  That was a little dangerous, you figure.  \r<br>\nSo you content yourself to nestle onto the curled \r<br>\nunderside of her toes, where you fall asleep.  And \r<br>\nthere you lie, for the remainder of Miss Beasley's \r<br>\nclass.  The spell of Mrs. Andrews has again taken \r<br>\nhold of you.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAt the sound of the bell, an overweight boy with a \r<br>\npimply chin offers to take you to your next class, \r<br>\nand grabs you in his sweaty hand.  Another desk is \r<br>\nwaiting for you when you arrive at Mr. Lorenzo's.  \r<br>\nYou sit in the desk, and try hard to pay attention \r<br>\nto algebra, but just cannot shake off your mental \r<br>\npicture of Mrs. Andrews.  When the class finally \r<br>\nends, and the other students rush out, Mr. Lorenzo \r<br>\noffers to take you to your next destination.  You \r<br>\nonly ask that he set you down onto the floor; he \r<br>\ndoes so, and returns to his desk.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou remember what Julie said: stay in Mr Lorenzo's \r<br>\nclassroom until she comes for you.  But maybe she \r<br>\nwon't be arriving for a few minutes.  And maybe in \r<br>\nthose few minutes you could sneak down the hall to \r<br>\ncatch a quick look into Mrs. Andr</span></div></div>",

Still you are disappointed \r<br>\nthat she was the only person from school who did.  \r<br>\nBut tomorrow is another day.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSince you are sick to your stomach early the next \r<br>\nmorning, your mother forbids you to go to school \r<br>\nagain.  That afternoon, even though you feel much \r<br>\nbetter, your mother insists you stay in bed.  She \r<br>\ndoes, however, carry your bed -- with you in it -- \r<br>\ndownstairs, and sets it on the kitchen table.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAt 3:30, while your mother is preparing supper, \r<br>\nthe front door bursts open and slams shut.  You \r<br>\ndon\u2019t even have to look to know it\u2019s Julie.  But \r<br>\nyou wonder why she doesn\u2019t come into the kitchen.  \r<br>\nYou look over to see her standing at the door; she \r<br>\nappears upset.  Your mother turns to look; Julie \r<br>\nmotions her over.  By the time Julie has finished \r<br>\nher whisperings, your mother also appears upset.  \r<br>\nShe returns to chopping vegetables, as if nothing \r<br>\nwere wrong.  You hear only the chop-chop-chop-chop \r<br>\nof her knife for several minutes.  Then, \u201cI don\u2019t \r<br>\nwant you going to that school anymore.\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\nOh no!  Family conflict!\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"But ma ...!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No, Mark, that's it.  I don't want you there.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"But you said ...\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Never mind what I said.  A public school is too \r<br>\ndangerous a place for a two inch tall boy.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"But ... you can't teach me anymore.  You even \r<br>\nsaid ...\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Just because I don't feel qualified to teach the \r<br>\nhigher grades doesn't mean you have to go to that \r<br>\nschool.  We can hire tutors.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"But ... I want friends!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYour mother puts down her knife and walks up to \r<br>\nyou.  \"Mark, you don't need to go to that school \r<br>\nto find friends.  We can look elsewhere.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"But what's wrong with finding them there?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Mark, please, I ... I just don't want you going \r<br>\nto that school!\"  (You can tell that she's hiding \r<br>\nsomething from you; but what?)\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Why not?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I don't want an argument, Mark.  That's it!\"  She \r<br>\nturns back to her work.  You sit there in silence \r<br>\nfor a minute or two.  Then you hit her with: \"You \r<br>\ntold me I could go if I wanted to go.  You told me \r<br>\nyou wouldn't interfere.  You PROMISED.\"  Your Mom \r<br>\nhas this crusade that everybody (you and Julie in \r<br>\nparticular) ought to keep their promises.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nEven with her back to you, you can see her wince \r<br>\nin reaction.  She turns around to you; she looks \r<br>\ndefeated.  \"Oh Mark, I ...\"  Her look now becomes \r<br>\none of resignation.  \"Alright Mark.  But you have \r<br>\nto promise me something.  You have to promise me \r<br>\nthat the moment it gets too hard for you at that \r<br>\nschool, the moment it gets too ... unpleasant; as \r<br>\nsoon as you want out, you'll tell me.  Promise?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou promise.  But gee, you wonder, what's this all \r<br>\nabout.  Why does she speak as if all this negative \r<br>\nstuff is going to happen?

Every chance you get you ask Julie \r<br>\nwhat happened at school while you were away; every \r<br>\ntime she evades your question.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nNo one visits you on Friday.  Then on Saturday at \r<br>\nnoon, the doorbell rings.  Julie runs up to tell \r<br>\nyou that Mrs. Andrews is here.  You hurriedly get \r<br>\nyourself ready.  But she doesn't come up for five, \r<br>\nten minutes.  You hear her and your mother talking \r<br>\ndownstairs in low voices the whole time.  But what \r<br>\nabout?  You climb down to the floor and creep over \r<br>\nto the top step to listen.  Your mother's keen eye \r<br>\nnotices you there and stops the conversation.  She \r<br>\nwalks up the steps and carries you into the living \r<br>\nroom.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIn the course of a few hours, your mother and Mrs. \r<br>\nAndrews return now and then to speaking about the \r<br>\nstruggles of widowhood.  In one extremely poignant \r<br>\nmoment, Mrs. Andrews speaks about miscarrying her \r<br>\nand her husband's child -- their only child -- at \r<br>\neleven weeks, three weeks after Neil's death.  As \r<br>\nshe speaks, a change comes over you.  You begin to \r<br>\nfeel in her presence not merely aroused, but warm; \r<br>\nshe is becoming not just an object of your desire, \r<br>\nbut also someone you care about.  As she tearfully \r<br>\ntells of her miscarriage, you wish you were closer \r<br>\nto your mother's size, so you also could hold Mrs. \r<br>\nAndrew's hand, rest her head on your shoulder and \r<br>\nstroke her hair, embrace her.  Later that day, you \r<br>\nlook up on the computer everything you can about a \r<br>\nfetus at eleven weeks.  You discover that a child \r<br>\nat that stage is about two inches long.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMonday morning dawns; reluctantly your mother gets \r<br>\nyou ready for school.  As her car is pulling up in \r<br>\nthe school parking lot, Julie grabs you and stuffs \r<br>\nyou deep into her backpack.  You hear the corridor \r<br>\nfull of voices, but you can't see anyone -- and no \r<br>\none can see you.  Julie hand delivers you to your \r<br>\nfirst class.  As the class ends, Julie arrives for \r<br>\nyou.  Again she stuffs you into her backpack, too \r<br>\ndeep for anyone to see you, and hand delivers you \r<br>\nto your next class.  You figure that she's trying \r<br>\nto hide you from people, which really annoys you.  \r<br>\nSo near the end of the class, seconds before Julie \r<br>\narrives, you get the teacher's permission to leave \r<br>\nearly.  Now you have the chance to walk along the \r<br>\ncorridor and see people.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nPeople are acting strange toward you.  Before they \r<br>\nseemed fascinated by you.  Now they seem to look \r<br>\ndown at you with contempt.  You see Elissa and her \r<br>\ntwo friends walking toward you.  She seems to have \r<br>\nnoticed your waving at her, yet she walks right by \r<br>\nyou.  One of her friends even appears to sneer at \r<br>\nyou.  As she walks by, her sandal suddenly swings \r<br>\nout to the side, knocking you up against the wall.  \r<br>\nYou decide to stay close to the wall the remainder \r<br>\nof the way.  It is then that you notice all of the \r<br>\ngraffiti written on the walls, low enough for only \r<br>\nyou to see.  They are obviously referring to you.  \r<br>\n\"Punt the Runt\" is one of the few you would dare \r<br>\nto repeat, the rest are so vile.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou are practically in tears, when from behind you \r<br>\na hand grabs you and scoops you up; thank goodness \r<br>\nit's Julie.  She scoots into an empty classroom.  \r<br>\nAt first she acts miffed at you for avoiding her, \r<br>\nuntil she sees how upset you are.  \"Well I suppose \r<br>\nyou had to find out some time,\" she sighs.  Craig \r<br>\nBradley and his two buddies were expelled Friday, \r<br>\nall on account of you.  They were all star players \r<br>\non the school football team, especially Craig; he \r<br>\nhas already received offers from the top football \r<br>\nuniversities in the nation.  The school team had \r<br>\nbeen expected to win the state championship this \r<br>\nyear, but not now -- they'll be lucky now if they \r<br>\nwin a single game.  And everyone's blaming you.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBut, you argue, you didn't say anything to anyone.  \r<br>\n\"They don't know that, and they don't care,\" she \r<br>\nreplies.  You accuse Julie of saying something; \r<br>\nshe denies it.  Then you accuse Elissa.  \"Elissa!  \r<br>\nShe hates you now more than anyone,\" Julie says.  \r<br>\nWho then?  Who could have ratted on Craig?  None \r<br>\nof the students would have dared.  So who is left? \r<br>\n\r<br>\nMrs. Andrews.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

But you don\u2019t feel like saying.  Julie takes \r<br>\nyour schedule out of her pocket.  \u201cOh. It\u2019s Mrs. \r<br>\nAndrews,\u201d she smiles,  \u201cYour friend.\u201d  Your sister \r<br>\nthen stuffs you in her backpack and heads for Mrs. \r<br>\nAndrews\u2019 room.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nOn the way to class, you begin thinking that maybe \r<br>\nyour mother was right.  Maybe going to high school \r<br>\nis too much for you.  And if it is, you\u2019ll have to \r<br>\nkeep your promise to her and finish your schooling \r<br>\nat home.  And the way you feel right now, you\u2019re \r<br>\nfiguring maybe that\u2019s not such a bad idea.  You \r<br>\nonly wish that Mrs. Andrews would disappear from \r<br>\nyour life with the rest of the school.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJulie gets you to Mrs. Andrews\u2019 class just as it\u2019s \r<br>\nabout to begin.  She places you on the table where \r<br>\nyour desk is set and, before she leaves, asks Mrs. \r<br>\nAndrews if she could get you to class next period.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAll during class you keep your nose to your notes, \r<br>\npurposely avoiding eye contact with Mrs. Andrews.  \r<br>\nAs class ends and the other students file out, you \r<br>\nslide down the rope provided for you and start to \r<br>\nleave the room.  Mrs. Andrews, who has been check- \r<br>\ning over a few papers, looks up to find you now no \r<br>\nlonger in front of her.  She turns and notices you \r<br>\nwalking out the door.  \u201cHold on there, Mark.  I\u2019ll \r<br>\ncarry you to class.\u201d  You pretend you didn\u2019t hear \r<br>\nher and keep walking.  \u201cI said, hold on.\u201d  You \r<br>\nkeep walking.  \u201cMark -- stop!  Now!\u201d  The force of \r<br>\nher voice stops you.  \u201cTurn around,\u201d she says, in \r<br>\na gentler tone.  \u201cMark -- please do as I say.\u201d  \r<br>\nAgain, you do so in spite of yourself.  \u201cCome over \r<br>\nhere.\u201d  It\u2019s become pointless to disobey.  She \r<br>\nbends down to pick you up.  \u201cWhy, you\u2019re as stiff \r<br>\nas a board,\u201d she says.  She sets you on her desk, \r<br>\nand holds your shoulders with her thumb and fore- \r<br>\nfinger.  You keep your eyes cast down.  She bends \r<br>\nher head down in an attempt to look you in the \r<br>\neye.  \u201cMy, but we\u2019re sullen today.  What\u2019s the \r<br>\nproblem? Is it the new seating arrangements?  Need \r<br>\nanother floor show?\u201d  You turn your head away from \r<br>\nher.  \u201cMy,\u201d she says. \u201cbut this is serious.  I\u2019d \r<br>\nbetter keep my shoes on.\u201d  You wrest yourself free \r<br>\nof her and turn your back to her.  \u201cAlright,\u201d she \r<br>\nsays in an abrupt change of tone, \u201cLet's cut the \r<br>\nkidding.  What\u2019s wrong?  You haven\u2019t looked at me \r<br>\nall day.  What\u2019s the problem?  Have I embarrassed \r<br>\nyou somehow?  All this teasing, maybe?  Or, my \r<br>\nvisits to your home?  Or ... my bathing you in the \r<br>\nsink?\u201d  You keep your back to her, unresponsive.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJust then, Mr. Ripley, passing by the room, pops \r<br>\nhis head in to say, \u201cOh, Mrs. Andrews; I\u2019ll still \r<br>\nneed a sworn statement from you.  A technicality, \r<br>\nof course, but .. well, I\u2019ll meet with you later.\u201d  \r<br>\nHe slips away.  Mrs. Andrews, from looking at him, \r<br>\nlooks back down at you.  She discovers you facing \r<br>\nwhere Mr. Ripley just stood, clenching your fists, \r<br>\ngritting your teeth, breathing heavily. \u201cSo that\u2019s \r<br>\nit.\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m a squealer.  I ratted on your \r<br>\nfriends.\u201d  Again you turn your back on her. \u201cMark, \r<br>\nlook at me.  Mark ... don\u2019t be this way.  I don\u2019t \r<br>\nwant to use force.  Come on now.\u201d You don\u2019t budge.  \r<br>\nShe heaves a sigh, and the next thing you know her \r<br>\nhand is descending on you.  With her thumb and \r<br>\nforefinger she picks you up and twists you around.  \r<br>\nShe holds you firmly, while her thumb under your \r<br>\nchin jerks your head up.  You\u2019re now her captive, \r<br>\nforced to look her in the face.  In spite of \r<br>\neverything, it\u2019s still a beautiful face.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cMark,\u201d she explains, \u201cI had to do what I did.  If \r<br>\nyou weren\u2019t going to tell, I had to.  Maybe it\u2019s \r<br>\nokay for you to play the hero.  But for me to keep \r<br>\nquiet about what Craig did to you would not be \r<br>\nheroic.  It would be irresponsible, cowardly -- \r<br>\npractically an act of collusion.  What sort of a \r<br>\nteacher would I be -- what sort of a friend -- if \r<br>\nI let Craig get away with what he did to you?  \r<br>\nMark,\u201d  she adds softly, \u201cI\u2019m your friend.  Right \r<br>\nnow, you\u2019re blaming me for turning the school \r<br>\nagainst you.  I can understand that.  But believe \r<br>\nme, all that will pass.  Still, no matter what \r<br>\nanybody else thinks of you, I\u2019m your friend.  I\u2019ll \r<br>\nalways be your friend.  Always.\u201d  You manage to \r<br>\nforce your head from her thumb, and turn your face \r<br>\naway again.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAt that, she lets go of her grip.  \u201cAlright, then.  \r<br>\nI\u2019m sorry I said anything.  I\u2019m sorry I got poor \r<br>\nCraig Bradley expelled. If it weren\u2019t for me, he\u2019d \r<br>\nstill be roaming the school halls.  And maybe the \r<br>\nnext time he\u2019d kill you.  Then you\u2019d really be a \r<br>\nhero.  You\u2019d be in all the papers; you\u2019d be on \r<br>\ntelevision.  They\u2019d have all sorts of services for \r<br>\nyou, dedications, plaques, scholarships, all in \r<br>\nyour name.  They\u2019d remember you as the boy who \r<br>\nbraved death in order to get a good public school \r<br>\neducation.  And no one would say anything about \r<br>\nhow ... foolhardy you were. Even I\u2019d keep my mouth \r<br>\nshut.  I\u2019d play dumb for you like I did ...\u201d Her \r<br>\nvoice cracks. \u201cOh God, I\u2019ve had enough of heroes!\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHer last words stab you in the gut.  Your feelings \r<br>\nof anger yield to feelings of shame.  You still \r<br>\nkeep your back to her, only now so she can\u2019t see \r<br>\nyour tears.  But she knows.  \u201cTurn around, Mark,\u201d \r<br>\nshe whispers.  You do so, but keep your head down.  \r<br>\nShe lifts up your chin gently with her finger.  \r<br>\nGrabbing Kleenex from its box, she twists a corner \r<br>\nof it into a point and daubs your cheeks.  \u201cI \r<br>\ndidn\u2019t mean what I said.  I still want you for my \r<br>\nhero.\u201d  She blushes a little.  \u201cI mean, I want you \r<br>\nto be everybody\u2019s hero; mine, your family\u2019s, the \r<br>\nschool\u2019s.  And you still can be.  You can be now \r<br>\nmore than ever.  You\u2019ve come to a school where \r<br>\neveryone suddenly wants to hate you.  It\u2019s unfair \r<br>\nwhat they think about you.  Unjust.  But you\u2019ve \r<br>\ncome here, anyway.  I know your mother wants you \r<br>\nto give this school up, and maybe you should.  But \r<br>\nif you stay and brave this out, I\u2019m here for you.  \r<br>\nEvery minute of the day, I\u2019m here for you.\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe leans toward you.  \u201cAre you still mad at me?\u201d  \r<br>\nYou look up at her tearfully, and shake your head \r<br>\nno.  \u201cThen can you smile for me?\u201d  You do your \r<br>\nbest to smile.  She returns the smile, almost as \r<br>\nteary-eyed as you.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAt once she brushes her tears away, and sits \r<br>\nupright.  \u201cOh dear, I\u2019ve got to get you to your \r<br>\nnext class.\u201d  She looks at you teasingly.  \u201cOr \r<br>\nmaybe I should ask if you want me to take you.  \r<br>\nMaybe you\u2019d rather somebody else?\u201d  Before you \r<br>\nhave a chance to answer, a voice at the door calls \r<br>\nout, \u201cI\u2019ll take him fo</span></div></div>",

You see standing there \r<br>\na boy of African descent, lanky, well-built, with \r<br>\na good-looking and pleasing face, but an awkward \r<br>\nmanner about him.  He has a funny accent, like a \r<br>\nforeigner.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Why, Pierre,\" Mrs Andrews exclaims, \"You startled \r<br>\nus.  Were you listening in on our entire conversa- \r<br>\ntion?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh no Ma'am, Mrs. Andrews,\" he says, nervously, \r<br>\n\"I only just got here.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"That's okay, Pierre.  So -- are you sure you can \r<br>\ntake Mark to his next class?  It isn't out of the \r<br>\nway for you?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Um ... no, it ... doesn't have to be.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"All right.

Pierre does the same, though he's a \r<br>\nlittle rough; he almost wrenches your arm out of \r<br>\nits socket.  He apologizes.  \"It's okay, Pierre,\" \r<br>\nMrs. Andrews assures him, \"For a first try.\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou, however, aren't quite so sure you want to be \r<br>\nhandled by a boy so clumsy.  And you are frankly a \r<br>\nlittle suspicious of him.  He doesn't seem to have  \r<br>\na malicious intent; in fact, the word \"malicious\" \r<br>\ndefinitely does not describe him.  Yet why would a \r<br>\nboy who doesn't even know you be so interested in \r<br>\nhelping you out, when all the rest of the students \r<br>\nhate you?\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter a painfully long pause, Mrs. Andrews says, \r<br>\n\"Well, Pierre, it's so nice of you to want help \r<br>\nout a fellow student in need.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yes, Ma'am, it is ... I mean, yes Ma'am.  Only, \r<br>\num ... Mrs.  Andrews?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yes, Pierre?\"  She eyes him quizzically.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Um ... well ... could you please ... keep this to \r<br>\nyourself?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You mean, You don't want me to tell anyone that \r<br>\nyou're helping Mark, or in any way befriending a \r<br>\nhelpless two inch tall boy?\"  He hangs his head in \r<br>\nshame.  She sighs.  \"Very well, Pierre.  Thank you \r<br>\nfor offering your services under such trying cir- \r<br>\ncumstances. Only I think that Mark himself has the \r<br>\nright to decide whether to accept the offer as you \r<br>\npresented it.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe now looks down at you.  \"Well, Mark, are you \r<br>\nwilling to take up Pierre on his ... generous \r<br>\noffer?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Brushing her \r<br>\nhair to one side, she exposes her ear, then leans \r<br>\ndown near enough for you to whisper in it. (Wow, \r<br>\nyou think, even her ear is beautiful).  You want \r<br>\nso much to keep Pierre from hearing you that you \r<br>\npractically crawl into the ear.  \"Please take me,\" \r<br>\nyou plead.  Mrs. Andrews sits upright again, and \r<br>\naddresses Pierre: \"Mark isn't quite ready yet for \r<br>\nyou to handle him.  I'm sure once he's gotten to \r<br>\nknow you better, he'll gladly accept your offer.  \r<br>\nBut for now, know that the offer is appreciated.  \r<br>\nYou have at least shown Mark private support, and \r<br>\nthat is a whole lot more than other students in \r<br>\nthis school have done.\"  He makes no reply, but \r<br>\ncontinues to stand there hanging his head.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMrs. Andrews regards him sympathetically for a \r<br>\nmoment longer; then she turns to you.  With one \r<br>\nhand she scoops you up, while with the other she \r<br>\npushes herself away from the desk and rises.  She \r<br>\nbrushes swiftly by his motionless figure, but once \r<br>\nshe reaches the door she turns back around to him.  \r<br>\n\"Pierre -- thank you,\" she says, and hurries off.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nToward the end of Dr. Gompers' class, your sister \r<br>\narrives in the doorway to pick you up.  When the \r<br>\nbell rings and the class begins to file out, she \r<br>\nnotices Elissa nudge the table on which you are \r<br>\nseated, causing some liquid in a beaker to slosh \r<br>\nout dangerously close to your desk.  Julie steps \r<br>\nin Elissa's way.  Elissa shoves her aside and \r<br>\nwalks out.  You don't mind Elissa's abusing you.  \r<br>\nBut when you see her do this to your sister -- oh, \r<br>\nhow you wish you were taller.  As you think this, \r<br>\nyou catch sight of Pierre, watching from afar in \r<br>\nthe corridor.  From where he's standing, he must \r<br>\nhave witnessed the whole scene.  But he just \r<br>\nstands there, gaping.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJulie again hides you in her backpack.  You hear \r<br>\nthe sounds of the corridor, then the clattering \r<br>\nand tinkling sounds of the cafeteria.  You hear \r<br>\nJulie talking to the ladies at the food counter.  \r<br>\nA few moments later she is fishing for you in her \r<br>\nbackpack.  She lifts you out, and you discover \r<br>\nthat she has chosen a table for you and her in a \r<br>\nremote corner of the room.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs you and she eat from her plate, you look over \r<br>\nand see a group of boys at a table.  Pierre is \r<br>\namong them, but only barely paying attention to \r<br>\ntheir conversation, staring into nowhere.  Not \r<br>\nwatching what he\u2019d doing, he grabs for a sandwich \r<br>\nand knocks over a carton of milk.  The boys begin \r<br>\nto laugh uproariously, ridiculing him and thwart- \r<br>\ning his attempts to clean up the mess, then all \r<br>\ngetting up and leaving him there to finish the \r<br>\nclean-up alone.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter lunch period, Julie carries you to Mrs. \r<br>\nBeasley\u2019s class.  At the end of class she comes to \r<br>\npick you up, but Mrs. Beasley wants to speak to \r<br>\nyou about the class you\u2019ve missed.  Julie explains \r<br>\nthat she\u2019s in a hurry, but Mrs. Beasley insists.  \r<br>\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there anyone else,\u201d she complains, \u201cwho can \r<br>\ntake your brother to class?\u201d  Since there isn\u2019t, \r<br>\nJulie stays and waits for Mrs. Beasley to complete \r<br>\nher overblown summary of last Friday\u2019s material.  \r<br>\nJulie then grabs you and runs you to Mr. Lorenzo\u2019s \r<br>\nclass (already well in progress), then runs off to \r<br>\nher own class.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter Mr. Lorenzo\u2019s class you wait for Julie.  \r<br>\nShe\u2019s late, but after what happened last week, \r<br>\nLorenzo doesn\u2019t allow you to leave, and in fact \r<br>\nstays with you despite his own eagerness to get \r<br>\nhome.  When Julie finally shows up, he expresses \r<br>\nhis annoyance, and rushes out of the room.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJulie slumps into a chair, on the verge of tears.  \r<br>\nSince she was late to her last class, her teacher \r<br>\nheld her fifteen minutes after everyone else left \r<br>\nand gave her an extra written assignment.  \u201cI \r<br>\ndon\u2019t know how I can keep this up,\u201d she cries.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s good to hear Julie laugh.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cYikes,\u201d Julie exclaims, jumping up, \u201cWe've gotta \r<br>\nmove it.

She hops into \r<br>\nthe front seat and sets you upon her lap while she \r<br>\nfastens her seat belt.  It\u2019s then you notice your \r<br>\nmother; her body slumped forward, her head resting \r<br>\nhard on the top of the steering wheel, her fists \r<br>\nclenching its sides, her eyes shut tight.  Either \r<br>\nshe\u2019s dead, you think to yourself, or she\u2019s upset.  \r<br>\nAnd you don\u2019t think she\u2019s dead.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cWhere -- have -- you -- two -- been?\u201d  She gasps \r<br>\nin a breath between each word.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou try to explain why you were late.

She lifts her head \r<br>\nup off the wheel and all the way back against her \r<br>\nseat\u2019s headrest, and remains there until she\u2019s \r<br>\ncomposed enough to switch the car into gear and \r<br>\ndrive on home.  It\u2019s a tense ride.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe atmosphere is sober the rest of the evening, \r<br>\neven after your mother has returned to calm.  You \r<br>\nand Julie hardly talk.  You both do your household \r<br>\nchores (you pick up any crumbs or lint which the \r<br>\nvacuum has missed), do homework before and after \r<br>\nsupper, wash up and dress for bed.  Then you join \r<br>\nJulie in the living room and she sits you on her \r<br>\nlap in front of the TV.  Julie\u2019s hiked-up shirt \r<br>\nexposes her abdomen; you rest your head in her \r<br>\nbelly button.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nUninterested in the program she chose, you squirm \r<br>\naround until your head and feet have switched \r<br>\npositions.  Now you\u2019re looking up at Julie, as \r<br>\nyour bare feet idly play inside her navel.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cHey!\u201d you shout up at her.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she replies, more interested in the TV \r<br>\nthan in you.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cDo you know a guy in school named Pierre?\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cNo.  Who\u2019s he?\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cThe guy who spilled his milk at lunch today.\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cYou mean the guy sitting with the football team?\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cWas that the football team?\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cPart of it, yeah.  Why, who is he?\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cI thought you knew.\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cHe\u2019s a new kid in town, that\u2019s all I know.\u201d  \r<br>\nJulie finally looks down at you.  \u201cWhy do you \r<br>\ncare?\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cWell, maybe he can carry me to class.\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou dig your feet a little too far into her navel.  \r<br>\nAnnoyed, she swats them away and pulls down her \r<br>\nshirt.  \u201cWhy should he carry you to class?\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cBecause he asked.  After Mrs. Andrews\u2019 class \r<br>\ntoday he came in the room and asked if he could \r<br>\ntake me to my next class.\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know him?\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cI never even saw him before.\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cYeah, I thought so.  Mrs. Andrews seemed to think \r<br>\nhe was okay, though -- even though he asked her \r<br>\nnot to tell anybody.\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cNot to tell anybody that he wants to be nice to \r<br>\nyou?\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cWhat a jerk!\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cYeah, well Mrs. Andrews said at least it\u2019s more \r<br>\nthan anyone else has done.\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cSo what?  The whole thing is too weird.  And the \r<br>\nguy hangs out with the football team?\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cThen stay away from him.  They all hate you.\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cYeah, well ... too bad for them.\u201d  Now your feet \r<br>\nare playing with the bottom button of her shirt, \r<br>\ntwisting it back and forth as if they\u2019re steering \r<br>\na ship.  She picks you up and tosses you further \r<br>\ndown her lap.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cWill you keep your feet away from my buttons?\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cWhy should I?\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cBecause -- I\u2019ve now got like five shirts with \r<br>\ntheir bottom buttons missing.\u201d  You sneer at her, \r<br>\nand roll over to watch whatever dumb show she has \r<br>\non TV, staying in that position until your mother \r<br>\ncomes along and sends you both to bed.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe following day ...\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Then you hear someone speaking Spanish, \r<br>\nand you realize that she's brought you into Senora \r<br>\nMendoza's Spanish class.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMeanwhile (as you later find out) Pierre, who has \r<br>\ntrailed this girl to her class, then runs back to \r<br>\nMrs. Andrews in a panic.  She finally gets out of \r<br>\nhim that you were swiped up by Stacie Wilson, who \r<br>\nstashed you into her purse and is now holding you \r<br>\nin Sra Mendoza's classroom.  Mrs. Andrews runs to \r<br>\nthe class and calls out Sra Mendoza, who a moment \r<br>\nlater asks Stacie Wilson to bring her things with \r<br>\nher and go with Mrs. Andrews.  You hear Stacie as \r<br>\nshe gathers up her things, and feel her fling her \r<br>\npurse (with you in it) around her shoulder.  You \r<br>\nhear the brisk clicking of high heeled shoes and \r<br>\nthe scuffing of sandals in what sounds like a now \r<br>\nempty corridor.  The next thing you hear is Mrs. \r<br>\nAndrews' stern voice:\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Alright -- take him out of your bag.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I ... I don't know what you mean.\"  Stacie sounds \r<br>\nscared.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Take Mark out of your bag.  Now.\"  Light enters \r<br>\ninto her purse, Stacie's tremulous hand lifts you \r<br>\nout, and you see that you are now in Mrs. Andrews' \r<br>\nroom again, facing Mrs. Andrews' stern face.  You \r<br>\nthen look up at Stacie's face.  She's crying.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMrs Andrews proceeds with the interrogation: \"What \r<br>\nwere you doing with him in your bag?  What were \r<br>\nyou planning to do with him?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBetween sobs, Stacie manages to answer, \"I ... I \r<br>\n... don't ... know.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Do you realize how serious this is, and how much \r<br>\ntrouble you can get in for it?\"  Stacie hangs her \r<br>\nhead and nods, still sobbing heavily.  \"In fact,\"  \r<br>\nMrs. Andrews continues, \"right now, your entire \r<br>\nfuture depends on one person.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nStacie raises her head, with a look of terror on \r<br>\nher face.  Mrs. Andrews now addresses you.  \"Mark, \r<br>\ndid you allow Stacie to put you in her purse like \r<br>\nthat?\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh great,\" you think to yourself, \"Am I the one \r<br>\nnow who has to get this stupid girl in trouble?\"  \r<br>\nYou hate these moments (unless, of course, it's a \r<br>\nmatter of getting your mother angry with Julie).\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Did you allow her to put you in her purse?\"  Mrs. \r<br>\nAndrews repeats.  You nod.  \"You did?\"  Again you \r<br>\nnod.  \"You mean you purposely skipped Dr. Gompers' \r<br>\nclass, so you could travel in Stacie's purse?\"  Oh \r<br>\nno!  Is your lying for this dummy now going to get \r<br>\nyou in trouble? Oh, well, you think, it's too late \r<br>\nto back out now.  You nod again.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nStacie stares at you, gaping.  \"Now hand him over \r<br>\nto me,\" Mrs. Andrews says.  Stacie does so.  Mrs. \r<br>\nAndrews strokes your head as she addresses Stacie, \r<br>\n\"You're a lucky young lady -- lucky that you chose \r<br>\nto abuse a boy who hates ratting on people.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nStacie's expression changes to one of puzzlement.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"That's right,\" continues Mrs. Andrews, \"Now there \r<br>\nis at least one student in this school who knows.  \r<br>\nMark Letellier hates ratting on people.  You hate \r<br>\nhim, the whole student body hates him, for ratting \r<br>\non the star football player, who by the way almost \r<br>\nkilled him.  But Mark didn't rat on Craig and the \r<br>\nothers.  He should have, but he refused to. And as \r<br>\nit turned out, he didn't have to.  You know, there \r<br>\nwas one other witness to what happened that day.\"  \r<br>\nMrs Andrews brings you up to her face.  \"Mark -- \r<br>\nwhy don't you tell Stacie who that person is, the \r<br>\nperson who really told on Craig and his buddies?\"  \r<br>\nHorrified, you shake your head with an adamant no.  \r<br>\n\"All right then, I'll do the ratting.  I'll rat on \r<br>\nmyself.  I was the one who talked, not Mark; I was \r<br>\nthe one got Craig and the others expelled.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nStacie stands there in shock.  Mrs. Andrews hands \r<br>\nyou back to her.  \"Here,\" she says.  \"Now tell him \r<br>\nyou're sorry.  Tell him you're sorry for being so \r<br>\ncruel to him.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nStacie begins sobbing again, hardly able to talk.  \r<br>\n\"I ... 'mmm ... sorry, ... I'm ... ssso ... sorry, \r<br>\nI ...\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"That's enough for now,\"  Mrs. Andrews says, \"Now \r<br>\nhand him back to me.\"  You return to Mrs. Andrews' \r<br>\nsoft, comforting hands.  \"And never forget what he \r<br>\ndid for you here today,\" she adds.  \"After all you \r<br>\ndid to him, he lied for you, even took the rap for \r<br>\nyou, to save your skin.  Because believe me, if he \r<br>\nhad told me what you really did, I wouldn't have \r<br>\nhesitated to get you in trouble.  Now get back to \r<br>\nyour class.\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nStacie, still heaving heavy sobs, gathers up her \r<br>\nthings and dashes out of the room.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

That's the rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some dumb reason, you accept this line of <br>\r\nargument without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well ... then why don't you be the Teenie- <br>\r\nGenie-Weenie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops her search and looks at you in the <br>\r\nmirror. \"I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuz, Stupid,\" she says, scrunching up her face at <br>\r\nyou.  \"I'm not teenie-weenie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention switches back to the sewing kit.  <br>\r\nYou start to whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a baby.\" She says, preoccupied.  <br>\r\n\"It's not like it\u2019s going to hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt better not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, like eating off somebody\u2019s foot could hurt.  <br>\r\nAh!\u201d  She uncovers a final prop for her act.  <br>\r\n\u201cBesides,\u201d she adds, as she closes up the sewing <br>\r\nkit, \u201cI never hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d  She looks in the mirror, and notices the <br>\r\nbuckle of her bra strap digging into your back.  <br>\r\n\u201cOoh!\u201d  She lifts the strap and pulls you out, <br>\r\nthen rubs your reddened back and kisses it.  She <br>\r\npresses you against her cheek.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry.  I <br>\r\ndidn\u2019t mean it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere sweetness at moments like this makes it all <br>\r\nthe harder to defy her crazy schemes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds you up to her face.  \u201cYou okay?\u201d  You <br>\r\nnod.  \u201cGood.

Julie then <br>\r\nlowers her face to the table and whispers her plan <br>\r\nto you.  She then sets you down on the ground.  As <br>\r\nshe prepares materials for her act from the couch, <br>\r\nshe has you prepare things on the floor. As usual, <br>\r\nthe idea is not only screwy, but elaborate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacie starts to fidget. \"Can I open my eyes yet?\" <br>\r\nshe asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait till I say so.\" Julie replies, intent on <br>\r\nher preparations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she announces: \"Okay, Stacie, open up your <br>\r\neyes and look down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacie does so, and finds you, the Teenie-Genie- <br>\r\nWeenie, standing before her left foot. From behind <br>\r\nyou, you whip out a rectangular piece of tissue, <br>\r\npin-pricked to resemble a lace table cloth, which <br>\r\nyou spread out length-wise across her big toe. You <br>\r\nnext step in between this toe and its neighboring <br>\r\ntoe, and nestle down into a lotus position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clap your hands. \u201cFood!\u201d you cry out.  As you <br>\r\nrest your elbows on Stacie\u2019s second toe, Julie\u2019s <br>\r\nright hand descends toward you. She has turned her <br>\r\nentire hand into a puppet, which she introduces as <br>\r\nyour slave.  The top part of her index finger has <br>\r\na bearded face drawn on it, its tip is wrapped up <br>\r\nin a turban, while the rest of the hand is covered <br>\r\nin a cloth as if in a robe.  Her thumb and middle <br>\r\nfinger, now functioning as a pair of arms, carry a <br>\r\nbig white button, whose concave side holds a lump <br>\r\nof pizza. Her finger bows profoundly to you,  sets <br>\r\nthe button down upon Stacie\u2019s big toe, again bows <br>\r\nprofoundly, and withdraws. You reach forward, rip <br>\r\noff a portion of pizza, and sample it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clap your hands again.  \u201cDrink!\u201d you cry out, <br>\r\nas you rest your elbows on her second toe.  Again <br>\r\nyour puppet-slave descends, bows profoundly to you <br>\r\nand sets before you on Stacie\u2019s big toe a thimble- <br>\r\nful of Coke, bows profoundly again and withdraws.  <br>\r\nYou lean forward and with effort lift the thimble <br>\r\nto your lips, taking a sip and carefully setting <br>\r\nit back down on the toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clap your hands a third time, and as you rest <br>\r\nyour elbows on her second toe, cry out: \u201cBring on <br>\r\nthe dancing girls!\u201d Now Julie shoves her feet up <br>\r\nto your face.  On each of her ten toes she had you <br>\r\ndraw a female face, which you then veiled in gauze <br>\r\nso that only the eyes are showing. She wiggles her  <br>\r\ntoes seductively at you, while she hums in a reedy <br>\r\nvoice an appropriately exotic tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this you can no longer hold back, and burst out  <br>\r\nlaughing. So does Julie. So does Stacie.  But when <br>\r\nStacie does she forgets herself, and moves her own <br>\r\ntoes, which upsets your table. The thimble of Coke <br>\r\nfalls over and splashes out.  You jump up onto her <br>\r\nother toes to avoid getting wet.  The Coke totally <br>\r\ndrenches her big toe, and the tissue on top of it.  <br>\r\nYou scoot forward off her toes to survey the mess.  <br>\r\nYou try to use the tissue to soak up the Coke, but <br>\r\nit falls apart, and some bits of it even bunch up <br>\r\nand tangle into the hairs on her toe's knuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a yucky end to a very funny first wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You slip behind the lamp, as <br>\r\none by one she hands around to you each new piece <br>\r\nof your costume.  After a few minutes, she puts <br>\r\nthe last of her tools aside and turns to Stacie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, the further adventures of your favorite <br>\r\ncartoon hero: Captain Spongepants!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's your cue. You leap out from behind the lamp <br>\r\nand strike a pose, hands on hips, a mask over your <br>\r\neyes, cape about the shoulders, and a sponge where <br>\r\nyour pants ought to be. (Julie cut out a roundish <br>\r\npiece from an old scouring sponge, gouged a hole <br>\r\nin its center, and made you squeeze into it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacie screws up her face.  \u201cCaptain Spongepants?  <br>\r\nWho\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\" Julie says, \"I just made him up.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Julie plugs in a hair dryer, turns it on its <br>\r\nlow setting, and hands it over to Stacie.  \"Here,\" <br>\r\nshe says, \"point this toward me.\"  She then picks <br>\r\nyou up and holds you by your sides in front of the <br>\r\nblast of wind.  You stretch yourself out, Superman <br>\r\nstyle, as your cape flaps in the breeze.  Julie <br>\r\ndips you up and down, left and right, to simulate <br>\r\nthe turbulence of flight.  Your masked eyes scan <br>\r\nthe world below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it that Captain Spongepants sees?  Oh no!  <br>\r\nHis archenemy, the evil Coke Fiend, has claimed a <br>\r\nnew victim!\"  Julie yanks out the plug of the hair <br>\r\ndryer with one hand, and with the other lowers you <br>\r\nfeet first, setting you down at Stacie's big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can Captain Spongepants save her in time?\" asks <br>\r\nannouncer Julie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whip off your cape.  \"Soap!\"  you cry out.  \"I <br>\r\nmust find soap!\"  As you look about, Julie grabs a <br>\r\nglass of soapy water off the table. She picks you <br>\r\nup, making it look as if you leap up onto the tall <br>\r\nglass in a single bound, then dunks you into it up <br>\r\nto your waist, until the sponge is saturated.  She <br>\r\nnow makes it look like you jump back down onto the <br>\r\nfloor; then she lets go of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hop onto Stacie's big toe and straddle it. You <br>\r\nproceed to clean it off with your spongy backside, <br>\r\nas Julie bops out a rhumba beat: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbumbum-bumbum bum BUM! <br>\r\nbumbum-bumbum bum BUM! <br>\r\nbumbum-bumbum bum BUM! <br>\r\nbumbum-bumbum bum BUM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour rear end jerks backward and forward in sync <br>\r\nwith the beat:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nupdown-updown up DOWN! <br>\r\nupdown-updown up DOWN! <br>\r\nupdown-updown up DOWN! <br>\r\nupdown-updown up DOWN!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou inch your way up Stacie\u2019s toe.  As soon as you <br>\r\nhave cleaned the top of her toe, you dismount and <br>\r\nbegin with your butt to clean the toe\u2019s sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nupdown-updown left RIGHT!<br>\r\nupdown-updown left RIGHT!<br>\r\nupdown-updown left RIGHT!<br>\r\nupdown-updown left RIGHT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you move your rear up and down against Stacie's <br>\r\ntoe, you grasp tightly to the sponge, making sure <br>\r\nit keeps its place in front.  But you fail to see <br>\r\nhow it's holding up in the rear.  Julie, however, <br>\r\nnotices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook-at-Mark-ie's bum BUM!<br>\r\nLook-at-Mark-ie's bum BUM!<br>\r\nLook-at-Mark-ie's bum BUM!<br>\r\nLook-at-Mark-ie's bum BUM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacie notices too.  She can't contain herself any <br>\r\nlonger.  She picks you up and, with the tip of her <br>\r\nnail, pushes the sponge further down, just enough <br>\r\nto expose the rest of your buttocks in their full <br>\r\nglory.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeeeee!\" she squeals, \"How totally CUTE!\"  Her <br>\r\nfinger pats your cheeks, caresses your cheeks; her <br>\r\nthumb and finger squeeze and nip your cheeks. Then <br>\r\nher eye catches your other set of cheeks, the ones <br>\r\nattached to your face.  They're beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"  Stacie cries.  \"Oh, I'm so sorry.  I wasn't <br>\r\nthinking.\" She taps the sponge back up, and holds <br>\r\nyou up to her face. \u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d she asks.  <br>\r\nYou shake your head no, but with eyes cast down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor little guy\" she says, as she nestles <br>\r\nyou up against her cheek. Then she turns to Julie.  <br>\r\n\"Let's stop this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we can\u2019t\" Julie says, \"he\u2019s still gotta rinse <br>\r\noff the soap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Well then, I\u2019ll help him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie now produces a cup of soapless water. Stacie <br>\r\ndips you up to the waist in the water and sets you <br>\r\non top of her toe.  Holding you firmly she glides <br>\r\nyou gently up and down, back and forth, rinsing <br>\r\nas she goes the top, the sides, and the underside <br>\r\nof her toe.  By the time she finishes, she stands <br>\r\nyou back on the floor next to her foot.  The <br>\r\nthrill of the experience has left you woozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we\u2019ll dry you off,\u201d says Julie. She grabs the <br>\r\nhair dryer, unplugged, clicks it onto its highest <br>\r\nsetting,  and aims it at Stacie\u2019s foot -- no, she <br>\r\naims it at you, who still stand dazed in front of <br>\r\nStacie\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out of the way, dummy.\u201d Julie says. She keeps <br>\r\nthe hair dryer pointed at you as she turns away to <br>\r\nplug it in.  You\u2019re too dizzy to react.  The next <br>\r\nthing you know, hurricane winds knock you over and <br>\r\nscoot you helplessly on your back along the floor, <br>\r\ntoward a hole in a floorboard that leads straight <br>\r\ndown to who-knows-what below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust in time Stacie\u2019s foot comes down to save you.  <br>\r\nThe ball of her foot pins you firmly to the floor.  <br>\r\nAfter a few moments of appreciating the sensation, <br>\r\nyou begin wriggling your way up to the arch of her <br>\r\nfoot -- until you sense that the sponge has failed <br>\r\nto wriggle along with you. As soon as Stacie lifts <br>\r\nher foot, you flip over on your stomach, and like <br>\r\na cockroach scuttle on your hands and knees under <br>\r\nthe couch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacie just catches the \u201ctail end\u201d of your escape, <br>\r\nand suppresses a grin.  Julie catches it too.  She <br>\r\nleans down toward the bottom of the couch and says <br>\r\nto you: \u201cIs that what they mean by \u2018scuttlebutt\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d you cry back, \u201cJust get me my pants!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie fishes up your pants from behind the lamp on <br>\r\nthe table. She lowers them to the floor, dangling <br>\r\nthem just far enough so that you\u2019d have to expose <br>\r\nyourself to grab them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoohoo! Big Chief Little Bare!  Come and get it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!  Bring them closer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but ... what do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know this routine, the \u201cplease, pretty please\u201d <br>\r\nroutine.  Well, you\u2019re not going to kow-tow to her <br>\r\nthis time.  \u201cJust give me my pants!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacie notices your cape still lying on the floor.  <br>\r\nShe grabs them with her toes and slowly backs her <br>\r\nflexed foot under the couch.  You run over to her <br>\r\nfoot, yank out the cape from between her toes and, <br>\r\nwithout even thinking, kiss her sole. You hear her <br>\r\nshiver with delight.  You wrap the cape about you, <br>\r\nrun out and yank your pants from Julie\u2019s fingers, <br>\r\nrun back in and slip your pants back on.  Finally <br>\r\nyou come out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d you say, \u201cyou\u2019ve got one wish left.  And <br>\r\ncould you make it a little less stupid this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The dirty <br>\r\nlooks, the snide remarks, of the previous week <br>\r\nhave all but disappeared.  Your sister and <br>\r\nfriends, at first so protective of you, gradually <br>\r\ncarry you in the open again; sometimes, you even <br>\r\nwalk the halls by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm.

The younger Apat <br>\r\nchildren enjoy playing with you, although the <br>\r\nreally young ones need supervision.

I cannot practice.  The team is not <br>\r\n...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean practice with us, in the field across the <br>\r\nstreet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith you?  But you cannot ... \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith me coaching you on your shoulder, with all <br>\r\nyour brothers and sisters, Stacie, and Julie in <br>\r\nthe field, and especially with Choo-choo and Brie <br>\r\n[those are the Apat dogs].  We can train them to <br>\r\nrush you.  You\u2019ll have to try to keep away from <br>\r\nthem, while at the same time trying to make <br>\r\ncontact with someone running down the field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut ... I do not see how that can ...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than sitting around here all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPierre,\u201d Stacie says, \u201cI\u2019m a real good sprinter.  <br>\r\nI just didn\u2019t try out for track this year because <br>\r\n... Elissa\u2019s in it.  If my running can help you <br>\r\nmake the football team, that\u2019ll make it, like, <br>\r\nworthwhile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee Pierre,\u201d you say, \u201cThis isn\u2019t just for you.  <br>\r\nSo come on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she cannot catch a ball.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to catch a ball.  You have to <br>\r\nthrow it to where she would catch the ball, if she <br>\r\ncould. Get it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but ...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Stace.  Let\u2019s just go and do it.\u201d  She <br>\r\nputs you in her shoulder, stands up, and heads for <br>\r\nthe stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWithout me?\u201d Pierre asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d you say, \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to do it, <br>\r\nwe\u2019ll find ourselves someone else who will.  Like <br>\r\nRoland.\u201d  Roland is the next Apat child after <br>\r\nPierre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoland?  Roland is not the football player.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he could be.  He could be better than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPierre\u2019s eyes flash with anger.  \u201cI am the <br>\r\nfootball player!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll meet you out in the field then,\u201d you yell <br>\r\ndown to him, as Stacie walks you up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that point on, you practice with Pierre every <br>\r\nday.  Again and again, Stacie runs down the field, <br>\r\nthe Apat kids run all over the field, while <br>\r\nChoo-choo and Brie, at your command, do their best <br>\r\nto pounce on Pierre before he throws the ball at <br>\r\nStacie.  You, strapped to his shoulder, coach him, <br>\r\nwhile Julie, standing on the sidelines, judges <br>\r\nwhether the ball reaches a place in the air where <br>\r\nStacie would catch it if she could.  You become <br>\r\nquite a team, and Pierre\u2019s raw talent becomes <br>\r\ndaily more refined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stacie had quite a crush on <br>\r\nyou at first, but over the weeks you have gently <br>\r\nsteered her in Pierre\u2019s direction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not that you don\u2019t like Stacie -- you really <br>\r\ndo.  You just don\u2019t have a crush on her.  You have <br>\r\na crush on somebody else, on -- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, what does it matter?  She'll never have you, <br>\r\nanyway.  It's not because of your difference in <br>\r\nsize (that would be true of anyone), but because <br>\r\nof your difference in age. She\u2019s an adult, after <br>\r\nall, your own teacher, a good tens years older <br>\r\nthan you are.  And you're a child; at least, that <br>\r\nis how she treats you -- with affection, but with <br>\r\nthe affection one shows toward a child.  If only <br>\r\nyou could prove to her otherwise.  If only you <br>\r\ncould show yourself a real hero to her -- that <br>\r\nmight win her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, all you can do is attend her classes, and <br>\r\nquietly care about her.  In fact, you worry about <br>\r\nher.  Once you realize that all the school knows <br>\r\nthe truth about Craig Bradley's expulsion, knows <br>\r\nthat she, not you, reported him to the principal, <br>\r\nyour immediate reaction is not one of relief.  It <br>\r\nis concern for her, concern that the students will <br>\r\ntreat her the same way they treated you.  When you <br>\r\nwarn her of this, she only laughs.  \u201cI don\u2019t think <br>\r\nso --I haven\u2019t fit in a girl\u2019s handbag for years.\u201d  <br>\r\nStacie feels terrible, too -- since it was she who <br>\r\nspilled the beans, when she told Elissa, when she, <br>\r\nin fact, blurted the facts out loud in the hall.  <br>\r\nBut Mrs. Andrews reassures her: \u201cI\u2019m a teacher, <br>\r\nnot a student.

Craig Bradley's <br>\r\nnot here in school anymore, and no one else has <br>\r\nany reason to hurt you.  Just go, step by step, <br>\r\ntoward that last room down the hall.  Step by <br>\r\nstep; that's it.  Go a little faster -- you're <br>\r\nanxious to see Mrs. Andrews, after all.  A little <br>\r\nfaster.  But don't run -- that would mean you're <br>\r\nscared.  And ... it would attract attention.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttention?  Whose attention?  There's no one <br>\r\naround to see you.  There's no one behind you.  <br>\r\nYou can't hear anyone behind you.  Don't turn <br>\r\naround.  There's no need to turn around, because <br>\r\nthere's no one behind you.  And you wouldn't want <br>\r\nhim to see you turn around, if he were behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're hugging the wall. But you should always hug <br>\r\nthe wall, even if no one's around, because what if <br>\r\nsomeone were?  He could step on you.  Or she could <br>\r\nstep on you.  Anybody could step on you.  A little <br>\r\nfreshman girl could step on you.  Always hug the <br>\r\nwall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach an open door.  But that's okay.  Just <br>\r\nrun across it.  Now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made it.  But of course you made it.  And now <br>\r\nthere's only a little bit left, and you'll be at <br>\r\nMrs. Andrews' door.

Can you come out for a second? There\u2019s somebody I want you to meet.\u201d To your astonishment she knocks on the roof of the dollhouse. What the heck is going on here?

You get to your <br>\r\nfeet and tiptoe closer to Craig Bradley, close <br>\r\nenough to hear him.  He keeps repeating how she <br>\r\nhas destroyed his life, and now he will destroy <br>\r\nhers.  As he speaks, you look up and notice, on <br>\r\nthe teacher's desk near him, a pencil sharpener <br>\r\nclamped to the lip of the desk, and a lamp whose <br>\r\ncord drops down to a floor outlet.  Good to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to Craig's feet.  You climb up his <br>\r\nright shoe, and stealthily untie his laces.  You <br>\r\nclamber down and do the same with his other shoe.  <br>\r\nBack down on the floor, you tie each of the outer <br>\r\nlaces to the nearest leg of the desk he's in, and <br>\r\nthe inner laces to each other.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb up the cord of the lamp on the teacher's <br>\r\ndesk, and look around the desktop until you notice <br>\r\nthat box of thumb tacks you remember seeing there.  <br>\r\nYou push the box toward Craig Bradley and with one <br>\r\ngreat shove send it over the edge.  The box hits <br>\r\nthe floor, and bursts open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound startles Craig Bradley,  He looks down <br>\r\nat the box of tacks, then up to the desk.  There <br>\r\nyou stand, taunting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" he snarls.  \"Next to this Andrews bitch, <br>\r\nthere's no one else I want to get more than you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumps to his feet, and tries to lunge at you.  <br>\r\nBut his strung-up feet trip him up, and he loses <br>\r\nhis balance.  He holds out his hands to break his <br>\r\nfall.  His left hand lands in the middle of the <br>\r\ntacks; the student's desk he's still tied to falls <br>\r\non top of him.  He screams in pain and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this is going on, you slide down the cord.  On <br>\r\nthe floor, you notice a wasp crawling.  With Craig <br>\r\nstill struggling over the tacks, you pull the now <br>\r\nempty box over and capture the wasp under it, and <br>\r\nrun away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig notices movement under the box.  \"I got you <br>\r\nnow, Worm!\" he cries.  Still tied up at the feet, <br>\r\nhe nonetheless manages to flip over the box and <br>\r\nslap his hand down onto the life crawling beneath <br>\r\nit.  He howls again in pain; the wasp flies away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now you have climbed up the cord of a Venetian <br>\r\nblind, and are standing on a window sill, drawing <br>\r\nattention to yourself.  Craig spots you.  Managing <br>\r\nto stand up, but still unable to free his feet, he <br>\r\nrips the pencil sharpener off the teacher's desk, <br>\r\nand hurls it at you.  You jump out of the way, and <br>\r\nthe missile smashes through the window.  He grabs <br>\r\nthe lamp off the teacher's desk and tries to kill <br>\r\nyou with that.  Again he misses you, only to smash <br>\r\nfurther the already damaged window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Craig struggles to free himself from his shoes, <br>\r\nyou look outside and see that several people have <br>\r\ngathered, staring up at the broken window.  One of <br>\r\nthese breaks away from the rest and hurries off in <br>\r\nthe direction of the front entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange silence fills the room; a sudden shadow <br>\r\nlooms over you.  Mrs. Andrews screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You slide down on the cord <br>\r\nbehind the radiator, leaping off as you feel a tug <br>\r\non the cord.  You land on a pipe (a cold pipe: the <br>\r\nradiator, thank God, is not in use).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig lifts out of the radiator a now empty cord, <br>\r\nand howls in frustration.  From a slit of grating <br>\r\nin the radiator you see him grab Mrs. Andrews by <br>\r\nthe hair.  \"You tipped him off!\" he cries, as he  <br>\r\nyanks her out of her seat and hurls her onto the <br>\r\nground.  It's only then that you notice she is <br>\r\nbound and gagged (You wondered why she had only <br>\r\ngiven a muffled scream).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig grabs a ruler from her desk, and frantically <br>\r\ntries to fish you out with it.  Furious, he throws <br>\r\naway the ruler, picks up a student's desk, and now <br>\r\nbangs it against the radiator.  The whole radiator <br>\r\nshakes; the clanging is unbearable. But it's okay, <br>\r\nbecause you know that this unbearable clanging has <br>\r\nnow traveled to every radiator in the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne colossal bang knocks you off your perch.  You <br>\r\nfall from pipe to pipe, tumbling down to the floor <br>\r\nof the radiator.  You look above you and see that <br>\r\nthere is now nothing in your reach to climb onto.  <br>\r\nSo you peek out of the bottom of the radiator and <br>\r\nlook up.  You see Craig continuing his banging in <br>\r\nsuch a blind rage, that he isn't even looking for <br>\r\nyou.  Yet should he try to fish you out now, from <br>\r\nthe bottom of the radiator, you wouldn't stand a <br>\r\nchance. You know what you have to do; you have to <br>\r\nget out of there while you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where will you go?  Hmmm ... What if you hung <br>\r\nonto one of his socks?  Or climbed up his pants <br>\r\nleg?  After all, the last place he'd look for you <br>\r\nis on his own person.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounds crazy, but it's the only chance you've got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go for it: you scramble out of the radiator, <br>\r\njump to your feet, and ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banging stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Into her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't even thought of that. You wouldn't have <br>\r\ndared.  Even now, you hesitate. A split second too <br>\r\nlong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! GOT YOU NOW WORM!\"  Craig hurls away the desk <br>\r\nhe's holding, and looks right back down at you.  <br>\r\nYou're gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he? WHERE THE HELL IS HE?,\" you hear him <br>\r\ncry, against the background of her rapid heartbeat <br>\r\nand heavy breathing, as you go up and down, up and <br>\r\ndown, on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're now lying where her shirt doesn't touch her <br>\r\nbody, between her breasts, so that he won't detect <br>\r\nany of your bodily movements against her clothing.  <br>\r\nBut couldn't he still peek down her shirt and find <br>\r\nyou?  That soon ceases to be a problem. With every <br>\r\nexpanse of her lungs you sink deeper down into her <br>\r\ncleavage, until it all but engulfs you.  Your only <br>\r\nproblem now is trying to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear him frantically search about the room for <br>\r\nyou. For the moment you feel secure. Then you hear <br>\r\na thud; Mrs. Andrews yelps and writhes in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know where he is. Where is he?,\" he yells, as <br>\r\nhe kicks her again.  For a moment you hear nothing <br>\r\nbut her moaning, then a sharp \"click\" -- the click <br>\r\nof a gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wimp!  Come out or the bitch here gets it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what you have to do. You wriggle yourself <br>\r\nfree, and proceed to ascend back over her chest to <br>\r\nthe top of her shirt. You've hardly begun when her <br>\r\nwhole body jerks upward, and you fall further down <br>\r\nher shirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what that means. She's trying to keep you <br>\r\nfrom saving her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlan B: you begin crawling down her stomach, past <br>\r\nher navel, then forcing yourself under the elastic <br>\r\nwaistband of her skirt. You slither down her right <br>\r\nhip. You reach her thigh, where you intend to jump <br>\r\noff to the right, away from her, and show yourself <br>\r\nin the open.  As you begin to stand up, she jerks <br>\r\nher body to the left.  You lose your balance, and <br>\r\nfall in between her legs.  She's trapped you!  You <br>\r\ncan't crawl under her legs; she's tensing them so <br>\r\nas not to leave you any room. You can't crawl over <br>\r\nher legs; they're too high for you.  So you run to <br>\r\nher feet, and crawl through the space between her <br>\r\ninsteps.  Before you have a chance to break away, <br>\r\nher giant left foot knocks you on your stomach and <br>\r\npins you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig notices the movement. \"What did you just do?  <br>\r\nHe's down there, isn't he?\"  He steps over to her <br>\r\nfeet.  \"Lift up your foot!\" he says, still holding <br>\r\nher at gunpoint.  \"I said, lift up the foot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, she does what he demands.

The team continues to <br>\r\npractice, despite all the alarming sounds they've <br>\r\nheard coming from the school -- breaking glass, <br>\r\ngunshot, and police sirens.  The gunshot did stop <br>\r\nthem for a moment -- until Coach Boggs screamed at <br>\r\nthem to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Pierre and Stacie hear Mrs. Andrews on the <br>\r\nbullhorn, and look to see Craig Bradley running <br>\r\nonto the football field.  Stacie runs after him.  <br>\r\nPierre tries to follow, when ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHut-hut-hike!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe center snaps up the ball, just as Pierre runs <br>\r\nbetween him and the quarterback.  Pierre ends up <br>\r\nwith the ball. All the players, on both sides, try <br>\r\nto grab him.  He dodges them all just long enough <br>\r\nto look out on the field, calculate Craig's pace, <br>\r\nand let the ball go.  It soars in the air, fifty, <br>\r\nsixty, seventy, eighty, ninety yards.  And ... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBONK!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball beans Craig Bradley on the five yard <br>\r\nline.  He loses his footing and falters.  As he <br>\r\nbegins to stumble, Stacie catches up to him, and <br>\r\nsnatches you out of his hands.  Craig falls to the <br>\r\nground.  The police, huffing and puffing, arrive <br>\r\non the scene, and hold him down to handcuff him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe football team look on in shock. No one appears <br>\r\nmore shocked than Coach Boggs.  \"I have never seen <br>\r\nanyone throw like that before!\" he says to Pierre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have never let me show you before,\" Pierre <br>\r\nreplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The <br>\r\nmoment you see your mom, you do what until now you <br>\r\nhaven't allowed yourself to do in front of Stacie.  <br>\r\nYou break down and proceed to sob uncontrollably.  <br>\r\nStacie presses you up to her cheek, then envelopes <br>\r\nyour whole face in a kiss, before handing you over <br>\r\nto your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch EMTs and police convey Mrs. Andrews on a <br>\r\nstretcher into a waiting ambulance, which quickly <br>\r\nraces away, its siren blaring. The policewoman who <br>\r\nremains behind assures your mom that Mrs. Andrews, <br>\r\nalthough badly bruised by Craig Bradley, will pull <br>\r\nthrough.  This ride in stretcher and ambulance is <br>\r\nmore precautionary than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, two police arrive at your home. Your <br>\r\nmom leads them upstairs to your bedroom, where you <br>\r\nlie upon your bed, still trembling.  The policeman <br>\r\nawkardly tries to explain that they need to obtain <br>\r\na statement from you concerning the occurrences at <br>\r\nschool this afternoon.  The policewoman takes over <br>\r\nand, with your mother's permission, asks you if it <br>\r\nwould be okay to place you in her hand. You agree.  <br>\r\nGently she picks you up and sets you down onto her <br>\r\nopen palm.  The policeman writes, as in a soothing <br>\r\nvoice and with the consoling caress of her finger, <br>\r\nthe policewoman coaxes out of you the information <br>\r\nthey require.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, your mom keeps you home from school, <br>\r\nso that you can recuperate from the trauma of the <br>\r\nday before, and so she can take you to the doctor, <br>\r\njust to make sure that you received no damage from <br>\r\nyesterday\u2019s ordeal.  This time, you do not protest <br>\r\nyour mom's decision.  You really do not want to go <br>\r\nto school today.  In fact, you don\u2019t want to go to <br>\r\nschool ever again.  Your classmates have all along <br>\r\ndespised you, because of your connections to Craig <br>\r\nBradley\u2019s expulsion from school. How they now must <br>\r\nhate you, now that you\u2019ve caused his arrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this, you think to yourself, results from your <br>\r\ncrush on a teacher.  Puppy love, that's all it has <br>\r\never been, puppy love; with you as the puppy.  And <br>\r\nmost likely you\u2019ve never been anything more to her <br>\r\nthan that: just a pet, a cute little two inch pet.  <br>\r\nYeah, well, if that\u2019s the case, then ... you never <br>\r\nwant to see her again.  You\u2019ll stay away from her.  <br>\r\nYou\u2019ll fight off that senseless pull you feel when <br>\r\nshe\u2019s near, and stay away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what can you do to avoid her? Maybe you really <br>\r\nwill never go to school there again; that ought to <br>\r\nsolve the problem.  But what if you do?  Well, you <br>\r\ncan always ask to be tranferred to another history <br>\r\nclass.  Yeah, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll do.  And whenever <br>\r\nyou see her walking toward you down the hall?  Not <br>\r\na problem \u2014 if there\u2019s one advantage to your size, <br>\r\nit\u2019s your ability to keep a low profile. So you\u2019ll <br>\r\nhide behind someone\u2019s shoes, or should somebody be <br>\r\ncarrying you, you'll ask to remain concealed from <br>\r\nview.  That\u2019s probably the way to go.  You\u2019ll have <br>\r\nJulie, Pierre or Stacie carry you everywhere, and <br>\r\nkeep you hidden.  You don\u2019t want anyone looking at <br>\r\nyou in the hall anyway, not if everyone hates you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay moping in your room most of the day.  The <br>\r\ntelephone and the doorbell are ringing constantly, <br>\r\ngiving your mom no time to be with you, giving you <br>\r\nlots of time to brood about school, and especially <br>\r\nabout Mrs. Andrews.  You wish you could just cease <br>\r\nto think about her.  But since you can\u2019t erase her <br>\r\nimage from your mind, you brood about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment your mother finally has time to be with <br>\r\nyou, Julie bursts through the front door and races <br>\r\nupstairs. She pulls your mom aside and starts that <br>\r\ninfernal whispering of hers. Whatever news she has <br>\r\nto report from school this time, you don\u2019t want to <br>\r\nknow about it.  You don\u2019t even want to speak with <br>\r\nPierre and Stacie when they call you that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assume the next morning that your mother will <br>\r\nindulge you, and let you stay out of school again.  <br>\r\nInstead, she wants you to go to school.  You plead <br>\r\nwith her, and she tells you to go to school.  You <br>\r\nyou argue with her, and she commands you to go to <br>\r\nschool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s going on here? Even your own mom has turned <br>\r\nagainst you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sulk as you sit on Julie\u2019s plate at breakfast.  <br>\r\nAfter breakfast, your mother spends a long time in <br>\r\nher bedroom, threatening to make you late for your <br>\r\nfirst class, which you mind not a bit. She finally <br>\r\nhustles you both into the car. You sulk throughout <br>\r\nthe ride, as Julie holds you in her hand. You feel <br>\r\nthe car eventually slow down to a stop. Curiously, <br>\r\nyou hear the motor stop, too.  You look up through <br>\r\nthe windshield above you and see that your mom has <br>\r\nparked, not along the curb in front of the school, <br>\r\nbut in front of trees, as if in the school parking <br>\r\nlot. Then your mom steps out of the car, and once <br>\r\noutside with Julie, asks to carry you in herself. <br>\r\nYou notice for the first time that she has dressed <br>\r\nbetter than on most mornings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Julie hustle you into the school; yet once <br>\r\nin the hall, they turn away from the direction of <br>\r\nyour first class.  Julie leads your mother through <br>\r\na door you haven't seen before.  It\u2019s dark as you <br>\r\nenter it; it becomes even darker as your mother\u2019s <br>\r\nfree hand covers up your head.  You begin to hear <br>\r\nthe rumbling of a crowd.  It grows louder as your <br>\r\nmother walks, then settles into silence.  You hear <br>\r\na man's deep voice, the principal's voice, over a <br>\r\nPA system.  He announces your name.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother lifts away the hand which covers your <br>\r\nhead.  Bright lights blind you.  An explosion of <br>\r\nsound deafens you.  Your eyes soon adjust to the <br>\r\nlight, your ears to the sound.  You look out and <br>\r\ndiscover that ... you're on a stage!  You're in <br>\r\nthe school auditorium, in front of all the school.  <br>\r\nEveryone in the audience, not only every teacher, <br>\r\nbut every single student, is jumping up and down, <br>\r\napplauding you wildly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019re giving you a standing ov</span></div></div>",

Your mother settles you <br>\r\ninto a special seat provided for you on the stage.  <br>\r\nIn front of you, a bunch of television cameras are <br>\r\npointing at you.  Behind you, a screen projects an <br>\r\nimage of you enlarged to the size of everyone else <br>\r\nonstage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look about you, and discover Pierre and Stacie <br>\r\nseated alongside you.  Stacie exchanges with you a <br>\r\nfurtive wave and a quick smile, just as Mr. Ripley <br>\r\nacknowledges her and Pierre as the two who rescued <br>\r\nyou.  After the audience applauds them, Mr. Ripley <br>\r\nacknowledges the police men and women onstage, who <br>\r\nwere on the scene for the arrest of Craig Bradley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the audience applauds them, Mr. Ripley steps <br>\r\naside, and motions the mayor of the town to get up <br>\r\nand say a word or two.  After him, the governor of <br>\r\nthe state rises to add a few words. And after her, <br>\r\na U.S. congressman from your state steps up to the <br>\r\nmicrophone, and reads a message from the President <br>\r\nof the United States, commending your courage, and <br>\r\ninviting you to the White House that weekend.  The <br>\r\nassembly ends in a final long and lively ovation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the audience disperses, the dignitaries onstage <br>\r\nstep over to you and one by one shake your hand -- <br>\r\nas you shake their thumb and forefinger.  Finally, <br>\r\nPierre and Stacie come up to you. Stacie picks you <br>\r\nup and kisses you tenderly; Pierre, with a tear in <br>\r\nhis eye, thanks you, his \"best friend in the whole <br>\r\nworld,\" for everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon your mother picks you up, and excuses herself <br>\r\nand you, explaining that you have a plane to catch <br>\r\nthat evening.  You exit through the same side door <br>\r\nthat you entered.  Just outside the door, students <br>\r\nline the walls, applauding you as you go by.  Near <br>\r\nthe front entrance, Julie steps up to you and Mom. <br>\r\nShe takes you in her hand, kisses you, whispers \"I <br>\r\nlove you,\" then, just before handing you back over <br>\r\nto Mom, gives your behind a mischievous flick with <br>\r\nher finger.  \"Oooo!\" You know it's just her way of <br>\r\ngiving you lovin's, but -- man, it hurts. Your mom <br>\r\nfrowns at her as she takes you back, then massages <br>\r\nyour offended heinie with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be outside on time this afternoon;\" your mom says <br>\r\nto Julie, \"We have an 8:40 flight to catch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep yep. Bye Ma! Bye Markie!\" Julie cries, as she <br>\r\ndisappears in the crowd of students dispersing for <br>\r\nclass, and your mother carries you back outside to <br>\r\nyour car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the car, she puts you in a special harness <br>\r\ndesigned for you on the dashboard, buckles herself <br>\r\nin, and drives off. Every now and then, she smiles <br>\r\ndown at you proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long silence, you finally speak.  \"Mommy?\" <br>\r\n(You never call her that anymore -- except when <br>\r\nyou're alone with her, and are in a clingy mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Swee' Pea?\" (She never calls you that <br>\r\nanymore -- except when you call her \"Mommy.\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy,\" your voice begins to break, \"I'm scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scared?  What are you scared about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm scared that all the kids hate me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hate you? Swee' Pea, didn't you hear them applaud <br>\r\nyou?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but ... that's because they had to, cuz all <br>\r\nthose people were up there, and so if they didn\u2019t, <br>\r\nMr. Ripley would be mad at them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think their seeing all those important <br>\r\npeople up there impressed them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Ma!\u201d your voice indicates your impatience <br>\r\nwith her.  \u201cThat just made them madder at me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, why do you think they\u2019re mad at you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got Craig Bradley arrested, Ma!  And it was bad <br>\r\nenough that the police got involved.  But now -- <br>\r\nthe mayor, the governor, the president!  And now I <br>\r\ngotta go to Washington, and it\u2019ll get into all the <br>\r\npapers, and be on the news! Oh, the kids are gonna <br>\r\nhate me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother pauses a moment before asking her next <br>\r\nquestion.  \u201cWho do you think got all those people <br>\r\ninvolved, like the governor, and the president?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Ripley must have.  He\u2019s so ...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Mark!  Please.\u201d  Your mother pulls the car to <br>\r\na stop and shuts off the ignition.  She brings her <br>\r\nenormous, beautiful face down close to you, until <br>\r\nyou can feel her sweet breath wafting over you.  <br>\r\nYou cast her eyes down from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook up at me, Baby.  There's something I have to <br>\r\ntell you.\u201d  Gently her finger lifts up your chin.  <br>\r\nShe looks deep into your eyes. \u201cMr. Ripley did not <br>\r\ncall in the mayor and the governor. Mr. Ripley did <br>\r\nnot arrange for the president of the United States <br>\r\nto see you.  The students did.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles down at your look of shock.  \u201cWhy does <br>\r\nthat surprise you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fumble for words.  \u201cWell ... cuz ... Craig <br>\r\nBradley ... he\u2019s the most popular kid in the <br>\r\nschool, and ...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe WAS the most popular kid in the school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah, cuz I got him expelled, and he\u2019s not <br>\r\nat the school anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Swee\u2019 Pea.  You got him arrested, and he\u2019s <br>\r\nnot popular anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her with your mouth open. She smiles.  <br>\r\n\u201cOh, Baby, what a confused little face!  Don\u2019t you <br>\r\nsee?  Craig Bradley came into school with a gun, a <br>\r\nloaded gun. And he used it. He could have hit any- <br>\r\none: teachers, students, police -- anyone. But you <br>\r\ngot him to try and hit you.  You stopped him.  You <br>\r\nrisked your life to stop him.  You\u2019re so tiny, and <br>\r\nhe\u2019s so big. The odds were completely against you, <br>\r\nyet all by yourself you stopped him. You saved the <br>\r\nwhole school.  And the whole school knows it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But ... the football team ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strokes your cheek with her finger. \"Oh, Swee' <br>\r\nPea! There are some things more important than the <br>\r\nfootball team. And now everyone knows it -- thanks <br>\r\nto you.\"  She sits herself back up, pulls the keys <br>\r\nout of the ignition, grabs her pocketbook and sets <br>\r\nit upon her lap. \"Besides,\" she says, as she drops <br>\r\nher keys into her purse. \"I hear that the football <br>\r\nteam will do alright -- thanks to you. But I think <br>\r\nI should let Pierre tell you about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she undoes you from the harness, and lifts you <br>\r\nout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But ... Ma!  We're not home yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Swee' Pea.  We're just going make a quick <br>\r\nlittle trip in here first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But ... where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother doesn't answer you.

She <br>\r\nalmost always carries you out in the open, letting <br>\r\nyou see wherever she's taking you.  You wonder why <br>\r\nshe now is literally keeping you in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you feel your mom slide herself out of the car, <br>\r\nstand herself up and begin walking, you press your <br>\r\near up to the wall of her purse, listening for any <br>\r\nclues as to your location. You recognize the click <br>\r\nof her heels on asphalt, the whoosh of a revolving <br>\r\ndoor, the rumbling of voices echoing in a spacious <br>\r\nroom. You feel her lift up the pocketbook, and set <br>\r\nit down in front of her; you sense her press it to <br>\r\nher chest, and hear her converse briefly with some <br>\r\nlady whose voice you don't recognize. You feel Mom <br>\r\npick up the purse and secure it under her arm; you <br>\r\nhear her heels click again.  This clicking softens <br>\r\ninto a dull pounding, as if she's walking now on a <br>\r\ncarpet.  The walking stops; you hear a bell sound, <br>\r\na door open, a half dozen clicks of her heels, and  <br>\r\nthe door close. There's no mistaking the sensation <br>\r\nyou now feel in your head and your stomach: you're <br>\r\non an elevator.  The queeziness comes to an abrupt <br>\r\nhalt; you hear the door open, and your mom's heels <br>\r\nbegin their clicking again.  You feel her turn the <br>\r\ncorner, and stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a pause; you think you hear whisperings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear above you the snapping open of the purse.  <br>\r\nA bright light blinds you, as you feel your mother <br>\r\ngrasp her fingers around you and lift you out into <br>\r\nthe open. She hands you over to some other person, <br>\r\nwho holds you up to look at you.  Your eyes adjust <br>\r\nto the light, and slowly begin making out who this <br>\r\npresent captor of yours is: someone light, or even <br>\r\npale, in complexion, blonde, feminine, pretty; no, <br>\r\nmore than pretty --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Andrews!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's lying in a bed, dressed in a hospital johnny <br>\r\n(even that looks good on her).  Tubing sticks into <br>\r\nher arm, pumping a clear liquid from a bag hanging <br>\r\nabove her head. You look back into her face; tears <br>\r\nstreak her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hero.  My big little hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe presses you to her bosom and sobs lightly. You <br>\r\nfeel and hear the beating of her heart.

A guard at the security <br>\r\ncheck point, after letting your mom and sister go, <br>\r\nputs you through a thorough search. She even tells <br>\r\nyou to remove your shoes and socks, then picks you <br>\r\nup and makes you to wiggle your toes.  She has you <br>\r\nwiggle them for a long while, as she examines them <br>\r\nclosely, gliding one of her fingers lightly across <br>\r\nthem.  Your mother considers the inspection rather <br>\r\nodd; Julie calls it \"really weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou board the plane, and get to sit in first class <br>\r\n(which makes hardly a difference to you - you sure <br>\r\ndon\u2019t need the extra leg room).

He and the <br>\r\nFirst Lady receive you cordially, then lead you to <br>\r\nthe White House lawn where, before microphones and <br>\r\ncameras, he awards you a citation for bravery.

Kelly conducts it herself.  She's <br>\r\nlying tummy-down on a couch, as you stand in front <br>\r\nof her on a pillow.  After some preliminary small- <br>\r\ntalk (she herself calls it that), she asks you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you afraid of me?  Just a bit?

Her face is <br>\r\nbeautiful; and her feet -- they aren't bad either, <br>\r\nas feet go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA technician directs your eyes upon a monitor.

He's standing there on the other <br>\r\nside of Kelly's feet.  You then turn away from the <br>\r\nmonitor and look over to where he therefore should <br>\r\nreally be, but he isn't there.  A special effect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you glance back up at the monitor, and watch as <br>\r\nRegis points to Kelly's feet.  \"Now that's funny,\" <br>\r\nhe says.  The giant foot beside him makes as if it <br>\r\ntakes a swipe at him.  He makes as if the foot has <br>\r\njust hit him, and he tumbles onto the ground, then <br>\r\nrolls offscreen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that they break for a commercial.

The closest thing she's got to any sort  <br>\r\nof doll collection ... is you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly the next morning, as you and your family get <br>\r\nready to go to the airport, you find out what your <br>\r\nsister was concealing in that tiny shopping bag of <br>\r\nhers.  \"It's a disguise,\" she says, \"to keep those <br>\r\nobnoxious airport security ladies' hands off you.\"  <br>\r\nYou watch anxiously as her fingers reach deep into <br>\r\nthe bag and pull out ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!  Julie's gonna try to make me wear a dress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mom -- it's a costume.\"  She shows it to your <br>\r\nmother.  It is a period piece, something like what <br>\r\na Dutch milkmaid might have worn two hundred or so <br>\r\nyears ago.  She even bought for the overall look a <br>\r\nflaxen wig of long pigtails.  \"I thought if Markie <br>\r\nlooked like a little doll, we could get those dumb <br>\r\nairport ladies to leave him alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark, your sister spent her own money on that, to <br>\r\nsave you from embarrassment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save me from embarrassment!\" you say to yourself.  <br>\r\n\"She doesn't know what embarrassment is!\"  Yet you <br>\r\nrealize from the tone of her voice that there's no <br>\r\nsense arguing with your mother, so you submit your <br>\r\nbody to Julie's latest scheme.  She dresses you up <br>\r\nand then, to your horror, takes out of her purse a <br>\r\ncouple of almost empty tubes of makeup.  \"The lady <br>\r\nwho made up your face in the studio yesterday said <br>\r\nI could take these,\"  Julie says.  She smears your <br>\r\nface with what almost looks like clown white, does <br>\r\nyour eyebrows with a finely sharpened brown pencil <br>\r\nand then, with the blunt end of a toothpick, daubs <br>\r\nyour lips and cheeks with rosy red.  Even your mom <br>\r\nsqueals with delight at the results, and takes out <br>\r\nher camera for a photo shoot.  All you're thinking <br>\r\nabout is with what perverse delight the gal at the <br>\r\nphoto place will develop this roll of film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you will have to admit again and again <br>\r\nin upcoming months, Julie's little ruse does work; <br>\r\nairport security passes you by without any special <br>\r\ntreatment.

Stacie and Pierre <br>\r\nfollow close behind.  Only now do they get a first <br>\r\nlook at you.  They try to suppress their laughter, <br>\r\nbut can't, exploding in a sudden outburst.  In the <br>\r\nmidst of their laughter, you yell out: \"Why didn't <br>\r\nshe make me up like a ... a GI Joe or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother's brow wrinkles into a quizzical look.  <br>\r\nShe turns to Julie.  \"Why didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make him up like a GI Joe or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Julie yawns, stretching her long body out on <br>\r\nthe sofa, as she surfs the TV with a remote, \"That <br>\r\nwould have been so uninteresting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother's whole face drops.  She looks down at <br>\r\nyou.  You shrug.  \"She got you again, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess she did,\" your Mom says, looking at Julie <br>\r\nblithely pretending not to hear what she obviously <br>\r\nis hearing.  \"Yes, she definitely did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo life goes on as usual -- only the usual becomes <br>\r\nalot better than it was.  You become overnight the <br>\r\nmost popular kid in the school.  The football team <br>\r\ndubs you their mascot; before every game, each one <br>\r\nof the players rubs you on his head for luck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut both you and they know that there's a lot more <br>\r\nto their winning streak than that; it's really all <br>\r\nabout their quarterback Pierre.  His leadership on <br>\r\nand off the field hustles them right to the state <br>\r\nchampionship; he becomes the state's player of the <br>\r\nyear, and receives offers for full scholarships to <br>\r\nthe top universities in the country.  Yet whenever <br>\r\nhe acknowledges another award or does an interview <br>\r\nfor the media, he always attributes the major part <br>\r\nof his success to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacie has her own share in fame and success.  She <br>\r\ngets back on the track team, and boosts the team's <br>\r\nvictories enough to lead them up to the regionals.  <br>\r\nShe also enjoys a renewed popularity in the school <br>\r\n-- thanks to her association with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all good things must come to an end, including <br>\r\nhigh school.  You, already voted Most Popular, now <br>\r\nare chosen valedictorian for your graduation.  You <br>\r\ndeliver your address standing on a raised platform <br>\r\nset atop the podium.  As at that assembly given in <br>\r\nyour honor, behind you is an enormous screen which <br>\r\ndisplays an image of you big enough for all in the <br>\r\naudience to see.  And the topic of your address? <br>\r\n\"Learning to Live with the Little Things in Life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut we're getting ahead of ourselves.  A few weeks <br>\r\nprior to graduation day is, of course, prom night.  <br>\r\nPierre already has Stacie for his date, and so you <br>\r\ndecide that you'd like to ask -- Elissa.  You have <br>\r\nfelt sorry for her; her popularity plummeted after <br>\r\nCraig Bradley's arrest.  But how will you ask her? <br>\r\nShe has seemed almost afraid to go near you, as if <br>\r\nshe were some sort of leper or something.  But you <br>\r\nknow where she sits in the library (she spents her <br>\r\nlunch hours there, to get away from people).  With <br>\r\nPierre's help, you get on the table and take cover <br>\r\nbehind some books.  At a few minutes before twelve <br>\r\nshe arrives and sits down.  You call out her name.  <br>\r\nShe looks around the room nervously.  You step out <br>\r\nfrom the book shelf.  You yell up to her: \"No, I'm <br>\r\ndown here!\"  She looks down and jumps back.  \"Hey, <br>\r\ncome on!  I'm not going to bite you -- it wouldn't <br>\r\nhurt that much, even if I did.  I just want to ask <br>\r\nyou something.\"  Now you're the one who's nervous.  <br>\r\n\"Um ... Elissa ... are you going to the ... do you <br>\r\nwant me to take you to the ... could I take you to <br>\r\nthe ... prom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hangs her head.  \"That's not funny.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elissa, look at me.\"  She does so.  \"I'm not here <br>\r\nto hurt you.  I'm really asking you to go out with <br>\r\nme to the prom.  But then (now you hang your head) <br>\r\nit's possible that you're the one who doesn't want <br>\r\nme.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're serious.  You ... want me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elissa.\" You hold out your hands to her.  Slowly, <br>\r\napprehensively, she extends an index finger toward <br>\r\nyou.  You take it in both your hands.  \"I've never <br>\r\nbeen mean to you, ever -- have I?\"  She shakes her <br>\r\nhead no.  \"Well, I'm not going to begin to now.  I <br>\r\nreally want to take you to the prom. So how about <br>\r\nit?  Will you say yes?\"  She's speechless.  \"Hey,\" <br>\r\nyou say, \"You once called me your boyfriend, but I <br>\r\nnever did ask you on a date.  So I owe you one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe draws back her finger, then -- opens her palm.  <br>\r\nYou step into it.  She closes her hand around you <br>\r\nand brings you to her now tear-stained cheek. It's <br>\r\nthat kind of moment when it's actually nice to get <br>\r\ndrenched.  \"Thank you.\" she repeats, over and over <br>\r\nagain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You, however, roll away from them and pull the covers over your head.<br>\r\n\u201cUh, oh,\u201d says Stacie, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to go to the prom with Elissa?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d You say from under your covers.  \u201cBut cut out the cutsie stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLiss!\u201d Stacie says to Elissa, \u201cHe said yes!\u201d  Then she says to you, \u201cBut I can\u2019t cut out the cutsie stuff, Markie, \u2018cause you\u2019re even cuter when you\u2019re in your pj\u2019s AND MAD.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGo away!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he cute?\u201d she says to Elissa.  Then she starts shaking your dollhouse stand.  \u201cMark!  Get out of bed!  It\u2019s an earthquake!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been hanging around Julie too long! Now go away!\u201d  But Stacie doesn\u2019t go away.  Instead, she stealthily pulls back your sheet from the foot of the bed, revealing the soles of your bare feet.  \u201cSee how cute?\u201d she says to Elissa.<br>\r\n\u201cCut that out!\u201d you say, and draw your legs up further.  But Stacie only pulls the sheet up further.  With thumb and forefinger she grabs your two legs at the ankle, and tickles your feet with her pinkie nail.  You try to kick yourself free. but of course are no match for her.  \u201cLet me go!\u201d<br>\r\nAbruptly she releases you.  \u201cOkay Liss.\u201d Stacie says, \u201cWe\u2019d better go.  Sleeping Beauty\u2019s in no mood for games right now.  Bye Markie.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBye Mark,\u201d says Elissa, \u201cThank you, and ... um ... I\u2019m sorry ... if I laughed at you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d you grumble. \u201cIt was Stacie\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to forgive me, Mark?\u201d  Stacie asks. \u201cI hear that we\u2019re supposed to forgive each other.\u201d<br>\r\nShe\u2019s got you there.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah.  Well, we\u2019ll ... we\u2019ll talk about it tomorrow.  But go away now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll forgive me.\u201d  She says to Elissa.  \u201cHe always does.  So -- we\u2019d better go.  Come on, Liss.  Love you, Mark.\u201d<br>\r\nStacie pats your head with her finger and the two girls leave the room.  You hear their footsteps down the stairs, and a moment later, two car doors opening and slamming, one right after the other, and Stacie\u2019s car driving away.  You snuggle up cozily under your covers, and sigh a sigh of relief.  Everything\u2019s all right again.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Stacie.\u201d you say to yourself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your friends can wait for you in the car, and I\u2019ll hold Mark until you come out.\u201d<br>\r\nActually, this gives Elissa\u2019s mom a chance to talk with you alone.  She holds you up to her lips and whispers in your ear, \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUm ... for what, ma\u2019am?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh ... lots of things.\u201d She looks toward the bathroom, and says, as if to herself, \u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult couple of years; but it could have been a lot worse.  Oh, was I relieved when that boy was locked away!\u201d  She holds you up and looks at you.  \u201cDoes that sound awful?\u201d  You shrug your shoulders, sheepishly.  She looks to the bathroom again.  \u201cHer father didn\u2019t understand.  He was so taken with her dating a football star that he couldn\u2019t see what harm that boy was doing.  Our baby was beginning to act and dress like a ... well, you know.  Oh, I don\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t painful to see her lose all her friends as she did, but I still say she was better off moping around at home than hanging out with him who-knows-where and doing who-knows-what.  And she\u2019s not so depressed now, since you asked her to the prom.  It\u2019s like you saved her life twice.  So I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying thank you and -- do you mind if I give you a kiss?\u201d<br>\r\nOf course you acquiesce, so she covers your face with her puckered lips and gives you a tender smooch.  She looks down at you and smiles, and presses you to her bosom, as Elissa opens the bathroom door.  She takes you from her mother, and they kiss goodbye.<br>\r\n\u201cRemember,\u201d her mom says, \u201ccall if you\u2019re going to be out later than two.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI will.  I promise.  Bye mom.\u201d  Elissa hurries down the stairs with you, and out the door.</span></div></div>",

Your eyes focus in on a gargantuan female face framed in long blonde hair.  That beautiful familiar face.<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Andrews!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Andrews?  My, we are sleepy this morning.

Mrs. Andrews is no longer Mrs. Andrews.  She\u2019s ...<br>\r\n\u201cThe name is Letellier now,\u201d she says, as if you didn\u2019t know.  \u201cMrs. Mark Letellier.\u201d  She pokes you in the tummy.  \u201cAnd don\u2019t you forget it!\u201d  She picks you up and gives you a kiss.

She wiggles her toes for you.  \u201cDid you think I\u2019d let anyone but my husband nibble at those the way you did last night?\u201d<br>\r\nOh (heh!) right -- how could you forget THAT?<br>\r\nShe suddenly lifts you to her face, and says, with mock concern: \u201cBut we must be careful what we say.

You groan, and don\u2019t really care if Julie, and the whole world with her, hears you.<br>\r\nIt was a dream.  That scene with you and your beautiful bride, was nothing but a dream.<br>\r\nYou are just awake enough to know that what had seemed so real was not real at all.  You now begin to second guess everything else that has hitherto seemed so real.  Was any of it real -- Elissa and Craig Bradley, Stacie and Pierre?  The prom, your televison spot with Regis and Kelly, your meeting with the President and First Lady, the ovation you received at the school assembly?  Did Mrs. Andrews really save you from been beaten to death in the hallway?  Did you really risk your life to save her?  Or did you just concoct all of these people and events in your little head to boost your little ego?<br>\r\nYour mind goes from seeing yourself as the world\u2019s luckiest lover, to fearing you\u2019re the world\u2019s biggest chump.<br>\r\nAnd then the most horrid of possibilities hits you.<br>\r\nWhat if ...?<br>\r\nNo, you reason with yourself, there must be a Mrs. Andrews.  Yet who is she to you, really?  Or maybe you should ask: who was she to you?  After all, right now you don\u2019t even know what year it is, or how old you are.  At this point she could be an alluring flashback from your now distant high school past, a fetching memory from days gone by, yet one which has never ceased to captivate you in your dreams.<br>\r\nOr maybe she\u2019s not so distant a memory at all.  In fact, maybe you just met her.<br>\r\nYes maybe, just maybe, you\u2019re still in your first day of school.  Maybe you right now are doing just what Julie told you to do on that day (which may be today): staying put after your last class, Mr. Lorenzo\u2019s class, and waiting for her to pick you up.  Yeah -- maybe you\u2019re in Mr. Lorenzo\u2019s classroom.  And maybe, while waiting for Julie, you dozed off on his desk, with visions of your pretty new history teacher dancing in your head.<br>\r\nFor by now you\u2019re awake enough to realize that wherever you\u2019ve been sleeping, it\u2019s not in your own room.</span></div></div>",

You breathe deep breaths but only get the stale air of her gym sock's stink. You feel yourself lift into the air and the opposing force that you were pushed up against - her insole - pulls away. You feel the gym sock wrap tighter around your body allowing you breathe through the tiny holes between fibers. You feel yourself going back down and her foot lifting off your back. You turn your head to see light at the end of the tunnel when her foot completely comes out of the sock. You turn over and begin trying to climb up to the light, when you suddenly feel the world turn upside down. Before you know it, you're falling face first toward the opening. You land on the hard locker room floor. You turn around and see the girl smiling on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a free period next,\" she says smiling. She slips her bare feet into her flip-flops. She just finished changing out of her gym shirt and put her top back on. She looks back down at you and sees that you turned your eyes away from sneaking a peak at her in her bra. Suddenly her hand descends on you and wraps her fingers around your body. You feel your back crack as she lifts you up into the air; she's definitely holding you too tight. \"Now I'm taking you to meet with a few friends of mine who are just anxious to see you.\" She then starts moving you toward her purse, you see the words 'Punt the Runt' written across a locker. You gulp hard as she puts you in her purse. You then feel her start walking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does she take you?</span></div></div>",

Well, they might hate me but they aren't crazy. They're not going to kill me...are they?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard lots of sounds. She was in the hall. You were terrified. You had no idea where she was taking you. You had to find out where she was going in case you get a chance to escape; that way, you would know where you were and where to go next. You decided to climb up the side of her purse. You climbed onto her red nail-polish using her compact mirror and lipstick tube. When you couldn't reach the top from here, you climbed up to the top using the fabric lining of the purse. You reached the top and peered out, slipping through a hole on one side of the single snap button. Every step she took, shook her purse and you along with it. In order to keep from falling, you threw your arms over the side to secure yourself. you then took your look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw that she was still in the hallway. But you hadn't been on this hallway. You didn't know where you were!!! That is until you heard the sounds of the other students grow larger. You looked around and saw that she was close to the cafeteria. Yes, you knew where you could go from here; granted that you don't get caught or stepped on. Either would be bad, and most likely intentional; you overheard a few complaining about the game and how without Craig, they were sure to loose. They were speaking very angry words concerning you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so glad that no one could see you. Everyone was moving by so fast that no one would take notice of some teen girl's purse. However, as she passed by the last of the lockers on her way to her destination. You spotted something that seemed to stand out. It was a teenage boy, about seventeen or eighteen years old. He had brown hair, a thin layer of facial hair, and wore rectangular glasses with red rims wrapping around the glass. He wore blue jeans and a gray shirt. Over his shirt he wore a black blazer and a black fedora on his head. A typical teenager from the description but he had two very peculiar features; hanging from his left arm was a cane - the handle wrapped around his elbow. The other feature was that his right hand held a match that he was using to light a tobacco pipe in his left hand. He lit it and doused the match. From out of his mouth came puffs of smoke afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what, but something about him drew your eyes. You didn't take them away from him the entire time. Then as she passed by the boy, he exhaled another cloud of smoke from his mouth, you saw his hazel eyes pierce through the smog and stare strait at you. You weren't sure of it though, but when the girl completely walked away, you saw him turn his neck to watch her go. You never took your eyes away from him, until you hear your captive talking with another girl. You then see her reaching for her purse. You quickly withdraw your arms and allow yourself to fall back into your leather prison. You look up expecting to see the button open up and a hand to descend on you, but you don't see anything. She must have been going for something on one of the side pouches of the purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon felt her moving again. Every step she took brought her closer to her destination. You had to get out now! You started to climb up when you heard most of the noises stop. You then heard her say, \u201cGuess who I\u2019ve got?\u201d You were dead for sure. Suddenly you felt your entire world shake around. You assumed that she was shaking her purse. After you had been shaken up, you saw a bright light pour inside. You covered your eyes when you saw the shadow of a hand descend on you. It wrapped around you and lifted you out of the purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light was so bright, it was unbearable, but eventually your eyes adjusted. You looked around and saw grass, a tree and the blue sky; you were outside! You saw a few picnic benches and heard the sounds of a few kids; she\u2019d taken you to the outside lunch area. However, she\u2019d brought you around a corner of a brick wall away from the other tables, so no one could see her or her friends. You gulped with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d said a male voice. It was familiar enough to make your eyes shoot open with fear. She did NOT bring you to him! He was definitely the last person you wanted to see. You slowly began to turn around and see Craig Bradley sitting on the table and his two cronies standing beside. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t the little bug that got us kicked out of school boys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCraig, I never said anything about you guys,\u201d you said choking on fear. The boys just glared and started cracking their knuckles. You turned to look up at the girl and asked, \u201cWhy would you bring me to him? I thought you and Elissa hated this guy?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow why would I hate my new honey?\u201d she said. \u201cI was always jealous that Elissa got all the attention as well as the hottest guy in school. But, Craig\u2019s with me now, and I\u2019d do anything for my new boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks babe,\u201d Craig said snapping his fingers and pointing at her. She giggled a bit. Craig continued smiling evilly at you. \u201cWord around here is that you\u2019re public enemy number one. Not surprising seeing as how you steal the star player\u2019s girl, get him kicked out of school and then ruined the school\u2019s chances of winning the State Championship. Who couldn\u2019t hate you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho couldn\u2019t hate me?\u201d you ask. \u201cStole your girl? Craig, you almost killed me! I had two broken ribs and a medley of contusions because of you, you Psycho! You walk around like a King and you were a jerk to everyone around here. Then I show up and you try and kill me on my first day. You get kicked out of school, and now everyone reveres you like some kind of god? You tried to kill me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig started laughing. \u201cOh look boys, the insect thinks he\u2019s a human being.\u201d The boys began laughing as well as the girl. Your mind sunk in as you heard those words. \u201cLet me explain this to you bug; we as well as most of the world, are human beings. You don\u2019t fit the requirements. You fit the qualifications for an insect or something. And as such, you don\u2019t get the usual rights that we humans do. And we humans, we have a habit of squashing little pests like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you hear yourself?!\u201d you yell out unable to contain your anger any longer. \u201cYou think that I\u2019m not human because of my size. And now you suddenly think that gives you the right to kill me? That his a load of crap. And once my lawyer gets a-hold of you, you\u2019ll be in jail faster than you can kick a football, you Psycho!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you were to suddenly disappear? How long would it be for people to forget you? We crush your kind everyday. Plus, when they do look for you, the one\u2019s they\u2019ll blame are that teacher.\u201d <i>Mrs. Andrews</i>, you thought. \u201cAnd that foreign freak \u2013 what\u2019s his name \u2013 Pepe\u2019 Le Pieu!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis name is Pierre!!!\u201d you yelled against your better instincts. Craig turned to his boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing this bug talk,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you say we show him what I\u2019m best at?\u201d He turned towards the girl. She suddenly started handing you off to one of the boys. You saw Craig taking steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING?\u201d you yell as the big teenager puts you on the ground and holds your head between his thumb and index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a reason why I was needed to win the game, Cockroach,\" he said. \"What was it you said? I'd be in jail faster than I can kick a football? Well...let's see just how fast that really is!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes opened wide when you realized what that meant. You then saw Craig start his run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything went slow as you saw Craig running towards you. You tried to struggle, but because your head was pinched in between the jock's two fingers. There was no escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1!\" He yelled. You knew why. He was counting down. \"2!\" He was only a few feet away when you saw his right leg start to go back in its arch. You went silent. \"3!!!\" You knew what was coming now. You saw the foot begin to swing back towards you. You couldn't take your eyes off it. You couldn't yell for help, you couldn't escape, you couldn't do anything. All you could do, was hope that it would be quick and painless. \"PUNT-dah!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped out of your fear and saw that Craig had stopped. His leg remained back in its arch, trying to pull forward. But something had stopped it. You looked up and saw a figure standing behind Craig. But you couldn't recognize who it was. But you looked back down toward the leg that was about to kick you into next week. You saw something wrapped around his ankle. It was the tip of a cane!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig turned his head around. His friends looked up and saw the teenage boy from the hall. He was holding the cane that held Craig's leg back. He was glaring at them with his piercing hazel eyes. Other than that, he said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the f-HEY!\" before Craig could finish, the boy raised his arm, pulling the cane up. The movement pulled Craig into the air and the handle came off his ankle. The boy then slammed the cane down on Craig's back making him impact back onto the ground. Craig groaned in pain and didn't get up. The boy then stood up right and let the cane rest at his side. It was so fast that you barely saw it. You were astounded. The jock pinching your head let go allowing you to fall onto your back. He got up and rushed toward the intruder with a fist held high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think you are, punk?\" he was about to throw a the punch. Suddenly the boy thrust the cane into the jock's stomach, causing him to bend over in pain. The boy then grabbed the handle of the cane and pulled back on it, swinging the end of the cane into the jock's face. The jock shot up because of the impact and stared at the sky. The boy then twirled his cane around until the pole rested on the back of the jock's head. He pulled back on the cane pulling the jock with him, throwing the jock to the ground behind him. He landed next to Craig and didn't get up either. The boy then started walking toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third boy stood up on top of the table and then jumped, trying to tackle the mystery boy. However, your defender sidestepped out of the way allowing the jock to pass. However as he passed, the boy moved his cane onto the jock's pants. It hooked onto either his pockets, his belt or his belt loop; regardless, the cane hooked onto his pants. The mysterious warrior then began spinning, pulling the boy with it. Then, the cane unhooked the jock's pants and sent him flying toward the brick wall. He hit hard, but he wasn't knocked out. He was angry now and rushed toward his opponent throwing a punch. However, the other boy began to twirl his cane. The cane pressed against the lunging arm and forced it to follow the spin. The boy then stepped behind the jock's back, still leading his arm. He pressed the cane against the jock's back, pinning his arm there as well. The boy lifted his leg up and placed his foot on the jock's back. He kicked, pushing the jock forward. He slipped the cane out from under the jock's arm and then slashed the cane across his opponent's rear end. The jock straitened out and put his hands over his buttocks in pain before falling on top of the other boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were astounded. You'd only seen things like this in movies, never in real life; of course you'd only seen people being shrunken down to minuscule sizes in movies, but look how your life turned out. But still everything that this boy did was amazing! He looked to be about an average teenage size without large muscles, but he just beat up the three largest boys in school. And he did it all for you! And you don't even know who he is!!! You looked up and saw the girl was up against the wall completely terrified. Now the question is...how would you react to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, Bradley,\" he said pointing his cane down toward Craig's head. Craig groaned as he looked up he slowly pulled himself to his feet. You got a chance to compare the two. They were almost the same height, but Craig was definitely taller. And what was worse, his muscles were huge compared to this boy's arms. And he was angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, you're gonna pay for that you little punk!\" he said huffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" the boy said condescendingly. \"Because the Big can always outdo the Small. They have power over those who are smaller and weaker than them and can do anything they want to them. You know all about that don't you? You tried to exercise it on the kid over there,\" he said nodding his head toward you. \"That's how it's gotten to be for bullies like you. You always prey upon someone smaller and weaker than you. He is the perfect target; definitively smaller and weaker. And somehow by killing him, no one will ever question your power again. Is that how it goes...you ignorant psychopathic Meat-head?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Craig do? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"SHUT UP!!!\" Craig yelled. Apparently, insulting his intelligence is a pressure point. He threw a punch toward the boy's face. The boy's expression didn't change. He leaned to the side, completely dodging the attack. Craig threw another punch with his other arm - it was easily dodged. He threw another and another and another - all of them dodged. Craig was getting irritated, his teeth gritted. He threw the hardest punch he could. The boy still had no reaction and this time, he didn't even try to dodge. Instead, Craig's fist was suddenly caught by the boy's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig was still trying to force forward, you could tell by the way it was shivering. But the boy's hand and arm was completely still. You saw him slightly turn Craig's wrist and then he began to push his hand back farther than his joint would allow. Suddenly, you heard a cracking sound. You saw Craig's eyes get wider. He then tried to pull away, but the boy wouldn't let go. He was tightening his grip on Craig's fist. You heard another crack. You then heard Craig scream in pain as he dropped down to one knee. He put his free hand on his wrist to try and pull away. He grabbed at the boy's hands to try and get free. \"Let go!!!\" The boy tightened harder causing Craig to drop onto both knees, using his free hand to keep himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is interesting,\" the boy began. \"Here I am, with a boy who is at the very least twice my size, twice my physical strength and I have him...on his knees...bowing to me. But wait! This can't be right! It goes against the laws of the Universe! The Large are better than the Small! You exercise it on him a lot.\" Craig kept grunting and trying to pull away. He gritted his teeth and stared at the boy angrily and wild eyed. The boy raised an eyebrow and then smiled darkly. \"You know what? You're right; it's not really bowing until your face hits the ground!\" You suddenly heard a loud popping sound and Craig yelled louder. His head hung from his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-p-please, l-l-let go,\" he said calmly between gasps of pain. You never thought you'd see Craig like this. You looked up at the teenage boy and your mind kept wondering how it was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...Begging for Mercy,\" the boy said. \"Alright close enough!\" Suddenly the boy let go of Craig's hand. Craig pulled his arm back and flew backwards. His friends had long since gotten up and were astonished seeing their ringleader like this. They rushed toward him and pulled him to his feet. But he pushed away from them. He stood up and raised a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to pay for this! I'm going to sue your clothes off and then I'm going to <i>sew</i> your ass to your face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not,\" the boy said smiling. \"You're not going to be able to. How are you going to prove that a kid like me did <i>that</i> to your hand? He's your only witness. Now stop being a big baby; you're hand is going to be fine in a couple of days. You've got bigger things to worry about. So I suggest not building up more debt and burying yourself in even more shit. Seeing as your going to be brought up on two charges of assault <i>and</i> attempted murder.\" Craig and his friends raised an eyebrow to that. \"Faces and Names, Craig; I've got 'em. Now I think you guys should go work on your alibis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig was angry now. \"Well it doesn't matter anyway. The bug doesn't matter anymore; I'll always be greater than him! I've got a dozen offers from the Top Universities already. I don't need to win the championship here. Screw this school! I'm still going to go on to be a professional football player.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Top Universities? Football Scholarships?\" The boy chuckled softly. He closed his eyes and began swaying his head. \"Craig, don't you get it? None of that is going to happen. The minute you first kicked that boy across the hall, your life was officially over. The kid said you were going to jail; that's not even a fraction of what's going to happen to you. Once his family is done suing you, you - and probably your entire family - are going to have to work for the rest of your life to pay him off...not to mention all the legal fees. Last week, those universities were going to offer you the world. Now that you've got a record, they wouldn't even touch you with a forty foot cattle-prod. Oh, and you will be imprisoned; maybe for life. And even if you do get out, you'll still be in prison; a prison for your relationships, a prison for your money, and most importantly, a prison for your life. And believe me, I know about prisons. The point now is, you made your choice and now it's come back to bite you in the ass! Your future...has gone bye-bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig stood there, completely stunned as well as his two boys. So were you. Craig just got schooled in the legal future that awaits him. He was going to spend his entire life paying you money; and you loved it! The jerk had finally been put in his place! You, your mother, and your sister were set for life!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now get out of here,\" he said. \"Since you've been expelled, just being here can add Trespassing onto your list of charges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so what are you going to do about that?\" Craig asked as his buddies stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not going to do anything.\" The boy then lifted his left arm and looked at his watch. \"The solution should present itself in - 5...4...Here...We...Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the policeman who served as the school's security guard was leaving the school with a box of donuts. He was going on his lunch break and had just exited the school. That's when he turned and saw Craig. He recognized him and his boys from when Mr. Ripley called them up to the office to be expelled. \"Hey you!!!\" he called starting to run over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! Scram boys!!!\" Craig said as the three of them began to run away. The cop began to chase them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look, another witness!\" the boy called when the cop ran past him. \"Be sure to testify about what they've done here today!!!\" The boy smiled confidently. But he didn't see the girl walk up to him. She tried to slap him in the face, but he lifted a hand and caught her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You jerk,\" she said. \"That was my boyfriend you attacked! And if he can't sue you, then I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly pushed her against the wall and held her there as he said, \"Firstly; that wasn't assault, that was defense. And secondly; you won't be able to sue either, cause you'll be too busy being sued as well.\" Her eyes widened. \"I'm pretty sure that Mrs. Letellier wouldn't appreciate the fact that you kidnapped her son, kept him in your gym sock <i>during</i> Gym Class and then finally turning him over to a group of individuals with the intent of killing him with a record of doing just that...But I know her lawyer would.\" He then leaned in close to her face and said, \"Now run little rabbit...run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe released her from the wall and she scampered off toward the building and went inside. You couldn't believe what had happened, a few minutes ago you were sure you were going to die. Then this kid comes out of here like some Heroic Warrior sent to save you. But then he started walking towards you. You seemed to snap out of your world of admiration and saw this kid for what he is; a teenager. And the majority of teenagers that you know hate your guts. What if he was one of those that hated you because of the game? What if he only saved you so he could have the chance to get back at you? I mean, if someone could, who wouldn't beat up Craig for no reason?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about a foot from you now. You stared up at the giant teen. He was giving you one of his blank expressions again. You couldn't tell what he was thinking. You were terrified. Suddenly, you saw him swing the handle of the cane down toward you! You were right; he does hate you!!! The cane was certainly going to crush you. You closed your eyes and covered your head with your arms. You waited for the inevitable impact. You hoped it would be painless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

You slowly crack both your eyes open and you saw the handle of the cane hovering just above you. It just stayed there within reach of your body. You looked up and saw the boy giving you a light expression. Something that you'd call a 'neutral smile'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well c'mon,\" he said. \"Grab a-hold!\" You looked at the cane. You didn't fully trust this guy yet. You didn't know him. But, he did rescue you. You reached up and grabbed onto the curve of the handle. You wrapped both arms tightly around the wooden handle. He smiled again. \"Good, now hold on tight.\" Suddenly you felt him turning the cane to where the handle was pointing toward the sky. You held on with all your might, but you were afraid that your arms would give out at any moment. You wrapped your legs around the handle as well to be as secure as possible. Then once the rotating had stopped, you shimmied up the slope of the handle until you reached the partially flat top. There, you let your body lay against it. You turned your head to look back at him. \"You okay, kid?\" he asked you. You slowly nodded your head while your mouth was still a gaped. You stared at him, still fearful. \"Good,\" he said. Before long you felt the cane moving as he began to walk. You quickly wrapped your limbs around the cane again, However, you begin to notice that he's keeping the cane rather steady, it's not rocking about at all. You relaxed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crossed the outdoor picnic area and went toward the double doors that led back into the building. He opened one and stepped inside. It was quiet and empty. The lunch periods were over and everyone was back in class. You thought it was a bad thing; you didn't know where this guy was taking you and if he were to turn on you at any minute, there'd be no one around to help you. Though, not many would, but you were hoping you'd be lucky enough to have a teacher walk by. But there was no one. And this was a person who could easily kill you; <i>no</i>...he could <i>kill</i> people like Craig and his goons. He could completely <i>destroy</i> you...And you were completely at his mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Mark,\" he said. \"The silence is getting a bit irritating. I know you have a lot of questions, so I say, let's be on with it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know my name?\" you say. But then realize how ridiculous it was to. There probably wasn't anyone in the building that didn't know you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure do,\" he said. \"And no, I don't know you because of you getting Craig expelled and ruining the game and blah-blah-blah. I'm not part of the majority that hates you and I don't plan on being such. Any other questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour next question was the obvious one. \"Who...Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name's Sean,\" he said. \"Just Sean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Sean...um...why would you save me?\" you asked next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't I save you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like you said, the majority of the school hates me. How come you don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like I also said, 'Blah-Blah-Blah'. The reason you're hated is a stupid one. They hate you cause you almost got killed, got the assailant kicked out of school and now they won't win their precious Championship Football game. Sports don't matter to me; they seem so trivial. And they're certainly not something to hate someone over. You can relax Mark. Believe me, if I had wanted to hurt you, I'd have done it by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made you feel better...or maybe not. Actually it made you feel a little less than better. But, he so far showed no malicious intent toward you. You began to relax a little bit. You decided to get a little more comfortable. You pulled your leg over the other side of the cane and let it dangle down next to your other leg. You sat up strait now. You then asked, \"But why did you save me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over and smiled, \"Cause I like you kid. You interest me...You...intrigue me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sounded a bit creepy when he said that. You don't know what possessed you to ask, \"Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell them that it's Human Nature,\" he said. After he said it, he started chuckling to himself. You didn't get the joke. He stopped after a short while. \"Sorry, it's the line of a song that I like. As for why you interest me...well,  its your size - I hope you don't take offense at that. But - its at least got to do with your size. You see, no one in the world is like you. Now you'd think that with someone of your stature, people would treat you kindly as such a delicate thing. The interesting thing is, because of a circumstance that you have no control over, everyone in this school hates you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your head drop as you realized how right he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it ISN'T Human Nature but to be kind and compassionate,\" he started again. \"But instead to take advantage of those smaller and weaker than themselves. That Psychopath Craig genuinely believes that you are an insect, that deserves to be squashed. Now, one way or another, even though he's been expelled, I have a feeling his influence is going to spread around to the others. It starts out with intimidation; fear. That kid, Pierre. He wants to be friends with you, but he's afraid to be due to the threat of alienation. And what's more, they'll probably beat him up and get away with it, considering that few people here are willing to rat on each other, and how they're all working for the same cause. Eventually, I have a feeling that the people here are going to get very violent towards you. And the way things are now...You're very vulnerable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he was saying made you even sadder. Maybe you should've listened to your mom and left school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But all that's about to change.\" He said. \"Now that I'm around, no one's going to have the gall to hurt you ever again; cause if they try - well...I don't need to tell you what'll happen seeing as how you watched me lay up Craig and his goons. Believe me kid, stick by me, and you'll be just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, while we're on the subject,\" you said springing up. His words slightly made you feel good. But when he started talking about what he did to Craig, you had to take the opportunity while you could. The next question you asked was something you desperately wanted to know. \"How exactly did you do that? I mean, Craig and his goons are the three strongest guys in school. You can't weigh more than 140 pounds! Yet you completely wiped them out without even breaking a sweat. What you did seemed completely impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean smiled smugly and then chuckled. He lifted his hand up to examine his nails. \"Mark, as you'll soon learn, I am adept at many abilities that most human beings consider to be impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got curious again, albeit a bit nervously. \"What do you mean by 'abilities'...and many?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled and turned an eye to you and said, \"Mark, at what point do you plan on realizing that I'm no longer holding the cane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the realization came to you, the hand he was looking at was his right hand. And the cane was on his right side!!! Your eyes got wide. You looked down and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No one was holding the cane!!! The pole was just floating in the air. And it was keeping in pace with Sean as he walked. You shot strait up onto your feet and stood up strait on the cane in complete surprise. You started stuttering. But you couldn't form words no matter what you did; you were at a loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty impressive, ain't it?\" Sean said looking at you again. You stared at him completely bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing that?\" you ask in bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's just a simple trick,\" he said. \"It's one of the easiest things I've ever done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, eh?\" you ask. \"You got, invisible wires strung up around here to hold it up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark at what point do you plan on realizing that you're no longer <i>standing</i> on the cane?\" he said as you saw him twirling the cane in his left hand. It's when you realized that he had swung the cane out from under you with his right and had twirled it around into his left, where he kept twirling it. Your eyes nearly jumped from your skull. That's when you looked down. YOU WEREN'T STANDING ON ANYTHING!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now tell me Mark,\" he began. \"Are there any wires attached to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!\" you yelled. You began flailing your arms trying to grab hold of anything that you could. But you couldn't you seemed to be frozen in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Mark,\" he said. \"I've got you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked bewildered at him. \"You really are doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet your life I am,\" he said. \"As long as I retain my focus, you won't go any higher or lower than that spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to calm a little bit. You began to start moving your arms around like you were swimming, giving yourself a little propulsion forward. You couldn't believe it, you were flying! And no one else was going to believe it, cause there was no one around to see you, not even a janitor. But it was fun. You smiled and laughed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before you realized where Sean was taking you. It wasn't back to any class, it was to the front office. You figured that if you explained what happened to you, you wouldn't get in trouble for missing your classes. Sean had reached the door to the office when you stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Sean!\" you called. He turned. \"Everything; taking on Craig, levitating the cane, making me fly...how did you do it?\" He scoffed for a minute before looking at me with a truly happy expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes got wide again. You couldn't believe anymore. \"What?!\" you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned in forward with a finger over his lips. \"Shhhhhhh.\" He then pulled back and winked at you. When he did, you thought you saw a strange sparkly light shoot out the corner of his eye. He then lifted his cane from underneath you allowing you to land your feet on it. He then opened the door and went into the office. You were quiet for a while. Sean entered the office and saw the woman sitting at the front near the intercom, reading a book. She looked up and saw Sean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sean,\" she said. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Dorris,\" he said working around her desk. \"Don't worry,\" he said, pulling the intercom's microphone away from her and placing it closer to himself. \"Just here to make a special announcement.\" He then lowered his cane onto the counter so you could walk off. He then pressed the button and the intercom buzzed to life with a 'BEEP' and then a 'BOOM'. He spoke into the microphone, \"Would a Miss Julie Letellier please come to the front office?\" However, Sean also pressed down the receiving button. From all over the school came a series of 'boos' and 'hisses' and 'insults'. You felt bad about how because of you, Julie's reputation was also ruined. Sean however pressed the intercom again and yelled, \"<i>Shut the hell up</i>!!!\" That suddenly got everyone quiet. No one had ever said something like that over the intercom. Just imagining the looks on their faces made you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Mr. Ripley stormed out of his office and said, \"Mrs. Sanders, who was it that just made that announcement over the intercom?\" Dorris didn't have a chance to say anything. Ripley saw Sean standing next to the intercom. He rushed toward him pointing his index finger. \"Young man, that intercom is school property and is not for student use, and what you just said over it is grounds for suspens-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too Mr. Ripley,\" Sean said suddenly seizing Mr. Ripley's hand forcing, his pointing finger into an open handshake. \"My name is Sean - nevermind the last name - I'm a new student here.\" Mr. Ripley was suddenly speechless as Sean shook his hand. \"You'll have to forgive the obscenity, Sir. I was just silencing the student's deplorable behavior as you have very well have heard yourself. And you certainly know why. I was merely helping out the fugitive here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Ripley looked down and saw you standing there. \"I understand. They been giving you trouble again, Mark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's much worse than that, sir,\" you said. But then you silently cursed yourself for doing so. You hated ratting on people and now you might've just put yourself in a position that you can't back away from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean son?\" Ripley asked. You looked up at him and were about to come up with some excuse, when suddenly the security guard entered. It was the same cop that chased off Craig an his goons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Ripley,\" he said. \"That Bradley boy and his two friends were here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Ripley said. He then looked down at you. His expression seemed to say that he'd pieced the puzzle together. \"Have you called the police?\" The cop nodded. He explained that they were going to be scouring the county on a man-hunt for Craig. Mr. Ripley looked at you again and asked, \"You alright Mark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a bit shaken up, my body aches a bit, my head hurts a little, but other than that, I'm fine,\" you say. \"Thanks to Sean here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop looked up and recognized Sean. \"Yeah, you were there when they ran away. What were you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off,\" Sean started. \"I want it on the record, that whatever I did was strictly in defense of Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can vouch for that.\" you said. \"He showed up from out of nowhere and he saved me. I really don't want to say this, but if it hadn't been for Sean, I'd be in worse condition than I was when Craig first attacked me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...uh,\" Ripley looked at Sean with a bit of confusion for a moment. \"Well, the boy is a hero then; well done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you, sir,\" Sean said. \"Well, as you've heard from the intercom, I've called the boy's sister up. I suggest calling his mom next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Mr. Ripley said. Something about it seemed weird that he would so easily take the suggestion of a teenage boy. It was almost like he was following an order. He spun around to look at Dorris and said, \"Get the boy's mother on the phone.\" Dorris began dialing. \"Now, I suggest that whatever is said in this office stays in this office. This incident is NOT to get out to the other students. We don't want any more trouble for Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will all due respect sir,\" Sean began. \"It might be too late for that. There was a fourth there; a girl still enrolled here. Apparently she's dating Craig now; she hand-delivered Mark to him. There's a chance that she's spreading rumors around to further bash Mark's reputation. However, I have a feeling that she might be wiser and keep quiet, because any information about what she did leaks out could cause trouble for her; plus if she does tell them anything, Mrs. Letellier can sue her for wrongful prosecution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipley was stunned for a minute. So was I. How did Sean no so much about legality? \"Well, Sean,\" Mr. Ripley began. \"We have to ask that you stay in the office so that way we can get the information about the situation; we'd like to wait until Mrs. Letellier gets here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm perfectly alright with that,\" Sean said. \"I wasn't planning on being anywhere anyway.\" He then lowered his hand down to you. You immediately hopped on, feeling perfectly safe in Sean's hand. He carried you over to the waiting chairs and placed you on the small table next to them. He sat down in one. \"I know you don't like 'squealing' Mark, but believe you me; in this situation, it's going to help. When your mom and sister get here, you don't have to hold back. Since Craig is now outside the school's system, I highly doubt it's going to get you in much trouble here. Besides, I'm pretty sure making that kid go behind bars where he belongs will be a real treat. There's no way we can loose. Just wait and see what happens.\" Sean finished talking and adjusted himself in the seat, and pulled out his pipe again. He merely stuck it between his teeth without lighting it. The things he said really did make you feel good. You decided that you were done playing nice. It was time to make sure that Craig got what was coming to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sean,\" you said. He turned his head slightly to look at you. \"Thank you...for saving my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned in closer and smiled. \"Hey,\" he winked his eye. \"Don't mention it.\" He then sat back up in his chair and took a copy of <u>Jurassic Park</u> from his blazer and began reading. You decided to lay down on the stack of magazines and get comfy. You felt like now, things were starting to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

You all got the email about his rare birth condition so let\u2019s make him feel welcome.\u201d she says. The teacher instructed everyone to watch a video on the board for the class period. 5 minutes into the video, someone in front of Kelly starts to poke fun at your size. \u201cHeh heh. Midget.\u201d He says. \u201cDon\u2019t mind if I slam my fist on you, do you ant?\u201d He says again. You feel vulnerable. Kelly notices. \u201cBack off.\u201d She says to the boy and he turns back to face the board. \u201cHey, sorry Mark. If you want, you can sit in one of my hoop earrings so you can see the video better or you can sit on the bridge of my nose (she laughs a bit at the thought of you on her cute nose).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is your decision?</span></div></div>",

Girls rarely smiled at him, so this was big. Well...everything is big to Mark...but nothing it means a lot to him to be acknowledged by a girl, especial what with it being so easy for people to over look him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COULD I....UM....COULD I RIDE ON YOUR HEAD?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe braced himself. He'd asked his sister that once, and he deeply regretted it. Some girls are touchy about their hair, and most freak out of the thought of <i>anything</i> so much as <i>touching</i> it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Mark,\" her srhill, loud voice echoing down to him. She put her palm down next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, Mark stepped onto her hand and let her lift him up to her head. He climbed out of her fingers and nestled himself next to a big, pink burette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easier to hear me when I'm up here, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...yeah it is, Mark,\" she replied, with her sweet way of talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mark smiled. He was stunned that even before he'd gotten to school he'd made a friend. <i>She's really a nice girl</i>, he though, <i>especially to make me feel welcome and give me a ride.</i> But there was still something that he didn't understand about her. Why was she so....calm? Most people freak when they see a sixteen year old that's only about the size of their pinkey. Not that he'd met many people in his life. He'd been homeschooled up until now and never really got out much. School was no place for a kid like him. You can't put a two inch kid in with a bunch of normal sized kids; its like throwing catnip to a bunch of crazy kittens. But when Mark turned 15, Mom began to wonder. What about high school? High schoolers are pretty mature. Aren't they? Mark would do fine in high school. Besides he needs highschool, so he can be prepared for college. Surely someone will be his friend, and the kids will be understanding of his growing disorder. Somehow Mark's Mom had made up her mind: Mark was going to high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So far, Mark was at ease. Everything was going much better than he'd thought. But, still why did Laura act like his size is no big deal? <i>Maybe she's a lives in neighborhood. Moms always making sure to talk with the neighbors, so maybe she told her about me...</i> he thought. But then an uncomforting thought came to mind. <i>What if Laura's only being nice because she feels bad for me?</i> he thought, <i>After all, she has good reason to....I mean I never knew my dad...I'm as short as a toothpick...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would make her a care taker, not a real friend, and Mark wanted a friend not someone to \"take care of him\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura?\" he inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" she replys politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
