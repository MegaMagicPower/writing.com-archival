He hadn't been there in quite a while but was glad to be going back. It was the night of the big Show Choir show where they were showcasing numbers from the musical High Fidelity. Tonight was a big deal to a lot of Sam's friends who were in the show choir so he was very happy when musical director, Anna called him and said that they needed his help. He arrived backstage, waved to a few of his friends before finally spotting Anna. She was beautiful, all made up for the evenings performance, but her and Sam had a troubled history that he'd rather not remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Anna, what's up?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god you're here Sam! Something dreadful has happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna rushed over to Sam and grabbed his arm, dragging him to a back room. In the room sat Sara, Sam wasn't too fond of Sara, she'd always freaked him out a tad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lydia is ill Sam\" Anna said bluntly.<br>\r\n\"Ok?\" Sam replied, a little confused by what was going on.<br>\r\n\"She's the star of tonight's show and we need someone to fill in for her and your the only person who isn't already in the show who is covered by our insurance! We need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was taken aback by this, he'd left show choir the previous week as the work seemed to much for him. He looked at Sara who just nodded at him as if to agree with Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Lydia is a girl! I can't sing soprano.\"<br>\r\n\"No, but someone using Lydia's body can.\" Sara said looking at Sam intensely. \"I have acquired a small amount of magical talent in my time Sam, I have the power to swap your body with Lydia's.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous, is this why you called me back here? Get a life you two.\"<br>\r\nYou begin to leave whilst Sara quickly mutters something under her breath and yells \"WAIT!\" Anna then hands you a mirror. \"Take a look.\" You look in the mirror and see Lydia's face staring back at you! You throw the mirror in Shock but Anna catches it. <br>\r\n\"What have you done?!\" you cry reaching for your face.<br>\r\n\"Nothing\u2026 yet, that was a small taster of what my power can do.\" Sara said.<br>\r\n\"Come on Sam! You know all the dances, all the songs. It's just for one night please help us.\" Anna pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat still for a moment. What should you do?</span></div></div>",

As a uni student he'd drunk much worse. And suddenly\u2026 nothing happened. You just sat there.<br>\r\n\"When does this start?\" you ask instantly covering your mouth. It wasn't your usual tenor voice that came out, instead it was Lydia's sweet soft voice with a slight lisp. Suddenly your mouth felt different! The teeth had changed, Lydia's teeth were larger than yours. You looked down to see two breasts perking up beneath your t-shirt and felt long hair fall down your back. Suddenly you yelp as a sharp pain hits you in the groinal area, as your new lady bits took form. The pain was too much and you blacked out for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke you were lying on the floor in Lydia Shaw's body. Anna and Sara looking over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to get get you read for the show\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat first?</span></div></div>",

Sara grabbed him and said , \" You will have plenty of time after the show to get know your body! \" . Her words brought Sam back to reality, he immediately remembered why he was here. Sara then said that Sam should face a blank wall and not look down. Sara began taking his underwear off and he could feel the cold air touching his delicate genitals. Sara then told him to put his feet in the leotard. He stepped into it and she pulled the leotard up on to him. It had a nice tight fit which showed Lydia's figure off. \" It have a great fit. I have to be somewhere else...\" , Sara said walking away. She left Sam alone.</span></div></div>",

After several minutes and several more squirms you are finished with the ordeal and begin to put on the clothes in front of you. You pull up the short shorts up, trying to ignore the muscular, tanned and hairless legs that you now possess. You try to ignore the fact that now these shorts undoubtedly making your new rear end look fantastic, as you remembered watching the girls before in their pre performance routine. Next comes the jersey as you place your arms through it and pull it over your head, pulling your ponytail out of your shirt and let it flop freely for a moment on your back. <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://gordonkeith.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/ponytail.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://gordonkeith.files.wordpress.com/2...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look into the mirror in front of you and make a face, just to make sure this is really happening. <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.heyuguys.co.uk/images/2011/06/Anna-Kendrick.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.heyuguys.co.uk/images/2011/06...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough it is.

He groaned, but it was with her voice making him move his new dainty hand to cover his new lips.<br>\r\nAnna lent over and whispered in his ear \"You look great Lydia.\" She then stood up and shouted \"GUYS, Lydia's here after all, but she needs our help to get ready!
