As they ate, Ron showed Harry his new pet rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brother, Fred showed me a spell to turn him yellow\" Ron pointed out \"want to see?\"<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ron took out his wand, a girl appeared at the doorway of their compartment. The girl had bushy brown hair and a superior expression. She was already wearing her Hogwarts robes over a skirt and top. She seemed not be paying any attention to the boys themselves, at first for her first question was one she appeared to be asking everybody she met. \"Has anybody seen a toad?\" she asked \"a boy called Neville has lost one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Ron answered for himself and Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that the girl seemed to notice Ron, and his and.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you doing magic?\" she asked him \"let's see then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout being asked, she walked into their compartment and sat down next to Ron, opposite Harry. Harry got a view of her knees sticking out of her skirt and her legs dangling over the edge of the chair as she sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sunshine daisies, butter mellow. Turn this stupid fat rat yellow.\" Ron waved his wand around as though he expected something to come from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione wasn't impressed.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that's a real spell? Well it's not very good, is it? I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they all worked for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at Harry and noticed that his glasses ere damaged. She raised her wand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ocular reparo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's glasses fixed themselves, and he noticed that his eyesight had improved. He brushed his hair aside as though to get a better look at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she saw his scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cricket!\" she declared \"you're Harry Potter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Harry agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me introduce myself\" she advised him as she stood up from her chair and started walking towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry raised his hand, thinking the girl would shake it and give her name. Wasn't that how people normally introduced themselves?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushed his hand aside, as she turned so that her back as towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't be necessary\" she informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she sat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl sat upon the seat that Harry was already occupying, and upon Harry himself. He felt her weight suddenly bearing down upon him, her warm body, her nearness. He couldn't see much else as her back pressed against him, blocking his view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Hermione Granger\" she finally gave her name as she relaxed and allowed her full weight to claim the boy beneath her.</span></div></div>",

Ron was also in the group but ever since Hermione had joined them on the train, he had been keeping his distance from Harry. He didn't want the girl to get bored with Harry and start picking on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was not bored with Harry, not in the slightest. She was busy thinking, feeling it was time for Harry to resume his place beneath her but not entirely sure if she'd be able to pull it off yet or if she'd have to wait until after the sorting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students were brought to the front of the Great Hall, in front of groups of older students who were sat at the four house tables. Before them stood a wooden stool and an old hat. Some of the people in line understood the significance of the hat, but others did not. Those that didn't were surprised hen a rim opened in the hat and it started to sing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the hat had completed its song and everyone applauded, Professor McGonagall who had escorted them into the hall took out a sheet of parchment. \"When I call your name\" she instructed \"you will come forward and sit on the stool. I will place the sorting hat on your head and it will probe your mind and tell you which house is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then started down the list of names, in alphabetical order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abbott, Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hannah Abbott was being sorted, Hermione considered her options. How was she going to get Harry onto the chair, to sit on him when the time came? How would she get that stern old witch to approve? Curiously, she thought the secret lay in pursuading the hat itself to go along with her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students continued to be sorted, until eventually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granger, Hermione\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione came forward alone and sat on the stool. Harry watched her. He recalled that she had sat on him on the train, but now she was alone on the stool. He had no way to know that she planned to correct that oversight, as she saw it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a keen and agile mind, I see\" the hat began \"Rowena would like that, also a strong sense of decency and ethics that would suit you well for Gryffindor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sort me yet\" Hermione requested, looking over at Harry who was still stood in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have designs on that boy\" the hat remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have sat on him already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he is the most comfortable seat I ever knew\" she purred her thought \"a girl should be comfortable when she is sorted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I grant your request?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's him or you\" Hermione sent back \"either you let me sit on Harry during the sorting, or I'll sit on you instead. You'll struggle to announce people's houses after I turn you into a frizbee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your point\" the hat concurred \"very well, hand me to Professor McGonagall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione lifted the hat from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have not yet been sorted\" McGonagall informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hat wants to speak with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well\" the woman snorted, clearly not happy that the sorting had been interrupted \"hand it over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione did so and McGonagall placed the sorting hat on her own head. Hermione could hear the professor speaking out loud a she addressed the hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Are you serious.\"<br>\r\n\"It's somewhat unauthodox.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed the hat back to Hermione, who hadn't heard the full discussion but it seemed that the aged professor was going to go along with her plan.<br>\r\nAs she placed the hat back on her own head, she heard the woman call out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potter, Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry came forward, a stunned look on his face.<br>\r\n\"It's not my turn yet\" he pointed out \"she hasn't been sorted yet.\"<br>\r\n\"I have a name\" Hermione advised him \"I doubt you have forgotten it already.\"<br>\r\n \"Miss Granger desires your aid, Potter\" McGonagall informed him.<br>\r\n\"What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something wrong with my seat\" Hermione informed him.<br>\r\n\"It looks okay to me.\"<br>\r\n\"It doesn't feel right, I think there is something missing.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n\"Could you try it for me?\"<br>\r\n\"You are occupying it.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't state the obvious, Harry/\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione lifted herself off the chair, slightly - enough for Harry to just about get into place under her. She hovered over the stool, using one hand to keep herself in place.<br>\r\n\"You aren't giving me much room.\"<br>\r\n\"You'll have to cope, you aren't getting any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sighed and started edging onto the seat. It required a lot of shuffling for Harry had virtually no room at all. Hermione's butt was so close to him that he rubbed against her every time he moved. Hermione smiled whenever he did, she was enjoying feeling him shift into place under there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you in place?\" she asked, when she felt no more motion from the boy.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n\"Is the chair comfortable?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess, as comfrtable as you can expect a wooden stool to be.\"<br>\r\n\"My seat isn't made out of wood\" she pointed out \"not any more.\"<br>\r\nHermione settled back into place, seating herself on the boy who suddenly found himself buried beneath her once more.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, that is far more comfortable\" she approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sent her thought to the hat. \"Take your time sorting me\" she advised \"I didn't sit on Harry for very long on the train, this time I plan to stay a while.\"<br>\r\n\"How long do you require?\"<br>\r\n\"What is the record for the longest ever hatstall?\"<br>\r\n\"42 minutes.\"<br>\r\n\"Let's break that record, I don't think an hour is too much to ask for.\"<br>\r\n\"People are likely to get bored.\"<br>\r\n\"Not the girls, I think they'll be entertained. The boys don't really matter.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Those responsible (except for Harry) had been severely reprimanded by Mrs Weasley and now the family were all sitting down for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind, there was the sound of footsteps, followed by a girl's voice, asking her mother if she had seen a certain article of clothing.<br>\r\nMrs Weasley was just giving her response when the red haired girl caught sight of their new guest. Smiling to herself, she drew out her new wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry suddenly felt his body being held firmly against the chair, which slid back from the table a couple of feet. Smiling broadly now, the girl walked up to the table and stood in front of Harry. Harry could see her long, red hair hanging loosely down her back, and her young, feminine body in front of him. He was still trapped against the seat, even his arms were pinned to his sides. He could not move. He watched the girl, wondering what she was going to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had to admit she was a beautiful girl, with a strong, firm, body and wonderfully proportioned rear. His eyes were drawn to her butt, and whether the girl was aware of this or not, she didn't seem to pay any attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you joining us for breakfast, Ginny dear?\" her mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Ginny smiled, and she sat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on the chair that Harry was already occupying, as though he wasn't even there, as though she didn't know that she had just pinned him to it precisely for this purpose. Of course she knew. Ginny always knew what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt her full weight suddenly bearing down upon him, sitting on him, using him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny continued not to pay any attention to him at all as she started to fill her (formally his) plate with foodstuffs.</span></div></div>",

That evening, Hermione waits for everyone to go to bed and sleep. She reads a book of spells to keep her busy until then. She is on her bed, in her pyjamas, barefoot, and her flats are at the bottom of her bed. She slowly turns the pages of the book so she can hear if everyone is asleep. After a few minutes, she realizes that everyone is asleep, so it's time for her to take action. She then closes her book, gets out of bed, then grabs one of her shoes, she holds her wand in her left hand. Stupid Harry! She says in a whisper, He sleeps peacefully but doesn't stop himself from waking everyone up when he screams, I'll take care of him!
