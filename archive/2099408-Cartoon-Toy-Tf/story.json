I wasn't sure about it when you suggested we make a 'Plush-Machine,' I wasn't sure about it, but you've got quite the silver tongue, eh?\" Phineas said. Upon hearing Phineas, Ferb just smugly shrugged his shoulders, staying quiet like he usually does. Like Phineas said, the two were building a Plush-Machine, originally intending to create a plush of their very own Perry. Maybe they could both have their own Perry at night, maybe Perry could have his own plush friend... no matter what they decided on, they were gonna make a Perry plush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device took ordinary rubble, put it on a conveyor belt, and turned it into a random plush logged into the system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though, in retrospect, making the computer select a random person <i>may</i> not've been our best idea,\" Phineas said, chuckling towards the end of the sentence. Ferb, again, shrugged. After twisting one last screw, Phineas was sure it was ready. \"Alright, let's give this thing a test drive!\" Phineas grabbed a bit of rubble, and threw it onto the conveyer belt. Unfortunately, he wound up carried off with the force of his swing. He tossed himself onto the conveyer belt and into the machine. Ferb panicked and leapt after him, trying to catch him. The machine, unfortunately, recognized the two as objects for the Plush-Machine, and selected two characters to plushify. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine chose to turn Phineas into a Phineas plush, and turn Ferb into a Ferb plush. The two are then deposited outside the machine, in their new plush forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was quite convenient how that machine turned us into us, huh Ferb?\" Phineas said. Unfortunately, his voice couldn't escape his body. Suddenly, the gate fence opens, and in comes Buford! He walks over to the machine and...</span></div></div>",

Ferb?\" He finally noticed the machine. He walks over to it, unfortunately walking right towards the two plushies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buford? Buford!\" Phineas and Ferb looked on in fear as Buford's shoes stomped dangerously close to them. Then, the two smash right on top of them. \"Ugh...\" Phineas groaned. Unfortunately, the impact got there arms caught in his TUFF SHOELACES, so they were carried along as he continued walking. They're thrashed about, banged against the soil and occasionally wedged under the shoes again as Buford paces around the machine, wondering what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Phineas and Ferb were here, they'd know what the heck this thing is...\"</span></div></div>",

He pulled Phineas up to his mouth, opening it up wide. \"Ahhhhhh,\" he said as he pulled him up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! NO! BUFORD!\" Phineas tried to shout. But it was for not. Buford stuffed the stuffed toy into his mouth, and tried to chew on it. But his teeth had no effect on the fabric skin of the toy. Not that it made things any more pleasant for Phineas. He decided it was probably some sort of swallow only candy. Phineas stared on in horror as he was brought to Buford's throat. He's pulled down the slimy esophagus, squeezed through the warm tube, and deposited into his warm gullet. \"Well, this is unusual,\" Phineas remarked. Eventually, Ferb was plopped onto Phineas, who recoiled in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ferb. Did you see that?\" Phineas started. Ferb still couldn't hear him. \"I could move right there.

After few manipulations, they get out of the machine as plushes of themselves<br>\r\n\"Well now we know that the machine works\" says Phineas laughing but nothing comes out of his mouth, he tries to get up but his fluffy corpse won't move. As they realize that they are stuck like that, they hear someone at their fence<br>\r\n\"Hi Phineas, hi Ferb, this is weird, I heatd them not so long ago\" says Irving visibly disappointed to miss them, he started to leave when he noticed the plushes \"Oh what's that\" he enters in the garden and comes closer to them <br>\r\n\"They are Phineas and Ferb plushes, awesome\" he exclaims as he seizes them \"they probably made them with that machine so they won't mind if I borrow those two\" he says as he leaves the garden and runs to his house. Phineas and Ferb are really worried about what will happen.<br>\r\nWhen Irving arrives in his room, he puts the plushes on his bed, Phineas notices that the room is full with photos of them, it makes him uncomfortable.<br>\r\n\"I have a lot to do today but tonight I will take care of you\" he says visibly excited. The brothers don't want to know what he means by \"take care\" but they don't want to know, they really need to go away or at least aware Irving that they aren't plushes, so they try their best to move and talk.</span></div></div>",

What the heck is going on?\", Gwen mentally cried. She looked around, but found herself unable to move her head. Here eyes darted across the room, hoping  to find a mirror or something.

Lola, of course, was a bunny just like her friend bugs who had an<br>\r\n apparent crush on her. Unlike her, friend her fur was a light tan except for her<br>\r\n cheeks,chest,belly and of course the underside of both her tail and feet which were a<br>\r\n brilliant shade of white. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n A smile crosses her face as she admires her own beauty in the mirror, it was no wonder she<br>\r\n had her male counterpart drooling at the look at her.

A moment passes before she saw bugs running past her, A male rabbit<br>\r\n with gray and white fur. She says his eyes widen and literally turn into hearts he ran by<br>\r\n her only to stop next to her. \"Heya Lola, um how are you doing today,\" he says<br>\r\n clearing his through while comedic drops or sweat form on his brow.

However, instead of leaving a powder on his face, it releases a wave of energy<br>\r\n throughout the area. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n The trees and ground slowly start to shine like they were suddenly made out of some sort<br>\r\n of plastic. Looking around Lola shrieks when she's her back turn rigged a develop a<br>\r\n stiff plastic texture. Her horror terror grew as the plastic slowly crept over this rest<br>\r\n of her body making her form more rigid and shiny. Gone was her fluffy texture of her fur<br>\r\n replaced with the hard smooth texture of plastic, not unlike the kind you see on a barbie<br>\r\n doll or certain action figures.

Although he can't move anything he can feel the denim of blue jeans pressing up against his face and front. As Max walks, this becomes really itchy. Against his back he feels the cotton of some underwear, but it feels a little thick. Realizing that they aren't regular underwear, but cloth training pants with extra padding. Milo dreads to think it, but the thought can't escape him, what would happen if Max has an accident?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilo tries to put the thought out of his mind and concentrate on how to get himself out of this predicament.

I've got to get out of this situation before that happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the thought crosses Milo's mind, he sees Max take out a pink marker. Suddenly, it starts to tickle as Max begins writing on him. First, something is drawn on the face, but you can't quite tell what. Then being flipped over, everything goes dark again, but Milo feels something tickling his back. He is giggling in his mind, but no noise is coming out. Finally it stops, but not before Milo worries if this will be permanent if he can find his way out of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thewe,\" Max cries out as his hand closes around the plush doll. \"Now you will be mine forever.\" Holding the doll up to the mirror, he asks, \"Does that look wook better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, Milo is shocked to see that on his face he now has bright pink glasses and streaks of pink in the hair. Being spun around Milo sees that across his bottom is the word Max, written like any 4 year old would write it. He is left speechless as he tries to process everything that has happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Milo processes this he suddenly feels himself flying through the air and landing on a bunch of action figures. Pain courses through Milo's mind as action hero hands, arms, and weapons poke and prod him all over the place. As the pain starts to subside Milo is yanked up and starts to be hit in the belly by an action hero of Thor. Trying to fight back, Milo realizes it is useless and resigns himself to the fate of this until he gets some time to think through what he needs to do to get out of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 45 minutes of flying, crashing, destroying blocks and Legos, and being hit over and over Milo hears his saving grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maxie, it's time for dinner, why don't you come on down!\" His mom shouts from down stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax leaps to his feet and runs to the door to Milo's joy.

Looking up, he sees Max reaching down and wrapping his hand around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you need dinner too if you are going to fight off these bad guys.\" Says Max. He picks Milo up and stuffs him down the back of his pants, knowing mommy will never let him bring a toy to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the pitch black, Milo gasps for air as he feels Max move each step and lurches from side to side. Just when he thought things couldn't get any worse, Max's full weight goes down on top of him, leaving him gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Milo feels something else not at all pleasant....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At 4 years old, there is no reason to have messy pants.\" She scolds, as Milo realizes it is his mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing this might be his chance, Milo again focuses on trying to move. This time he focuses on his right leg. He suddenly feels a twitch and moves his eyes down. He tries again and this time sees his right leg twitch. Realizing he might be able to move, he puts one final effort in to moving the leg. His knee bends as he looks on.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">*I will give 3,000 gps or a add to a story you would like to see get added to for the first 20 new chapter add ons. If Interested pm me and I will explain to you the rules on this.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJourney to the worlds of some of your favorite cartoon characters and see if they can last as toys. That's right folks due to one circumstance or another, your choosing, a character or characters from a show of your choosing get turned into toys and must survive their new owners. They can turn into anything from  simple stuffed version of themselves to a thing of silly putty. You decide who it happens to, what toy they get turned into, who their new owner is, and why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Once they are turned into a toy they stay that toy, no switching toys cause you don't like the choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. If they turn back to their normal selves then that is the end, so don't try to use that as a means to get past rule 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Toys should be no taller then a cabbage patch kid, no giant toys<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. They physically can't talk but they can hear, smell, taste, and even feel everything. They can move but they have to relearn how, so no miraculous getting up and sprinting like all hell sort of thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. They cannot die unless their toy form is completely destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Fetishes are allowed, if you want their new owner to swallow his new \"Toy\" by all means go for it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. The character or characters you pick at the start are the only ones who can become toys, if you would like to have another character also get turned into a toy ask me first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Story must follow the character, or at least on of the characters, that gets turned into a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun</td>",
