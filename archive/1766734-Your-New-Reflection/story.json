Your reflection did the same - the air hostesses face also wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to when your phone camera didn't show the difference, you pulled it out and turned it on. Sure enough, your camera showed that you were the air hostess in reflection.<br>\r\n<i>'I must have accidentally swapped back with her when I last got out...'</i> You theorized.

While you pulled your shirt off, your reflection unbuttoned her uniform and blouse.<br>\r\n<i>'Clearly you can't just pull off that uniform'</i> You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent the next hour or so poking the different parts of your body and seeing how your reflection reacted to it. The most surprising part was when you pulled your 'beret' off your head and put it on the sink counter. You didn't have one on yourself, but your reflection seemed to understand the gesture at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was your hair. While your own hair was short, your reflections was tied up in a bun. You ran your hands through your hair, the bun coming undone and spilling out down your shoulders. While you might have been caressing air, your reflection was running her hands through her air. And yet, for some reason, you were really enjoying yourself. Almost too much...</span></div></div>",

Doubtful.

Either way, she looked cute with her brown hair tied up like that and her green eyes. You once again opted for swapping your reflection but decided against it due to the number of reflective surfaces around here which would probably make her panic. And panic was the last thing you wanted here.

She had shoulder length brown hair had a slender figure. Next your attention turns to the high school aged girl opposite you who was busy texting on her phone. She had bleached blonde hair and was dressed in a skimpy rainbow tank top and a bait of short jean shorts. Your attention is then diverted to a hispanic looking college aged woman who just tripped while disembarking one of the nearby aircraft. Hew clothes were far more conservative than the high school girl though she obviously still was interested in showing off her splendid assets. As she walked past you, she smiled at you with a perfect white smile before walking off, her long black hair reaching down to almost to her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then check your watch, seeing that your flight is now running more than 1 hour late in departing. You then look up again and continue your bored overlooking of the people in the immediate vicinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person you look at is a tall, buff looking male security guard who is busy breaking up an argument between a pair of women passengers. From your angle you can only see one of the two arguing passengers and see that they are a wavy haired, big breasted blonde who's fancy clothes convince you that she likely has money. Rushing over to the scene is someone who looks like they must be the woman's husband. He is dressed in a nice suit and was carrying a briefcase. The way the woman you guessed to be his wife reacted to him you got the feeling the argument must have had something to do with him. By the way the man reared to the woman you realized that he was definitely not the dominant in their relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit longer the intercom comes on and you are told you can board the plane.

After the first time you completely undress the reflection will be wearing equivalent clothes to what you put on [if you put on a top(shirt), the reflection will put on a top (maybe a shirt or maybe a tank top\u2026)]. This will even hold true for when there are definite gender differences in clothing [if you don't put on an undershirt, a female reflection will not be wearing a bra]. For haircuts and other obvious differences, your reflection will get/ be holding or wearing stuff similar to what the person whose reflection it is would be doing/holding/getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhotos taken of you will still show your regular body and clothes (though still show your alternate reflection.
