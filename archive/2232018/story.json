Its a beautiful Thursday afternoon so she decides to walk home, as the short blonde walks through the outskirts of town she comes across a newer shop that has a lot of random things up in the store front window with the name of the store writen across the top. \" 'New things, old you' that sounds fun, I could check it out I do need some new hair clips they should have something cute.\" The short blonde 16 teen year old says to herself as she walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk behind the counter heard the bell and looked up from her phone to see a young short haired blonde girl who looked not much older than 12, dressed in a simple pink tee shirt, small black gym shorts, pink socks and matching pink sneakers. The girl was obviously wearing a bra but wasn't holding much on the almost flat chested girl. <br>\r\nThe clerk stood up from her stool and watched the customer look at different cutesy hair clips before walking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello little girl can I help you with anything?\"<br>\r\nSarah looked up at a tall, thin, busty, long haired brunette and paused for a minute before giggling a little. <br>\r\n\"No I'm ok I might get a few hair clips though, this short bob cut looks cute but can be a pain when in varsity sports.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Varsity? But your surely not old enough for that. You look like a middle schooler.\" The clerk says kneeling down to the small girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggles. \"Its ok I get that a lot, I'm actually 16. My name is Sarah Miles I go to the high school up the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry honey! You just look so... little... sorry if thats insulting. My name is Mya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha no no its all good! I'm well aware that I could pass as a preteen and it doesn't bother me, I fact some times I don't mind it. People are alot nicer to a polite kid than a polite teenager hehe he. Its nice to meet you Mya, this shop is so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you honey, its good to see you embrace your childish looks. Is there anything I can help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah walks through the store with Mya until she points out something almost like a small child would a new toy. Mya smiles knowing this would be an exciting sale. Mya rings up her new tiny friends purchase and they exchanged goodbyes.

She had to think quick, hopping to her feet Melody ran to her closet and closed the door but as she headed back the class started. Melody ran as fast as she could back to her chair but the damage was done! Some of the class was giggling seeing the whole thing especially her soaked diaper swinging and sagging as she ran!<br>\r\nMelody started to blush and cry, a few private messages were sent to her calling her a baby, saying goo goo gaa gaa, but what sent Melody into hysterics was her teacher sending her a message while claiming down the class if she needed to be excused for a diaper change!<br>\r\nMelody lost in and cried out loud.</span></div></div>",
