            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The story begins in home of Matthew\u2019s family. The twenty-year-old is alone, since his parents had won a trip to another state for a week. Matt was laying on his bed, relaxing in the silence. It wasn\u2019t going to last\u2026Matt knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d Matt looked at his watch. The second hand slowly ticked by. \u201cThree\u2026two\u2026one\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ding Dong*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight on cue.\u201d Matt muttered as he hopped out of bed and scratched his dirty blond hair. He made his way out of his room, down the stairs into the living room, and to the front door. He unlocked the door and opened it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBIG BROTHER!!!\u201d Zach shouted as he jumped through the doorway and tackled Matt. If the older boy hadn\u2019t been expecting it, he would have been on the ground right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, little bro.\u201d Matt said as Zach hugged him. \u201cHow was your last day of school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. I\u2019m so glad summer vacation\u2019s here!\u201d exclaimed the sixteen-year-old. The teen\u2019s childish tone of voice made Matt chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna head up to my room?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! I want to tell you about all the things I have planned for the summer! We\u2019re going to have a blast!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Zach both made their way away from the door and back up to Matt\u2019s room. The two of them weren\u2019t really brothers, but they were so close that they thought of each other as that. They also had  a lot in common, more than even normal brothers. They both liked the same kind of anime and played the same video games. Sometimes, Zack would come over Matt\u2019s house just so they could watch anime to together or play his newest game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had reached Matt\u2019s bedroom, Zach took his usual spot on the bed while Matt sat down at his computer desk. Zach was about to start explaining his plans when he glanced at the computer remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Matt, have you added to my interactive yet?\u201d Zach asked, speaking of his newest macro story on writing.com. That was another thing about the two; they were both macrophiles who loved adding to each other\u2019s stories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe new anime one? No, not yet. I\u2019ll do that right now, okay?\u201d Matt replied, spinning his computer chair so he was facing his laptop. As Matt got to work, Zach started telling his big brother about all the things he had planned for the summer. The teen stood up as he talked and wandered around the room. He liked looking at all the interesting stuff Matt had; a rapier on the wall, a wooden staff from Jamaica, a model battleship the two of them had made years ago, and even his pet lizard named Scorch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026and we defiantly have to go to the beach this year! I really want to\u2026\u201d Zach trailed off when he spotted a strange golden box on top of the dresser. \u201cHey, what\u2019s this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked up from his writing and said, \u201cThat box? I bought it at an antique store yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach took the box off the dresser and slowly opened it. Inside was a small gray shard about he size of his thumb. The teenaged boy took the strange piece of rock out of the box and examined it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid this come with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. The owner probably left it in there or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018what does it do\u2019?\u201d It\u2019s a rock, Zach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a magic rock that shrinks people!\u201d Zach joked, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been reading too many stories. Speaking of which, I\u2019m finished.\u201d  Matt pressed the enter key on the keyboard, successfully posting the new chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me see!\u201d Zach said as he rushed toward the computer. Before he could reach it, he accidentally tripped over Matt\u2019s fan and fell onto the carpet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! Zach, are you alright?!\u201d Matt asked, hoping his brother hadn\u2019t harmed himself in anyway. Before the older boy could get up off the chair, he heard something hit his wall and shatter. The shard had slipped out of Zach\u2019s hand when he fell and hit the back wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! Sorry, big brother!!\u201d Zach apologized as he started picking himself off the floor. Just as he got onto one knee, a sudden light appeared out of nowhere. The broken rock had been shattered into pieces and was somehow releasing this brilliant light. Both brothers shielded their eyes, unable to look at the light. The whiteness quickly filled the room and consumed the two friends\u2026</span></div></div>",

The sixteen-year-old sat up and rubbed his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat just happened, big brother?\u201d Zach asked as he looked over at the computer chair\u2026and saw a giant foot! \u201cAHH!!\u201d Zach leaped back in shock as his eyes trailed up the leg and torso until he saw the sleeping face of Matt. He was gigantic\u2026everything was gigantic! That must mean\u2026 \u201cHoly crap! That rock really does shrink people!\u201d Zach exclaimed as he examined himself. Instead of being scared or worried, the boy smiled happily. \u201cThis is awesome! I can\u2019t wait to see the look on Matty\u2019s face when he sees me like this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he said this, he heard the sounds of Matt\u2019s groans as he stirred awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026Zach, are you okay?\u201d Matt muttered as he held his throbbing head. That light hadn\u2019t just blinded him; it knocked him out! When Matt didn\u2019t get an answer, he looked over to where Zach should have been, but saw nothing but his empty room. \u201cZach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt\u2019s little friend watched as he stood up from the chair and started walking toward him. At first he thought it was because Matt had seen him, but the giant boy wasn\u2019t looking down at him! It suddenly dawned on Zach that his big bro might step on him without knowing! These fears became all the more real when the sounds of Matt\u2019s socked feet stomping toward him got louder and louder\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Big brother, don\u2019t step on me!\u201d Zach cried, but his bro couldn\u2019t hear him. \u201cI\u2019m down here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it became apparent that Matt couldn\u2019t hear him and wasn\u2019t stopping, Zach decided it was time to move and quickly ran to avoid his brother\u2019s giant feet. He managed to get out of the way just as a shadow loomed over him and one of Matt\u2019s feet crashed down where he was once standing. The gust of air created from the impact blew Zach off his feet and sent him flying forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw\u2026maybe this isn\u2019t as awesome as I thought\u2026\u201d Zach said to himself as he rubbed his arm. Meanwhile, Matt unknowingly almost stepped on his close friend and made his way to his door. He opened it and stuck his head into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle bro!! You here?!\u201d he yelled into the house, hoping for some response. When he didn\u2019t get anything of the sort, Matt closed the door again and placed his hands on his hips. \u201cMaybe he went home? I\u2019ll try emailing him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned around and started stomping back over to the computer. Once again, Zach was right in his path and in danger of being squashed under those huge feet. Instead of getting out of his way immediately, the high schooler waved his arms franticly and shouted at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m right here, big brother!! Look down!! Please!!\u201d Zach shouts, hoping his voice wasn\u2019t drowned out by the sound of the socked feet slapping against the floor. He thought this whole shrinking thing was cool, but he didn\u2019t want to end up a red stain on his bro\u2019s socks!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Matt made his way to his computer he heard a faint voice. At first he thought he was hearing things, but then it happened again. It sounded like someone was whispering his name. Matt, puzzled, glanced around his room a bit before his eyes fell down to his feet. There, directly in front of him, was some kind of small creature. Matt squatted down to get a closer look and his eyes almost popped out f his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZ-Zach?!\u201d Matt cried, not believing what he was seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOww! Not so loud, big brother!\u201d Zach shouted a she covered his ears. Matt\u2019s voice was so unbelievably loud to him. Matt quietly apologized before he gently scooped Zach into his palm and sat down on his bed. He brought his tiny friend up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow in the world did this happen?\u201d Matt asks, still shocked that he\u2019s hold his best friend in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must have been that rock I broke!\u201d Zach exclaimed, motioning over to the box that once contained the rock. \u201cI told you it shrinks people!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is unbelievable\u2026we need to get you back to normal. Lets go the that antique store right now and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Zach shouted, cutting his older friend off. \u201cWhy do we have to do that so soon? I\u2019m not in danger now that you\u2019ve found me, and it\u2019s really awesome at this size!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZach\u2026.do you hear what you\u2019re saying? You can\u2019t stay like this! It\u2019s dangerous like that, not fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can be fun! Put me on the floor and I\u2019ll show you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No! What if I lose\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t put me down I\u2019m going to jump onto your pants and climb down!\u201d the high school student warned, cutting his bro off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d Matt says, not wanting his friend to accidentally hurt himself. Zach balances himself on his brother\u2019s palm as it slowly descends to the rugged floor. Once it\u2019s low enough, he jumps off and immediately races for Matt\u2019s left foot. Before Matt can even notice, Zach leaps against his brother\u2019s cotton-covered foot and burrows his face into the fabric. Matt almost gapes as he watches Zach take deep breaths of his sweaty socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026Zach\u2026what are you doing?\u201d Matt asks. He is so surprised by his brother\u2019s actions that those are the only words he can muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it look like I\u2019m doing?\u201d he replies, taking his face out of the sock. His youthful face is covered with sock lint, but it doesn\u2019t seem to bother him. \u201cI\u2019m doing exactly the thing we always write about! Your feet smell terrible, by the way. \u201c Despite his words, Zach pushes his face back into the sock to get another smell. He seems to like the terrible odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZach\u2026this isn\u2019t a story.\u201d Matt says, trying to talk some sense into his friend. Instead of listening to his elder bro, Zach grabs handfuls of the sock and begins to pull with all his strength. Despite his size, Matt can feel his sock slowly inching off his foot. At this rate it\u2019ll take all day to come off, however, and something inside Matt makes him reach down and tug the garment right off. Once the bare foot is exposed, Zach dives between two of Matt\u2019s toes and starts snorting up the toe jam. The giant Matt gasps in surprise as he feels the odd sensation between his toes. \u201cAren\u2019t you going a bit far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d asks Zach\u2019s muffled voice. Whether he heard him or not, Matt defiantly feels when Zach starts lapping up the toe gunk. He gasps again and bites his lip. He didn\u2019t want to say it out loud, but it DID feel kind of good\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Matt was trying to decide whether he liked this or not, he suddenly looked down to find Zach gone. He looks around the floor thinking Zach had run off, but is corrected when he feels something wet brush against his sole. Zach had crawled underneath his foot and started licking his sole! Matt pivots his foot onto his heel and spots his brother lying on his back. The hyper boy is soon back on his feet and hugging the giant foot. Matt feels him start to lick again and shudders at the feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZach\u2026we should really get you some help\u2026\u201d Matt mutters weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a while longer! Please!\u201d Zach begs as he snuggles up against Matt\u2019s foot. The twenty-year-old just stares down at the shrunken boy for a moment before making a decision. </span></div></div>",

They both walked around stupidly, rubbing their eyes trying to clear away the spots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually both boys' vision cleared and they found each other and hugged. That was when Matt noticed something....odd. \"Um...Little bro? Why aren't we in my room anymore?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys broke their hug and looked around, it was true. They were outside now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa....Check this out!\" Zach said as he stooped down near Matt's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Matt stooped down too and saw what he had been standing on. He gasped, \"No...way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Matt had been stepping on was his own house, only....it was really tiny! Tiny enough to be crunched under both boys' feet like a cheap dollhouse! Matt and Zach looked at each other, then looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, everything else was tiny too! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big brother, I think we.....I think we grew!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...either that or everything else is just really small!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what should we do big brother?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt put a hand on his chin and thought, absentmindedly tapping his sneaker on the ground below, making a mini earthquake for the people in their houses and anyone else nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt felt something heavy ram into the side of his foot, causing him to jerk out of his thoughts. He looked down irritably at the thing and saw it was one of those vans soccer moms are so fond of. The fat woman inside even had the nerve to honk at him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt glared down at the car, and without moving his giant foot, picked it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach watched his brother with intrigue as he emptied out the car of its occupants. Which included the fat woman, and her two kids, into his palm. Zach came over and looked down at the shouting woman and the terrified children. Matt rolled his eyes, getting more annoyed by the stereotypical soccer mom's voice by the minute. He looked over at his little bro and grinned, getting an idea. \"Remember how the people in our stories used to deal with tinies who hadn't accepted the giants as their gods yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Zach's eyes lit up was priceless. Then he put on the best evil grin he could manage and turned down towards the people in Matt's palm. \"Usually they were stuffed in the giants' shoes or armpits. But I think we don't need to keep this bunch, they don't seem very submissive.\" Zach said smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt grinned and, giving the kids to Zach, and keeping the soccer mom for himself. Matt licked his lips and opened his mouth, tossing the soccer mom in without a moment's hesitation. He chewed her to bits, letting the children watch from Zach's hand as he swallowed their bitch of a mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach chuckled and turned to the tinies in his hand, he shrugged and popped them into his mouth, he didn't chew them but only swallowed them whole after sloshing them around for a bit and they stopped moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt put his hands on his hips, \"That bitch gave me a great idea....This is such an opportunity bubbie! We're gods now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh yep!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And gods need slaves right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So lets go into the nearest city and enslave the people there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Zach jumped up and down happily, crushing the woman's van under his sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They left the demolished remains of Matt\u2019s house and the soccer mom\u2019s van behind them. That wasn\u2019t the only destruction they left behind, however. Matt and Zach both lived in a small neighborhood next to a larger city. The two giants stomped through the neighborhood they both grew up in, uncaring of the houses and people they stomped on. Some of the houses their feet tore through belonged to their other friends. Some of the cars they kicked off the street were owned by their neighbors. A few stupid acquaintances even stood in the giants\u2019 path and stared up at them in awe. These people were either stepped on unnoticed or plucked up and popped into one of the boys\u2019 mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the duo arrived at the city, leaving almost their entire neighborhood looking like a tornado hit it. Both brothers looked at the large buildings around them and the streets below. Their large feet had brought traffic to a complete stop. It was like the city had been frozen in time; all eyes on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. I\u2019ve been to the city before, but it looks so different! Everything\u2019s so much smaller.\u201d Zach grinned and turned to a nearby skyscraper. The teen approached the building and looked at himself reflected off the glass. His grin widened as he started to playfully flex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell everything is small when you\u2019re a god.\u201d Matt said as he reached down and grabbed a blue car that was trying to speed through his legs. The giant young man brought the car up to his face and peered inside. The driver\u2019s seat was occupied by an adult male, while the back seats contained two kids\u2026probably the man\u2019s children. One of the kids (the older looking one) mouthed the word \u201cawesome\u201d as he stared at Matt. The giant just smirked and mercilessly crushed the vehicle (and its passengers) in his fist. He tossed the crushed car over his shoulder and into a building, imbedding the twisted metal into the building\u2019s frame. Wonder if the kid thought THAT was awesome\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what are you doing, bubbie? I thought we were going to enslave them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are,\u201d Matt replied before stomping a car flat under his sneaker. \u201cBut first we\u2019re going to cause chaos and show these insects why we\u2019re the gods and they\u2019re the slaves!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, I see!\u201d Zach said before turning back to the skyscraper, rearing his fist back, and punching a hole right through the structure. The people inside that couldn\u2019t get out of the way fast enough (which was a lot) were mowed down by the giant\u2019s hand. Zach removed his fist from the skyscraper and brushed it against his shirt. He then delivered a swift kick to the lower part of the building; his sneaker-clad foot tearing through the frail supports of the building. The damage was worse than a bomb explosion and the building soon crumbled without its bottom supports. Zach stepped away from the collapsing building with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is fun!\u201d he shouted as he scanned the ground for something smaller to ruin. He spotted a small convenience store and cracked his knuckles. The mighty teen bent his knees and jumped high into the air, coming down on the store with a thunderous boom that shook the entire city. With the store obliterated under his feet Zach began stomping down on the nearby buildings, crashing his shoes through roof after roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Zach was doing this, Matt was marching down the street watching all the people flee from his towering form. The older god chuckled and peered into a building to his left. He found the building was a lot emptier than he thought, but glanced down to find all its occupants fleeing out the entrance. Matt smirked wickedly and raised one of his feet over the crowd. With a deafening thoom, Matt brought the foot down with enough force to crack the road and send a tremor through the pavement. He lifted his foot up and inspected the bottom. Many people had been crushed and their mangled remains now decorated the trends of his sneaker. The giant scanned the damage done to the area and spotted several survivors among the rubble. Without giving any of them a chance to get back to their feet, Matt picked them up and tossed them all into his mouth. Some he crushed with his molars; others he swallowed whole. No matter how he ate them, they all tasted delicious! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant brothers rampaged through the area for over an hour. No matter how many buildings they toppled or how people they snuffed out, neither boy was showing any signs of tiring. Zach was deciding to take a break from \u201cremodeling\u201d and scratched his stomach through his shirt. The teenage god stomped toward Matt, grabbing a handful of people from the flooded street below. The city folk were all trying to escape from the rampaging boys, but their desperation left all of them easy prey for the giants. Matt popped the people into his mouth one by one, swallowing each of them whole. He didn\u2019t like chewing them like his big bro did, instead enjoying the feeling of them squirming down his throat and into his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned to the approaching Zach and smiled. \u201cHey now, bubbie! Don\u2019t eat them all; we still need some of them to enslave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach gulped down one more person before nodding. The two giants looked down at Zach\u2019s hand to see four people the teen hadn\u2019t gobbled up yet. One was a woman, one a man, one a teenager around Zach\u2019s age, and the last one was a young kid. Matt smirked down at the four toothily, making them cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations. You four are the first to be enslaved by your new gods!\u201d </span></div></div>",

I can have em?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt chuckled and put a hand on Zach's shoulder, \"Yup! You get the first four slaves to yourself!\" Matt smiled kindly at Zach as Zach seemed to be bursting with joy and love for his big bro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stomped off into the city to look for his own slaves, while Zach looked down at his four slaves. They didn't seem to be related, just a bunch of people picked out of the blue. Zach sighed and sat down on a building, which caused the windows to blow out from his weight. He chuckled and then, using one shoe to pry the other off, he kicked off his well worn sneakers. He giggled as he felt the cool air through his hole ridden dingy socks. The socks were ripped in some places and turning gray instead of white from wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach stretched out his feet and legs and wiggled his toes through the socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh......\" he smirked, put his feet on the ground and stood up from the building. He grinned wider as he looked around him and saw how his foot odor was affecting the people below. They were coughing and plugging their noses, they couldn't stand it! Which made Zach all the more prouder to have gone without changing his socks or bathing for awhile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Matt came up with a few slaves in hand, two women and a man. He greeted his brother cheerfully and took a deep whiff of the foot odor ridden air. \"Must be heaven for the tinies down by your feet little bro.\" He said grinning along with Zach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach giggled and wiggled his toes before siting down in the middle of the street and, putting the tinies in his lap, he peeled his socks off to reveal two greasy feet covered in flecks of lint. Zach chuckled and placed his own slaves near his feet, causing them to react much the same as the rest of the tinies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna join me big bro?\" Zach said wiggling his linty toes. </span></div></div>",

The building creaked under his weight and a couple of the floors seemed to collapse, as shown by the debris and dust that shot out from the windows. Matt dropped his three slaves on the ground in front of him and started untying his shoes. \u201cSo, how do you like your slaves, bro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re okay for a starting bunch.\u201d Zach answered as he smiled down at the four tinies by his feet. \u201cI hope the kid can keep up with the rest, though. If he can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Zach grinned evilly at the young boy, making him cower in fright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt finished untying his shoes and stepped out of them, revealing his white socks. They were in much better condition than Zach\u2019s, but they still looked a bit dirty and stained from sweat. Matt flexed his toes inside his sock a few times before pulling them right off, sending a cloud of white flecks into the air. The flecks came down upon Zach and the street below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, watch where you take those off!\u201d Zach said jokingly as he fanned the air in front of his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, sorry.\u201d Matt dropped his scrunched up socks into his shoes and placed his sweaty bare feet before his trio of tinies. The people around them suffered even more now that there were two bare footed giants nearby. They coughed and became disoriented as the fumes polluted their air. The giant brothers didn\u2019t care about them, however, and paid there full attention to the seven slaves before them. Matt smirked and raised one of his feet above his three. He wiggled his toes tauntingly, fanning foot odor down upon them in the process. The two women and the man coughed and held their noses with both hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Can\u2019t stand the smell? Well you\u2019re going to have to if you want to live as my slave! If you can\u2019t, there\u2019s plenty more bugs in this city!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo show the bugs how insignificant they really were, Matt lowered his foot upon them. They tried to get out of the way, but the god\u2019s foot came down too fast and pinned them against the concrete street. Matt pushed down just enough to cause them some pain before he started rolling them around. The boys\u2019 feet were so huge that they could completely cover three people under one sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat looks like fun!\u201d Zach exclaimed as he watched his big bro smothered the tinies under his stinky foot. Zach grins down at his own four bugs and raises is bare foot over them. Drops of sweat dripped down to the ground, smacking against the ground like hail. As Zach descended his foot upon the four, the slaves immediately tried to scatter to get out of the cast shadow. The kid and the adult male got out of the way, but the woman and teen couldn\u2019t. They were forced flat against the road as Zach rolled their squirming bodies under the ball of his foot. Their bodies were getting drenched in foot sweat and they had no control ovr their bodies. They were completely at the giant teenager\u2019s mercy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten about you two!\u201d Zach said as he winked down at the young kid and the older man. They seemed to have forgotten the giant had another foot, since they were shocked when it appeared over them. Zach slowly brought the foot down while the buggy kid started to sob. Zach either didn\u2019t notice the cry or ignored it, since his decent didn\u2019t slow and the boy (along with the adult) was pinned under his other sole. Zach now had all his slaves under his feet and promptly rubbed them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant duo tortured their slaves for several minutes, soaking them with sweat and stink and making sure they knew how fearsome their feet could be. When the giants finally moved their feet away, their slaves were all twitching on the ground; their faces as green as a cucumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you bugs like that?\u201d Matt asked, not expecting any form of answer. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve been introduced to our feet, it\u2019s time for some real fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, what did you have in mind, big brother?\u201d Zach asked, grinning like a child. </span></div></div>",

You\u2019re all going to rub them, lick them, and kiss them until we tell you to stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two groups of slaves looks up at Matt with disbelief. They had just been smothered under the nastiest things they\u2019ve come across in their entire lives, and now they were expected to do all that to them?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but\u2026that\u2019s gross!\u201d shouted the young boy from Zach\u2019s group. The boy had just been crying, but now he was clenching his fists and showing some bravery before the older, bigger boys. His bravery quickly turned to cowardice when Zach stomped his foot right behind him, making him jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou calling our feet grow, punk?!\u201d Zach asked, glaring angrily down at the kid. \u201cDon\u2019t make me eat you like I did those two other kids!\u201d Zach grinned down threateningly at the boy. The tiny instantly bowed his head and tried his best not to bawl like a baby. This giant teen didn\u2019t seem to have any problem \u201cdealing\u201d with kids\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u2026get to work!\u201d Matt shouted, slamming his heels against the ground and cracking the street wide open. The man and two women nodded and ran to their master\u2019s soles. The female duo vigorously rubbed his right foot while the man was left with his left. The big man\u2019s feet smelled horrendous; turning the poor tinies pale and making them couch every other second. The sweat smeared over their hands like glue and it would not be easy to remove them. Matt stared down at his slaves and got such a rush of power. Writing about stuff like this was one thing; but actually experiencing it was another thing entirely. Being a giant would never get old!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Zach kept himself seated on the road with his bare feet positioned on either side of his four slaves. The four shook with fright as the giant master wiggled his toes in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, hurry up and worship! Do it, do it, DO IT!\u201d The giant\u2019s lack of patience was enough to tell his slaves they better get a move on. The teenager and the kid hurried to his left foot while the two adults focused on his right. The giant boy watched as they all started rubbing and licking his soles, making him feel really good. Even the scared little kid was lapping up the boy\u2019s sweat like his life depended on it\u2026which it did! Judging by the look on his face; he wasn\u2019t enjoying his new life at all. He probably missed his mommy and wanted to go back to his carefree, comfortable life\u2026well too bad! The kid and all the other slaves were gonna lick up their masters\u2019 sweat and they were gonna like it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re getting some tongue action over there, bro.\u201d Matt noticed before looking down annoyed at his trio of slackers. \u201cYou start licking too! Give my feet some nice smooches too!\u201d Matt laughed evilly as the slaves did as they were told and started dragging their tongues against his sweat soaked soles. Every now and then they would quickly kiss the foot they were worshipping; showing how much they \u201cadored\u201d this torture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two best buds relaxed their for awhile, not saying anything more to their slaves and just letting them do as they were instructed.

He looked down at Matt between his toes and smirked thinking of what he could do to his new toy.. Perhaps he could make him lick his toes, sniff his arm pits.. Drink his sweat or making him walk up and down his abs... That's when one of the women who was licking zachs toes came up behind him and patted him on the ass.. The feeling sent a wicked thought through him... As he picked up a tiny Matt and slowly guided him around to his perfectly shaped ass and slowly began to insert him into his ass, but hesitated after a second wondering if it was morally right to do this to another human, and almost decided against it untill the girl saw his hesitation and instantly grabbed his cock and whispered dirty encouragements in his ear then went down to her knees and engulfed his throbbing cock, going in a slow motion...<br>\r\n     This was all to much for Damien who fully inserted little Matt into his ass ordering him to lick and kiss his ass. Uncertain wether Matt was actually doing it. Damien thought it didn't matter as the vibrations coming from his ass were more than stimulating him, as well as the expert head he was receiving... Slowly pushing him over the edge, until his resistance was worn away by the two sensations. He finally decides that enough is enough and pulls the girl up and bends her over entering her moist pussy from behind.. Knowing that his ass is dominating a helpless man... No his helpless bitch while he was pounding another bitch was the best feeling I'm the world. Damien wasn't sure but he almost thought that the extra stimulation coming from his ass was keeping him hard longer than usual, but all good things have to end eventually and when his stamina finally gave way he unleashed a flood into the poor girl as she fell to the floor exhausted by the pounding she had taken.<br>\r\n      Zach who had been watching this with arousal decided that now was the time to get more involved and remind the little man at his feet that he is still a slave to him... Zach lifted his foot and brought it right down on the exhausted woman on the floor crushing her whilst wanking of to the tiny porn he had just seen and the humiliation that Matt was going through stuck inside that mans ass. Waves of pleasure overtook zach and he didn't realise that he had dropped his stone in the excitement as he come and aimed it at his little slave a bright light flashed as the stone cracked and hit the floor. The next thing zach knows he is...</span></div></div>",

Matt held the two cops firmly in his fist as he thought about how use them. The cops shuddered in the younger male\u2019s fist, afraid of what the future held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStomping out weaklings sure is a lot of work!\u201d Zach said as he stretched his arms over his head. As he did this, the older brother noticed sweat stains on Zach\u2019s shirt. A sly grin appeared on the giant\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re sweating up a storm, bro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not the only one.\u201d Zach replied as he put his arms down and watched Matt wipe his forehead (using the same hand as the one the cops were in, splattering fresh sweat over them). \u201cWe could both use some deodorant. Too bad there\u2019s none our size\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to improvise.\u201d said the older giant as he showed Zach the two cop bugs they had enslaved. Zach looked at them for a couple seconds before grinning widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! I almost forgot about that!\u201d Zach chuckled and stood up. As he approached his bro, the teenage giant whipped off his shirt and tossed it over some buildings. The two pitiful police officers shook in fear as the barechested teen stood over them. Zach plucked one of the men out of Matt\u2019s hand and brought him up his smiling face. He took a few steps away from his bro before shoving the man under his left pit and rubbing him all over it. The man screamed as he was pressed relentlessly against the armpit hairs, forced to swallow the giant\u2019s sweat as his uniform absorbed most of the liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zach did this, Matt stripped off his own top and laces his arms behind his head. He buried his nose into one of his hairy pits and took a deep sniff. The giant male and grinned at the smell; having fun sure made him sweat. Matt let one of his arms drop to his side, but kept the other one behind his neck. The remaining cop watched everything rush by a she was brought under the bigger man\u2019s arm and shoved face-first into the pit. Matt smirked evilly as he rubbed the cop up and down, treating him like he would a stick of roll-on deodorant. Matt\u2019s pits were fairly hairy; the dirty blond hairs smearing the poor cop with perspiration and giving him no fresh air to breath; just B.O. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bugs should of none better than to mess with us.\u201d Zach said as he twisted his deodorant around, giving him a nice face full of his raunchy underarm. The teen\u2019s pits weren\u2019t as hairy as Matt\u2019s, but they were still fuzzy. The small cop groaned as he was pricked and slapped by dark brown hairs and sweaty, damp skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s next on the list, bubbie?\u201d asks Zach as he switched the cop to his other hand and applied him to the other pit. The man\u2019s struggles had started to die down; the humiliation he was receiving was far too great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Matt pondered as he tossed his deodorant cop into the air and caught him mid-scream, shoving him under his other arm for more pit torture. As he thought, the giant\u2019s nose picked up something. It wasn\u2019t his own body odor, however, but something else. It smelled like the ocean\u2026the city\u2019s beach must be nearby! \u201cSince we already have our shirts off, how about taking a trip down to the beach? I bet they\u2019ll still be people their who don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a couple of giants rampaging through their city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like fun! Although\u2026I was thinking we could stop by my High School. The teachers should still be there, plus I think several bullies had to stay after.\u201d Zach smirked deviously. He could finally get some revenge on those cocky muscle heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey had to stay after on the last day? Wow\u2026if they\u2019re that bad, I bet they deserve to be taught a lesson by us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! But\u2026your beach idea sounds fun too. I don\u2019t know which one to choose\u2026\u201d Zach closed his eyes and thought. He stopped applying his deodorant, instead curling the man up in his armpit hairs and shutting him in there. Matt did the same thing, smiling at the man\u2019s screams as he was compressed between his pit and his arm.</span></div></div>",

He groaned as he sat up and tried to adjust is eyes to the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026my head. What the hell happened?\u201d Matt asked himself as he looked around, but found things were still a bit blurry. He was sitting on the floor, so he must of fallen out of his chair at some point. He reaches his hand behind him to feel for the chair, but touches nothing but the hard wood of the floor. Annoyed, Matt rubs his eyes vigorously until he can see clearly and looks behind him to find the chair. All he sees in the floor\u2026but something\u2019s odd about it. Not only is it a different color than his own floor, but it looked\u2026wider for some reason. Matt figured out why the moment he picked his head up and looked around the rest of the room. \u201cNo\u2026way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was sitting in the middle of a completely different room\u2026a GIANT completely different room. Everything; the bed, shelves, windows,  and other furniture were all giant sized! Matt deduced that he was only a few inches tall compared to everything else. As Matt continued to stare at his surroundings in awe, he suddenly remembered Zach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZach! Where are you?\u201d Matt yells as he spins around. \u201cLittle bro!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver here, Matt!\u201d hears the 20-year-old. Matt spots Zach running toward him from a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZach! Where were you?\u201d Matt asked once Zach had reached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just woke up a few seconds ago! You won\u2019t believe it, big bro; I was laying on someone\u2019s sock! It was huge and it smelled nasty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026so\u2026that stone shrunk us somehow. That\u2019s just great\u2026\u201d Matt couldn\u2019t believe he was saying that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow just that, big brother! It sent us to an anime world too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Zach. What makes you think this is an anime world? People don\u2019t just warp into fictional worlds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t shrink either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTouch\u00e9. Still, I don\u2019t think-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Matt could finish, both brothers were startled by the sound of a door swinging open. The two boys looked over at the bedroom\u2019s door and saw the most shocking thing in the form of a titanic person. The figure stood in the doorway for a few seconds, observing his room, before beginning to march inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatt\u2026that\u2019s\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpossible. That means we really are in another world! We\u2019re in Soul Eater!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatt, he\u2019s heading right for us! He\u2019ll step on us if we don\u2019t move!\u201d Zach shouted as he tugged on Matt\u2019s arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit, right!\u201d Matt muttered as he just now noticed the booming sounds creating by the giant\u2019s shoes. The two best friends ran out of the figures way as quickly as possible, just barely managing to escape before one of the shoes crushed them like bugs. The giant strolled over to his bed and sat down on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo bored\u2026\u201d mumbled the giant figure to the empty room. At least\u2026he THOUGHT it was empty.

What actually came out was the last thing he was expecting. Matt and Zach tumbled out of the humid shoe and landed in the center of Soul\u2019s gigantic, sweaty palm. At first Soul thought they were a couple insects and was about to drop them on the ground so they could be squished when he noticed they looked strangely\u2026humanoid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the-?\u201d Soul brought his palm closer to his face and sure enough his suspicions were confirmed. There, sitting on his palm, were two tiny humans! They looked pretty shaken up and gasped when they saw Soul staring at them with his big, crimson eyes. Upon instinct, Soul glared at the two suspiciously. \u201cWho are you and how did you get in my shoe?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys remained sitting and just stared at the giant with fright. Eventually Matt swallowed his fear and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou threw your shoe on top of us!\u201d Matt shouted, pointing a finger at Soul. The giant teen seemed annoyed at the tiny Matt\u2019s boldness and used a single finger to push against the man\u2019s chest. Matt was easily pushed back down into a sitting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t see you, punk. Probably because you\u2019re so damn tiny!\u201d Soul snickered as Matt rubbed his chest and glared up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Soul, you have to help us!\u201d Zach said as he stood up next. \u201cWe got sent here by some weird rock and we don\u2019t know how to get back. Maybe you could ask Lord Death if he could help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome weird stone sent you to my room? Well, that wouldn\u2019t be the craziest thing I ever heard. However, I think I have a better theory as to why you were lurking around my room at a few inches tall.\u201d With that said, Soul picked himself off the ground but remained leaning against the wall. With one hand tucked into his pocket and the other in front of his face, he was now in a \u201ccool\u201d position. \u201cI think you were spying on me! You\u2019re probably servants to some witch. How else could you have shrunk besides some magic spell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong! We really were brought here by a rock! No witches were involved\u2026at least I don\u2019t think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever. Do I like an idiot? Maybe Black Star would of believed that, but someone as cool as me wouldn\u2019t! Now that I\u2019ve caught you, I think I should punish you shrimps!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! S-Soul, you can\u2019t!\u201d Zach shouted, not wanting to end up a slave to some giant like the littles in his stories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re annoying\u2026\u201d Soul muttered before he took his other hand out of his pocket and reached for Zach. Before the little teen knew it, Soul had grabbed between two of his fingers and lifted him of his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, little bro!\u201d Matt shouted as he reached for Zach, but Soul easily carried him out of reach. The giant weapon coiled his fists around the two friends, trapping one in each hand. He turned his attention to Zach and smirked at the boy. His fist slowly began to squeeze the younger of the two, causing Zach to yelp in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it! Leave him alone!\u201d Matt yelled, struggling to break free of Soul\u2019s grip. The giant teenager, however, was far too strong to give his struggles any meaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, you two bugs picked the wrong guy to spy on\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Matt increased his struggles, but the giant\u2019s hand didn\u2019t even budge. Soul continued to crush Zach until he heard a small crack come from the boy. The teen then went limp in his fist\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZACH!!!!!\u201d Matt shouted at the top of his lungs. Soul ignored his pained scream and brought Zach up to his face. As he inspected the boy\u2019s prone body, he grinned toothily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s still breathing. I must of just cracked a rib and he passed out from the pain.\u201d Soul explained, not seeming to care that he had almost killed him. Matt breathed a sigh of relief, but that relief was short lived when he saw Soul hover Zach over his shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it look like I\u2019m doing?\u201d Soul replied before dropping Zach\u2019s unconscious form into is shoe. The cruel teen then raised his socked foot over the shoe and slowly put his foot in. Since Zach was unconscious, he couldn\u2019t do anything to escape and was pinned under the rank sock. Soul smirked with satisfaction after shaking his foot a bit to make sure Zach was nice and secure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you can\u2019t leave him in there! You\u2019ll squash him!\u201d Matt shouted to the giant weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll try going easy on the squirt. If he gets crushed, though, oh well. One less bug in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou son of a-\u201d Matt started to say, but was silenced with a quick and powerful squeeze from the larger male. Soul slipped his foot out of his other shoe and lowered Matt to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust so you won\u2019t feel left out\u2026\u201d Soul flashed a smile before dropping the tiny man into the footwear. Matt landed on his stomach and groaned as he rolled onto his back. Once he did, he got a clear view of Soul\u2019s socked foot entering the shoe. Matt could only sit up before the foot came down on him, forcing him back on to his back. With both \u201cspies\u201d under his feet, Soul put his hand in his jacket\u2019s pockets and started walking. Each step he took brought an immense weight upon the two brothers in his shoes. Zach was spared from the pain, but Matt felt like he was going to be crushed each time! It wasn\u2019t like when he was under Soul\u2019s toes and spared from most of the pressure; this time he was right under the sole and being pressed flat by it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, you bugs feel pretty good down there. You\u2019re just what my tired feet needed!\u201d Soul uttered as he made his way around the school. Matt could only hope that his brother was okay and remained asleep\u2026</span></div></div>",

He looked around for his brother but found nothing and started to struggle fruitlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was walking to his house to play with his new slaves, his feet were still sore and he was planning to squeeze a nice long foot rub from the two bugs currently passed out under his soles. He was walking up the stairs when he felt one of the bugs struggling inside his shoe, a sinister grin appeared on his face as he opened his apartment door. He rushed to his bedroom and locked his door behind him as he entered.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe albino haired teen slipped his shoes off and sat down on his bed; he grabbed his right shoe and turned it upside down. Zach toppled down onto Soul\u2019s palm and looked up at the giant shark-like grin and evil red eyes.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHey there squirt, ready to please your new master?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!

He rushed to one of the upturned soles and started to massage it vigorously, too scared at the possibility of an angry scythe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh, that\u2019s great, pretty soon you\u2019re gonna be begging to worship me like the god that I am\u201d that\u2019s when something in soul\u2019s mind clicks and he looks down at his slave with even more evil intent \u201cGet ready to be brainwashed squirt\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then again, that was easier said than done when the younger teen was head over heels in love with the cruel giant. Still, he had to try. His plans however were thwarted when he felt a giant fist close around him. \u201cWell, well, well, what do we have here\u201d the huge weapon smirked \u201cA little slave up and ready to serve\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew you!

Black Star wondered if skipping school was such a good idea since he had no one to hang out with outside of school since everyone was busy.<br>\r\nBlack Star sighed and slipped off his shoes which he had been wearing all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne shoe tipped over on it's side, Black Star wiggled his socked toes, but he was looking for a little more, so he stripped off one sock at a time, sending fluff and crud everywhere as the sock came flying off. \"Ahhh....\" Star sighed in delight as he wiggled his cheesy bare toes which hadn't seen a wash in a good long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star swung his legs up on the bed and laced his hands behind his head, soon he was fast asleep, letting the cool air blow between his toes, it felt good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile down below the bed, Matt and Zach saw everything. The shoes came off and bounced inches away from them, and the dirty socks fell down on top of them! \"Ugh! This smell is awful!\" Zach said to his big brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....Big brother?\"  Zach poked his head out from under the wet sock to see that his brother was scaling the sheets that were falling into the floor. \"Big brother! Don't!\" Zach yelped as he ran over. Zach looked up at Matt just as he climbed onto the bed, Zach was afraid of heights and he didn't have the guts to do what his big bro did. So he decided to hope for the best and stay on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was already all the way up to the bed though, and he saw a sleeping blue haired titan, snoring loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I have to wake him up somehow...to get his help.\" </span></div></div>",

He suddenly noticed that the teen\u2019s muscled arms were folded behind his head, exposing his light haired pits. Matt smirked before he dashed over to the nearest armpit. As he got closer, he began to doubt his initial plan\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026maybe this isn\u2019t such a good idea.\u201d Matt mumbles to himself as he pinches his nose. The air reeks of Black Star\u2019s B.O. and Matt can clearly see that his pits are covered with sweat. He can\u2019t turn back now, however. He needs to get Black Star\u2019s attention so he can help them. Matt takes a moment to prepare himself before taking a deep breath and lunging for the meister\u2019s pits. He sinks his hands into the underarm and begins tickling Black Star. Despite being so small, Matt\u2019s touch still registers with the giant who snorts loudly and begins chuckling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the floor, Zach hears the sounds Black Star is making and wonders what\u2019s going on up there. Just as he thinks this, he hears a voice call out to him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he\u2019s waking up, Zach!\u201d shouts Matt from atop the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Matt! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d Zach calls back. \u201cIt almost never ends well when someone tries to wake a sleeping giant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, little bro! What\u2019s the worse that could-\u201d But Matt doesn\u2019t finish, and his sentence his interrupted by a sudden scream. Zach\u2019s eyes widen in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig brother!!! Are you okay!!\u201d he shouts, but gets no reply. He starts to fear the worst\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of the bed, Matt\u2019s tickling had disrupted Black Star\u2019s sleep and caused him to roll over. Matt was now pinned between the mattress and Black Star\u2019s own smelly pit! The tiny man tries to push the giant off him, but\u2026well\u2026yeah, that doesn\u2019t work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this!\u201d Matt shouts in annoyance. \u201cNow I know how the characters in my stories feel\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Matt tries to squirm out from underneath the giant, Black Star suddenly starts to murmur in his sleep. He\u2019s dreaming about something and starts to sway back and forth while smiling. This movement causes his pit to rub against his bed, thus unknowingly smothering the tiny Matt! Matt squeezes his eye shut as he\u2019s covered in armpit hair and perspiration. Eventually, Black Star stops giving Matt a rubdown and resumes his motionless sleep. Matt opens his eyes to find that he is no longer pinned against the bed, but glued to Black Star\u2019s armpit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on!\u201d Matt groans as he pounds against Black Star\u2019s skin with little effect. \u201cWake up! Your pits stink!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral feet away, Zach is still wondering what has become of his longtime friend. Did Black Star roll over and crush him like a bulldozer?! Was Matt just knocked out? Zach wants to find out the answers, but his fear of heights prevents him from following his brother. Still\u2026Matt could be injured! </span></div></div>",

The reaction was almost spontaneous; Black Star\u2019s foot began to fidit and he laughed in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, stop that!\u201d Black Star mumbled in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Matt, what\u2019s going on up there?\u201d Zach asked his brother, shouting up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m tickling his foot to try and wake him up!\u201d replied Matt, much to Zach\u2019s surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you crazy, Matt?! That\u2019s dangerous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m being careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach, however, wasn\u2019t too sure of his brother\u2019s words. Since Zach knew Matt as near Black Star\u2019s feet, the shrunken teen ran around the bed until he was behind it. As he ran, he heard Black Star speak in his sleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026stop that\u2026stupid bug\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatt!! He thinks it\u2019s part of his dream!\u201d Zach yelled as he looked up the end of the bed, but still couldn\u2019t see his bro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll just have to tickle harder!\u201d Matt said as he began tickling even faster. The increase in speed caused Black Star to twitch his foot, a movement that sent Matt several inches backwards. \u201cOw\u2026son of a-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn bugs.\u201d Matt heard Black Star say before he saw a shadow engulf him. The older of the two friends looked up with horror as he saw Black Star\u2019s foot hanging above him. He immediately turned around and ran, but it was too late. The foot came down\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatt! Are you okay?\u201d Zach cried. He had heard what Black Star said and feared that the teenaged meister had woken up and thought Matt was a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026fine\u2026\u201d Matt answered back weakly. Even though it sounded like he was in pain, Zach was glad he was at least alive. What had happened was that Black Star had dreamed about stomping the bug that was tickling him, but thankfully his mattress was soft so Matt wasn\u2019t squished. Instead he was pinned underneath Black Star\u2019s gargantuan toes with only his upper half free from the pressure. He tried to pull himself free, but Black Star was keeping his foot planted flat against the bed. Matt was forced t just lay there as he felt his body being covered with foot odor and sweat\u2026   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnluckily for Matt, Black Star\u2019s dream isn\u2019t over yet\u2026</span></div></div>",
