She was in a total state of bliss being with a boy she loved dearly and enjoyed the various aromas that the kitchen had to offer. The meal itself was a massive feast rather than a small dinner as pork cutlets and shepard's pie were made for the crew whose tastes were varied but opinions on the matter were the same: the food was exquiste and nothing that fast food could even fathom to replicate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renton, the mixed vegetables are done. Should we prepare anything else?\" Eureka asked as she set out the final dishes before they called everyone in for supper. Renton shook his head as he came to the window with a luscious chocolate fudge cake he himself had prepared. \"Wow. Renton, it looks so good.\" she complimened as the cake was plenty big enough to be a meal itself. Renton admired his handy work as he went to wahs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Eureka. I hope you will enjoy it. It would be nice to see you eating some more though.\" Eureka was confused as she turned to Renton, whose backwas to her. Her face was blushing as she didn;t know how to take the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat more? I eat a moderate amount.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but you do look awfully skinny. That and the fact anytime I see you eat, you only take the smallest portions. I even overheard Mischa who made a comment on how your body is running with no body fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need body fat?\" Eureka was now confused as the other girls on the ship created a massive storm if any one of them gained so much as one single pound. \"Do people need fatin their bodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually yeah.\" Renton exclaimed, remembering one thing from school when he was too busy day dreaming about riding the waves in the sky. \"Fats contain energy for your body. So it'snatural you should eat a little more.Okay?\" Renton gave her a peck on the head as he went to call everyone for dinner. Eureka, meanwhile, was thinking of his statements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So getting fatter...is healthier?\" She didn't know to make heads or tails as being a Coralian alien, she had never even experienced what it is like to gain weight. She stared out at the copious quantities of food and nodded. \"Alright. I should eat more. Renton said its good for me to gain weight. Maybe he'll like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEureka stopped for a second. \"How do I go about gaining weight though?\"</span></div></div>",

She had her hand on he belly rubbing it. She got to the kitchen to get more food and saw 30 cakes in there and they were all for her. She started to eat the cakes and gained more and more weight.

This black Nirvash was quicker than Nirvash, zipping around like it owned the air, freely it moved just trying to keep up with it was quite the difficult task for just eureka to partake in as Nirvash wasn\u2019t at optimal levels with just her piloting it Renton was also needed if they ever stood a chance. Nirvash couldn\u2019t even compete with whom ever was piloting this LFO, Anemone was the secret weapon of the United Federation, a coralian modified human whom only purpose was to battle and capture the human form coralian named Eureka. Being swiftly defeated by this pink haired girl took this fight as more as just play time with the cute little coralian, barely was it even a fight to her with her LFO\u2019s power she quickly over whelmed the Nirvash in every turn and move Eureka could think of, trying to fall back to the Gekko seemed like the best choice that Eureka could have make. Not able to over whelm or even break through the defense that Anemone has placed around herself, no matter the attack that was thrown at her Anemone just shrugged it off like it was nothing, like swatting a fly Eureka was swiftly defeated by the weapon of United Federation. Trying her best to get away from the United Federation and Anemone was beginning to prove to be futile, corner by the enemy with the Gekko having no way to collect the Eureka from her recent predicament all they could do was watch as the Nirvash and Eureka were collected by the United Federation, no one knew what kind of horrors would await within the hands of Dewy Novak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the order of Dewy, Anemone was sent to watch over the coralian while he attended to other things that needed his attention at the moment, not even giving the young girl the satisfaction of a job well done. Anemone didn\u2019t really mind babysitting the sleeping girl, looking upon Eureka, Anemone thought just how cute this coralian looked even when she was asleep. Looking upon Eureka Anemone knew that she wanted to use this girl as her personal plaything, looking upon Eureka teal hair, supple cream skin and magenta eyes Anemone knew that she will have fun with this girl. Jumping down from the bed that was placed in the room that was place in the ware house of the United Federation. Grinning devilishly about what she was about to do with the coralian, \u201coh my, my doesn\u2019t my little piglet love her sleep so much, but she shouldn\u2019t worry much about it since her has her new master to obey and obey she will\u201d Anemone stated with a grin. While Anemone begun her plans to make Eureka her pet, team Gekko was just begging to try to find where they had taken their team member and what their end goal with her would even be, \u201cI should have been there, why did she leave with out me?\u201d Renton ask himself over and over in his head, while they did retrieve the Nirvash from a mountainous terrain, although it was badly damaged, it was still functional. Gidget was hearing chatter between the the Federation\u2019s troops, not able to pinpoint a direct line to where they were keeping Eureka, all they could do was wait. Throughout all of the radio chatter that was heard from the united federation\u2019s communication, a few items stuck out they were a bit odd for a military unit to order, sweets, shackles, a collar and a few girly outfits were some things that weren\u2019t something that they would need, only a teen girl would need to have like Eureka.</span></div></div>",

However, the revenue gained from the last issue was lower than usual and it had the usual Talho acting sexy for all the eager men to buy and ogle her picture. This is where Gidget came in, as air headed as she was, devised a plan to have the others ladies pose for the magazine. Hilda denied it and Eureka was unsure of what to do, so Gidget became the April cover girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't beleive it, all the guys will be wanting my autograph now!\" She said as she kissed the magazine cover with her creamy tan body posing in a bikini. \"and Doggie will be so jealous.\" She couldn't help but to coo with delight as she ran into,literally, Hilda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seriously need to lay off that crap.\" Hilda chided Gidget. \"It's bad enough you got Talho bumped off the cover, now you go all around acting like Renton was when he was on the cover.

Karma can be quite a bitch.\" Gidget didn't know how to make heads or tails of that comment but went on her business anyway as she wanted to walkaround the town they had stopped at to gain the admiration of her fans. And this plan worked like a charm. Gidget was taking up everyone's glory of her, wanting autographs and pictures. She knew it'd be a success but she never imagined it like this. After some time, she knew she had to get back to the Gekko and made her way back to the ship. Unfortunately, she never got to step foot in the hull as she felt something hit the back of her head, causing her to slump to the ground in an unconscious manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke some time later, she found out she was with...</span></div></div>",

As ships doctor, she maintained a variety of tasks to surgery to taking care of minor colds and stomach aches the other crew members got from eating too much junk food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This gets more and more boring each day.\" She complained aloud as she typed up her various reports on her main PC, trying to figure out a way to alleviate her boredom. \"I could always just try and entertain myself...but I don't have too many hobbies. It's not like I can date. I have an ex and am 44...\" Unfortunately, there weren't many options that were available to her at her age and interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is always science...\"she trailed off, deciding to fiddle around with her various medical programs, in hopes she could find something new about the human body. \"Heh...maybe I can discover a cure for cancer or something miraculous like that. Fat chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came to the conclusion she wasn't going to let any of the crew members mess with their simulated bodies on the program, so she made the decision to put her own data in the computer to see what could happen. She came up with a theory and put it in motion to set it off. After a few days of messing around on the computer, she came to an amazing discovery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is impossible...\" She found out that at her age and weight, if she ate certain foods and commited herself to a regime of activities, she could become hugely obese and still be perfectly healthy. She looked over the data again and again and realized there was no misconstrued information and that it could work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" she examined her body and tried to outweigh the options of doing something like this, to test if there was a cure for obesity in terms of this battle plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is for science...and it could be a huge medical achievement...and I could get a grant for this is my data proves to be useful. Should I get some help with this though? Would one of the others be willing to assist me and be my coach? Great, another tough call...\" She knew that this was the best thing to do. It could allow her to reach new and unfound boundaries, but the big question should if she should get help.</span></div></div>",

He knew he had screwed up big time, but verbal abuse with phrases such as \"useless\" and \"moron\" were never welcomed to him. What made things worse was that Eureka was in the Med Bay again as her headaches were getting increasingly worse. Renton sighed as he entered the galley that he was in charge of stocking items and selling them to the other crew members of the ship. However, since barely any one came in at thislate of an hour, hehad the place to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will help tonight?\" He muttered as he picked up several bags of chips, cookies, and candy bars from the shelves. Renton's method of coping with depression mixed in with loneliness was to go on several binges of junk food to help ease the aches. However, this wasn't doing him any actual service as the last time he was in such a state before he fled the Gekkostate, he literally tore through a dozen bags of potato chips in the course of two days. His unhealthy eating habits weren't doing any good to his body as he felt his waist line becoming tighter with each passing binge he went on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got the massive pile of a dozen snacks with a six pack of Dr. Pepper and began his feast of sugary goodness. He was so entranced into the cornucopia of food that he didn't notice Hilda walking into the store, looking for some eyeliner she ran out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Renton, can you...Geez!\" was all she could muster as she saw the mountain of treats Renton collected for himself. \"I thought the others ate bad, but if you keep that up, we might need a bigger ship.\" She teased. Renton was still in an odd food bliss as he further ignored Hilda. This annoyed her as one thing she honestly couldn;t stand was people being rude to her. The athletic African woman slammed her fist on the counter, causing several of the bags to spill their contents, some salty chips absorbing the puddle of soda that was all over the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?\" Was all he could mutter as Hilda was getting on her last nerve. \"Did you need something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda wanted to force the food down his gullet, but she didn't want to lose her cool. However, she was feeling awfully tempted to teach Renton some manners. </span></div></div>",

Shaking her head, she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenton took no notice of this. He continued his bingeing, shoving chips, candy bars, and countless other types of junk food into his waiting gullet. Several times, he felt his waistline tighten, but paid it little heed; he REALLY needed this food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good 15 minutes, he'd cleared the massive food pile he'd amassed. Letting out a happy groan, he fell onto his back, rubbing his stomach. It now formed a massive bulge underneath his red and white jacket, protruding at least a few inches into the air. His pants felt uncomfortably tight, but Renton was much too occupied rubbing his stomach and enjoying the sensations to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while though, he began thinking of Eureka in Medbay, and he frowned. Groaning with effort, he got to his feet, his engorged stomach throwing off his balance a little bit. He placed a hand on the wall to steady himself, then began walking towards Medbay, his engorged but still-concealed gut protruding in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",
