            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a very lazy day in the Vocaloid house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen was sitting in a corner, reading his favourite book. Miku was sitting on the couch watching TV, Rin beside her sprawled out like a ragdoll that had been flung at the couch upside-down. Meiko was off at work and Kaito was shopping, leaving the three of them alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin let out a very dramatic sigh. Len looked up from his book to her. \"You know, sis, if you don't like that show you could always get up to change the channel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flung her arms up in the air. \"I could, but the problem is that I would need to <i>get up</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then Miku could do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the TV is so far away,\" replied Miku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Len could retort, the front door burst open. \"Not to worry, kids, <b>your saviour is here!</b>\" shouted Kaito, holding aloft the replacement remote control he just bought. The girls burst into applause as he levelled it at the TV and pressed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-?\" He pressed it again. Nothing. He continued to press it, and still nothing. Quickly flipping the remote upside-down, he pried the battery cover off, muttering \"I just put the batteries in this thing in the store...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a melodramatic sigh, he tossed the remote to Rin, who caught it with some difficulty due to her upside-down position. \"Alright, I'll go and get another one. You guys can break that like you did the last one, not like it works or anything when it's in one piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slammed shut. Rin began examining the remote in closer detail. \"Well, it's no wonder this thing didn't do anything, it's not even a TV remote? The heck are all these buttons for, anyway?\" And with that she threw it on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it landed, a beam of green light shot out toward Miku. Before anyone could react, she was enveloped in the green light, and vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>MIKU!</b>\" both twins shouted in unison as they dashed to where their sister was, until moments ago, seated. Rin began frantically searching over the couch for any sign of her, tossing aside cushions and pillows, but to no avail. As she grabbed one particular pillow, Len realized there was something curious about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rin, do we have any green pillows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin slammed the pillow on the couch. \"Is now the time for that!?\" she demanded. 'Miku just disappeared and all you can think of is the decor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not that,\" replied Len. He gingerly picked up the remote, noting which end the beam came out of and keeping that side pointed away from either of them. As he examined the remote, one button caught his eye: one with the word 'Revert' printed on it. \"We never had any green pillows,\" he said as he pointed the remote toward Rin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Len, what are you doing?\" Rin asked. In response, he pressed the button on the remote. A blue beam shot out, enveloping the pillow Rin was holding. An instant later, the pilllow was gone and in its place was Miku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miku!\" shouted Rin, giving her sister a large hug. \"What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know,\" said Miku. \"One minute I was sitting here, and the next I was staring up at the ceiling. I tried to move, but I couldn't. Then you picked me up and Len...\" they both looked at Len. \"What is that thing?\" asked Miku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem,\" Len replied, \"that this is a transformation device of some sort. Let's see...\" he pointed the remote at a lamp, and pressed the button again. The remote fired a beam, and suddenly the lamp was now a potted plant. Another press and the plant was a lamp again. \"Aha, so you only have to think of what you want to turn a thing into, then press this button. And this \"revert\" button will change anything back into what it's supposed to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" said Rin. \"That's so cool. Hey Miku, what was it like being a pillow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was... fluffy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them talked, Len placed the remote down on the table. This is an amazing device, he thought. Which of them should be the one to use it?</span></div></div>",

The most obvious answer was the house right next door, where their friends Neru and Teto lived. He dashed down the path to their front door, but stopped when something caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the front lawn was a very unusual rock formation, One rock, mostly round with the exception of some vaguely spiky pattern at the top, sat between two triangular ones pointing downward with a spiral groove traveling down each one. Given neither inhabitant of the house has any interest in rock decorations, and the distinctive shape of the formation, it didn't take Len very long to figure out what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh,\" said Len.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen looked down and realied he had been clutching Miku with her face pressed against him.<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" he said as he turned her around, \"but I think I know where Rin has been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiku gasped. \"That's not Teto, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen walked over to the rocks and crouched down as close to \"eye-level\" as he could. \"Hey Teto, are you all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rock didn't respond. Considering she didn't have a face, this was unsurprising. Len gave her an experimental poke in the middle of where her face should be, which had the effect of dislodging the two adjoining rocks and toppling them over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's not going to like that,\" said Miku. \"She spends hours getting her hair into those drills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen set Miku down, then began frantically trying to reset the rocks. Unfortunately, they were too pointed, and refused to stay upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending entirely too long trying to fix it, he jumped up into a standing position. \"This isn't what's important right now! We need to find Rin and get that remote back.\" He looked down apologetically at Teto. \"Sorry, I'll fix you when I get the chance.\"</span></div></div>",

The first thing he noticed was that it was already open slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he pushed open the door, which immediately foiled his attempt at being sneaky with a loud creak. He quickly ducked behind it. After waiting a few moments without the door changing into a duck or something, he pushed it open again and crept in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house was completely empty. Rin had definitely been here, but she wasn't anymore. Still, Len felt he had to find out what happened to Neru so he could fix her later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to search long. On the living room couch there sat two identical copies of Neru's phone. Len picked one of them up; it was typing text messages on its own. Len realized he could see exactly what Neru was talking about to whomever, but no, he probably shouldn't invade her privacy like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Neru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe text messaging screen disappeared, and in its place was Neru's face, startled at seeing a giant Len.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Len!\" came the tinny voice from the phone's speaker. \"W-what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of a long story. We got this weird remote that can apparently change people into different things, which I know sounds crazy but it's true and... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeru narrowed her eyes. \"Yeah, I don't think you're gonna have any trouble convincing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I realized that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're looking for Rin,\" said Miku from down below. \"She grabbed the remote and ran off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miku? Is that you? Len, I can't really look around like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen put Miku down on the couch and pointed Neru toward her. She stared for a few seconds, then burst out in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know, I'm a pillow, ha ha. You're no different you know, you're stuck as a phone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" replied Neru, trying to stifle her giggles, \"but the difference is I have internet access!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiku grumbled at this. Len realized he should step in, and turned Neru around to face him again. \"We need to find Rin, do you have any idea where she went?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, no. I didn't even hear her come in, it was just one second I'm looking at my phone, then I'm looking at the ceiling, but through the phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen sighed. \"No, that's okay. We'll keep looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing... do you think you could leave me here like this for a while? It's so much easier typing directly from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen looked at her quizzically. \"Uh, sure, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Thanks.\" And with that, the text messaging client popped back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we've lost her.\" Len placed her back down on the couch and picked Miku back up. \"Alright, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran back out the front door, trying to figure out where Rin could have gone next.</span></div></div>",

On extra thing Teto can do is that if she wants to move, she can summon the ground to build her a rocky body. The body would break apart if she wanted to be a stationary rock again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka was the only one turned back to normal and she was crying with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin remained as a yellow ball with her face. She spends some of her time rolling around and bouncing. Sometimes she asked if she can be used to play ball games like basketball. The strange part is that Rin didn't mind having no arms or legs.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">One day, while lazing around the house doing nothing in particular, the vocaloid family suddenly obtain a transformative device. It is capable of doing nearly anything transformation-related, so go wild and come up with as many ideas as you can. The story can follow any of these characters that you want, whether they are transforming people or perhaps the one transformed themself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you don't know any of these characters, then try reading the <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Vocaloid_Wiki\">Vocaloid Wiki.</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Vocaloid_Wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The Vocaloid Family</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Miku Hatsune</u><br>\r\nThe oldest child in the family. Has ridiculously long green hair that she always wears in twin tails. A nice person who makes friends easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Rin Kagamine</u><br>\r\nLen's twin sister. Very mischievous, and has a habit of doing things before thinking about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Len Kagamine</u><br>\r\nRin's twin brother. While he can be just as mischievous as her, he is usually a lot calmer and intelligent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Kaito</u><br>\r\nFather to the family. He's a nice guy, but he can be a bit of a doormat (for example, running to the store to buy a new TV remote after Rin destroyed it in an accident).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Meiko</u><br>\r\nMother to the family. When she's not at work, she's usually rip-roaring drunk. At least she's a happy drunk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Neighbours and Friends</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Neru Akita</u><br>\r\nA bratty, yellow-haired girl who lives next door to the family. Often seen texting on her cell phone. Best friends with Miku and Teto, and has a crush on Len (not that she'd ever tell him).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Teto Kasane</u><br>\r\nA redhead who is Neru's housemate. She can be a bit airheaded at times, but she's a very nice person and always happy. Best friends with Miku and Neru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Haku Yowane</u><br>\r\nA shy, grey-haired girl who lives just down the street. She's friends with Miku, Rin, and Len, but doesn't see them often. Owns a pet cat named Yowaneko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Luka Megurine</u><br>\r\nA very tall girl with bright pink hair. Classmates with Miku, and the most mature of her friends. May or may not have a crush on Miku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore Vocaloids or UTAUloids can be added if you like; don't think you are limited to these ones.</td>",
