He rides a dragon named Nightmare which has the ability to confuse and control his enemies. <br>\r\nNow it begins in a cathedral. Dark was standing in front of a iconic structure of Jesus. He wasn't worshiping it, but he was admiring the artwork and significance of the sculpture.<br>\r\nDark: (thinking) Wow the people who made this really paid attention to detail. Hmm another example of God's handiwork through people. (turns around) Well I guess I might as well be off with my day. (walks out of the cathedral)(flies off to a cave) <br>\r\nMavis was patroling around on his dragon Nightmare. He is planning an invasion against the Shadows, but needs to study the area to see the status of the Shadow warriors.<br>\r\nMavis:(thinking) Looks like the Shadows are not out yet. (to Nightmare) Alright we can rest by that cave for a few minutes. (lands)<br>\r\nNightmare: (in a deep voice) I sense that someone else is here. We must go somewhere else.<br>\r\nMavis: Relax it's probably just a sleeping crystal monster.<br>\r\nDark: (lands in front of the cave) I wonder where they are at?<br>\r\nMavis: (sees Dark) Nightmare look! a Shadow.<br>\r\nNightmare: Yes I see.<br>\r\nMavis: Want to send him a \"surprise welcome\"<br>\r\nNightmare: (laughs) At your command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?     </span></div></div>",

Windy Willows is a dark mysterious forest with many trees. In the forest lives creatures called \"unknowns\" which are mostly parasites. The Shadows have figured out ways to control the unknowns and have kept them from overpowering them. (The unknowns will come in later) <br>\r\nThe Shadows were formed when the Darkites came. The Shadows are a people group that consists mostly of wolves, hedgehogs, and foxes. Although there are other types of animals Dark is the Commander. The Shadow history connects with the Darkite history because they were formed after the Darkites were formed. <br>\r\n    The Darkites are a group that lives near the Darkites. They live by the Cave of Wonders which is a cave that contains crystal monsters. The Darkites and crystal monsters or crystals share the same home even though they don't get along too well. The Darkite commander is Mavis. The Darkites were a people group that was created to protect Metropolis from invaders. However the Darkites became corrupted and started trying to take over the planet. <br>\r\n  The Darkites are like Shadows except they try to destroy things. The Darkites were not always corrupted. They became corrupted when the Unknowns started infecting them. The Darkites that kept themselves uninfected becameunited and formed a group called Shadows.
