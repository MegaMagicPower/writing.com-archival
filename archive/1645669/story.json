She still <i>never</i> got a boyfriend, despite her attraction to a boy named Harvey, only for him to <i>not</i> be \"romantically interested\". It was there, at the high school she had been going to, and at this point for the last time, that she tried a pancake for the first time in her life. She caught herself rather addicted from there. She was curious about what they were like, despite her aunts telling her that her family's line had an addiction to pancakes, be they just those or \"conjured\" ones, and \"conjured chocolaty foods\", other such kinds of \"conjured\" foods, in general, and decided to try one of these pancakes. She at least managed to bide her time 'til her last high school day was over. It was over for twelfth graders, including herself, during the first half of usual high school days. However, while in her own car she earned with insurance to cover it through arrangements made by her aunts upon her driver's education being completed, her driver's test passed and her driver's license won; which she was in for the purpose of heading for an afternoon, evening and possibly early night around the town she had been living with her aunts in, she dropped by at a buffet restaurant for lunch. A rather diverse and breakfast and lunch and dinner all-you-can-eat type of buffet. When she got there, she got her car into her parking lot, she entered the place and said it was just her at either a table or booth. A booth was offered, which she took. When this was done, she went to see what the buffet trays and plates, etc., had to offer and they offered diverse types of foods. Even pancakes, still. She got lots of customer's trays with plates of pancakes for her booth along with some syrup to go with those. She got <i>straight</i> to them, taking care she use a fork, a knife and some paper napkins to keep her fingers, hands, mouth and lips clean and a towel napkin to protect her regular grey colored shirt she was wearing with her blue-colored jeans long pants. She placed syrup on lots of the plates, fortunately not enough to make messes anywhere but still a lot. She ate lots of them. However, though the time of her arrival at this place was 10:50 AM, it only took up until 12:45 PM for her to finish those. When she did, she noticed some changes on her body. Most especially the middle of her front. Her belly of a stomach was getting <i>really</i> big, and though it caught her off guard, she now didn't care. Even so, though, she was starting to feel <i>really</i> <i>full</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, not only did it catch her off guard that she had a rather \"chubby\", big, distended, fat and <i>round</i> belly, but it also caused her to have a small but still hearty hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was mortified by this, and proceeded to cover her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina realized she was beginning to gain weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet a part of her <i>did</i> <i>not</i> CARE anymore. Since the start of her depressed state she <i>still</i> had been in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not sure whether she should just pay her bill and be off to continue her \"afternoon and evening and early night on the town\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was starting to feel full and saw that she had put on <i>a</i> <i>lot</i> of weight, she was craving for <i>more</i> pancakes <i>and</i> even other foods like the kinds available at the all-you-can-eat-buffet restaurant she stopped by at for lunch offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bill was an inexpensive one to pay, fortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Sabrina was unsure of whether she should just pay and take her leave to avoid getting any \"unwanted attention\", she didn't care and was too addicted to care at this point.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Adams College, Boston, prided itself on providing a well-rounded education, in terms of academics, sport, and extracurricular activities. Little did some students realize just how 'well-rounding' it could become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina Spellman, for instance, when picking her classes and physical activities, never even considered the idea that they could result in her gaining weight. But a combination of late-night study (and snacking) sessions, plenty of junk food and beer, and a relatively easy-going yoga class, meant that she was suddenly starting to outgrow her outfits. At first, she attributed it to the laundry service shrinking her clothes, but one day, she was forced to come to terms with her, 'growth'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nIt was a Saturday, the morning after an evening of eating and watching bad TV. Sabrina was still in bed, but her roommate, Roxie King, was up and sitting on the couch, brushing her long black hair. She was pretty slim, with small, yet perky boobs, though a slight potbelly was visible under her long-sleeved grey blouse, a result of her addiction to takeout food, which she had been indulging a little too often lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just considering getting some breakfast when Sabrina emerged from their shared room, dressed only in a t-shirt and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie's eyes widened as she looked at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina looked up, scratching her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was so shocking to Roxie was that Sabrina had clearly put on quite a bit of weight, probably around 15 pounds, and on her small frame, it really showed. The blonde's once flat stomach had grown into a proper belly, sticking out from under her nightshirt and jiggling when she walked. As she bent down to turn on the TV, she revealed that her weight gain hadn't been limited to her stomach, her wide bottom testing the limits of her underwear, the crack of her butt cheeks just peeking out above the straining waistband<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Roxie had gathered her thoughts, Sabrina was already sitting on the couch, helping herself to some leftover Chinese food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Sabrina began, chewing on a spring roll, \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie hesitated. Despite her reputation as a bit of a bitch, it was a delicate subject, and she was aware that she had put on a little weight as well recently. Still, she had to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Roxie was spared this unpleasant job by the return of their other roommate, Morgan, from her daily jog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red-headed, air-headed fashionista, with a cute face and bubbly curves, Morgan Cavanagh took great pride in her personal appearance, and made a point of exercising every day. While she generally watched what she ate, she also had quite a sweet-tooth, and often picked up pastries and other sweets to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked in through the door, resplendent in a hot pink tracksuit with matching running shoes, a Walkman clipped to her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought donuts!\" she trilled, brandishing a brown paper bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sabrina and Roxie were enticed by this news, and quickly abandoned the couch and moved to the kitchen area. Soon, all three girls were tucking into the sugary treats, as well as three steaming cups of coffee.  They soon finished off the entire dozen (Roxie had three, Morgan helped herself to four, while Sabrina managed to pack away five), and sat back, satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina stood up to get another cup of coffee, giving Morgan a great view of her expanded form.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe gasped and turned to Roxie, who gave her a warning look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Sabrina,\u201d Morgan began, \u201cyou\u2019ve put on so much\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Coffee!\u201d Roxie interrupted, \u201cMorgan was just saying you\u2019ve put on so much coffee, I don\u2019t know how we can drink it all! <i>Right</i>, Morgan?\u201d she added, threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked confused. \u201cOh, yeah. Coffee\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie sighed in relief.<br>\r\n as Sabrina sat back down.\u201cAlso,\u201d Morgan continued, \u201cyou really got fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina stormed into her room, slamming the door behind her. She couldn\u2019t believe the nerve of Morgan! Calling her fat! For a moment, she\u2019d thought it was just her usually superficiality, until she saw Roxie nodding her head. Maybe she had put on a little weight, but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling nervous, she conjured up a full-length mirror and took a good look at herself. She lifted up her shirt and poked her stomach. It looked rounder\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just a little bloated\u2026\u201d she told herself, \u201cfrom the donuts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran her hands up over her breasts, which felt a little fuller. In fact, she had noticed her bras were getting kind of snug\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 a growth spurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around, and looking over her shoulder, surveyed her backside. It stuck out much more than it used too, and the fabric of her underwear was being drawn up between her butt cheeks, giving it a thong-like appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just because I\u2019m\u2026 getting fat.\u201d She moaned, finally realizing how much weight she\u2019d put on. It wasn\u2019t <i>her</i> fault, she thought, sitting down on the bed and rubbing her belly. It was hard for her to keep slim when you could conjure up food at the point of a finger, especially without her aunts to keep an eye on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Sabrina decided to go ...</span></div></div>",

They would be able to give her advice, maybe there was even a spell to help her shed a few pounds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a point of her finger, she disappeared in a shower of golden sparkles, just as Roxy opened the bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sabrina, I...\" The dark haired girl broke off as she realised the room was empty. \"What the?\" She asked, looking around in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan poked her head in the door. \"Maybe she went out the window.\" She said, naively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy glanced at the window, measuring it up. \"I don't think she would fit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a second shower of golden sparkles, Sabrina appeared in her old bedroom, the familiar surroundings easing her mind. She stretched and yawned, only to hear a all too familiar voice from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Full moon on the horizon!\" Salem smirked, as Sabrina's shirt rose up over her bigger butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salem!\" She cried, turning around and pulling her shirt down. \"What are you doing in my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalem stood up and made for door. \"I was just trying to make the best of it before Hilda and Zelda turn it into a workout room. Speaking of working out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina grabbed a pillow and threw it at the cat, who let out a hiss before darting away. She then decided to get dressed, finding an old pair of track pants that looked like they would fit. She pulled them on, and they were fine, if a little snug around her rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way down stairs, to find her aunts in the kitchen. Zelda was sorting through some post while Hilda was buttering a slice of toast. They both turned to look at her as she came downstairs, their faces lighting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sabrina!\" They said in unison, as she sat down at the table. \"And how's our favourite niece doing today?\" Zelda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm okay.\" She murmured, reaching for a slice of toast and some jelly. What was the best way to bring this up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Aunt Zelda, when you went to college, did you ever find you had any trouble with... um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda smiled. \"Let me guess, you've put on a few pounds, and you're feeling self-conscious.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina sighed with relief, but stood up to show them the extent of the damage. \"It's more than a few pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda whistled. \"Still, don't worry about it Sabrina. I remember when Zelda came home from her first year of college, and she...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda interrupted primly. \"Now, you have to remember it was attractive to be a little heavy back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little heavy? You were the only woman who could make Henry the Eight look skinny!\" Hilda laughed, as Zelda scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina looked at her rail thin aunt. \"Really? How did you lose it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda smiled. \"Hard work and discipline, honey. There's no quick fix I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina frowned, but at least they understood what she was going through. \"Thanks guys, I'm going to head upstairs and grab a few more things with elastic waistbands, at least for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back upstairs, panting a little as she reached the top, and re-entered her room. Salem was on her bed again, leafing through a telephone directory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news Sabrina, I found a contractor who can reinforce your bed for you!\" He said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ha ha,\" She laughed, as she went back to her closet. \"Why don't you look up taxidermists?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, you could just look up a spell to get rid of the extra weight?\" He suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Zelda said there wasn't a spell that could do that.\" Sabrina said, turning around, intrigued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, but there <i>are</i> ways around that. You could transfer the weight to someone else, or somewhere else in your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina thought back to what Zelda had said earlier. \"Could I just change it so its attractive to be fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" Salem replied. \"So what are you going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She changed into some sweat pants and a loose tee and walked out of her room.<br>\r\n\"Where're you going?\" asked Roxie, curious.<br>\r\n\"I'm going out for a jog. I'll be back later!\" With that, Sabrina walked out the front door and started out on her jog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina didn't want any of the guys at her college to see her, so she decided to go to the park instead. She rode her car there, as she didn't want to use up any energy walking or running there. Once at the park, she got out of her car and got on the sidewalk. She didn't think that she would need to stretch first, so she just started out on her jog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jog was more challenging than she had originally thought that it would be. Her boobs kept bouncing up and down as she ran along, almost smacking her in the face. Her butt was slowing her down, too, as it was jiggling like mad with every step. This was also true for her thighs and stomach. \"Okay.\" Sabrina panted after five minutes of jogging. \"I need something to keep these things down with.\" She went behind a tree near the path and conjured two roes. She used one to tie up her boobs and the other to tie up her butt. She ran on like that, but she was still lazy, fat, and out of breath, so these changes didn't help out very much. And she couldn't tie down her stomach without hurting herself, so she had to just let it jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thirty minutes of jogging, Sabrina felt ready to pass out. She walked back to her car, and once she was inside of it, the first thing she did was conjur up an liter of Coca-Cola. She chugged the whole thing in one breath. When she had finished her drink, she let out a large belch. \"Excuse me!\" she said. \"Wow... That was worse than anything I've ever done before! I'm hungry now...\" She looked around the outside of the car to make sure that nobody was watching, and then conjured up an entire fast food meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal that Sabrina had conjured was a supersized order. She had a triple stack bacon and cheese burger, fries, another Coke, and a large chocolate milkshake. The meal was highly fattening, but Sabrina didn't care. She just wanted something to eat right now. She downed the entire meal in five minutes flat. Her stomach bloated, she felt content. The meal that Sabrina had eaten had canceled out the jog and then some. She had gained weight after her little jog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrgh... I'm so full, but I'm still hungry!\" said Sabrina.

In short, Sabrina needed a shower, for she smelled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Morgan was the one to tell her that. \"Wow, Sabrina, you really need to take a shower - and lose that weight,\" the tactless redhead told her promptly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina's eyebrow twitched, and a tiny spark of magic almost leaped off her onto Morgan - she was barely able to restrain herself. Instead, she just tried to reach the shower ASAP. Sadly, as she had almost reached her destination, Roxy decided to join Morgan, albeit in a more helpful way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Sabrina? I may not be the most social person and all, but I agree that you could use some help in getting back into shape. Plus, if you sweat a lot and take over the shower-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost growling in irritation, Sabrina slammed the bathroom's door, accidentally releasing some of her magic and hitting the other two girls before they could realize what has happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...As Sabrina closed the door into the bathroom in order to bathe, Roxy and Morgan looked at each other in a weird manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm off to cook Sabrina a big meal,\" Morgan said promptly and walked off to the kitchenette, while Roxy looked at the bathroom door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm off to help Sabrina bathe - before taking over the chores,\" the brunette said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Not knowing just what has happened back in the living room, Sabrina began to sing in the shower.</span></div></div>",

It was the size of a wedding cake, and the place where the figurines would go on top was replaced with two Twix bars. She ate the entire cake in five minutes flat. When she finished, she knew that she was bigger. Only a small bit, and it was barely noticeable. Her butt was a little bit bigger in her panties, her breasts were starting to strain her bra slightly, and her belly was ever so slightly bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect as always!\" said Sabrina, licking her fingers. \"I'm still hungry, though. It wouldn't hurt too much if I conjured up just one more cake like that!\" So she conjured another. She ate it and was still hungry, so she conjured up another. And then another. And then another.

She kept eating and didn't care because of a slight problem with conjured chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWizards and witches have near unlimited powers, but there are a few glitches in the magical system.

A witch could become addicted after just one bite of a conjured chocolate bar or cake. And Sabrina was officially hooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina had downed nine cakes so far and was working on her tenth when problems started to occur for her. The first thing that happened was that her stomach started sticking out of the bottom of her shirt. She didn't notice this until her whole naval was sticking out. She tried fixing it, but it didn't go well. She would fix it temporarily and then just come back out. The next thing that happened was that her panties started to ride right up her butt. She would fix it, but just as her stomach did with her shirt, her panties just kept on going back in. She eventually gave up on that. The last problem that she noticed was that her bra was starting to become insanely tight. She hadn't bought any new bras since her weight gain, as she had been in denial up into this moment. It was starting to cut into the fat on her back, and the fat collecting in her breasts were starting to seep over the edges of the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina had finished the tenth cake and had taken three bites of the eleventh cake when she heard a rip. She looked behind her and down, and saw that the rip had been caused by her panties. Her butt had expanded to past the limit of them, and a tear had started to rip through the bottom part that would have normally been covering the bottom of her butt. \"Uh oh... That's not good!\" She said through another bite of cake. \"I should probably get some new panties on, but I really don't want this cake to go to waste. Well, I'll put on some new panties when I'm done!\" With that, she continued eating. After she was half way done with the eleventh cake, her panties completely ripped off, revealing her large rear end. \"Oh, crap! I really should put on some more panties now. But...\" she looked over at the cake, longingly. \"This cake really doesn't need to just sit out here. So she finished the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had taken the last bite of the eleventh cake, her bra popped off. She was now completely naked and totally fat. Her butt was the size of two small pillows, her boobs were both the size of two basket balls, and her belly was as big as a small yoga ball. She looked down and saw all of this new fat, and decided that she needed to put some clothes on. \"But I'm still so hungry!\" she said to herself. \"Maybe I should conjure up just one more before putting on some more underwear...\"</span></div></div>",

In fact...\" With that, Sabrina first proceeded to \"use magic\" to make her clothing stretchable despite their being snug and shrunk her backside and breasts. Then, she conjured up a large chocolate cake for herself. It was the size of two wedding cakes, four times as big in length and width and the place where the figurines would go on top was replaced with two Twix bars. She ate the entire cake in five minutes flat. She also started conjuring forty trays, plates and platters with food consisting of the types of especially chocolaty goods from cookies, candies, candy bars, cupcakes, and more along with various pastries When she finished, she knew that she was bigger. Only a small bit, and it was barely noticeable. Her belly, however, still was big and because of magic she used to make her backside and breasts as small as they were earlier, all of the weight started to go into her hips and especially her belly. Her belly also began bulging really fast. She didn't care, though. Not anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect as always!\" said Sabrina, licking her fingers all the while in regards to the cake. \"I'm still hungry, though.

The first thing that happened was that her stomach started sticking out of the bottom of her shirt. She didn't notice this until her whole naval was sticking out. She tried fixing it, but it didn't go well. She would fix it temporarily and then just come back out. The next was that although her backside and breasts were still as small as ever, as stretchable as even her current short sweat pants were, especially they were starting to get ever so slightly snug. She would fix it, but just as her stomach did with her shirt, her short sweat pants were snug around the skin of her body despite how short her backside was and so were her underwear despite how stretchable they were.. She eventually gave up on that. The last problem that she noticed was that as stretchable as her current shirt was getting tight despite being stretchable. She hadn't bought any new shirts since her weight gain, as she had been in even no small concern at all up into this moment, despite her magic using having made all clothing she wore and any future clothing she would wear later on stretchable despite being snug with her current weight gain and her possible later increase in it if she was not careful. It was able to cover her small breasts and chest but was unable to cover her ever growing belly..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina had finished the ninth cake and serving of more of the foods she was eating, then had taken three bites of the tenth cake when she heard a creak in the armed chair she was sitting on. She looked behind her and down, and saw that the creak had been coming from her armed chair in her bedroom. Her weight gaining had expanded to past the limit of her armed chair, and a had started to leave her stuck. \"Uh oh... That's not good!\" She said through another bite of cake. \"I should probably do something with the furniture here, but I really don't want this cake to go to waste. Well, I'll deal with this when I finish what I have here!\" With that, she continued eating. After she was half way done with the tenth cake and and tenth serving of the eighty amounts of every single one of the junk foods she had \"conjured\", when she felt her hips leave her to feel stuck, especially with how big her belly had grown \"Oh, crap! I really should deal with this soon. But...\" she looked over at the food servings, longingly. \"These foods really don't need to just sit out here. So she finished the cake and other foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had taken the last bite of the eleventh cake and other amounts of food plus-surprisingly-eighty more servings of every food of \"junk type including sweets\" amongst them then twelfth servings of all of them, she then tried to see if she could get up, but she was stuck. She was now completely stuck in her chair because of how fat she was. Her backside and breasts were still small, but her hips were slightly swelled and bubbled up along with her shin and thigh parts of her legs. Her belly was also now so big, bloated, swollen, \"porked\", \"plumped\", distended, heavy and fat that it made her look like a humanoid whale pregnant with forty kids at the point of nine months plus ten, eleven, twelve months and four hundred and forty weeks overdue with them while in human form. She looked down and saw all of this new fat, and decided that she needed someone to help her. \"But I'm still so hungry!\" she said to herself. \"Maybe I should conjure up just one more serving of all I've eaten and maybe depending on how hungry I feel bring up two hundred and eighty times as much before calling for someone to help me up.\" And so ...</span></div></div>",

Though she had \"non-conjured food\" at her home from \"fridge and freezer type\" to closet type and \"non-junk food and junk food type\" alike, partly due to the degree she chose-despite it being an associate degree-had enough stress that despite no more than three classes, they and her client business were enough stress for her to \"conjure\" food of primarily \"junk food type\" and have \"order for delivery\" types in excess from \"pizza\" to \"order on the way\", usually in enough excess that at this point, she was not necessarily \"fat\" or \"obese\" but was not as \"skinny\" or \"thin\" as she used to be before university started for her. Her first university year started at that point since the start of September but at one point at a \"Pre-Halloween\" party, someone apologized for not recognizing her at first.
