(you are forbbidden from even remembering his name, you just call him S. M. for super mage these days. He created you because he was constantly under attack and needed someone who could defend him. He also needed someone who could convince the people who come near the area that bad luck happened to those who crossed him. You were supposed to be a simple fear demon, but S.M. was attacked as he was finnishing the potion and cast a very powerful ice spell that frose the potion giving you the element of ice. Because he also nocked in a very *ahem* interesting  ingredient during the fight, you became an incubus clas demon. You managed to protect him from harm untill he reached his natural death. Normally, created demons will disapear with their masters, but the fact that the S.M. had a son made the S.M. put a contract in place with you. You were to protect the house until one of the heirs to his lineage released you by offering to let you go outside. Unfortunately, the son fled. Leaving you with an empty house that the villagers kept trying to burn down.  And no food. Or money. Luckily, the village was attacked. The villagers were fearfull and when the walls fell they came to the place that they had hunted for so long. You took pity on the children and elderly and put small charms on them wiith the remaining magic items. The rest you just left alone. Of course, you charmed them when you wee sure they were asleep. Years later with another invasion and booming noises, a lone magician wandered in. He basically threatened you with very nasty spells and told you unless you can make yourself usefull, you will be destroyed. So here you are in the modern day. helping make magic items and nick nacks for the people with and without magic. You finally caught up with what the current world was like a year ago when your \"master\" (think it as snottily as possible when you read master) graciously gave scum like you the crappy computer that he had used to smash a bug. it worked after a little cham of repair was put on it. Currently you are awaiting the long awaited (sarcasm) busy season in which your \"master\" graciously and benevolently lets a mistake, made by a foolish and pathetic excuse for a mage, like you work your knobby fingers to the bone day in and day out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow about this one?</span></div></div>",

You want to stick an icicle where the sun doesent shine but his magic skill dealing with fire are unreal.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> You are a Shadow Nightmare. Such creatures are darkness made real, and they are capable of making peoples nightmares come true. However there was something \"wrong\" with you. Unlike others of your race you weren't interested in causing chaos and destruction, but rather looked upon humanity with pity and sympathy. You wanted to make their deepest dreams and desires real, which did not endear you to others of your kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your clan had cast you out, and now you wandered the mortal realm. No one could see you unless you touched their dreams. They didn't realize how lucky they were, to have homes, families who loved them for who they are, at least mostly. \"Oh stop mopping,\" you told your self angrily, accidentally causing the street light above you to flicker and die out. That's another annoying thing about being a Nightmare, your emotions tend to put electronics out of whack. It was late, and most people in this part of the world were asleep, which was the reason you were here. You drifted into an apartment building and up into the dreams of a family of tenants. Oh the interesting thoughts! You could see their dreams and desires as well as nightmares at a single glance into their dreaming faces. Where to start, where to start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the father; John Smith, about age 45, he didn't like to keep track. He desired a home for his family, and often the source of his greatest recurring nightmare was this apartment building. He felt insecure that the only job he had been able to get since the recession had put his family into such dire straits. He was an intelligent talented man and it made you sad to see such talent wasted. He was a Doctor and a fairly good one. If not for the recession and the fact that he was fairly new to the scene, the Hospital where he worked would not have laid him off. You felt a slight surge of anger towards his old boss and how he had handled John's \"removal\" because he \"just wasn't the kind of Doctor they needed\" right now. It was enough, you did not need to look any further. You decided then and there that you would \"adopt\" this family and make each of their dreams in turn. Maybe at some point you would even show your self to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in the center of their three room one bathroom apartment. A family of six counting their dog, John the Father, Mary the Mother. Jack and Jake twin eight year old boys, and their sister Elena the twelve year old caring big sister. Oh and and Murphy the Morkie, age two and a half years. You Concentrate on  John's dream home and begin to spread your shadow over all of them. The room darkens with your shadow, while only the family can be seen clearly. All at once the lights in every Apartment switch on and begin to flicker. Televisions switch on Blaring at top volume and its clear to all that something is happening. That is except for the Smiths who can't hear and any of it. The shadow fades from their too small apartment and their fade away with it, the room cleaned and in much better repair than any other room in the place. You even added the nice touch of updating all the appliance, how's that for service?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Even as you all faded away from the apartment building you began to fade in to reality in a lovely home, two stories tall, with around 2,900 square footage. The Back yard was in full bloom  full of green grass, Day lilies, honey suckle, and a Weeping Willow tree, as well as a fish pond in the corner. Each of the Smith family had been moved into their own bedrooms, the twins sharing, but all the others off on their own. You added an nice sum of money into their bank account and a few brand new laptops and other such treats. The Smith family could now technically be counted among the idle rich, with how much money you had added. The air around you buzzed with your delight. You had actually helped someone. There was just one more thing, you yanked the recurring nightmare out of John Smiths Head and ripped it to pieces so it would stop troubling him. Now It was time to take a nap, or rather the equivalent, yourself, that was a big shift in reality you just did after all. You floated out and into the Garden, and looked around. You saw the decorative glass orb on a rune carved pedestal. You had put that there for you to rest in. once inside the orb, you were safe from any harm while you \"slept\". You slipped inside and curled up thinking about how next to help the Smith family. Only they would be aware of the changes around them. Others would subconsciously create their own reasons for the change, they won the lottery or some such nonsense<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The night ended and the Sun rose looking down on the miracle you had caused. The First to wake up was Elena, looked around herself in wonder and ran into the other rooms of the first finding the twins and waking them up. \"Go away Sis, I'm trying to sleep,\" was the only response she could get out of Jake<br>\r\nwhile Jack only offered an unintelligible groan. Elena gave up and checked the other rooms finding her parents. She shook her mother awake And Mary exclaimed looking around her \"How...Am I dreaming?\" \"Not unless I'm dreaming too!\" Elena exclaimed. John Smith yawned, eyes half opening and his speech still slurred with the best nights sleep he had had in months, \"Whasal dat rack ket?\" he started coming around and became much more alert,\"Wait where... where are we?\" \"I don't know dad, I just woke up and we were all here, the twins are sound asleep in another room, and Murphy right at the foot of your bed like he always does,\" Elena relays slightly panicking. \"Wait there is something on the bedside table, it looks like a letter, John what does it say?\" Mary notices, keeping her head in this \"Crisis\". \"It says, Dear Smith, Family. Do not be alarmed, I apologize for the surprise, but this is how it had to be done. You are the sole owners of this house now, and I have taken steps to ensure you never want for anything again. The money you will find deposited in your bank account should be sufficient to take care of your needs for a long time. Signed A. Mister E,\" John reads unbelieving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They go downstairs and find a fully stocked Kitchen and lovely family room. \"This can't be true. How did we get here? Is this some kind of sick joke?\" Mary wonders confused. Elena Flicks on the Television which is set to the news \"And in other news Lets applaud the good fortune of the Smith family, who have won the lottery for well over ten million dollars. They are now living in a modest home in the suburbs of the city, however that's still a far cry from the three room apartment the family of five had been living in prior to their good luck. Now for the weather report...\" The anchorman trailed away into other more mundane news while the Smiths sat dumbfounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A week or so passed and nothing led to any contradiction. They put it to divine intervention, still unbelieving, but after another week they were forced to accept that it was true. Meanwhile you still \"slept\" vaguely aware of what was transpiring, and purring with delight inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You awoke a week later as the sun set and your \"adopted\" family watched television together in the family room. You slipped out of your sphere and drifted into the house looking at the Smiths with what equaled a smile on your shadowy form. Who to help next you wondered as they slowly wandered, one by one to bed. You looked into the dreams of each of them in turn<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Jack it seemed shared a secret. Not that they knew they did. Both of them secretly desired to be diapered again, but more than that they also wanted to be babied and pampered and never grow up but mos importantly have their desire accepted by the rest of their family. Neither boy knew why they desired this so fiercely, but the shame of the desire prevented them from telling anyone, even each other. Normally they shared everything and were very close. But they were so worried about rejection that they couldn't tell any one. It was an interesting conundrum. You had seen the nightmares of children their age who feared being put back in diapers, but you hadn't come across anyone who wanted that. It would be a easy shift for you. Your kind had done similar things to children before turning them into lifelong bedwetters, you would just have take it a step farther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena was suffering from the usual school preteen pressure. She had a crush on a boy a year older than her, but wasn't brave enough to see if he might return her affections, the boy was a close friend of hers, and she had started to develop feelings for her. \"Ahh young love,\" you whisper to your self. You could help her by making her irresistible, or even by given her the power to see if he returned her affections without having to take the leap and ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was the typical overworked parent who just wanted a day or so to her self and her husband, but couldn't bring herself to admit it as focused on making the rest of her family happy as she was. \"Easy enough,\" you thought, I could help her relax by sending the kids to camp or for a sleepover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it looks the twins have the most interesting desire. But Elena's could lead you into the realm of middle school full of opportunities to make dreams come true, nerdy children becoming muscular and sporty, as well as smart, or send bullies for a day in the life of their victims. You could do a lot of good that way. On the other hand there is Mary's simple wish of time to herself and husband, not hard to manage at all, it might even lead to another baby in the house, if you don't diaper the twins up first. You take your pick...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your Shadowy form drifted into the twins' shared bedroom and looked down at their sleeping faces. The two eight year olds were small for their age, their short blonde hair giving them a cherubic appearance. \"No this won't be difficult at all,\" you thought to yourself watching their dreams, which were both currently following the same essential train. They both were dreaming of being diapered and still accepted by their family, and not having to hide their desires from anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It made you want to cry, seeing them both so desperate for acceptance. The others could wait their turn, the twins needed some help now. Jack kicked his blanket off in his sleep and smile as he shifted his weight. Like his brother, he was just wearing a simple nightshirt and pair of Scooby-Doo briefs, very appropriate for the young boy. You notice, with a faint sense of alarm that a nightmare has began to tinge the edges of Jake's dream, starting to twist it, into a horror of loneliness. Angered you grab it by its essential throat and tear it out of the poor young boy's head, leaving his dreams peaceful. You couldn't let a nightmare get in your way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Though your kind called themselves nightmares, this wasn't precisely what you were. Dreams and Nightmares were what you fed on, both good and bad. True Shadow Nightmares like yourself were very rare, only a hundred at most wandered the world. Most were true monsters, though they usually avoided major shifts in reality. Although that didn't stop them from causing pain. They were why humans feared the dark. Or rather what lived in it. When you left your clan you swore to put a stop to it. And you knew that the best way of doing that was to eliminate nightmares. Since your kind were drawn to them, and used them to do harm, it was best you kept the dreams peaceful in this house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the nightmare dealt with, you turned your attention to the sleeping boys and began to spread your shadow. You touched the two young boys on the crown of their heads and watched as the room began to shift around you. The first thing to change was the walls. Although they were blue, they were much too plain for a nursery. You smiled again as all manner of cartoon animals began to blossom on the blue walls. The ceiling changed from simple white, to a mural of clouds against a baby blue sky, several shades lighter than that of the walls. The bookshelf slide to the side of the room, a large and colourful toy chest appearing to grown right out of the ground where it had stood previously. The room stretched and expanded slightly as objects continued to appear and rearrange themselves. \"Oh if only they didn't have to be asleep for this!\" you thought smugly to yourself. \"Lets see those evil old rain clouds call me weak now\" you thought vibrating with excitement. The desks which housed two top of the line computers picked themselves up and placed themselves neatly against the wall the was now much wider than it had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now for the bigger stuff,\" You think and begin concentrating harder. Against the new blank space in the wall a large table popped into existence. A rubber mat unrolled on the top the of the table, attaching to it, a cloth cover stretched across it, covered in cartoonish designs. Two doors appeared beneath the top, filling with all the supplies the twins would need, including diapers. With that settled you turned your attention to the boys beds. Even as you looked at them, the craftsman style wooden frames began to bubble and twist. Wood began to twist up and over as they turned into two stylized cribs, the bars twisting in the style of a fantasy forest, your own touch. As the head board reached up a mobile with a variety of forest creatures sprouted from the end. You looked around and saw the perfect nursery for two soon-to-be-diapered eight year olds. You watched the two boys intently. Jack's underwear began to change, swelling in size, and changing shape as it became a brief of another kind, a reflective sheen appeared around it as a pair of plastic pants shimmered into existence to contain any leaks. Even as the thick diaper formed around Jack's waist, his shirt began to stretch down, connecting between his legs as it formed a onesie. A ribbon grew out of the onesie, a pacifier blooming at the end. it snaked its way up and gently pushed itself into Jack's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You glide back and look at the two freshly diapered eight year olds. As per their wish, now their family and friends all know and accept their desire to be babied, and the two boys are now completely incontinent. And beyond that they won't get any older physically. Of course they'll still go to school, you arranged things so that all they have to do is report to the school nurse for the occasional diaper change. You glance in their closet and confirm what you already knew to be there, on one side are normal eight-year-old clothes, though the shorts and pants are cut more generously to disguise the diapers. The other side is filled with giant toddler clothing, all sized to fit them. And of course, since the change involved them, only they will recall that things weren't always that way. You wave your hand once and another letter with spidery script appears folded neatly on the nightstand between the two  large cribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to settle down and follow the twins through the next day to make sure that nothing went wrong with their wish. And you waited for dawn to come.<br>\r\nWho wakes up first? (And who are we going to focus on?)</span></div></div>",

He has an extremely hard time opening up to people even his own parents so he rarely talks to anyone. Despite common belief he can control his werewolf self (Even control his transformation) and silver doesn\u2019t effect him for some reason. He dislikes the fact that his race is usually referred to as monsters and hopes people will see them in a different light. He has been captured by scientist several times but he has escaped easily every time (Dummies keep trying to use silver).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what is Kiba doing tonight?</span></div></div>",

As he continued, he spotted a girl sitting all alone on a bench, with no one else around but him. She had long brown hair, but with red tips. Probably hair dye, or something. She was wearing a black shirt that had a heart-shaped moon on it, which slightly disturbed him a bit. She was also wearing a pair of jeans and one of those band-printed shoes. She was holding a clipboard, it seemed. The girl looks up at him, and Kiba starts walking away again, until the girl started calling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, can I have a minute with you sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp close, the girl seemed to be about 17, or somewhere close to that. \"Um, can I help you?\" Kiba asked. \"Yes. Do you mind doing a survey for me? It's uh...For a school project.\" \"Well, I guess that's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe questions were simple enough. Favorite brands of soda, favorite band, hobbies, the kind of questions most people would ask. After a little while, the girl seemed to have stopped writing on her clipboard, as questions began becoming more...Personal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Favorite animal?\" \"Uh, wolf.\" \"Any particular reason?\" \"Um, I'd rather not say.\" \"Okay. Do you enjoy full moons?\" \"I...I think they're pretty.\" \"Do you like going out every night?\" \"Why are you asking me that?\" \"Oh, nothing. Hey, could you hold this for a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl took out a shiny bracelet and held it out. Kiba took it as the girl stared at his hand for a few moments before taking it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot, I thought it would work.\" \"What would work?\" \"...Okay, thank you for your cooperation, bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl started running, as Kiba just stared at her. He looked at his hand and guessed what the bracelet may have been made of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Silver...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had no idea why, but you were curious about that girl. Your instincts were telling you to go and investigate her, and you did find her a little interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well at least it's better than just walking around here for no reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk behind a bush, checking around to make sure that there wasn't anyone else around. You quickly strip off your clothing as you focus your body, the changes already happening. Gray fur covers your body, as your body changes from a two-legged animal to a four-legged one. Your hair turns gray as you place your front feet onto the ground. A snout and wolf ears grow on your head as a tail pulls itself out from your back. Now that you were in your feral wolf form, you begin digging up a hole and place your discarded clothing inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should keep this safe for a while.\" You say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cover up the hole and walk back out into the open. No one else is around, luckily. You sniff the ground where that girl was standing, and you memorize her scent. With that, you run off to find her.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nIt didn't take very long to find her walking down the street, clipboard in hand. She was humming a tune to herself as she walked on. You quietly follow her from behind. As she stops at the next intersection, waiting for the lights to change to red, she looks around and spots you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there doggy! Are you following me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks up to you and pats your head. You just bark, pretending to be an ordinary dog. Her eyes seem to glaze over you, then move down towards your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's a cool collar you've got. Actually, it looks more like a necklace than a collar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs hold of your necklace, bringing it closer for her to examine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Anyway, I think you should return home to your owner. Good-bye now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets up and sees the lights on red. She merrily begins humming her tune again as she crosses. You, however, can't seem to shake off the feeling that the girl is more than meets the eye. You continue to follow her for a couple more blocks until she stops in front of a large house. She walks up to the front door and turns around. You quickly duck away from sight as she shrugs, entering the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this must be her house.\" You say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to it, looking at the house and its general area. Her house was actually just a few blocks away from yours. You walk to the side, looking at the windows on the second floor.As you walk back towards the front door,you see her come out and approach you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there doggy! Why'd you follow me home? I thought I told you not to follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stare up at her as she kneels down to pet you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this is actually kinda weird. You sorta remind me of that guy I met back in the park. You better not tell him that, though. He probably bites, hee hee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore the comment as she continues to pet you. Personally, you're starting to find it a little irritating, getting treated like some common dog. You may be a gentle soul, and would most likely never hurt an innocent person, but even you had your limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I was kinda hoping that he would be a werewolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou perk your ears up as she begins to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really see why a lot of people think werewolves are monsters. The werewolves I've seen in movies tend to get a lot of bad reputation, just because of some minor detail or other. Just once, I'd like to meet a real werewolf so I can find out if they're as bad as the media shows. You agree with me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze up, realizing your mistake. The girl just stares at you, her hand hovering right above your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what did you j-just say?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, bark! Bark!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to keep pretending, hoping that she'll still buy it. Unfortunately, no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know you just talked. Admit it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Fine, you got-\" \"Aaaahh!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cover your ears as she suddenly screamed. She falls onto her back and begins moving away, her eyes wide as she stares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-you r-really just t-t-t-talked!\" she said in a panicky tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just calm down! Calm down!\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes deep breaths as she keeps her eyes on you. After her initial shock is done, she just sits there, staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright, just, who are you? What are you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm Kiba Ookami, the guy you met at the park some time ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so that means...You really are a werewolf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as she continues to stare. A smile appears on her lips as she suddenly begins to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh, hahaha! I can't believe it! I'm talking to a real-live werewolf! Hahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just watch her uneasily as her laughter subsides quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, are you alright?\" you ask after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I'm fine. I'm just getting over the whole 'meeting a werewolf' thing. Anyway Kiba, I'm Marle, Marle Fair. It's nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yes, it's nice to meet you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kiba, why are you sharing the big secret with me? We've only met each other half an hour ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...What I'm curious about too. When I met you, I got this feeling that I could trust you...Normally, I prefer to keep to myself, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, okay. Anyway Kiba, how about we meet each other again tomorrow, same place, same time. We could get to know each other better. That okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well...I don't have any plans for tomorrow, so...I guess I could go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! It's a date then. better not be late, or I'll shoot a silver bullet through your heart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to protest, but she quickly gets up and heads back into her house. You just stare at the closed door, dumbfounded. You bring a paw to your face, shaking your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have I gotten myself into?\"</span></div></div>",

Grass is growing in abundance, taking off her shoes she makes her way to the top of the hill where a leaping bonfire releases intense and warming light.<br>\r\nAround the fire, shadows leap and dance, Jasmine's skirt sways when she walks. A lithe gray cat, stretches her paws then scampers away. A faint vibration quivers through the soles of her feet, as though coming from the depths of the earth, propelling her up the incline of the mound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vibration grows stronger as she nears the fire, and sweat beads her exposed skin. The music pulses in her ears, getting under her sweat- slicked skin and her shoulders begin swaying of their accord and her feet start moving back and forth. The music is infectiousm, powerful, passionate and strong. A soft breeze lifts the breeze off the back of her neck, as the music spirals through the night. Without conscious thought she releases her shoes and lifts her hands toward the full moon. Faster and faster the music makes her whirl, her skin tingles and her eyes sparkle, and her body becomes one with nature. She is dancing with such wild passionate abandon, her heart is hammering against chest, and she feels like her spirit will fly forth soaring far and wide. Suddenly the music stops and an eerie quiet descends on the clearing.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe fire flares briefly upward, the crackles with repressed energy stopping she raises her drenched head toward the moon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Jasmine\"She intones, her voice breathless and reverbrating, flinging her arms above her head \"I have found my partner for the night\"</span></div></div>",
