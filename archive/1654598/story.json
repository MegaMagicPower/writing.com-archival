As you throw on some jeans and a t-shirt, there is a strange tickly rippling feeling starting from your toes and fingers which works its way around your whole body in a second and the vanishes.

As fast as you possibly can, you make it to the edge of the pool and rest for a few moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam, what do you think you're doing?\" Coach Mack barked out, glaring at you with a dangerous look in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, coach,\" you say between deep breaths. \"But I have this rash on my chest. I can hardly swim.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares at you for a few seconds, apparently trying to decide whether or not to trust you. Eventually, he grunts and motions his head for you to get out of the pool.

It's been a weird morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you agree. \"I'll go down and see the nurse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill dripping wet, you run back down to the locker room and dry yourself before you dress and head up to the nurse's office. </span></div></div>",

It has grown at least 3 inches in total today.  You finish drying off and look at it again, but this time just disregard it as being some o trick.  ( You also do not even notice that you still don't have any balls). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start putting on your clothes and first put your underwear on,  followed by your pants, when you put them on you noticed that they both felt pretty loose, you didn't have time to try to find some replacement clothes though, because your chest was really itching.   As you were about to put your shirt on you see that those itchy lumps have increased swelling since you were last in the locker room.  You finish by putting on socks and shoes and head off for the nurse's office.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are there you tell the very cute 24 year old nurse, Miss Behl, \"Miss Behl, I think that I have a rash.\" \"Oh, where is it?\" She asked.  \"It is on my chest\" \"Ok well lets go it'll my room and I will check it out.\"  You follow her into her room and she asks you to remove your shirt.  At first you hesitate at someone asking to see your chest, but remember that is why you came here in the first place.  You take off your shirt, and notice that your chest is a lot it hire than before, raising both arms over your head to do so, and when your shirt was off.  You looked down at your chest and saw that your pants and underwear had fallen off!!!  You also notice that your already seemingly larger dick has definitely gotten larger and just now you notice that you do not have any balls!!! You shriek a very girlish shriek and cover your penis up and then look at Miss Behl's face. You see that it is crimson red and she is trying to cover her mouth from showing a slight giggle and that she is still looking at your penis that is not very well covered by your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also this time that you noticed your chest throbbing even worse from the itching.  You quickly pull up your pants and then itch at your nipples to relieve the immediate pain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to your chest now?</span></div></div>",

You're glad once you finally get the shirt off and toss it aside. The swelling on your chest has gotten worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Behl frowns and leans down to examine your chest more closely. As she does, her low-cut top reveals an ample amount of cleavage. You stare at it shamelessly, your dick stirring in your pants. You will it to go down, but being in such close proximity to the beautiful school nurse makes it nearly impossible. Your cock creates a much larger tent in your pants than it used to. You can't believe it, Nurse Behl is going to notice for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like you had an allergic reaction to something,\" Nurse Behl says. \"I'd suggest...oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Behl's eyes lock on to your crotch.

The door is locked. Now show me what you're working with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe what's happening, but you're definitely enjoying it. Almost instantly you drop your pants. Your dick makes an incredibly impressive bulge in your boxer briefs; Nurse Behl grins when she sees it. You struggle taking your underwear off your cock is so big. Once your finally free it from its confines, you can't believe your eyes. Your cock looks like something right out of a porno. It has to be at least a foot long and as thick as your fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, you're enormous!\" Nurse Behl exclaims, and you swell with pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forget your sensitive chest as Nurse Behl takes your cock in her mouth, teasing the massive mushroom head with her tongue. You groan in pleasure and grab the back of her head, forcing her to take more of your massive rod. She moans favorably and starts sucking with gusto. Her voluptuous lips slide up and down, up and down over your dick. She can still only fit over the first six inches of your cock. You moan loudly and grab your very sensitive nipples, playing with them between your fingers as Nurse Behl continues pleasuring you. You can feel yourself getting close. You grab her head once again and force her farther and farther onto your cock. Pressure builds up in your lower body, more intense than you've ever felt before. Finally, Nurse Behl takes your entire cock i her mouth and you immediately shoot your load straight down your throat. You can't believe how much semen you produce, you just keep shooting load after load. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, your orgasm subsides and you let Nurse Behl go. She coughs and tries to catch her breath. You look down and see that you're still hard. </span></div></div>",

Fortunately, it only seemed to last as long as the last one so finishing off your business you made to stand up but as you did, something gave way and you endend up on the floor. Embarassed after your brief faceplant, you quickly picked yourself up and examined your legs. They seemed fine, as hairy as ever (your swimming coach wasn't too pleased at this and was constantly trying to get you to shave them, to shave some time off your sprints), but looking closer, your knees felt different. They looked out of proportion, too thin for your legs and slightly red, probably from the fall. Although, like most people, you don't spend much time looking at your legs, something was definately different.<br>\r\nCatching a glimpse of the bathroom clock, its 7:20, you had to be in the pool by 8, \"$H!*!!!, I'm going to miss the bus!\", so hareing off down the stairs and out down the track to the bus stop you go.</span></div></div>",

Your legs still felt a little funny from before, it wasn't uncomfortable but somehow it just felt like you could feel the fabric of your jeans more. The reason for this was soon revealed. While getting ready, you noticed that all the hair had vanished from your legs leaving them smooth. No need to panic, one of your mates had obviously sneaked into your room and shaved your legs in your sleep, either that or your brother, yeah that had to be it. You also noticed that someone had put an electric pink swimming cap in your bag, \"Grr, Josh... When I get back I'm going to make him pay\", you say to yourself. Swimming caps were mandatory so you had no choice but to wear it.<br>\r\nPoolside, you join the rest of your group and wait for the coach. On the other side, there she is, annoyingly wearing the same colour swimming cap, \"Oh great, now its going to look like I'm so desperate that I'm copying her\". \"Oi mate, nice cap\" comes a mocking tone from behind. Looking round you see he has a big grin on his face, Joe, you'd known him for quite a while, he was alright but delighted in taking the mick out of anyone.<br>\r\n\"Give over will you? Anyway, it doesn't matter what colour hat I've got, I'm still going to beat you today\", you say in retaliation returning the big grin.<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes the coach turns up and begins explaining the session ahead and the 'big event' coming up where only the fastest male and female swimmer would be entered in for. Once that was over, the other lads get set away swimming but the coach pulls you to one side. \"I've got my eye on you my boy, between you and me I think you'll be the one we take to nationals but I still want to see you working hard out there. Oh and by the way I see you've finally got around to shaving those forests you call legs there, as well as the bright pink swimming cap? I see someone's embracing their feminine side.\" You laugh it off. \"Now get going, 8 lengths freestyle warm up, chop chop!\"</span></div></div>",

Still in awe of what you were watching, you sense that the noise around you is building. \"RACHEL!!!

I thought we'd still have a couple of weeks before deciding who goes, but apparently not, now get in there and do your best!\"<br>\r\n Everyone hopped back into the water and waited until they got their signal. It was only one lane so everyone had to wait their turn which gave you some time to think. \"He just yelled Rachel at me didn't he!?\" you suddenly realize.

The classmates who were also in the lessons you took were mostly girl's, in fact you were the only guy. It wasn't all bad though, after all the girl's skirts would often fly pleasingly up. However, the locker rooms weren't open until you had arrived, and , in all the confusion, you were accidently swept up into the girl's locker room. Trying to escape proved useless, but then you took a second to think. You were in the girl's room, and for some reason the girls hadn't raised a objection about your presence. Rachel, a fellow tennis player (and also the girl you had a crush on), called out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ad, if you don't hurry up and change, the coach will get pissed.\" And with that, you really did have no choice but to go over to Rachel and start striping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off your clothes was uneventful, unless you count the incredibly attractive girl who was undressing down in front of you without a care in the world. It was hard not to stare, so you settled on doing so descretly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Moments later, you feel a slight breeze around your privates. Your jaw slackens. You had forgot that you normally wear compression shorts with you played tennis, as it kept your junk in place. However, that means you had to take off your underwear, and when you had started staring at Rachel, you had unconsciously taken off your underwear! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quicker than you ever had in your entire life, you grabbed your compression shorts from your bag, and slide them up your leg. In your speed, you don't notice that your shorts had changed.

Reaching into the locker you feel a slight resistence, as if the air is charged with static. Bracing for the electric jolt you felt sure would come, you grab the item. Nothing. Relieved, you begin to retract your hand towards your waiting bag but instead of moving you feel a searing pain spread across your chest. Instinctively dropping the bra back in the locker, the pain stops. Closing the door, you say \"Well I suppose its going to have to stay there then...\" a little too loudly. Someone was surely playing a trick on you, some new practical joke that was going around, yeah that's it.<br>\r\n\"What's going to have to stay in where?\" a voice came from behind. Wheeling around to you see Robert with a disgruntled look on his face who says, \"come on, its unlike you to be late for sport, actually you've been acting strange all day, what's up?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing\" you reply, you could see from his face that he wasn't buying it so you add \"its just something for my mum's birthday, I picked it up from the shop this morning, a card and some stuff you know...\" it was a long shot but it seemed to have worked.<br>\r\n\"OK, come on then, coach already thinks that I'm trying to skip sport for good, I can't be late!\"<br>\r\n\"Alright\". You make to go but then say, \"Actually, I'll catch you up, there's something I need to do first\".<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" came the reply, you wait to make sure he'd gone and then give yourself a little pat around the chest.<br>\r\n\"What was that - OW!\" the shock seemed to have made your nipples more sensitive than before but everything else was fine. \"I'm sure its alright, I'm just imagining things, I don't really know how they were before\". You make to go again but your thoughts go back to that bra sitting there in your locker. \"I can't leave it in there, that was too close with Robert just then but I can't take it to reception without being way too late. I could always just take it with me, its not as if anyone is going to look through my bag. What should I do?\"</span></div></div>",

Grabbing hold of the bra you expect the same searing pain to come back, it did not. Instead, where the pain had been before it felt better than usual, like something warm was being pressed up against your chest from inside. But now was not the time to figure this out. Shoving it down into the bottom of your kitbag, you started running down the halls towards the gym. While running it was strange to feel the inside of your shirt rubbing against your chest, it was softer than touching it by hand, but by the time you reached the changing room it had become really irritating. For some reason, the closer you got to the gym, a mounting sense of dread had built up. Usually you loved sport but today the idea of playing football and getting all muddy and sweaty just put you down. Going to get ready, the other boys were looking at you strangely, as if they forgot who you were, if they had then they quickly remembered as one of them said \"Hey, its not like you to be late, you're on Bazz's team by the way\".<br>\r\nYou let out a slight sigh and say to yourself \"Urgh, not Tim Barret, what an idiot, was going to take him down...\". Putting your hate of 'Bazz' aside, you put your bag down next to Robert's and start to get ready. While formulating a plan to how to still tackle Bazz and make it look like an accident, or even better HIS fault, Robert turned to you looking quite alarmed and said \"Whoa dude, bad rash you've got going on there, you should go see someone about that\"<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n\"Look at your chest man!\", looking down you could see that the whole surface of your chest had turned blochy red, getting redder towards your nipples.

Both you and Robert laugh. \"Yeah, I do like getting new gear. I showwed you my new shoes, right after I smashed you in the last game.\" Robert says laughing harder. You shake your head. \"Yeah, we'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying football with an ichy chest isn't a good idea, as to quickly discover. After a few tackles, you decide that tackling hurts too much. Still you're fast, and can easily outrun nearly everyone, so you have a reasonable game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the game. you smirk as you remember tricking Tim. You was running, keeping his attention on you with the ball, and not the surroundings, you you was glad to see him run straight into the other team. Both you and Robert enjoyed seeing that, and you're joking with each other. Since sport is last, you can take as much time as you need, so you normally take your time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude. That rush still there. You should get it checked\" Robert says. \"Yeah, it stopped me tackling, but it will clear up in a day or so. Probably due to me not drying properly. Catch you tomorrow\" you say, as he leaves. Soon you're the only one left. You look closely at the rash, and see it is from rubbing and your chest is slightly swollen. Your thoughts return to the bra in your bag, wondering if anyone saw this rash and decided to play some sort of a joke on you. Sure a bra would reduce the rubbing but.....</span></div></div>",

However, the itchiness died away as soon as the fabric touched your chest so you decided just to hope that no one got close enough to see until you got to the locker. Passing the mirror before the exit, you catch yourself by surprise, it looked like your hair was a little bit longer again and maybe even a little lighter, \"Nah, the lighting down here's always rubbish and it doesn't feel any different anyways...\"<br>\r\nIt was 10 minutes after the bell had gone so the hallways were practically deserted except for a few here and there making their way to the bus.

I've heard that there's one shoot out every five minutes guarenteed, its going to be awesome.\"<br>\r\nYou still haven't got the foggiest idea what he's on about but you play along, it might be worth seeing, \"Oh of course, we'd better get going then.\" you say. Just outside the school gates is a whole group of your classmates waiting the walk down to the cinema, you start to get worried, *Oh no, someone's bound to notice eventually*. Robert hadn't seemed to have noticed anything out of the ordinary with your coat which was lucky but then again he could be a bit dopey, so before you join the group you say \"Hey, look, about the coat...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah? What about it?\"<br>\r\nAstounded that he still hasn't noticed anything, you push him a little further \"Well does it look any different than usual?\". <br>\r\nWith that he stopped and looked you up and down for a few seconds \"Errrrm, no, it doesn't, same coat you've had for a year - I was there when you bought it remember. Hang on, wait a sec, I see what you've done, hahaha, you've washed it and about time too, it was starting to look more yellow than red!\" *How can he not have noticed anything, same coat? Needs his eyes testing or something... but at least this means that the others probably wont see anything either, maybe I have had this coat for a long time, it feels right*. By now you'd both reached the rest of the lads and had all started to walk into town. While walking, your mind turned to all the things happening today and you got a headache, the more you thought about them and the stronger the headache was. As soon as you started to think about something else, the headache went away. You were going to start thinking about this when you were distracted by a shaking in your front coat pocket. Reaching in, you pulled out a phone which was ringing which said on the display \"Incoming...Sophie\" *WTF!? If this is my coat like Robert said and my phone which is what it looks like, then why is Sophie ringing me, also, I haven't even registered her number* Deciding you'd better answer it you pick it up and say \"Errr, hello?\"<br>\r\nSure enough, it was Sophie on the other side, \"Hi there Ad! Me and a few of the girls are going to see this new film 'A husband's wife's love', it starts at 7 so there's plenty of time to get ready, see you there?\"<br>\r\n\"Wha-? How di-? Erm...\"<br>\r\n\"Great! Meet at that bench at the front. Oh and my dad says he can drop you off back home after so you can tell yours that he's fine.

Turning around, you see a car pull up alongside you with Sophie's head sticking out the window grinning at you. \"We're dropping you off back home remember, come on get in!\" she says. You obey and pile into the back seat. You find Rachel is sitting in the back as well with Sophie sitting in the front and who was presumably her dad driving. Glad that you don't have to walk, you relax back into the seat and feel the car start up and move underneath you. You start regretting that you hadn't taken your coat off when you'd got in but then you remember the bra and the risk of it being seen so you try to think of something else to take your mind off the heat. Even though she'd been nice tonight and hadn't mentioned anything that had happened in the past, you still need to pluck up enough courage to ask Rachel a question, the first thing that came to mind was \"So, Rachel... what do you think of Mrs Saunders?\". Mrs Saunders was a new girl's sports teacher who occasionally helped out with other sports after school, you did sport and she was a girl, so it wasn't a completely random question.<br>\r\n \"She's nice enough, I suppose. You should have seen her though, she went completely off it with Danielle the other day, it was hilareous... but you were there right? What did you think last week when she hit the ball too far into the forest then started complaining that it was our fault and made us all go and look for it?\"<br>\r\n You didn't know what she was going on about, you hadn't seen this new teacher in action and definately weren't in her class. Deciding not to embarass her or yourself, you play along and say some vague answer that doesn't say whether you were actually there or not. \"Yeah, she sounds a little crazy, did anyone actually find that ball in the end?\"<br>\r\n \"No. Not that I know of, she'll probably have us all out looking for it again this week.\". You give a little laugh and move the hair from out of your eyes, only to have it fall back in place again. Come to think of it, you can remember moving the hair out of your eyes throughout the second movie about once a minute. \"It can't be that long\" you think to yourself and grab a strand that was tickling your chin and start twiddling in your fingers. \"I'm sure it was only ear-length this morning\", you think, \"the seat must be pushing it forwards\" you decide. The heat under your coat was getting hotter, but only in your upper body, you could start to feel the straps of the sports bra pressing into you back, so you lean a little forwards, seemingly into the heat as it got hotter, especially your chest. Looking out the window, the car was arriving at your street at last. Suddenly you realize \"I can't just get out without saying anything, what's Sophie's dad's name?\" You wrack your brains but you've never even seen this man let alone know his name. You were getting closer to the house \"I'm just going to have to use her last name instead\" you decide, now came the trouble of remembering that. \"Its close to the start of the register, erm 'Ball', no...\" The car ground to a halt, you open the door and step out saying \"Thanks Mr Bell!\", relieved to have remembered.<br>\r\n \"No problem\" came the reply from inside. \"See you later Ad!\" said a rather startled Sophie, and you were sure you heard \"Bye Adele\" from Rachel. The car drove off and you stood there for a minute in the cold air cooling down. Walking towards the front door, you suddenly realize, \"What did Rachel call me?...\"</span></div></div>",

Well, maybe being a cheerleader won't be as bad....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking that last thought, you continue to walk to the changing rooms doors, for both male and female. Though you know what changing room to go into, the boys, you feel the natural urge to go into the girl's changing room. In fact, you also walked into there if it was by habit! Knowing better but not knowing why you did that, you go into the boys changing room regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in, you see that everyone but Robert has gone out already to the playfield. Seeing that Robert hasn't begun changing yet, you gave a causal smile to him as you pass by to get to your locker, with Robert giving a smile back as he started to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you open your locker, you looked down on yourself, thinking on what to do. Sure, you're wearing your jacket but with that black sports bra under your t-shirt, how are you going to hide that fact you're wearing a black bra under a white t-shirt?<br>\r\nThen, you remember that the school has two variations of P.E uniforms! For both sexes, the choice in colour for P.E shirts is either white, red or a red/black jumper variant, for heavy sport such as rugby for the boys and a t-shirt for things like badminton or tennis. Lucky for you, the red t-shirt that you have was washed recently and was packed in your bag!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to yourself, you kneel down to get the red t-shirt out of your bag when you suddenly noticed that Robert has taken his shirt off. Instead of dismissing it as usually, your eyes seem draw to his chest area. It seems like he's been working out lately, probably with weights. It certainly makes him look more attractive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat catches you off guard, as you look away from Robert quickly as you had noticed that weird thought. As you begin to change, you feel your face heating up, if embarrassed by what happened.....or was it because you thinking Robert is becoming more hot?<br>\r\nWhile you change, you fail to notice that your eyes have become blue than grey, looking like sapphire-blue. Also, the length of your hair has increased as well, nearly touching your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThink how much of a pain this is to have this long hair, you then noticed a scrunchie in your locker as you were putting shorts on. Glancing to see that Robert is gone, having finished changing, you grab it to have a closer look. It is a normal black scrunchie, used to tie up hair. Normally, if you saw this, you would discard it straight away as you don't have a use for, but since you have much longer hair, you decide to use to wrap up your (increasing in length) hair, so it won't get in the way when you're playing football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your hair is in a ponytail and you feel satisfied with how you look, you cheerfully jog out of the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

You don't normally like it as much as other sports, but now that sounds fine. You find your performance in the game strange: you can consistently hit the ball, but it doesn't fly as far as you think it should. You're still able to run ok, but can only make it one base at a time. In addition, the exertion is more tiring than it should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you're done, your hips have pushed out more and your waist is narrower. You idly run your hand along the side of your body, wondering why you seem curvier. You are snapped out of your thoughts, though, by Sophie calling \"Hey Ad, hurry up!\" You go to leave with the girls, before realizing you're headed in the direction of the girls' lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you realize what's happening, you find yourself pushed into the girls' locker room. You realize where you are a minute too late, and brace yourself for the screams, but none come. You look around, face red, but none of the girls seem to care about you at all. Rachel gently pushes you in front of a locker, one with the same locker number as your one in the boys' locker room. \"Over here, Adele,\" she says, before returning to getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill embarrassed, you try your combination on this locker, and it works. All your stuff is inside. You put your clothes on as quickly as you can, take your bag, and rush out. You're in such a hurry that you don't notice that your pants now reach only halfway past your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to ignore what happened, you quickly head to your next class, math. It passes fine, without incident, as do the rest of your classes, until lunch. Normally you have a large lunch, but now you just get a burger and some water. You find a place to sit alone and start to eat, when a voice catches your attention: \"Hey Ad, mind if I sit here?\" You shake your head, the look up to see...</span></div></div>",

You turn red remembering being in the girls' locker room, but Rachel misinterprets the reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you shouldn't be embarrassed that you're not so good at gym, Ad,\" she says, \"You're really smart; you don't need sports.\" Not wanting to tell her the real reason, you let her think that, and just nod. For the remainder of the lunch period, Rachel talks to you, but you can't follow what she's saying at all - it's boring girly talk. Through all of it, you just say \"uh-huh\". Near the end of lunch, though, Rachel smiles. \"I know you're not interested in girl-talk, but it's nice to talk to you anyway. Thanks for listening to boring ol' me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" you say, your voice getting higher and softer. She gets up and leaves, and since you're done eating, you do the same, and head to your next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the school day passes uneventfully. Your chest itches a bit, and your hair keeps getting in your eyes, but that's it. As you leave to go home, Rachel and Sophie pass by. \"Hey Ad,\" says Rachel, \"See you tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you,\" you respond, your voice now quite high and soft. You flinch at it, and stop Robert as he walks by. You want to know what's going on, but don't want to draw attention to the weird things happening with you, so you just ask \"Have you noticed anything strange lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really,\" he says. \"You had that rash and you seem nervous but that's not really strange...\" he trails off, shrugs, and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think it over, scratch at your itching chest, and head home.</span></div></div>",

You tried to shake your head of them, trying to focus on eating instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Light lunch I see.\" Robert smiled, biting into the sandwich he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well I wasn't feeling too hungry..\" you trailed off a bit, taking a bite of your burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's nothing wrong with that,\" Robert smiled. Somehow, that smile alone seemed to be making your face even redder. \"As long as you don't starve yourself of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I'll do that.\" you said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was almost embarrassing. Not too long ago, you both were hanging out like two good friends. Now things felt kind of awkward for you. Granted, it didn't exactly feel bad. Heck, that warmth in your cheeks almost made you smile a bit. It didn't help your internal confusion all the same though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat also wasn't helping was that feeling on your legs. While Robert wasn't looking, you took a look down, seeing how short your pant legs were right now. The hem of the leggings seemed closer to your knees now, showing off more of those thigh-length socks you had put on before coming to school. You couldn't help but notice that your calves underneath the socks seemed a bit curvier too, kind of like the rest of your body right now.</span></div></div>",

After his comments, you felt even more awkward, which wasn't helped by the fact his presence made you feel weird. Two uncomfortable minutes of silenced flew past before you said, \"Excuse me.\" You just had to get out of there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert didn't say anything, or at least anything that you could hear as you walked away, leaving your bag with him. You needed time to compose yourself, since talking to your friend suddenly seemed so hard. Still feeling flushed, you headed to the bathrooms, which were halfway down the halls. Without even thinking, you walked into the closest one, which was the girls. Only once you were inside did you realize your error. Softly, you swore, expecting to hear a scream at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone came, but the lack of reaction left you feeling confused. First the locker room, now this. The bathroom wasn't exactly empty, as a couple of girls were standing by the sinks, talking. Slightly worried if you had been seen, you dashed into on of the stalls.</span></div></div>",

You froze a bit as she spoke, your hand still on the handle to the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um.....\" you stumbled a bit. Why did she not scream or anything? Wasn't this weird to them? \"I....I guess so....Is this not strange?\" you stumbled a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl just smiled, as did her friend next to her. \"Of course not. Why would it be? I'm Tori by the way. I don't think we've met before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Melanie.\" the brown-haired girl smiled next to her. She had nice hazel eyes on her beaming face. \"What's yours if I may ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Ad.\" you spoke after a second. You felt compelled to say \"Adele\" like Rachel had been calling you, but you didn't want to say that to them. \"E-excuse me, I need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went inside after saying that, though Tori just told you to take your time in a cheery matter. That didn't exactly make you feel much better after you closed the door. Why was no one making a big fuss about this? It made no sense. Unfortunately though, you didn't get much time to think about it when you felt something around your knees again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is-Ahh!\" you cried to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pants are climbing your legs again, exposing even more of your thigh-high socks. You couldn't help but notice how smooth they looked now, before shaking your head of the thought. In any case, they weren't really stopping this time, as the pants climbed up and over your knees. Once they did, you sat them latching on to each other at a small point at the bottom, but as they climbed, they came closer together, the fabric seemingly molding as one as you felt your legs forced closer. The material softened up, becoming smoother around your legs as they became more flowing. There was no doubt to what they were. A skirt was now flowing around your curvy legs, your long legs seemingly going on forever underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What is going on?\" you cried to yourself, just trying not to scream. \"This...this is so wrong....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you pushed the door open again, now a little panicked.</span></div></div>",

It was almost like you had this crush on him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, no\" you softly moaned as you realized that was what was happening. Finding yourself in a bra, or a skirt was bad enough, but having a crush on of best friend? That was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Ad?

It was embarrassing enough to be wearing these long socks and a skirt, not to mention the uggs that you were wearing because of yesterday.

You groaned and whined to yourself again, figuring that it was yet another change, and you would be right about that. You looked down to your torso, seeing your t-shirt beginning to tighten slightly around your body. It didn't get tight or anything, but still much more conforming. Your short sleeves began climbing down your arms, covering them all the way down to your wrists as they began taking on a lavender color. As if to add more to it, you felt a bit more skin being exposed around your neckline, which even showed a bit of the sports bra underneath. In the end, it was a lavender long-sleeved shirt that now adorned you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all of your clothes were girly, except for the male underwear you still wore underneath the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh.....thank goodness Robert and the others aren't laughing.\" you said to yourself.

I've kind of had a rough day, so I'm going home\" you said, not wanting to admit you were planning on going to the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're skipping practice?\" Rachel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave an inadvertent smile; the girl you were slowly turning into was still into sports, so this nightmare wasn't total. Additionally, Rachel was into the same sports as the normal you, so you figured it couldn't be something too bad. \"I just felt overwhelmed, but I guess I'm good for practice.\" Slowly, you reopened your locker, and gave a slight, feminine squeak. There was an extra bag on top of your textbooks. Grabbing it, you allowed yourself to be dragged by Sophie to the changerooms. Naturally, it was the girls, and unlike before, it only had you, and the two girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get changed. We're late\" Rachel moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the strange bag, and gave a louder, even more girlish squeak. Inside was.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not to mention, inside the bag, there was even a little pair of panties, a nice sky blue color in fact. Just the very fact that it could replace the one piece of male clothing you still had left made your face go red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh.....it won't end.\" you sighed, pulling both the leotard and panties out of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls were beginning to leave, so you had some privacy. You stripped your uggs, socks, and skirt off, seeing your male underwear on your oddly shaped body now. Reluctantly, you shimmied down your underwear, seeing your privates. You couldn't help but see that your manhood was just a tiny bit smaller than before. You sighed again as you tried pulling up the provided panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh...they're really tight.\" you groaned through your teeth as you pulled them up, letting them rest on your waist. Predictably, they were uncomfortable around your manhood, though they were rather loose around your hips and butt. Most likely because you were still rather thin to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, in any case, the big one was next, so you stripped your lavender shirt off, pulling the leotard up. Figuring your way around it, you were able to slip yourself in, your arms going through the long sleeves and out. Making sure it was snug enough, you adjusted it around your bottom, in which case the garment didn't feel like a proper fit. Again, you didn't really have a female figure yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost feels like it's mocking me.\" you said to yourself, even looking at the front and seeing that the lack of breasts left the top part a bit loose as well. You could only hope that didn't cause a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, and your hair still in it's ponytail, you followed the way you saw Rachel and Sophie leave. It didn't take too long to see them, already dressed in their leotards as well. Fittingly, you could see every inch of their curves through them, though you felt no reaction like you would have as a boy. Rachel smiled in any case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time, slow poke.\" she smiled as she grabbed your arm. \"Come on, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you basically got escorted to the gym, where upon opening the doors, you could see numerous other girls, gathering around in similar outfits.</span></div></div>",

Forgetting that you'd planned to go to the mall, you just head straight home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home, the first thing you do is get started on your homework. Unlike in class, you're able to concentrate just fine, and you get it done in a decent amount of time.

Thankfully, it was about the usual for a family meal, listening to your parents talk about their day, occasionally asking about your own. You kind of answered vaguely in return, which in all honesty was kind of how you usually acted anyway. However, your mom did bring up how gymnastics practice was, surprising you a bit though you supposed that was a sign of how things were changed. Again, you just said it was okay. It was just one of those days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh.....I'm beat..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said that as you entered your room, closing the door as you were getting ready for bed. You still had zero idea what was going on. Heck, for a minute, you tried a Google search but that predictably yielded no viable results. This whole phenomenon just seemed so random and there was no way to trace it anywhere. Such a thing frustrated you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So annoying.\" you groaned as you brushed your teeth, meanwhile taking the scrunchie out of your hair. That allowed your long blonde hair to fall past your shoulders, still about as neat and straight as before. Testing it a bit, you could see that it went at least to the top of your back, definitely longer than any guy's hair at your school. Sighing again, you finished that up and went back to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the same spot as your normal pajamas, you found instead a nightgown. You had hoped to at least see some pajama pants or something, but apparently this girl you were becoming had no pants of any kind. Great, as if this wasn't frustrating enough. It was white in color of course, and was at least somewhat comforting as you slipped it on. It still looked kind of weird on your strange body. You had some girly traits, but still many male ones left on you. Well, that was a thought process for another time. You were tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....guess I'll have to wait to see what happens next.\" you nodded to yourself as you slipped into your bed, turning the lights out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*****Dream*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place you were in was loud with the crowd there, cheering from every direction. It looked like a stadium of sorts, but you did't have much time to see much of it. The reason why was because you were moving so much. Suddenly, you dipped every which way, be it upside down or sideways. Were those...gymnastic thing? Like the balance beam? That was there, and at one point you could see yourself hanging upside down on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Ad!\" You heard a cry, hearing Rachel's voice from nearby. You could turn your head to see her cheering, which seemed to get you going even faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene then shifted to you on what seemed like a floor, jumping and flipped elegantly. By the time it was done, you could actually feel how tired you were, but that seemed interupted when you saw Robert nearby, also cheering you on. Just the sight of him seemed to spur you towards him, right in to his arms, even hearing some words over the PA as your lips were nearing his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here are your State Champions....!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****End Dream*****</i></span></div></div>",

Immediately, you reached down for your crotch and felt that you still had your familiar, male equipment that showed no signs of any change. Relieved, you risked a glance and immediately regretted it. Not only your room had changed slightly, with your walls becoming a pale cream color, and your study desk had become a vanity (even though it was still functionally a study desk), you've had some physical changes too. Your unpainted nails were slightly past your fingertips, and the room seemed slightly larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. I'm shrinking too\" you growled, as you walked over to your wardrobe. Your external clothes were still the same girlish clothes you found last night, but your underwear had changed. None of your boxers were there, just a whole selection of bras and panties. The fact that you had plenty of different styles was disturbing, though the presence of a lot of sports bras was oddly reassuring; it meant that the whole gymnastic thing wasn't some transitional thing as you changed. Even though you saw the necessity of wearing them you reluctantly put on a sports bra, and the most boyish styled panties you could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm still changing. How do I stop it?\" you muttered to yourself as you searched through your skirts, as the thought of wearing a dress was too alien. Finally, you found a simple cotton skirt that went past your knees and a plain white t-shirt that was one of the more gender neutral items of clothing that you still had. Finally, you put on a pair of your sneakers, which had changed to their feminine equivalent. You were now ready for school, though you preferred to remain home to investigate your changes.</span></div></div>",

However, it's the last football lesson for a while since the boys are going to do tennis while the girls are having their turn on football for a while. Feeling somewhat downtrodden about that, at least you'll be doing something else for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of changes, so far since earlier, there hasn't been any changes to your body. That might change soon! Hehehehe....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as you head to your locker, you feel the sudden urge to use the toilet, as if your bladder has quickly filled up. Running over to the toilet stall, as every boy in your class start coming in and the fact you don't like peeing in the urinal when there's people about, you proceed to lock the door and pull down your shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were about to pee, you gave out a small gasp in shock. You just realised that you're not wearing any underwear today! In fact, you spent the entire time since waking up this morning go commando! You frown to yourself, unsure as you remember that you were wearing underwear earlier. However, this thought is quickly pushed to the back of your mind as the need to take a piss needs more attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your shorts are already down, you decided to sit down on the toilet to relieve yourself, despite the fact you would have normally stood up. As you sit down, you feel a tiny bit uncomfortable, feeling like you're sitting on something. While you're pissing, you temporarily take your butt off the sit of the toilet to see what you're sitting on. Seeing that you're just sitting on the seat, you smile to yourself and continue to piss, unknowing to you that your butt has expanded only a tinny tiny bit, like a centimeter. Though still small now, your butt will be much bigger later on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, having finished peeing, you pull your shorts up, flush the toilet and went back to go change, though the thought of no underwear on is creating a bit of a problem. Walking towards your locker, you can't help but notice the more muscled members of your class. Your eyes can't seem to be distracted by anything but the boys with plenty of muscle. One of the guys you hang out with, Jason, is currently the boy who works out the most in the class. As you walk by him, you can't help but notice his six-pack. Feeling hot, you continue to walk to your locker to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get to your locker, you remember that you still don't have any underwear on, which is going to be a bit of a problem. Frowning to yourself, you open the locker, where to your surprise a pair a sky-blue panties lies on the bottom of the locker. Confused on why it's there, you figure out that you need to get rid of them before any of the boys see it. They're going to tease you about it, and might spread it to the girls, who'll think you're a pervert! Looking around, you see that there's not bin nearby. How on earth are you going to get rid of it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a idea forms in your mind! \"<i>It's genius</i>!\" you think to yourself, taking the panties and screwing it up into a small ball big enough to fit in your hand. \"<i>I'll put the panties on! That way, I can have underwear for the day and get rid of them later! Even though I don't want to wear them, it's better than being caught with them...</i>\"<br>\r\nWith that, you head over back to the toilet to put the panties on, despite wishing there was a different option. You lock the door to one of the stalls and then dropped your shorts on the ground. Then, carefully, you put the blue panties on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finished, you realise that it's fit! The front feels slight comfortable because of your testicals and penis, the sides feel loose and the back feels like it was meant to be worn by a girl with a large butt. But (heh), it's better then nothing. Feeling satisfied, you were about to leave when you notice that your penis looks a tiny bit smaller. That's due to the fact that it is, but only by a centimeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the subject at hand, you proceed to pull your shorts up and go back to your locker, with the boys unaware that you're wearing panties, who are heading out of the changing room. When you get to the locker, you find.....</span></div></div>",

Blinking, you go to search in your bag and around your locker for your shoes but it appears that someone took your trainers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great....\" you go, frustrated whilst facepalming, as the last boy exited the changing room. \"Those were my only pair! I can't wear my P.E trainers because they're too muddy! What am I going to wear?\"<br>\r\nThose brown trainers are your usual footwear to wear at school but now that they're missing, what are you going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rack your brain, to think, when you remember that the Lost&amp;Found office is nearby. Maybe they have a spare pair of trainers? Nodding to yourself with a smile, you proceed to get change and head over to the Lost&amp;Found office.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<i>A little while later...</i><br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nJust in your white socks, you walk into the Lost&amp;Found office to see that the Principle's secretary, Janice Red, is typing away at her computer. (What she looks like: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/young-secretary-bussines-woman-isolated-7269176.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/young-sec...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being the secretary for the Principle, Ms Red takes care of the Lost&amp;Found office on a Friday, which is today. She's considered extremely talent at the age of 25 and by the majority of the population of boys in the school (and a small minority of the girls who are lesbian), she's considered extremely attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile to yourself as you look at her, as you know her quite well because she used to rent out a room in your home sometime in the past before getting her own place. You do in fact see her as quite hot. In fact, when you were younger and before you had a crush on Rachel, you did have a small crush on her considering how nice she smells sometimes. However, nowadays, you consider her like a big sister! You don't know why but that thought disappeared as soon as you thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice looked up and gave a pearly white smile. \"Hey, Ad!\" she went, cheerfully. \"How's it going?\"<br>\r\nYou smile in return, feeling something rise in your chest, maybe happiness. \"I'm doing well!\" you smile back, giving your own perfect pearly white smile despite the fact you forgot to brush your teeth this morning! \"How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing....somewhat well....\" Janice remarked, frowning slightly. \"Got too much paperwork today.....anyway, what are you here for?\"<br>\r\nYou then frown, somewhat annoyed. \"My trainers have gone missing, maybe stolen. I can't wear my P.E trainers because they're too dirty, so I was wondering if there was any lost property that I could borrow until I can either get them back or buy a new pair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Red nodded, frowning as well, glancing over to your feet to see that you're missing shows. \"Guess I'll have to file out a lost property report.....\" she commented, seriously. She then grinned. \"But, I can have a look and see if there are any shoes available for you to wear.....!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ms Red got up and went over to the lost property section. After a few seconds searching, a small gasp was heard from her.<br>\r\n\"Um, Ad. There are shoes but....\" she started, coming back over to her desk. She placed two pairs of shoes down on the desk. One of the pairs is a pair of blue Uggs with a brown fur trim whilst the other is a pair of light purple Flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're taken aback by the choice. Ms Red nodded to your reaction. \"Unfortunately, the only pairs of shoes we have are these two. Sorry....\" she went, somewhat disheartened by the choice. You shake your head.<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I'm just surprised that it's just girl shoes....\" you said calmly, going up to the two pairs of shoes on the desk. \"I guess I'll just take one of them....Sure beats wearing nothing but socks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Red nodded to that. \"That's reasonable. Which one are you gonna choose, Ad?\" she questioned, curiously. You take a look at the Uggs then the Flats and then back at Ms Red with the response:</span></div></div>",

Also, it would be more comfortable for me to wear because the Flats look uncomfortable....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to put the Uggs on as Janice nodded, thinking the logic behind that. \"Yeah....flats are uncomfortable....wait until you get into heels, Ad!\" she remarked cheekily, giggling a little. Instead of thinking what Janice had said was weird, you giggled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Those will be a pain!\" you commented back happily, without noticing two weird things. The first, why on earth would you say that when you're not a girl? The second thing is that you didn't notice how high your voice has become. Your normal voice is quite deep but now somewhat higher in your voice range. How on earth did you know notice that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut anyway, the Uggs that you chose are now on your feet. You frown to yourself, feeling somewhat uncomfortable as they're a bit small. But, the Flats looked more uncomfortable, so you guess this is the lesser of two evils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice grinned. \"Well, you look absolutely fabulous in those Uggs, darling!\" she complimented dearly, somewhat gussing over you. Despite the fact you should feel weird about, instead you grin.<br>\r\n\"Ah, thanks! They really suit me!\" you replied, feeling sheepishly. Shaking the odd feeling off, you begin to head to the door. \"Thank you for letting me borrow the Uggs, Janice!\"<br>\r\nJanice chuckled a little. \"Hey, hey! That's Ms Red to you, young lady!\" she teased lightly. You grin as you exit the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're out of the door and out of view, you take a moment to think what Janice had said. \"'<i>Young lady....</i>\" you think, confused on why she would say that. \"<i>I've known Janice for a long time now....She wouldn't call me that....</i>\"<br>\r\nConcluding that you miss-heard her, you decided to head to break, as P.E took up periods. As you walked along, you felt your feet becoming more and more comfortable in the Uggs, becoming a perfect fit. Unknowing to you, your feet have shrunken a little, going from a size 9 for a man to a size 6 for a woman, changing you even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You look around the hall and see that Robert, Rachal and Sophie are sat on a table, with Jason sat there as well.<br>\r\nSmiling to yourself, you walk over to the table, swinging your hips a teeny tiny more than usual, with them expanding out a centimeter. Hey, if you're (the reader, not the actually character of 'you'!) thinking is your (the character) hips are expanding at a very slow rate, this story is called '<b>SLOWLY CHANGING</b>' for a reason! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut anyway, moving away from the fourth wall being broken, you take a seat down next to Rachel. Normally, you would sit next to Robert, but recently you feel more closer to Rachel and not in the romantic sense.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ad!\" Rachel goes, all cheerfully and girly. \"How was P.E?\" You smile, glad to see one of your best friends.<br>\r\n\"It was great! How about you?\" you question sincerely. As Rachel explains how her P.E went, your eyes seem to wander over to Robert and Jason, especially more of Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at 6 foot 4, Jason is one of the most attractive boys in the school, along with being the oldest. Handsome features such a chiseled jawline along with black hair, blue eyes and strong muscles and a six-pack, it's impossible to imagine that the majority of girls in the school are <i>not</i> in love with him. In fact, the other day, you swore you saw some girls swoon when he winked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nice, warm feeling came over your face, slightly tingling it. It appears that this small, warm feeling has caused all of your facial hair, which was pretty short to begin with, to retract into your face and disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel stopped talking, looking at the fact you're not paying attention and that you're looking at Jason. She grins, happily.<br>\r\n\"Heh, do Ad have a crush on someone?\" she teased lightly at you. You quickly snap your head towards Rachel, blushing in embarrassment. <br>\r\n\"N-n-no!\" you go, despite the fact you should crushing on Rachel instead. \"I-i-it's not like that!\"<br>\r\nRachel giggled, causing you to feel even more embarrassed. All in the meantime, you felt some tingling down at your feet, but you ignored it. But what you didn't know is that the hair on your feet have, like your facial hair, have retracted into your feet and disappeared from existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down, you go to chat with Rachel when she notices your Uggs. \"Oh, sweet! Where did you get those Uggs?\" she questioned, seriously. \"They look so good on you!\"<br>\r\nYou then frowned. \"I had to get them from lost property. My shoes disappeared!\" you replied, somewhat annoyed. Rachel gasped to responded to that.<br>\r\n\"They did? They might have been stolen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you asked back, confused. Rachel looked round and came closer to whisper in your eye. Despite the fact you have a crush on Rachel, you don't seem to blush.<br>\r\n\"There's been a rumour of a shoe thief going around the school recently....\" she whispered carefully. \"Some of the girls think a boy with a foot fetish is sneaking into the girl's changing room to steal our shoes.....Maybe that's what happened to your shoes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, to agree with this. You unknowingly dismiss the fact that Rachel might think that you're a girl! Rachel leans back out, and smiled. \"Well, I think for next time you should hide an extra pair of shoes. You're lucky that a pair of gorgeous Uggs were in lost property!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned to this, but then Rachel went to ask something. \"Hey, you free this weekend?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why?\" you questioned back, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....\" Rachel started, with a grin. \"Do you....\"</span></div></div>",

After all, being invited to a sleepover with Rachel and any other girls who would attended is a dream come true for any boys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, now that you think about it, the idea of going over to Rachel's for a sleepover actually seems pretty normal to you, like you've done it several times before. This is due to your memories being changed a little, making you thinking Rachel's sleepover are normal. For some strange reason now, when you think about it, all the previous sleepovers that you've had with Rachel and the girls, you've been a girl as well despite the fact you're a boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking that odd fact off your mind, you grin a pearly white grin. \"Yeah!\" you go, getting excited. \"I would love to go!\"<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Rachel started, happily. \"The sleepover is tomorrow, at my place as usual! Prepare for a night of movies, make-up, truth or dare and everything else, Adele!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback by what Rachel called you, you were about to reprimand her for that when suddenly the bell went off for lessons. Dismissing the fact that Rachel called you a girl's name, you said your goodbyes for now, as you head to your lessons. As you were about to head over to them, you pause for a second and glance over to Robert and Jason, who were heading to the same lessons as each other. Staring at the two, you smile to yourself warmly, gaining a bit of a blush before heading over to your lessons.<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<b>Jumping over to the next night...</b><br>\r\n....<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n....<br>\r\nYou stand in front of Rachel's house, somewhat nervously with a backpack on your back, ready for Rachel's sleepover at about 7:30PM. Despite the fact that you've been changing constantly over the last three days, since you've saw Rachel last, you haven't had another change. BUT....since the plot demands it, the changes shall begin again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're currently wearing a blue t-shirt, brown jeans and the Uggs that you got from lost property, and you have your hair down near your shoulders but not quite touching them. Despite the fact you have a pair of A-Cup breasts, they're actually still small enough to wear a t-shirt and not get notice. But, due to the size of the black sports bra that you're wearing, they're going to be much bigger, MUCH bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, I digress. For some reason, you feel nervous the fact you've done this before several times. You feel weird, like you've been here before but you swear you haven't. You decided to head over to Rachel's door and knock on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Rachel opens the door, wearing some pink pajamas. She grins on the sight of you and jumps and hugs you. \"YOU'RE HERE!\" she yelled excitedly, as she pulls out of the hug and squeal with joy.<br>\r\n\"Ah, this is going to be so much fun!\" she remarked. Rachel glances at your bag and sighs. \"Heh, always the prepared one, Ad? You can place it down there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel points towards a spot where another bag is placed. \"Only Sophie could come as well! The rest of the girls were busy....\"<br>\r\nYou frown as you put your bag down. \"Ah, that's a shame. Where's Sophie, by the why?\"<br>\r\nRachel grinned. \"She's in the kitchen! Follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to follow Rachel, you feel your hair tingle a little, feeling it tickle your shoulders. Unknowing to you, your hair has increase in length again, now going past your shoulders to the top of your back. Despite of the increasing length, it still has a lot more to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the kitchen with Rachel, which Sophie standing there looking at her phone whilst wearing some light blue pajamas. Racheal turns round to you and asked: \"What do you want to do first after you change into your pajamas? Makeover or movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment and then reply:</span></div></div>",

You could see lipstick, eyeliner and various different shades of nail polish besides Sophie. \"What do you want to do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to think to yourself before pointing at the nail polish. \"Let's do our nails first! It's been a while since I did my toes so why not now?\" you replied, with the odd feeling of never having done your toes before being shoved out of your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down and putting your feet forward, you let Rachel and Sophie do your toenails. Picking all sorts of colours, such as purple, blue and red, the two girls carefully painted your toenails. Unbeknowing to them or you, your leg hair slowly but surely begins to retract into your leg. Since you didn't have much leg hair to begin with, it doesn't take much time before the hair on your legs completely disappear, leaving your legs completely hair free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of legs, your leg suddenly become extremely smooth, more feminine like then the roughness of a boy's leg. Your feet also become smooth as well, while the soles of your feet become soft, if walking on soft pillows. Lastly, the bottom parts of your pajama shorts has extended a bit. Instead of being above your knees, your pajama shorts are now at the same length as your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!\" Rachel exclaimed as she and Sophie finished painting your toenails.

Its something that I know I'd regret if I didn't and besides, if the film you're all seeing is any good I'll go at the weekend.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan mate\" says Robert, \"but what'll I tell the rest?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know, tell them I've got to go see the dentist or something. I'll just stay here and wait for the bus, may as well go home for a bit. See you later\"<br>\r\n\"Bye then\" replys Robert, walking off with the rest of the group. The bus was due in two minutes at 5:30, it was only a 10 minute trip home and you had to change clothes, you couldn't risk the girls seeing you in a bra. The bus arrived on time for once so you got on and sat close to the back, a window seat as usual. Sitting there, staring out the window, you start to think about what it is that you're about to do. After about a minute or so, a wave of worry passes through you *I've been set up haven't I? I'll show up, no one will be there, or worse they will and then somehow set about ruining my reputation and embarrasing me. But it seems a bit elaborate to go through all this trouble, they invited me and I still don't know how Sophie knows my number, where I live, or why she called me 'Ad' - nobody does!*. Even though you'd managed to stop being worried, the pit of your stomach was still clenched. Taking out your phone, you looked at it a bit, something was different. It was a shade or two lighter so instead of looking black, it looked deep purple *can't be* you think, this phone was definately yours, the mark on the screen where you'd dropped it and it came out of your coat. *My coat...* It had to be your coat, after all Robert said he remembered you getting it and looking at the label on the inside pocket showed your initials. You decide to text Robert to say sorry, but looking at the addressbook, you can't find his number anywhere. *What? It must be in here. He called this morning*. But there it was not. Scrolling down you notice that you don't recognise more than half of these names. All the normal ones like 'Mum' and 'Home' were there but so was Sophie along with Laura K? Laura M? Cathy? the list went on and, you were shocked to see, Rachel. *How have I got all these numbers!? Where did all the others go?* But you couldn't think now, it was your stop. The worry pains hadn't gone away even though you'd been distracted. Standing up, there was an audible \"Whoomph\" as your sides gave way as if they were being pulled into your stomach. Gasping for breath and holding your gut, you realize that the 'worry pain' had gone *Must have been trapped wind or something* you say to yourself as you make your way off the bus and up to the house.

However, when it comes down to a choice between the boots and some high heels, its the boots every time. You give a begrudging \"Thanks\" as you take the boots off Miss Walsh and slip them on. It felt strange to be wearing footwear made out of fabric having spent a lifetime in those plasticy leather shoes and whatever they make trainers out of. As your toes touched the sheepskin sole at the bottom, they felt instantly warm *hmm not actually that bad* you think. When they were fully on you stood up half expecting to feel your toes pressing against the end, you did have size 11 feet after all and these were girl's shoes, but they did not. A little surprised you take a quick look at the the outsole 'size 7' it said, you could see this clearly as there was hardly any dirt on them. They came to about midway up your lower legs as you did the five white buttons up on the outside, covering them with your trousers as best you could you just had to accept that no matter how hard you tried there would still be some of the blue denim sticking out the front (they looked like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.uggaustralia.com/ProductDetails.aspx?gID=w&amp;productID=5972&amp;model=Lo\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.uggaustralia.com/ProductDetai...</a> Pro Button)<br>\r\n\"Oooh they don't half suit you!\" exclaimed a rather too excited Miss Walsh.<br>\r\n\"Errr, thanks... I'll bring them back tomorrow\" you say and make to leave.<br>\r\n\"You can keep them, they're just going to waste around here. Oh and one last thing...\" says Miss Walsh.<br>\r\nYou turn back around, confused as to why she's letting you keep them, not that you want them anyway. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"I loved your performance last Saturday\" she said, beaming, \"you know I used to do that when I was at school, made the game come alive and brought back so many memories... Now I expect you've got lots of stuff to do, bye!\"<br>\r\n\"Umm, glad to be of service\" you reply, not knowing what she was talking about but going along with it anyway. \"Bye\" you say, leaving the room. Back in the corridor, you make your way outside heading back home. It had been raining and the grey clouds were still looming, looking like it was going to rain again. *She must be mad* you think, *nice, but mad. Why would she even think that I'd rather wear high heels, or offer them in the first place? Also, sure I scored a few goals on Saturday but it wasn't anything special, and she doesn't seem to be the type for ball sports either...*. You carry on thinking about this as you make your way home, absent-mindedly scratching your chest through your shirt. </span></div></div>",

Want to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a big grin. \"I'd love to.\" You follow the girls.</span></div></div>",

You sit on a chair, and wait around for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they've tried on five different dresses each, they go to the counter and ask for the dresses to be given to them. The girl at the counter brings up something on her computer, and says to the three of you \"I have the dresses for you two, they should be through that door.\" Thanking her, the two walk off. The girl then turns to look at you. \"What about you ma'am?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, I'm fine...\" You say, not noticing that she called you ma'am. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I can see here that three dresses were bought in bulk, including those two dresses. Are you sure the one left over is not yours?\" She inquires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm cert-\" You start to say, but Rachel comes out and drags you to the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ad, yours is here as well!\" She says to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to ask what she's on about, when you see the dress.

To follow the trends you have to go to J&amp;J.\": Rachel says while slightly pushing you the right way. When arriving at the shop you look search for the boys-side of the shop. <br>\r\n\"No, you stay here.\": Sophie says. \"We want it to be a surprise, you always wear those last-season clothes. This time we will give you no choice to wear something a little bit more fashionable.\": Rachel explains. You wanted to say something against it but you suddenly feel really tired. <br>\r\n\"And secondly, if you don't like the clothes you always can bring them back.\": Sophie says. You nod, to tired to talk and lean to the show window of the shop. \"Okay, you will wait here.\": Rachel says while walking into the shop. Immediately after they walked away you feel a little bit nauseous and get a headache. It soon disappears again but you promise yourself that you go home when Rachel and Sophie come back.<br>\r\nBut what you not realize is that the headache converted your brains from male to female. From now on your body makes no male-hormones anymore and only female ones. This means that slowly your body will form that of a girl, your hair on your head grow faster, your hair on the rest of your body will fall out, your penis will shrink, breast will grow and your voice will get higher. But all those changes will take time.<br>\r\nYou sit there a moment worrying about what you just felt but you tell yourself it was nothing important. After a while Rachel and Sophie return with 3 full bags of clothes. You look a little bit scared to the bags and Rachel sees it. \"Don't worry Ad, one bag is mine.\": Rachel says in the hope to comfort you. You still think that 2 bags of clothes is a little bit much. You also worry about the price. Again it looks like Rachel sees what you think. \"I know you are collecting for that games console. That's why Sophie and I decided that we will buy these clothes for you. But someday, if you have the money again you have to pay us back someway.\": Rachel says, while winking to you in the last part. <br>\r\nNow you feel a little bit better you decided to look into the bags.

I only need breasts and I look totally like a girl, you think, not sure or it is a good or bad thing.<br>\r\nFinally you put some socks on. You see they are all girly colors but you don't care. The shirt and skirt is worse, you think while pulling the pink socks up your feet. After the socks you look at your shoes, the are completely wet and muddy from the rain.

We know this is a difficult time for you.\": Your grand-dad says. Again you just nod without knowing what to say. <br>\r\n\"Ow, before I forget. Your shoes are probably wet, aren't they?\": Your grand-dad asks. You nod again because it is easier to nod then to talk. \"While you were putting some new clothes on for you we searched for shoes. It is probably not really what you want but your niece forget her shoes. It's the only pair that fits you.\": Your grand-ma says understandingly. You think about a other solution but it seems like this is the only one. \"The shoes are on the kitchen table.\": grand-ma continues. <br>\r\nYou walk to the kitchen and look at the <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.shoes.com/ProductImages/shoes_iaec1174898.jpg\">shoes</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://www.shoes.com/ProductImages/shoes_iaec1174898.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>. They are obvious for a girl but with a little bit luck you don't have to wear them much. You put them on for a second to look if they fit and surprisingly they do. Hmmm, when I saw them they looked a little bit to small but now they fit real good, you think. If they weren't such girly color you would even wear them the whole day, that comfortable they are. <br>\r\nYou step out of the shoes when your grand-ma and mother walk into the kitchen. \"You look real good sweety. You really have to wear these clothes more.\": Your mom says seriously. You smile, thinking it's a joke. \"I've got an idea. Maybe my favorite you want to help us cooking.\": Your mom asks. You think a second about it. Cooking is something for girls you always thought but something inside you tells it also could be fun. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

And you decide to go tomorrow to the pool behind your grand-parents house. When you are done you pick some make-up out of the hand-bag and start applying it. When you are done you walk to the mirror in your room. This time you go through your legs so you finally see your face in the mirror.

It was the first time in months that a descent amount of sunlight had come through your windows so it was probably just down to that. Taking another step into your room, both of your feet went into cramp. Falling to the floor, you clutch at both of your feet, the shoes were still on but you couldn't bend your feet in the right way to get them off at the moment. It didn't feel like any other cramp you'd had before, for one it felt as if they were being constricted from the outside all around the foot rather than just a couple of toes clenching up. You decide standing might help, so you do, and start gently moving your weight forwards and backwards on each foot. Slowly, the pain faded and you could take the shoes off, but your feet looked smaller than before. Looking at the outsoles of the shoes it says 'Size 6', \"No wonder my feet hurt, they're size 12 and these are size 6! But I'm sure they were size 12 too in the office\", you think out loud. No matter you were back home now and you needed to find a place to hide the shoes, you couldn't have your brother seeing them, or anyone else if they decided to come round. \"I'll take them back to school tomorrow\", you think so you put them in a plastic bag and put them in your school bag. Opening your bag, you see some of your textbooks have been covered in laminated pink cr\u00eape paper. You stand there, almost sizzling with anger \"First my kit, then my shoes, now my work!\", its a good thing you're the only one in the house because you shout this at the top of your lungs. Whoever had done this must have been an evil genius, not only to cover your books in pink but in the frilliest sort of paper there is, you would have been in awe if it wasn't you that was the victim. Turning the books over in your hands, you realize that whoever's book you have must be the one thats been doing all the stuff. Turning it back over to the front cover, you see the label underneath the lamination. It was yours, the writing had worn a bit but you could definately make out the first letter of your name and your surname 'A.... White'. \"No, this can't be... I know, the work inside!\" - that was yours too, even the work from today on plant and animal cells, and the homework which you'd written down less than 3 hours ago. You let out a yell that the mastermind has foiled you again. But the lamination didn't smell fresh and also the rip in the page you'd accidentally done today had gone, your writing also seemed a little different but how? <br>\r\nTrying to think of a way to get back your old book and some new shoes for tomorrow, you phone rings.</span></div></div>",

You begin to wonder why you didn't change when you had the chance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fight with her, you suddenly remember a little trick Josh told you about, the one where you change into Zero Suit Samus using taunts.  \"I wonder if it actually works...\" you say to yourself.

A second or so later, just before you give up to dodge another attack, you suddenly see a bright flash as her suit crumbles.  \"Aw crap.  Why'd I do that?\" you think.  However, after this, you seem to be doing much better, even though you almost never use ZSS.  But after a while, he uses it again.  This time, you're able to dodge the first ring, but you get hit by the second and die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext is Zelda.  You notice that Tabuu has 2/3 of his full health.  \"I might just make it!\" you say as you change to Shiek.  But as you fight, you're getting your butt kicked.  You've got a lot of damage now, but you keep going.  You managed to hit him some, but most of the time, he's hitting you.  \"I guess not...\" you think.  Again, Tabuu gets ready to do his Off Waves attack.  Suddenly, you remember that Zelda/Shiek can dodge these using Down + B.

People'll be able to see them underhanging your skirt as well, not a good look darling\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You turn to stare at yourself in your parent's mirror, glareing, you say out loud \"It's not wrong, I'm not a girl, and I'm going to wear trousers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh but dear, you are a girl! That's you standing there in that pink nightie, a boy would never wear such a thing would he? Good luck finding any trousers, I threw them out with the rest of your clothes, haha!\". Without saying a word, you quickly slip the boxers on underneath the nightie and fling open your dad's wardrobe, seizing a pair of his suit trousers. \"I raised a smart girl in you didn't I? Well, it's understandable considering you're just me but not as good.\". Forcing your legs through the holes you tighten it up around your waist and look back in the mirror. Without thinking, you turn 90 degrees in the mirror to check the fit, \"Hmm, not what I wanted but I reckon I could make it work... are you sure you don't want that bra?\", Adeline coaxed turning up the pain as she said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You laugh \"Hehehe, as long as its hurting me its hurting you, you can't keep this up for long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry, I won't have to\", the voice said suspiciously, the pain in your chest fading. You walk back to your room, grabbing a white shirt out of your wardrobe. It was a fitted cut and clearly a woman's but it looked pretty much like your normal one and you couldn't be bothered to fight over this. \"Hurry up now, I don't want to be late for my first proper day of school, gosh you're so slow, want me to take over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Shut up you\", you reply, storming out of your room, resisting the urge to brush your hair, even though you usually do even without your deranged feminine side taking control of your body. </span></div></div>",

You naturally tag along with the other lads and after a while the noise dies down.<br>\r\n \"Right, now you're in your groups, number yourselves 1 to 8\", you were told you were number 2. \"Now all the number 1s come over here, 2s over there and so on...\"<br>\r\n 'Oh great', you think to yourself. You should have seen this one coming, the old group switchup trick. Looking round your new group, you were thrilled to see that Rachel is in it, 'I just hope its not going to be too awkward...'. All in all, the group of 8 was split nice and evenly into 4 boys and 4 girls.<br>\r\n \"Everybody get a partner, girls with boys, boys with girls\", came the next instruction. As much as you liked her, you really didn't want to be stuck with Rachel, and you were sure the feeling was mutual. Everyone was splitting off into pairs, those two were going out with each other so they went together, another two liked each other but weren't 'public' yet, so you were down to two. The girl that wasn't Rachel, Lauren, gave Rachel a sly glance and walked towards the boy that wasn't you, Liam. Somewhat begrudgingly you and Rachel saunter over to meet each other. \"Erm... hi\" you say, cursing yourself as your voice cracks from not talking for a while, \"So, it looks like we're together then\".<br>\r\n \"Yeah, looks that way\", she replies. Once everyone had found a partner and worksheets had been handed round, the next instructions were given out.<br>\r\n \"From reading your essays last week I noticed that everyone here, both in my class and in Mrs Hastings', finds it really easy to empathise with characters who are of the same gender but hard to get the same quality of depth out of characters of the opposite sex. Today we're going to do some excercises to resolve that problem, on the sheets which I've just given you there are a number of different scenarios which you might have had experience in in real life or you might not, it doesn't really matter. What does matter though is how you respond to these questions, write down what you would do in that situation, truthfully, and then give them to your partner.\" You shift uncomfotably in your seat, you could definately hazard a guess at what was coming next. \"You and your partner are then going to act them out as each other to the rest of your group who will then rate your performance and write it down on this other sheet. I will be coming round all of you and although I might not be standing next to you, I could be watching from the other side of the room, so get to work!\"<br>\r\n Glancing over at Rachel, you see she has a look of despair on her face, your thoughts exactly. Although you were secretly quite happy to have the opportunity to learn more about her, and besides, this was a drama lesson, so you could always act as if nothing had happened between you, start fresh...</span></div></div>",

And who knows, maybe after a little insight into who you really are Rachael might warm up a bit toward you and forget everything that happened before. At least it gave you something to be hopeful for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe questions seem pretty easy and start breezing through them. Then you hit question 10. As you start to write your answer you suddenly stop. You look at what you have written. You had answered it truthfully, but now the answer you gave just doesn't seem like you.

You dive under, and swim around. \"Winnie, how about you take that pacifier out f your mouth, so you can swim faster?\" Your mother asks. Your eyes get big at that thought. Taking your pacifier out of your mouth for something other than eating and bath time? Thats crazy! You shake your head back and forth violently, and dive deep to the bottom f the pool. Your mother sighs. After about two more hours, your mother gets tiered and its time to pick up josh from school. \"Winnie, lets go get you a diaper change, and into some dry clothes.\" Your mom says. You climb out of the pool. You have always wanted to try that shaky off thing dogs do... So you shake your body back and forth. To your surprise, it woked!
