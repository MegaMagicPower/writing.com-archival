When they got there Katie had stopped in front of Babe and pinned him against the door.  She leaned in close and in a very sexy tone whispered in Babe's ear and said,\"I like you hehe.\"  Babe almost fainted when he heard those words coming from the most amazing woman he had ever met.  Katie then leaned in closer and gave Babe a little peck on the cheek and said,\"Meet me by the library after school, I want to give you a ride home.\"  Then she left before Babe could react.</span></div></div>",

She asked,\"Hey, do you want to come back to my house to study tonight?\"  Babe of course said yes.  When they were walking Katie slowly grabbed Babe's hand.  When Babe looked up at her she was blushing like the ripest of cherries.  He asked her,\"Ummm Katie?  Do you like me?\"  She said,\"Babe you are one of the cutest guys I know, how could I ever not like you.\"  At that they drove off to Katie's house.</span></div></div>",

Her neck used to be about level with his nose, but now the top of her bosom was level with his nose.  She was now 6'2\" tall!  She said,\"Oh good! I'm glad you finally noticed shorty, hehe, and this is only the beginning of my growth spurt according to the doctor.\"  All Babe could think to himself was how truly amazing Katie was and how lucky he was to be with her.

About ten minutes into class there was a knock on the door and Babe's teacher Mr. Williams went to see who it was.  When he opened the door a new girl was standing in the doorway that was absolutely giant.  She was even bigger than Katie with her head even above the door frame. </span></div></div>",

While Babe was taking in this sight the girl leaned in and said,\"Did you miss me Babe?\"  That was weird, why did the girl's voice sound familiar... No!!! It couldn't be?  \"Katie?\" asked Babe.  She said,\" Yes sweety?\" At that moment Babe's heart went into overdrive and he leaned in and kissed his girlfriend's giant hand.  He asked,\"How tall are you now sweety?\" ...</span></div></div>",
