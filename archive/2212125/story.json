I\u2019m an 18-year-old boy living in a small Massachusetts town with my mother Lucy and 11-year-old sister Isabelle.  I have an amazing girlfriend named Kelly; we\u2019ve been dating since our sophomore year of high school.  I graduated last year but unfortunately couldn\u2019t go off to college; you see, a botched operation left my mother with constant back pain \u2013 this left her unable to work, so I became the sole breadwinner for my family.  Where\u2019s my dad you ask?  He ran off on us about 6 years ago; no one\u2019s seen or heard from him since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re probably wondering why I\u2019m telling you all this.  It\u2019s because my entire life changed in an instant following a car accident on my way home from work.  How did it change?  I somehow ended up in the body of a pregnant woman in her late 20s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat follows is my story...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just after 4:00 in the afternoon and I was just getting off my third straight 12-hour shift at Wal-Mart; where I worked as an associate in the Electronics Department.  The job sucked but the pay was just good enough to support my mom and sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just clocked out, I was walking to my car when I heard my cell phone start ring.  Digging it out of my pocket, I saw it was Kelly calling.  Answering the phone, I said, \u201cHey Kel, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much, babe; I was wondering if you were free tonight.\u201d Chuckling, Kelly said, \u201cI figured you\u2019d want to unwind after working those crazy hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like a great idea.\u201d Checking my watch, I said, \u201cBut first I have to pick up Isabelle from softball practice.  I can be over there around 5:15 if that\u2019s okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I can wait until then.\u201d Pausing, Kelly said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, babe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging up the phone, I continued the walk to my car; a light drizzle starting to fall on the parking lot.  I fumbled with my keys for a moment as the rain started to come down even harder.  <i>Great, that\u2019s going to make driving on the highway a bear</i>.  Finally getting into my car, I sent a quick text to Isabelle to let her know I was coming; before starting the car and driving out of the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive to the highway was uneventful, save for the annoying squeaking noise that told me I needed to replace my wiper blades.  I drove onto the highway without a problem, my GPS telling me it would be about 15 minutes before I got to the exit I needed.<br>\r\nI was driving along, minding my own business and being careful due to the weather when I suddenly heard a screeching noise behind me.  I looked over my shoulder to find a large SUV swerving all over the road; it didn\u2019t take a genius to know they were hydroplaning.  I tried to avoid the SUV, but it suddenly sideswiped me; which cause me to swerve into the next lane and hit another car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was powerless to do anything as both the other car and I were slammed against the median in the center of the highway.  The last thing I remembered before blacking out was the panicked look of the woman in the car I\u2019d hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea how long I\u2019d been unconscious for; but as I regained consciousness, I slowly became aware of my surroundings.  Looking around, I quickly realized that I was in a hospital room; and, judging from the window, it was night time.  I didn\u2019t pay much attention to the plethora of strange sensations I was suddenly feeling; figuring that it was because of the accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon became aware of someone else in the room; spotting a man, in his early 30s, dozing in a nearby chair.  I didn\u2019t recognize him at all; which made me wonder why he was in my room.  Feeling rather weak, I barely had the strength to say, \u201cHello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought something was wrong with my voice; but, before I could process it, the man woke up and looked at me.  A look of relief on his face, he got up and walked towards me.  Taking my hand in his, he said, \u201cThank god you\u2019re alright, I was so worried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could ask who he was, the man leaned over and kissed me on the lips.  I found myself reciprocating the kiss for a fraction of a second before I realized what was going on.  Shoving the man off of me, I looked at him and said, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, are you alright?\u201d Taking my hand, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s me Archie, your husband.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Husband? </i>  I looked at the man, trying to figure out if he was crazy and someone I should be worried about.  Looking around the room, I started to wonder where my mom and sister were.  Pulling my hand back, I looked at the man and said, \u201cListen, pal, I\u2019ve never seen you before in my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcie, please...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI climbed out of the bed before the man could finish his sentence; leaving him speechless as I made my way out the door.  Walking out into the hallway, I started to feel my legs give out; stumbling a few times as I made my way down the hall. <i>I have to find my family</i>.  The man must\u2019ve gotten some help, because I heard a woman\u2019s voice behind me say, \u201cMa\u2019am, stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<i>Ma\u2019am?  What the hell is going on here? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy leg strength came back as I rounded the corner into what I figured was the Emergency Room.  I heard footsteps behind me, so I turned around to find the man and a nurse running down the hall towards me.  <i>I have to get out of here. </i>  I made a beeline for the exit as the two started to catch up to me.  All eyes were on me at this point; as various hospital employees, and some visitors tried to get in my way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy attempts to reach the door were futile as hospital security had arrived and grabbed me.  I struggled to break free from their grip but found that I was somehow weaker than before.  \u201cLet go of me!  I have to find my family!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the man appeared in front of me and said, \u201cMarcie, everything\u2019s going to be alright; my mother\u2019s on her way here with Emma as we speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you calling me Marcie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was happening, I became aware of an ambulance arriving outside.  The guards moved me to the side as the paramedics came in with a gurney.  Nothing could describe the shock I experienced when I saw my body strapped to the gurney as it rolled past; covered in bloody gauze and a large gash down my leg.  I watched, in stunned silence, as my family ran past me.  <br>\r\nLooking at me, the man said, \u201cMarcie, sweetheart, you have to calm down or the doctors are going to sedate you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was powerless as the guards started to drag me back down the hall; my kicking and screaming weren\u2019t having any effect.  Suddenly something out of the corner of my eye; I turned to find myself looking at the reflective surface of a nearby vending machine.  What caught my eye wasn\u2019t that the machine had my favorite soda; no, what caught my eye was the reflection of a woman staring back at me.</span></div></div>",

I honestly wasn\u2019t paying much attention at that point, as I was trying to wrap my head around the fact that I suddenly looked like a woman.  A glance downward proved that what I\u2019d seen hadn\u2019t been an illusion; as I saw a pair of, what was obviously, breasts underneath the hospital gown. <i> What the hell is going on here!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was trying to wrap my head around everything that\u2019d happened when the man walked in with a doctor.  As the doctor closed the door, the man said, \u201cIs my wife alright, Doctor?\u201d glancing at me, the man said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen her act that way before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for the victims of car accidents to wake up confused.\u201d Looking at a clipboard, the Doctor said, \u201cHowever, I\u2019ve never seen someone react as your wife did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here, but I\u2019ve never seen this man before in my life.\u201d Looking at the two of them, I said, \u201cCan one of you please explain how I ended up as a woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the man and the doctor looked at me like I was crazy.  After a few seconds of silence, the Doctor said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d confused, he said, \u201cHaven\u2019t you always been a woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried my best to respond politely but still managed to come off as dumbfounded.  \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t always been a woman.\u201d Incredulous, I said, \u201cI used to be an 18-year-old boy until I got into a car accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure how to respond to that, the doctor and the man turned to face away from me.  They weren\u2019t whispering, so I managed to hear what they were saying.  \u201cDoctor, why does my wife think she\u2019s an 18-year-old boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy best guess would be that the accident caused some mild disorientation.\u201d Pausing, the doctor said, \u201cThere was an 18-year-old boy involved in the accident, but _____.\u201d</span></div></div>",

They depend on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything we can do for her, Doctor?\u201d the man called Archie looked at me and said, \u201cShe\u2019s nearly got <i>me</i> ready to believe her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes injuries can cause the brain to swell; which can result in temporary amnesia.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s what is happening with your wife; although I\u2019m at a loss to explain why she thinks she\u2019s an 18-year-old boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am an 18-year-old boy, doctor.</i>  It was becoming clear that neither Archie nor the doctor believed me; at best they thought I had amnesia, at worst they probably thought I\u2019d gone crazy.  Taking my hand in his, Archie said, \u201cIs there anything you can give her to help her sleep until she recovers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are some medications we could try, but I don\u2019t dare risk it in this case.\u201d With a sigh, the doctor said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the medications might harm the baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Baby!?</b>  That was the last thing I remembered before passing out in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up again, I realized I wasn\u2019t in the same room as earlier; this one was slightly smaller, probably one of the hospital\u2019s private rooms.  I turned and saw light pouring in through the window on my right.  I heard some light snoring to my left and turned to find Archie sleeping in the chair; the poor guy must\u2019ve stayed with the entire night.  I probably would have thought the gesture was romantic if I were really the woman he thought I was.  I also noticed the doctor standing nearby with his back to me.  Archie must\u2019ve sensed that I was awake because he opened his eyes and said, \u201cMarcie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea how I\u2019d ended up in this woman\u2019s body, but I couldn\u2019t honestly say that I was her \u2013 regardless of whether there was a baby involved.  Looking at him, I silently shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over from the counter, the Doctor checked my reflexes and vitals before saying, \u201cPerhaps we can shock her back to reality, Mr. Sullivan.\u201d Writing something on the chart, he said, \u201cThe young man from the accident was just moved to the recovery room upstairs; they had to remove his appendix, but he came through with flying colors.  Hopefully your wife will snap back to reality when he wakes up and proves that she isn\u2019t him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the doctor left and came back with a wheelchair.  Archie helped me into it and I was pushed through the hospital to the recovery room.  As we got closer, I could hear Mom and Izzy talking inside.  \u201cI think he's starting to wake up, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing me to the door, leaning next to my ear, Archie said, \u201cNow you\u2019ll see, Marcie...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard my own voice groan, followed by it saying, \u201cArchie?... Is the baby okay?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I started screaming and struggling to break free of the restraints holding me to the bed.  This only served to worry the man as he watched me have a mental breakdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my wife, doctor?\u201d pointing to me, he said, \u201cHow could a car accident do <i>this</i> to her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m as confused as you are, Mr. Sullivan; I\u2019ve never seen a reaction like this.\u201d Pressing a page button on the wall, the Doctor said, \u201cIs there any history of mental illness in your wife\u2019s family?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was still struggling on the bed, the man said, \u201cOther than some depression and anxiety, there\u2019s nothing like <i>this</i>.\u201d Glancing at me, the man said to the doctor, \u201cCould this be a complication from the pregnancy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately stopped what I was doing when I heard that; as preposterous as it sounded, I was apparently pregnant.  Looking at the man, I said, \u201cPlease just let me go, I\u2019m not your wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nurse arrived at that moment with what looked like a syringe in her hands.  Taking it from the nurse, the doctor said, \u201cMrs. <br>\r\nSullivan, I\u2019m going to give you something that should help calm you down.  Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s no risk to the baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse restrained me while the doctor injected me with the syringe.  The last thing I remembered before losing consciousness was the man looking at me.  \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be alright, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up again, I found myself in a completely different room; this one rather spartan in comparison to the one from earlier.  With the exception of a bed, a table and a chair, there was almost nothing else in the room.  I saw a door leading to a bathroom nearby, which gave me an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still coming off whatever the doctor had injected me with, so I stumbled a few times as I went into the bathroom.  I closed the door and immediately felt a wave of nausea.  Once I stopped vomiting, I got up and stood in front of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first opportunity I had to get a good look at this woman\u2019s body...my body.  She looked rather attractive; with brown hair and a smattering of freckles on her face.  I tried to convince myself that I wasn\u2019t really in this woman\u2019s body, but that was difficult when the reflection in the mirror followed my every move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t ready to do so, but I decided to get it over with \u2013 I looked under the hospital gown to find a pair of nice, slightly larger than normal, breasts.  <i>This has to be a dream.</i>  I stared at my reflection for another minute or so as I tried to figure out my next move.  After composing myself the best I could, I turned and walked out of the bathroom; only to find an African-American woman, in her mid to late 20s, leaning against the wall wearing scrubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn\u2019t heard anyone come in while I was in the bathroom, so I was surprised to see her standing there.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a <i>very</i> long time; but I must say, I\u2019ve never seen anyone react quite like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down on the bed, confused.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost people in your position are initially shocked; but to see you have a complete breakdown, that wasn\u2019t what I expected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought she was referring to the accident, so I looked at her and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you find yourself in a woman\u2019s body after a car accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surprised that, unlike the man and the doctor, the nurse didn't seem phased when I implied that I hadn't always been a woman.  \u201cI would try to keep to that to yourself if I were you.  Right now you're only a temporary patient in the hospital's psych ward; but if you kept it up, you'll be committed to a mental hospital.\u201d Looking at me, as I lay back on the bed, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll come back to check on you later; after you\u2019ve had some time to process everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed my eyes briefly as the woman headed towards the door; when I opened them again she was gone.  I was lying on the bed, a moment later, when the door opened; a pregnant nurse walked into the room.  \u201cHello Mrs. Sullivan, how are you feeling today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m feeling pretty good; despite suddenly becoming a woman.\u201d Watching as the nurse checked my blood pressure, I said, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t the nurse who was just in here check my blood pressure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe African-American woman, probably a few years older than you; why couldn\u2019t she check my blood pressure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse gave me the same look the doctor and the man had given me; like I was crazy.  Looking at me, with a nervous chuckle, she said, \u201cMa\u2019am, we don\u2019t have any African-American nurses on this shift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, I started to wonder if I was going crazy.  I remembered talking to the woman before she left, but apparently she didn\u2019t exist.  If I was imagining that, what if I was imagining everything else as well \u2013 what if I really was that man\u2019s wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could respond to the nurse, as if on cue, the door opened; and the man walked into the room carrying a little girl in his arms.  \u201cEmma, sweetie, say hi to Mommy.\u201d</span></div></div>",

In addition to not fully understanding how I\u2019d ended up in this woman\u2019s body, I still had no idea what had happened to the original occupant.  I wasn\u2019t about to devastate this little girl by saying I wasn\u2019t her mother.  \u201cI\u2019m feeling fine, sweetie; mommy just needs to rest a few days.\u201d Reflexively pulling her closer, I said, \u201cCan you promise to be a good girl for daddy while I\u2019m away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh!\u201d leaning over to kiss me on the cheek, Emma said, \u201cFeel better mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaned over and kissed her on the forehead, \u201cThank you, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the nurse left the room with Emma, the man closed the door and came over to my bed.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s come to this, honey; but I just want to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So you\u2019re the reason I\u2019m in the psych ward.</i>  As I sat on the bed, looking at him, I realized I couldn\u2019t really blame him for this.  After all, as hard as it was for me to believe, I did look like this man\u2019s wife \u2013 a wife he thought was having a mental breakdown.  Deep down I knew I was Ramon; but if I wanted to keep from getting committed, I had to play along.  \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Archie; you\u2019re doing what you think is best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a 72 hour psychiatric hold; so you\u2019ll be out of here in no time.\u201d Sitting down next me to, Archie took my hand and said, \u201cEmma and I will be here, waiting, when you get out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of Archie\u2019s hand on mine had an unexpected affect on me; I felt like I was being pulled in different directions at once.  As I looked into Archie\u2019s concerned eyes, I was overcome with foreign feelings.  Before I knew what was happening, I leaned <br>\r\nforward and kissed Archie on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he started to reciprocate, Archie and I lay back on the bed as we kissed.  I was completely aware of what I was doing; I knew it wasn\u2019t right, but I couldn\u2019t stop myself.  <i>This isn\u2019t right, I have to focus.  I\u2019m not this man\u2019s wife, I\u2019m a boy.</i>  I reflexively let out a soft moan between kisses.  <i>Wasn't I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of us made out on the hospital bed, I found it harder and harder to think straight.  <i>Don\u2019t be silly Ramon, of course you\u2019re a boy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Archie and I could go further, there was a knock on the door.  We pulled apart as the door opened; revealing the pregnant nurse from earlier.  She must\u2019ve realized what we were doing, because she blushed and said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t interrupting anything, was I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo ma\u2019am, you weren\u2019t.\u201d blushing, moving a strand of hair, I said, \u201cI was just having a moment with my husband before he left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mrs. Sullivan, but it\u2019s time for your first appointment with Dr. Stewart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Getting up, I took one last look at Archie and said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye to Archie, I followed the nurse out of the room.  As we made our way down the hall, I found myself thinking back to the kiss.  <i>I haven\u2019t felt that way since the first time I kissed Kelly.</i> Feeling a sudden ache in my head, I brought a hand up to rub my temple.  <i>That\u2019s weird; I\u2019ve never kissed a girl before.</i></span></div></div>",

Dr. Stewart looked to be around my age; a little heavyset but still attractive.  As I sat down on the couch, I saw the woman walk into the room and stand by the door; a look of concern on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the nurse left, Dr. Stewart closed the door and sat across from me.  \u201cHello Mrs. Sullivan, I\u2019m Rachel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, call me Marcie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Smiling, she looked at me and said, \u201cNow Marcie, do you know why you\u2019re here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was in a car accident where a young man was killed.\u201d Sighing, with a faint smile, I said, \u201cAfter I woke up, I was under the belief that I <i>was</i> that young man; that I\u2019d somehow been placed in this body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe you\u2019re referring to reincarnation?\u201d writing something on a notepad, Dr. Stewart said, \u201cYou believed that you were that young man; that you were reincarnated as Marcie Sullivan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, still standing by the doorway, just stared at me; it was clear she was worried about something.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I believed at the time; but I was adamant that I wasn\u2019t the woman they told me I was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you still believe that now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m not sure, Doctor.</i> \u201cNo ma\u2019am, I\u2019m no longer under the impression that I was that poor young man.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cMy husband, and the ER doctor, believed that I in a state of shock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s common, in accidents such as yours, for victims to have memory loss.\u201d Looking at her pad, Dr. Stewart said, \u201cDo you know your daughter\u2019s name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an affirmative nod, Dr. Stewart continued, \u201cDo you remember when she was born?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried my best to find the answer to that question but was unable to do so.  I started to get a little emotional as a result.  \u201cI-I don\u2019t remember.\u201d Tearing up, I said, \u201cWhat kind of mother doesn\u2019t remember when her daughter was born?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for upsetting you, Marcie.\u201d Placing her hand on mine, Dr. Stewart says, \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been told, you\u2019re an amazing mother.

Sitting up in bed, I looked at the \u2018woman\u2019 and said, \u201cAre you saying that if I accept that I\u2019m really that deceased boy, that I\u2019ll get my memories back?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cThat I\u2019ll remember marrying Archie and giving birth to Emma?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d looking at me, the \u2018woman\u2019 said, \u201cNo, you\u2019ll remember your life as Ramon; your mom, your sister and your girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would I want to remember a \u2018life\u2019 with a family I\u2019ve never met?\u201d getting up, I started pacing around the bed.  Looking at the \u2018woman\u2019, I said, \u201cWhy am I even arguing with you?  You\u2019re not even real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u2018woman\u2019 was starting to get flustered; her face turning red and looking as though she was going to start yelling.  After a moment, however, she calmly looked at me and said, \u201cI am real, Ramon; the sooner you accept that the better off you\u2019ll be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>You</i> are not real.\u201d Turning to look at her, I said, \u201cMy husband is real, my daughter is real.  The baby growing inside me is real.  You are not real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I turned to look away from her, the \u2018woman\u2019 said, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to help you Ramon; believe me, you don\u2019t want to know what\u2019s coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you really wanted to help me, then just leave me alone.\u201d Placing my arms across my chest, I turned around and said, \u201cThe longer you\u2019re here bothering me, the longer I\u2019ll be kept from my family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour fam...\u201d I could tell the woman wanted to say something else, but she stopped.  \u201cFine, since you\u2019re being incredibly stubborn, I\u2019ll just leave.  When you\u2019re ready to listen to me, I hope it\u2019s not too late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched, with a satisfied smile, as the \u2018woman\u2019 simply disappeared from the room.

I walked inside to find it empty \u2013 save for a young woman sitting on a nearby couch reading a book.  I glanced at her as I walked past; seeing that she looked to be only a few years younger than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grabbing a book from the shelf, I turned back and walked towards the couch.  Looking at the young woman, engrossed in her book, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt, but I was wondering if I could join you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d looking up, she saw me standing there.  Pulling her legs back, she said, \u201cSorry, have a seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat down, I opened the book briefly before putting it down.  Turning my attention to the young woman, I said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Marcie Sullivan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got the sense the young woman wanted to be left alone, but she decided to be polite instead.  \u201cAllison Young.\u201d Putting her book down, she said, \u201cWhat are you in for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was in a car accident that messed me up pretty badly.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t remember anything about my family, and I\u2019m seeing people that aren\u2019t really there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I was in here for something as simple as that.\u201d Looking at me, Allison said, \u201cI\u2019m here for suicide watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t want to pry, but a part of me was curious.  Looking at Allison, I said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, why are you on suicide watch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tried killing myself after my ex-boyfriend posted some revenge porn online.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy maternal instincts began to kick in at that point.  \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison then proceeded to tell me everything that happened; both leading up to her breakup and the revenge porn.  When she was finished, holding back tears, she said, \u201cYou want to know the worst part of all this?  My parents believe I\u2019m a lesbian now; because they saw a video of me making out with my female roommate at a party.\u201d  With a weak smile, Allison chuckled and said, \u201cNow they want nothing to do with me because I\u2019m a \u2018freak.\u2019  The worst part is, I think they\u2019re trying to turn my younger sisters against me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly my issues didn\u2019t seem so bad in comparison.  \u201cHow did that lead to the suicide watch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tried to OD on sleeping pills after a particularly bad telephone call.\u201d Moving some hair from her eyes, Allison said, \u201cI probably would have died had my roommate not found me.  She was concerned for my safety and convinced me to come here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat there, silently, as I watched Allison start crying uncontrollably.  Despite having just met her, I couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for her.  I moved over and pulled Allison into a hug; letting her cry into my arms.  Rubbing my arm on her back, in a soothing tone, I said, \u201cJust cry it out, Allison; everything will be alright.\u201d</span></div></div>",
