As she stacked her filling in the sandwich, she suddenly herd screaming and yelling. Dropping her lunch across the floor, the tall blonde dashed towards her door, her long blond curls streaming behind her. People where running down the street in a mad frenzy, cars were crashing into one another. Feeling scared she backed inside and her ears picked up the voice of the television.<br>\r\n\"We have confirmed reports of nuclear weaponry being dropped upon several major US cites\" the newscaster read in a deathly tone \"Detonations and EMP blasts have been recorded in..\"<br>\r\nFeeling scared Alyson started to run, she fled her house. Outside people were running wild, cars collided, voices screamed and there was even in occasional gunshot. Luggage was strewn all over the streets and people hurriedly packed belongings into bags. Alyson knew where they were headed, where she had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sprinted off down the street, outpacing many of the panicking crowds. She watched a bus ram the convenience store, the driver kicking the door open and fleeing as the store began to catch fire. The throng made its way through the suburban paradise, towards the hillside path to the local vault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyson ran off down into the woods, following the path she passed the tree with their falling autumn leaves. The sky roared as a Vertibird thundered overhead, tearing the leaves of the branches in a golden sandstorm. They were nearing the chain link fence that surrounded the vault. People were clustered about watching the Vertibird hovering overhead, its machine guns tracking the refugees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Alyson approached the three guards at the entrance, all were armed and keeping the crowds at bay.<br>\r\n\"Please\" she begged a man in a Vault-Tech uniform. \"You have to let me in!\"<br>\r\nhe raised an eyebrow. \"are you with Vault-Tech?\" he asked</span></div></div>",

You head up the gravelled path towards the vault entrance, along with a group of other refugees. A few are carrying large amounts of luggage, while some have only the clothes your wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the vault entrance, the huge cog shaped lift to take you into the vault. You and the other people huddle on the elevator as a few stragglers join you. Excavators and rubble-shifters are parked around the entrance, along with the operations booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready to send them down!\" yells a guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there is a huge flash and you see the bomb detonate like an evil red flower. The Mushroom cloud starts to reach into the sky and the shockwaves ripple through the ground. You see a Vertibird plummet to the ground from the EMP and dust flying through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, before the shockwave reaches you, the vault opens and you plummet into the ground. The shockwave races overhead as you enter the bowels of the vault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gaze in shock as the vault seals and you arrive at at a series of tunnels.

You start by rolling up your top, so this woman can take off your skirt, you hardly have time to think of the oddity of the situation because soon you feel the odd sensation of having your panties pulled down of your legs, reminding you to take off your top. You do that, and stay there waiting for a while, clad only in a bra, as the doctor reaches to grab something from underneath the table. You can't see what it is, your breasts block your view, and don't really want to sit up. Your answer comes in the form of powder being rubbed on your private areas, a feeling which brings sensations you didn't really think could come to you from a woman. After what feels like an unnecessary amount of time and focus on your womanhood, the doctor slides a big white diaper under you, and pulls it up, taping it on. She helps you up into a sitting position, where you see yourself in the mirror, and begin to understand just how puffy the diaper is. Silently, the doctor helps you into a jumpsuit that does nothing to hide your diaper. You waddle towards orientation, where most are already in their pods, and you climb in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gets cold, everything feels stuck, you close your eyes, and open them. The pod opens up and you fall out, everything is decrepid.

No staying up past curfew. and no forcing someone to change you.<br>\r\n\"The three level two rules can get you anything from multiple additional shifts, to lack of clothes privileges, just a bra and your diaper. The punishments are, no going over you weekly diaper limit, no opting to not wear a diaper, and no lying about other rule breakers.<br>\r\n\"And there's the two tier three rules, and the punishments for those are bad, you'll see 'em soon enough though. The only rules there, are no using a toilet, and no leaking.<br>\r\n\"Finally, there's the worst of them all, no self changing. Doing that can get you sent to the nursery, people who come back from that are never the same. Oh, but there is one girl, she's a courser so she doesn't follow the rules, and we're not allowed to tell her about them. Might cause a scene or something. Now can you change me? I really don't want to get caught breaking a level three rule, or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you say?</span></div></div>",

Bad Idea; pain flared across her legs and she went down landing on her softly padded bum. Wait, padded? A quick feel around her crotch and a spark of memory reminded her of her new undergarment. Sarah sighed knowing that there was no real way to properly change in this environment and considering her lack of underwear nothing for her to change into. She resigned herself to wearing a diaper until she could make it to Rivet City. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah tried to stand again this time taking into the account the pain her legs and the bulk in her crotch and managed an unsteady walk. Checking the bodies of the dead caravan she recovered a handful of useful items ammo, and water as well as their ID Tags. But, as she began to make her way towards the carrier she spotted a small leather bag. First making sure there was nothing dangerous Sarah began investigating, finding ammo, food, and diaper and other babyish items like a pacifier and powder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really is this someone sick joke? What the actual hell damn it.\"  A sinking feeling had been going through her, a dead Caravan diaper, who and what could possibly do this. Shaking it off she decided that she would investigate the matter later and began to head towards Rivet. A quick check of the time told her that she still had about a half an hour left the ambush and her unconscious having taken up close to two and a half hours and she needed to beat feet to make it on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she make it to Rivet city uninterrupted?</span></div></div>",

She snapped out of it and grabbed her sheets and snuck out of her room shitty knickers and all, towards the washing machine, which given her current state was quite hard, she almost was caught be some idle scribes but she managed to sneak past, once there she chucked the sheets into a spare washing machine and snuck back to her room. <br>\r\nShe was almost there when she felt the very urgent need to go, both 1and 2, really again she thought as she jammed, her hands to her still damp crotch and tried to get back to her room to avoid another accident, she had just made it into her private bathroom and locked the door when the floodgates let lose,\"no,no,no\" she stammered as a large yellow puddle formed at her feet. <br>\r\n It was at this time another battle was lost, with a loud \"ffrrrrrrrp\" a 2 inch wide log began to seep it's way into her already messy panties, this was followed by another loud \"pppprrrrrrffffffffttt\" as it quickened its pace into her pants, she tried halt it's progress by clenching her anus but the force behind it was to strong, she tried to make her way towards the toilet and was almost there when a sudden sharp pain to her lower abdomen caused her to double over and let out some more loud \"ppprrrfffttts\" followed by some loud \"ffffrrrrpppps\" as a second log landed in her panties, tears welled up in her eyes as she excepted defeat and squatted down and pushed, some more small logs landed in her pants which were now almost touching the floor due to the weight of her load, this was followed by a few more long \"fffffffffffrrrrrrrrrrrrpppppppppsssss\" and a very loud \"pppppppprrrrrrrrrrfffffttttssss\" as a loud of mushy poo landed on top of the rest of her mess, standing up and waddling of to the mirror she inspected the damage once again.<br>\r\nBefore it had been a few hand grenades but now her previously white panties were now brown at the back, and it looked as if someone had put a half deflated soccer ball in them, her panties were also just staying up and she had to grab the waistband to make sure the didn't fall, waddling over to the toilet she flushed it panties and all down the toilet, before taking a shower. <br>\r\nGetting out of the shower she walked over to her dresser and went to get some new panties, picking up her favourite pair she noticed a plastic package underneath she grabbed it, it was a pair of pulls ups from when she was 15 and still wet the bed, this gave her an idea, the infirmary stocked diapers for soldiers in comas and it would be pretty easy to sneak a pack out, \"no\" she said shaking the idea out of her head \"I am a fully grown women, I do not need diapers\", though the wet sheets in the wash and the destroyed knickers say otherwise she thought as she put her clean panties on and got dressed for her date. <br>\r\nShe decided to wear some old gray jeans, a blue skirt, a white singlet withe a black leather jacket, grabbing her 10mm pistol and satchel she left, on her way out she passed the infirmary and stopped, should she grab some diapers just in case, she could sneak a pack into her satchel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like the handful of other still functioning vaults in the area, it had some contact with the outside world, but mostly existed independently, separate from the stories of the commonwealth. What little stories did get through however, made overseer Jacklyn Pierce glad she was on her side of the vault door. Sure there were stories of deathclaws, metal men and all sorts of horrific beasts, but what really scared her, were the stories of the other vaults of the world. From junkie riots to cryogenic freezing, Jacklyn was glad that vault 85 had such non-lethal experiments. And what experiments they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVault 85, like most vaults, was all one big experiment for the people of the new world to take from when that time came. The experiment in 85 was simple, put one individual under extreme social pressure and gauge the reactions of them and their peers. The person chosen was always young, between 16 and 21 at the time of their choosing, for optimal social self-consciousness. They didn't know they'd been picked, hell, they didn't even know the experiment was happening. Once a vault-dweller reached 30 years in age they were informed of the prank, and let in on the secrets. If one was the lucky choosee of the experiment, they were often offered the job of next overseer, which was how Jacklyn got hers. Jacklyn remembered the wet bed sheets and unintentional public nudity fondly, and had decided she wouldn't trade it for the world. The one being experimented on was always female, keeping both the overseer of the project and the one being humiliated the same gender was simply a safety precaution, that the overseer might not abuse their position. The one at the core of the experiment was often the one thought to be the most squeamish, some parents tried to correct their children at a young age of such behavior, while others encouraged it, seeing the potential of having an overseer in the family. Most however, stuck to the experiment and did not alter their child's behavior either way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was a big day for the vault however, as today...</span></div></div>",

The experiment had stopped a little over 3 years ago when Jacklyn had turned 30 herself, and now it was time to pick her subject. This had to be good, as, for an additional precaution, the overseer usually backed down at age 50, as with age, came lack of ability to manage both the vault and it's experiment. Jacklyn had her old overseer, Ms. Paulson, if she needed help yes, but, with only one subject per overseer, Ms. Paulson's guidance couldn't help her now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vault was one of the largest vaults built on purpose. There were so many families, it was entirely possible that two given people would hardly come into contact throughout the first years of their lives.

Shy and self-conscious of her not yet entirely developed body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Anna, also a perfect fit, 18 years old and Asian with black hair and an average body type, boasting c-cup breasts and a tight, but not large, rear, she is a social butterfly with great care in her image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: more choices</span></div></div>",

One of her predecessors had installed this direct line so that the vault's secret work could be aided by the outside world without the security staff (many of whom were still quite young) not having to learn about the work. As far as Jacklyn new, there had never been much use for this direct line in the way the old overseer had hoped, but the promise was always there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacklyn pressed the button, aware that she was most likely talking to some scavvers trying to case the vault. \"Hello, this is Overseer Pierce of Vault 85, are you a caravan, adventurer, or of another occupation?\" She hated that last part, it sounded so robotic, and most raiders would answer with nothing pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, caravan.\" The voice on the other end said, this was clearly a young woman, and not one Jacklyn recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vault 85's policy for new caravaneers is an entrance tribute as well as a full list of inventory before entrance, we accept fusion cores, water or food shipments, or anything of equal value to the vault.\" Jacklyn was bored out of her mind, and she was sure it showed on the intercom, she was much more interested in operating the experiment than she was in dealing with this wasteland trader, carrying nothing more than junk and irradiated snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I have some food, but that's not what this caravan really sells...\" The stranger spoke with enough mystery to intrigue Jacklyn, maybe there was something more to this trader than junk and rads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly do you sell then?\" Jacklyn asked, trying to maintain her bored monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person switched on their pitching voice and began her sell. \"You, my friend, are speaking to the sole proprietor of Ava's Adult emporium. The only caravan in the commonwealth bringing old america's naughtiest pastimes back from the grave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light bulb turned on in Jacklyn's head.

Jacklyn sat impatiently as the elevator's arrow moved from the top, closer to the bottom, where her floor was. The girl that came out was thin, tall, and strikingly blonde. She was tanned from her days on the road, and clearly took care of her appearance. She wore clothes that would be normal for a scavenger, were they not so short and revealing, and carried just one backpack on her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacklyn spoke first, \"Show me what you have for sale.\" She attempted to sound bored and monotone, as well as strong and demanding at the same time. Jacklyn was the overseer, if the vault new she was looking at 'adult items' she would be kicked to the wastes for sure. This Ava had to know that Jacklyn was in charge, and one peep to the people of the vault would find her on the receiving end of the bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither Jacklyn's intimidation didn't work, or the girl just didn't care to show it. She opened her pack and began to lay out a few of her wares. \"Is this you're entire store?\" Jacklyn asked, trying to sound unimpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh no,\" The girl said, she had mastered the art of appearing both innocent and sexy at the same time, \"These are just a few sample items, a tribute, as it were.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the girl had brought her tribute in secret, maybe she was smart enough not to blab to the vault if she was given entry. Jacklyn, now slightly more comfortable, looked at the five items the girl had brought, the first one was simple, attractive women's underwear designed to entice. The second one, was nearly the opposite, a metal band that looked like it went around the waist, it would allow for the bathroom, and little else. The third one she finally recognized, a diaper, like the ones in the vault, but sized to fit an adult. The third and fourth both appeared to have similar uses, one both were, long, and rather cylindrical with rounded tops. The first one appeared to have a switch attached to a fission battery near the base, and the second one came with a harness near the base. Jacklyn could picture their uses, but she wasn't sure she wanted to. The last one confused her, a small, egg that was corded to a dial, she'd have to inquire about that some other time, but at that time she said...</span></div></div>",

Where other raider groups pick a piece of dirt to set up shop, and then proceed to draw attention to themselves by attacking everything in sight, the atomic brothel is carefully placed inside an old strip club in the south side of Boston. The club only has two ways through, and both go into small alleyways where enemies can be fired upon from the roof easily. The building itself is full of side rooms alcoves, great for storage, interrogations, prisoner holding, ambushes, you name it. Not to mention the main stage, which is nice for public executions, shows they can charge other raiders for, or just keeping the girls morale up. Being in south Boston means trade comes through commonly, but no faction has a grip on the area, and the gang can grow unchecked. The only problem so far has been the gunners, but they'be been held off successfully enough so far. Their leader is also smart, never calling raids on something so rich it will get the wrong people's attention, but not so poor that girls have to die over some two-bit farmers dirt cart either. The gang is also selective with it's recruits, with many requirements, the least of which being you must be a girl. Selective recruiting means smaller numbers but more time to train each soldier, something the gang uses to it's advantage. The gang has operated with an alright amount of success, but that's about to change, and you're going to change it. Who are you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You crawl back into your room, wet, messy and overall disgusted. What a night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started when the boss called a celebration to, as she put it, 'show off her NRC prize.' You didn't even try to correct her. The party was little more than an excuse for them to all get drunk and frisky with each other, and you often found yourself at the center of it. As the bosses personal servant you were given some special rules. One, she was to be called mistress by you (you heard in a conversation that she was known widely as Lucille.) Two, when speaking, you would only speak when spoken too, and with your given title in the third person, (or in other words, this bitch this, this bitch that et cetera.) Three, You would do any request made for you by the girls, with more important girls getting more priority. And finally, if you broke any rules, your chances of getting your diapers changed would decrease, and while it wasn't that bad right away, the idea of being chained into a triple diaper in a building with no working toilets doesn't sound very fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actual party was even worse than being told the rules. At first, you were dog collared to a leash with Lucille, and were forced to crawl to avoid being choked by the woman. When you made it to the 'hall' you found yourself on a makeshift stage in a gutted portion of the factory with four long tables all full of raiders in diapers beneath you. As the trophy, you got to stand on the stage tonight, in future nights you were to stand in the corner. After Lucille gave her nonsense speech about how this new gang known as the MRC (just unfortunate really) had already given up it's artillery expert and was now totally crippled by Innocence Station, the feasting commenced. You were sent to work, both as a server, and as an object of desire. You could at least take solace in being the bosses trophy, no girl got to handsy with you, but it was still hours of waddling down the isles carrying rancid meat or bringing drinks, both in traditional and baby bottles. You were groped and felt and called for more times than you can remember, with one girl even going so far as to pour her drink down your diaper, causing it to sag wildly and increase the effort in your waddle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the night, you did however, gather some information. For one, this was the entire gang, some 40 or so girls, most of which hardly trained in way of real combat. Your division could storm this place with minimal casualties, that is if you were with your division. Additionally, you learned the structure of command pretty well. In lieu of stripes or stars, the raiders used diaper variants. Learning the structure from diaper type was difficult. On one hand, the lowest girls got thin, plain only semi-childish and rather thin diapers. And as the chain moved up from there, they got more thick, colorful, and humiliating, at a point however, they stopped being so humiliating, some were still childish, and they were all even thicker than before, but they were worn like badges. Finally, you were able to discern four distinct groups in the hierarchy, you aren't sure if this is a conscious structure from the girls, or just a natural outcome of their power balance. The lowest, 'bedwetters' as you called them. Wore thin diapers, with minimal, if embarrassing designs, like the diapers used for a kid who wets the bed. At first you found it humorous, a lot of these girls were young enough to be doing just that, but with the structure of this place, <i>all</i> of the girls are probably doing just that. Next in line were the babies, slightly older and more important looking, with thicker diapers but still on the bottom of the totem pole, as exemplified by the childish colors and designs that they often seemingly tried to hide in how they sat. These two groups made up seemingly 75% of the group. Above them were, as you called them, the diaper models. Girls that had diapers even thicker than before, this group was your standard squad leaders and work supervisors. Their diapers were thick and vibrant often with post-war designs, like the one on yours, but less humiliating. And finally, there were the Mommies, that group actually seemingly had that title, as anyone who spoke to one of them started the conversation with 'mommy.' There were only three of these, Lucille and her two lieutenants, named Maria and Dalia. All of there diapers were completely unique, Maria and Lucille having rather plain diapers, and Dalia having arguably the most colorful one of all. The unifying factor of all of these were how large they were, almost rivaling yours in scope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were of course exceptions in the group. Maria seemed to be slightly more important than Dalia, and some of the bedwetter group were seemingly in the process of becoming the babies. Three girls, all younger than twenty, wore only pull-ups, and were clearly initiates. One of them was promoted to a bedwetter at the party, and changed from a soggy pull-up to a white diaper right on the table, with a new poorly fitting bra to boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was, in short terrible, but amidst all the terrible behavior of your new captors, you came up with a plan of escape. It was, in short...</span></div></div>",

The room you step into is massive, a storage room for the finished product no doubt, it has been turned into a pink painted room with racks upon racks of diapers. You move to the pull-ups, and not wanting to waste any time on your punishment grab the thickest pull-up you can first find. A purple striped one with a wetness indicator you suspect has a short lifespan. Thinking quickly, you decide to release yourself into the diapers, knowing just how full this little piece of plastic is bound to get. You return to the room, a new sag to your diapers and await further instructions. Dalia hasn't moved, and doesn't bother looking up before saying. \"Undress yourself, and put the pull-up on.\" You do exactly that, glad to be out of the stale heavy diapers so soon, even if it is just into a pull-up. You stop, awaiting further instructions. Dalia watches you for a second, before motioning with her eyes to pick up the chain near your feet. You pick it up, chain it back on, and toss her the key without a second thought. \"Good girl, now let's escort you to your new room.\" Dalia stands up and takes you by the hand to a small room on the other side of the second floor. You find it weird not waddling, and choose to waddle if only to avoid having to re-learn regular walking for a hundred foot walk. The room you find yourself in is rather odd, you aren't sure what it was used for before, it's simply an empty room now, but you do notice that the door locks from the outside, and small slot exists at the bottom for food. You waddle in, and Dalia shuts it behind you. \"Oh, and one more thing,\" She calls from the door. \"Every day, you're gonna get a challenge, if you can do it successfully, then we'll take a day from your sentence, if you try but fail, we'll add one. If you manage all three today before your mistress gets home, I have a reward for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you find yourself alone, you sit on the ground, and lie there for a bit, bored but absolute in your resolve.

You need to complete this challenge, so you start to rub to, much to the pleasure of yourself and the girls watching. You block them out as you try to think of Cassie, or old world pin-up posters. It starts to work more and you find yourself actually feeling pleasure. You let out a light moan before the weirdest thought pops into your head, Cassie in that diaper, it's only for a second but it sends your body into overdrive. And is enough to carry you to finishing within the minute. The pull-up soaks up the fluids as the girls cheer, and Dalia approaches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job little one, ready for your next challenge?\" You nod yes, as that is all you have the control to do. \"Good, because your challenge is to spend an hour in the stocks, ready?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting locked into the stocks, it is hardly ten minutes before you realize...</span></div></div>",

Now come on, Dalia has a mission for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waddle with Sophie to the armory, where you find three girls assembling outside the armory, all significantly higher up the invisible totem poll than you or Sophie. The door opens and the girls shuffle in, you and Sophie coming in last. Upon entering the room, you see Dalia has a crude map drawn out, with a route drawn along one of the roads. For all the crap you and you're squadmates gave raiders, you see that they have more in-depth maps than you ever did. \"Alright girls, here's the plan.\" Dalia says. \"We've heard rumors that the Jaguars are trying to take territory in the area. Well not if innocence station has anything to say about it! We're taking two new recruits with us,\" Dalia says, gesturing to you and Sophie. \"They'll try their hardest not to mess themselves when the bullets start flying, but still, everyone be ready. We're moving out in 10.\" With that, the briefing ends, you and Sophie as well as all the other girls move around the armory and into the nearby diaper room, loading yourselves out. There's a clear section marked off just for girls of your rank, containing mostly just melee and pipe weapons. You grab an old 10mm, so you can use something semi-reliable. Going to the diaper room, you notice it has more than just diapers, but armor as well, you find it odd, wearing something over your breasts after these days of going shirtless, but you find a reinforced leather bra as well as new diaper and change into that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the party set off, Dalia in the lead, with you and Sophie directly behind her as the shock troops going stealthily through the bush. Or as stealthily as possible considering. You heard the attack plan, attack them when they are setting up camp with a direct assault, but that seems to you like a needless waste of resources and life, particularly when there's an overpass just nearby you could climb to snipe them and throw explosives down. You could bring it up to Dalia, but a good soldier follows orders, not questions them. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Dalia explains your plan and you and Sophie wait while the others set up. The last thing Dalia gives you is a hand grenade, to 'deliver the first blow' as she put it. Fifteen minutes later, you can see Dalia out on the over pass in between your hidden position and the Jaguar camp. As you approach it, you see not the three you were anticipating, but ten. Dalia gives the thumbs up and you toss the grenade at the fire at the camp center, and all hell breaks loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first grenade took out four, then it was just a case of picking targets and taking them out while the others caught them from behind. You got two more causalities and by the end of the fight, the Jaguar camp was destroyed and innocence station saw a single injury in the form of Sophie scraping her arm against a stick. You and Sophie set about looting the camp ground as the girls came down. You joke and laugh about how Sophie had indeed messed herself at the first sign of fire, and find some pretty good guns along the way. When Dalia comes down she too joins in the looting speaking as soon as she enters. \"Nice job girls, NCR, you did a good job coming up with that plan, a few more successes and you may become my personal assistant, and plan these things full-time. Other than that, you girls can keep what you find on two conditions, it was your kill and no one of a higher rank wants it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Sophie and the raiding party trek back after the whole event, and after a short stint halfway back for a collective diaper change, you make it back without incident. Your first thought is to go get something to drink in the hall, but Dalia gestures for you to follow her. \"Is there something you want mommy?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few things actually, one you can cut the mommy crap with me, it's Dalia, Mommy's something we make the girls say to prove to them how little they matter in comparison to us, but you, you're going somewhere, so don't get used to calling me mommy, cause you won't be for long. Two, I want you to come with me, we're planning something big and with what you've shown today, your brains will be a valuable asset to our organization.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, uh, ma'am, er, Dalia.\" You say, a little awkwardly. Dalia simply laughs it off as the two of you walk towards a room in the corner that contains Lucille's throne room. You enter a small unmarked door after Dalia, only to find Maria and Lucille standing around a situation table with all sorts of commonwealth maps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's she doing here?\" Maria asks with disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought her along, she was very valuable today, that scouting party ended up having ten members, but her good aim and tactics meant we didn't see a single casualty. We need someone to break this little tie of ours, I thought she would be a good fit.\" Dalia says with a surprising amount of force. You didn't think she cared that much for your abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria laughs it off but Lucille seems impressed. \"Alright, it's not like she's been around long enough to have a favorite of the three of us. She's the tiebraker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour confusion catches up with you, and you ask. \"Tiebreaker for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria opens her mouth, probably to scold you for not saying 'mommy'. But Dalia steps in. \"We're at a crossroads right now. This war between the commonwealth factions has really opened up a lot of avenues for us, but we only have the resources for one. Being this far out of Boston means we'll probably only find trouble if we go looking for it, so we'll need to focus on one thing, in case it goes bad and we end up needing all of our forces to deal with one problem. I say, we try and fight the Jaguars, that gang we fought today. They have their own farms and have been infringing on our territory for far to long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I say we focus on raiding the caravans!\" Maria jumps in, \"We won't need farms when we're get so rich we can all go buy our own rooms in the Diamond city upper stands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I abstain, I like both plans, but I'm not about to commit to one without some counsel.\" Lucille says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what'll it be?\" Dalia asks, \"The jaguars or the caravans?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can go now, we've got some more things to discuss but we'll see how you are at making plans tomorrow, when you help us plan the first assault.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon leaving the room, you run off to go find Sophie, share some drinks, and tell her the good news. After doing just that, you fall asleep drunk. And wake up the next morning, being sent for by Dalia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you enter the room you were in last night, you find Dalia sitting, pouring over maps and seemingly hand-made troop tallies. Her eyes have bags and her diaper's soggy, she's been here all night. \"Good, you're here. Listen, here's the deal, the Jaguars have three main strongholds, we have the force to take each one, but we only have the girls to hold one. The other problem is that we don't know how many troops are at each base, the rotate regularly, so no one knows which target is easiest and which one's the hardest. I've been thinking, and my best bet is take their central base, the tato ranch. Split their forces and take out their food supply. Any critiques?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the maps for a second, and make your comments. \"A few, for one, taking the center tato farms opens us up to a two pronged attack, if we want to go take another location, part of the strike force would have to stay back to defend from the other side, and if one group gets a message to the other, we could be facing a two fronted battle. Two, if we don't have the troops to hold all three positions than the idea of a war of attrition is impossible, they have food stores in the other two locations no doubt, and if they can grow tatos at the ranch, they'll be able to grow tatos elsewhere, and as soon as we try to stop one group from growing those tatos, they take back the ranch. And we can't go salted earth, we'd lose the whole reason we're fighting this thing. No I have a different plan, we should...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Use shock tactics to overrun both sides, the center will be in chaos as the others retreat in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Commit to a massive all at once stealth attack on all three locations, it doesn't matter if we actually out gun them, we simply need to overrun them.</span></div></div>",

I'm done calling you little one, you've earned a name here.\" You nod your head and feel a sudden rush of humanity. You've hardly thought about your true self since starting this. You aren't a raider, you're an NCR soldier, a taken woman with a girlfriend back at camp who's waiting for you. But here you stand, planning for this gang in which you are rising through the ranks, feeling more like yourself than you've felt in a long time, maybe not now, but soon you're going to have to evalaute what you really want for your life. \"The other bosses and I are done planning, with one look at our maps, you were able to figure out a more complex plan than we could in a day, I don't know if that counts as genius where you're from, but it does at Innocence Station. You're being promoted, and not to typical grunt, you're a lieutenant now, specifically one of my lieutenants. When you get a second, change your diaper, and wear it with pride. Now, as my lieutenant, you'll be one of my field leaders as well, that means radioing to me on the situation during the battle and leading a group of the girls. I know you've found a friend in that Sophie girl, so she'll be your aide this mission. You will be helping to lead the assault on the Jaguars southernmost base, the old motel. It's not their headquarters, or their farms, so we have reason to believe you'll be attacking on the path of least resistance. I'll rally the other girls, and you'll all rally the troops, but we attack tonight. No go change, and grab your old service rifle, you'll need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step into the nearby room, and move over to the far rack, farthest in the diaper part of the storage room, where you find the diapers of your rank. You pick out a pink one, only to find there are no designs on it. It makes sense, all of theses designs are post war, and until you get a design into the factory floor, you're gonna have to make the designs yourself. Thinking quickly, you write 'NCR waste disposal' in small marker on the butt, and put it on. You grab a second diaper, write an identical phrase, and put it in the canteen pack of the pink combat armor you find in the room. You grab one last poorly fitting army helmet before returning to the armory to grab your gun, where you find three other girls waiting around Dalia and her maps. \"Girls, this is Sammi, she's the brains of our plan, and if this goes well, she'll have a permanent residence in our upper ranks.\" Dalia then looks at you and gestures to the first of three girls, a smiley blonde woman with a look of innocence aided by her rainbow colored diaper. \"Sammi, this is Kayla.\" Next she points to an angry looking woman clad in some heavy combat armor, save the the pants, with no hair on her head. \"This is princess, she won't tell us her real name. And this is Lilian.\" She finishes by pointing to the last girl, and frizzy haired girl with skin darker than Dalia's. \"Now that we have our introductions, here's the plan. The old motel is our target of choice. For the Jaguars, it works like a trading hub, where anyone, so long as they aren't to above the board, can bring in all sorts of goods. Unfortunately for them, it's also very open. Out goal is to take the parking lot, that's where the garrison and the shops mostly are, and from there, it will be easy work flushing out the motel rooms. It has two main road entrances, as well as one rear path to what used to be a pool, and is now a watering hole. Lilian, Princess, you two are taking the two front entrances, to the north, and east respectively. Kayla and Sammi, you're the rear attack force, I want you to push in after the fighting starts to catch them by surprise and cut off escape. Kayla, you're in charge of everything, if radios are knocked out, I want you to be the next in line for command. You all have your teams, Sammi, you'e in charge of K-team, you'll find that your assistant has the manifest. Mommy Lucille is going to send us off tonight with a speech, but as soon as it's over, that's when you're leaving. Don't let anything slow you down, and make sure all radios are charged, Sammi's plan hinges on one all-out coordinated stealth assault.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day continues and you're able to connect with Sophie, she has your troop manifest, mostly the newest recruits, as such you spend most of your day giving them the basics of unit tactics, which seems to work a little. Night comes, Lucille gives her speech about 'innocence station supremacy' and 'the end of the Jaguar' which does well to work the girls up, leading to an anxious, yet quiet crawl through the wastes. You get to the motel, and prepare for the assault. Soon you get the signal, three short bursts of radio static, and the gun fire starts from the front of the motel. Due to the darkness, you still aren't sure how many troops the Jaguars have there, but once the shooting ramps up, it seems to be more than you were anticipating. You aren't worried however, and you take Sophie and your girls through the back side into the parking lot path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight is going well, until you notice a problem, in an act of bravery and skill, you single handedly...</span></div></div>",

Your first observation during the fight is that not every jaguar is directly shooting back, some are radioing in to somewhere. That won't do, you look around to see a small dish connected with a cord to one of the rooms on the second floor of the motel. In a moment of pure adrenaline, without even thinking about your own safety in this raider war, you rush for the stairs, taking out the Jaguar who was using them as cover, and run up to the second floor. You sprint across the platform, all the while taking shots at the other Jaguars up on your level. Soon, you make it to the door with the radio. Standard NCR breaching procedures requires three individuals, but your plan requires the Jaguars be in chaos, and a radio is the oppisite of chaos. You kick open the door and open fire on the two guards, as well as the radio operater. All three fall before returning a single bullet to you. You slow down, approaching the radio and letting the adrenaline subside. The smell in the room is bad, at first you think one of the raiders here messed themselves, but you realize that was you, without even noticing while on the adrenaline rush. You kick the dead radio operator out of his seat, so tired you don't even care about the mushing as you sit down in his spot, and radio in to the Jaguars around you. \"Attention all Jaguars, any girl who wants to join innocence station as a raider on the winning side, can throw down her gun and pee herself. Otherwise, throw down your guns anyway, and accept surrender!\" You feel exhausted, your body aches from adrenaline, and crawling, and sleeping on the floor. You look outside, the fighting is still happening, but the Jaguars are completely overrun, you did it. You also see a utility ladder leading down to a break in the fencing. You could run now, be down with it, return to the NCR, and simply say you escaped. Or you could stay, either because you've truly become a raider, or you desire to use these killers as unknowing NCR puppets. You decide to...</span></div></div>",

Cassie continued to move in her reverie until a smell pulled her out. It wasn't pleasant to say the least. She looked around, hoping it was a clue to some innocence station raider, and not just radstag droppings. Sure enough, she soon found a large pink diaper, discarded on the ground.

We were recruits too once, and no one wants time in the cells.\" Replies Katrina, the representative for the lower class grunts who just graduated from training. The hard line civilized life style was met with almost no resistance. While fun, it was just easier to live in a world where you were free from having your ass felt for 'wetness checks' every five minutes. (That never happened to you of course, but it was a common occurrence according to the members of the first council.) \"And besides, you don't even know if it's us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Several girls have reported getting pranked or groped at night, only to see the rear end of standard non-trainee diapers running away, you're the only one's who wear those.\" Tanya responds. The council has been civilized as well, no one cares enough for political assassinations, but there has still been good attendance, and three weeks of heavy training, learning the rules, and trying at democracy has softened up the girls. Not in the combat sense, but in that they all seem a little less comfortable with the idea of attacking an innocent caravan, which is exactly what you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrook, the representative of the guard detail speaks up, \"Look, why don't we just form a joint investigation, some recruits, some regulars, and some of my girls. At worst, the criminals hear about the investigation, and stop doing it to avoid punishment, at best, we get to catch some bad guys.\" The cherry on top to your brilliant plan has been it's affect on the other parts of the gang. Dalia's already made her council, Maria and Lucille are being pushed to make councils of their own, and the idea of a big council with representatives from every part of the gang has been thrown around. It's starting to feel a little bit more like home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I like that plan, and I think that's our last matter of business.

You find Sophie, passed out with her face dug into the diapered crotch of one of the girls and shake her up. With her in tow, you say your polite goodbyes to the other mommy's and stop by the armory before heading back. It's so weird to think that not so long ago you were enslaved to these girls, humiliated and objectified for their fun, and now you're the top dog. You figure the other mommy's aren't going to punish the newest member on top for taking more than she was allowed from the armory. In all the weeks since coming to really join this outfit you've hardly updated your outfit. Now, with the pick of the litter, you waddle your way around the armory, hardly even conscious that your diaper is still used, and pick out an outfit to match your rank. You grab a padded bra and a leather jacket, as well as some fishnets that have amazingly not yet ripped, (though you wonder for how much longer) and lastly, a pink tutu that hardly covers your sagging diaper. That last part is for Cassie, she always had a thing for those old world dancers, though when you return to her, you aren't quite sure how she'd think of your look now. Ignoring that thought, you also grab a few extra pink diapers and some markers, the NCR design the girls made for you is nice, but you think it could use some personal flare. Lastly you turn around to Sophie, standing quietly in the corner of the room. You've kept her as your aide this whole time, and you still have never really promoted her, not in the way that counts here at least, not in fashion. All this time later she's still in a plain, white (leaking right now) diaper. \"Sophie,\" you say. \"I'm promoting you, please, pick whatever type of diaper you want from here.\" Sophie looks surprised,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you Sammi!\" She waddles over to a shelf of purple diapers and bends down to pick one up. If you weren't taken, Sophie would certainly be someone you were into, most of these raiders would scoff at you for being so monogamous, but it was important to you. And besides, now that you were mommy, they wouldn't scoff publicly, lest they wanted an hour in the stocks. Eventually Sophie pops up proudly, holding a thick, lilac diaper in her hands, you waddle over to examine it. Sophie looks somewhat worried as you snatch it from her hand and grab a marker, and begin to write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Business Bitch'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Business... Bitch?\" Sophie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" You reply, \"Because we've got work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour walk back starts with a change, first her of you, then you of her, then of her again, as she fairly immediately wets one of her new purple diapers. But you don't mind, you spend the changes asking her questions, nothing outright seditious, Sophie is loyal to the gang after all, but mostly asking her what she knows about the mommy's, you'll need dirt or an alliance with some, if not all of them, if this is going to work. The discussion while you clean and change her in the dirt, and while you walk to the motel ends up being very informative, and you get dirt on all 3 mommies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe info you find is fascinating, turns out Sophie's had her ear to the ground for a while, it turns out Dalia, Maria, and Lucille all have weakspots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDalia: already allied with you, is said to have risen from the ranks herself, but some say she misses the old lifestyle of being lower class, the crawling, the being played with, she's too important for that now, but she misses it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria: Word is, she's planning a power grab of her own. All of this is just rumor though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Lucille: The woman on top, you'll need to work on one of the other two before her, but its said she only likes to wet her diaper, but avoids messing it if she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour imind is a buzz with thoughts on what to do next, but as you approach camp, something takes you out of your thoughts.
