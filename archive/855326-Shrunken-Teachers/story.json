They all take out their pens and books and you start the lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything is going well until about 5 minutes before the end of the lesson. You have a load of chemicals on the bench. The lab assistant has just brought out some solutions and has put them on your desk. One is a greeny liquid.<br>\r\nWhile you are teaching you turn and spil it. It goes over you. You think nothing of it and wash it off immediately just incase.<br>\r\nThe bell sounds and the girls pack their books away.<br>\r\n\"Right thank you girls. See you on Thursday morning.\" you say<br>\r\nThe girls all vacate the room and head for their buses or cars to travel home.<br>\r\nOnce the room is empty you feel funny. Your hot and dizzy.<br>\r\nSuddenly without warning you collapse on the lab floor.<br>\r\nAfter a while you wake up and look around.

The program on at that moment just happened to be an old cartoon from the US, one of the old Bugs Bunny's and one you recognize. They'd just gotten to the scene where the rabbit is underwater, and the dog cashing him has him trapped in a rabbit sandwich. The dog is about to take what he thinks is a big bite from the bunny, though in reality Bugs had pulled himself out of harms way before the dog even got near the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over to find that Hannah has timed her own bite quite perfectly and just as the dog takes a huge chomp out of his sandwich, she takes a bite out of her's. One that, unfortunately, includes you. You feel the pressure increase around you for a moment, before slacking off again, and looking out you can see nothing but darkness, with occasional flashes of light off the tendrils of saliva that are forming in response to your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hits you then that you're really inside your daughter's mouth, about to be part of her snack while watching the telly waiting for her friend. Such an end doesn't seem fitting of a man of your standing and you're determined to rally against it. Pulling the last of your strength you roll as the tongue pushes the sandwich between those white rocks, and fall right onto its slimy surface. The slippery saliva causes you to slip and slide for a moment, and then suddenly the tongue cups and you are swished from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMM,\" says your daughter in a voice that comes from all around you. You realize that she's tasting you, and apparently you taste good. You would much rather taste rancid or something, so that she spit you out. Instead you are apparently very much to her tastes as she slips you around her tongue, getting the fullest of your flavor. You can't believe your own daughter is going to kill you, by simply enjoying her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a last slide you find yourself uncomfortably situated on top of some sharp objects, with more of them descending to crush you. You don't have time to think or make any kind f conscious decision. Instead you act completely on instinct. With a sharp cry you kick out, catching you foot on one of Hannah's molars and pushing yourself off the teeth. Only when you take a moment to think do you realize that you just pushed yourself right into Hannah's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strike a soft wall that ripples under you a second later, and then feel a suction as you are pulled down with an audible GULP! Again there is no time to think, and you splay your arms and legs wide, hoping to catch something again, and with a cry of surprise you find you have, and suddenly your rapid descent comes to a hold. Hannah can't swallow you any farther as long as you hold yourself out like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately your muscular prison of flesh begins to vibrate rapidly now, and you can feel it undulate under your hands. With a sickening feeling in your own stomach you realize that Hannah is choking on you, and with no one around she might not get you up, and she would die, choking on her father. You were faced with a horrible decision now. Let go, and slid down into your daughter's stomach, or stay where you are and let her die.</span></div></div>",

So you punch and scream as loud as you can, shouting out every curse word you can think of in your mindless-ranting. She suddenly bits down on you-hard.

Immediately, you work feverishly to undo your belt so you can get away. But as you are undoing the buckle, something drops next to you, a ball of paper. Then another one falls, and you look to see where it came from. A student from one of your previous classes is stareing at you. You immediately reconize her as Jessie Thomas, a vrey good student and roll model for all students. She smiles as you make eye contact then it fades as she mouths something to you,<br>\r\n\"Professor?\" she mouths looking at you. You knod you head as looks on. <br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" she mouths again. You give her an odd look, and she then immitates putting something ino her mouth and biting down. You understand and knod your head again as you work on your belt. It is quickly undone, and you grab it and easily slip it back on, slowly walking to Jessie's seat. Her heand immediately scoops down, and you climb up. She holds onto you gingerly, and you are thankful for that. She quickly but gently deposits you into her purse, which you are also thankful that it isn't full or crammed with dangerous objects. You sit and wait the class out, thankful that your in the hands of a responsibly, kind girl.</span></div></div>",

How did you get so small?, asked a very concerned Jessie. \"I'm not okay!\", you shout in a high pitched little voice and then begin to cry. Jessie cradles you in her arms and strokes your face with her long soft fingers. \"Shhh, it's okay Professor everything will be okay don't cry! I'll make sure you get big again somehow\"She coos softly to you as she wipes away your little tears. Your very embarrassed to be sobbing like this in front of one of your pupils but you can't seem to stop. \"B-But I'm really small and can't do anything I used to! I-I can't grade papers or-or teach classes and I'm smaller than a Barbie doll I---\"Jessie cuts you off \"Professor everything will be okay,okay?\", she says softly while still cradling you in her arms. You sniff loudly and wipe your face while it grows very red. \"Sorry it's just that everything is so big and scary now\",you say and pause and then look down while your face continues to redden and murmur\" I'm glad your taking care of me though Jessie...I feel safe with you\" Jessie starts blinking her tears away. She is touched that Professor Harris would say something like that to her. And as she continues to cradle you in her soft arms you yawn softly and sleep like you haven't slept like in a long time.</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds you land in it.

The sides are too high and too slippery.<br>\r\n\"What we got for pudding mum\" came the other girls voice as she came back with some potatoes and began chopping them.<br>\r\n\"Chocolate Angel Delight.\" her mother replied her voice sounding very close so she must of come into the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"Great I'm going to be pudding for one of them unless I can escape.\" you say to yourself.<br>\r\n\"Are all the carrots and mushrooms chopped now Louise,\" asked her mother<br>\r\n\"Yes all done.\" Louise replied<br>\r\n\"Right if you set the table Claire, then I'll do the cooking.\" replied her mother<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat for what seemed hours in the bowl unable to do anything.

I am significant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pudding has started to engulf your body, blocking out all coherent thought. Primal survival instincts kick in as you thrash wildly to escape your impending doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhcrapohcrapohcrapohcrapohcrap\u2026\u201d you think frantically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body cannot move. It is like trying to swim through quicksand. The harder your struggle, the faster you sink.

You know that voice. It\u2019s\u2026 No\u2026 The face is blurry. You keep seeing your wife instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your body jolts upward. Your brain snaps back into reality. Something metal\u2026 and cold has supported your feet. High in the air above the bowl, you finally escaped drowning in the pudding. Fresh air never tasted so sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face is clear now. Green eyes, like clover. Strawberry hair. A plump round face. Early forties. Her name\u2026 It is\u2026 Cecilia, a receptionist at the college. The two of you are good friends, very good friends. You have known her ever since you started working as a professor. She told you she was going on a date today, and you were happy for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCecilia,\u201d you think. \u201cAll this time and I didn\u2019t realize it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth opens revealing the horror within. Strands of saliva connect the roof of her mouth to her delicate tongue. Masticated potatoes and carrots decorate the grooves of her slightly off-white teeth. A warm wave of breath smelling of previously eaten vegetables washes over you. The tongue undulates in anticipation as Cecilia\u2019s uvula glistens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCecilia!\u201d you scream. \u201cLook here! It\u2019s me, David! Don\u2019t eat me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spoon stops for a moment, and Cecilia pauses to reflect upon something. Has she seen you? Does she know you are there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls, what do you think?\u201d Cecilia booms.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Claire responds through a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n\u201cCharles. Charles Bremen. David introduced me to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe draws the spoon to her mouth. The light fades. You wade frantically through the pudding to escape, but it is far too late. Darkness and humidity sweep over your tiny body. A pungent mix of vegetables and bodily secretions causes you to gag. The spoon jerks backward, and her upper lip scraps you from the spoon, flinging you upon her tongue. The pudding rolls around her mouth as Cecilia\u2019s tongue savors every moment. The tip of the tongue rises to the roof of her mouth. You have seen enough videos from the Anatomy and Physiology class your fellow colleagues teach to know what comes next. The rest of the tongue pushes squeezes you toward her awaiting throat. An indescribable squelching noise ensues. Cecilia swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have given up all hope. The slow dissension down her gullet gives you a few seconds to reflect upon your life. Your daughters and your wife. You want them to never forget you. What will they think of your disappearance? Will they assume you left them for another woman? Well, involuntarily you have. Cecilia has taken you away from them, gluttonously ingesting your miniscule figure without ever knowing it.</span></div></div>",

But, instead, you hear her voice say, very very quietly to you, so no one else can hear... \"You are very lucky, pudding.  I'm the one that's going to eat you, instead of the others.  I hope you enjoy my tummy.  I'd play more, but I can't out here...\" Then she leans back again, and beams down at 'you', looking sweet, innocent, playful, and, subtly hungry.  She licks her lips with a soft, pink tongue, as she picks up her spoon.  She reaches down with it, and scoops out the first spoonful of pudding.<br>\r\nYou yelp in terror, and dive to the side, trying to avoid that spoon, not wanting to get scooped up by this hungry young girl.  What she said just now put a real chill in your bones, gave you a true sense of dread for your fate.... You know you can't stay in here, that's certain doom.  And yet, if you are caught by her, somehow you get the sense that she wouldn't be all that gentle to you.  She seems to enjoy playing with her food quite a bit, so what would she do with something like you, if she had you all to herself?<br>\r\nYou scream again, as another spoonful of pudding gets spooned up.  You can feel the cold metal rub against you, coming within inches of scooping you up with it.  You shiver, and decide to take the risk, before you start waving your arms desperately, hoping to get this young girl's attention, before it's too late!</span></div></div>",
