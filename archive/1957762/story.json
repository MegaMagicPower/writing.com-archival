I got a little over-ambitious and was over 2500 characters over the limit. &gt;.&lt; )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you are so mesmerized by this jiggling that you miss what you should really be paying attention to as the woman moves her foot so fast to regain her balance that it slips right out of the slipper\u2026  Just in time for her to SLAM her foot down on you with a wet SQUESPLAT!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are sure you\u2019re dead, but you soon wish you were as you find your body being smothered under the squishy, sweaty foot flesh, only to realize that your head is stuck between two of her toes!  You try to kick and flail, but her weight is too much, and you only succeed in getting her to squeeze her toes around your head, you finding out first hand that she has massive amounts of toejam along with the sweat as they are both forced down your throat.  You want to throw up, but sweat and toe grime keeps making it\u2019s way into your mouth, leaving you so disgusted that you don\u2019t even notice her moving her foot back into her slipper until it\u2019s too late and you are encased in the most disgusting prison you could ever imagine without your \u201cwarden\u201d even aware of your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are forced through foot gunk hell, Rachel Saxonette settles in as she grabs an old journal out of one of the nearby boxes.  It had suddenly hit her today that now that her youngest had moved out that she was well and truly alone, and how much she really missed her kids well\u2026 being kids.  She hoped that whatever was in the box she had felt crunch under her wasn\u2019t too important, wiggling her toes frantically to try to wipe off whatever had gotten stuck to her foot onto her beloved slippers.  She giggled as she realized that the journal she had just grabbed was from the same year she had gotten these slippers, back when her oldest was still fairly young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Samantha\u2019s Facts About an Extra-Super-Duper, Double-Triple Rare Pixie, the Vexie\u2019 by Samantha.  Oh geez, the only thing she had more of than smarts at that age was her imagination, and that girl had truckloads of smarts\u2026\u201d  Rachel flipped open the book, her curiosity and nostalgia not allowing her to ignore such an old gem by her eldest, even allowing her to ignore whatever was bothering her in her slipper, or at least just play with it with her toes for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Fact 1: Fairies exist, they are rare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 2: Pixies exist, they are rarer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 3: Vexies are a kind of Pixie, and they are extra-super-duper, double-triple rare.  If you are reeeeeally lucky and find one, they make great pets!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 4: Fact 4: Even though Vexies look like tiny humans, they act more like tiny ogres.  They like gross things, and they like to live in gross places, but they like human gross things the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 5: Smelly places are the best.  Places that smell like feet or sweat are better. But I think they like stuff that smells like bum-bums the bestest \u2018cause they\u2019re the smelliest!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha, she did call butts \u2018bum-bums\u2019 back then, didn\u2019t she?\u201d  Rachel let out a little of a laughing fit, her pudge jostling as she ground her foot into the slipper, the tickling between her big and second toe getting worse but not bad enough for her to check yet as she continued reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Fact 6: Vexies like meeting humans, but they\u2019re reeeeeally shy, so they play hide and seek!  Sometimes they like to hide in clothes and stuff so people will find them when they put them on!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s in my slipper!  Well I hope he\u2019s enjoying himself down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she knew\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Fact 7: Vexies like humans so much, they want to be one!  If you find one, he will try to tell you he is a little human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Fact 8: Vexies know humans don\u2019t like gross things, so they will say they don\u2019t either, but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Fact 9: If they don\u2019t get enough gross human stuff, they can get sick!  Don\u2019t worry, you can be as icky as you want around them, and they\u2019ll just like you more!  Actually, the more they complain, the more they probably like it!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, I\u2019m starting to like these little Vexie guys more and more, if only Samantha had actually found one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Fact 10: Vexies are tricky.  They want to be human so bad, they will tell you anything to get you to be not gross.  But they really like it and even need it, so don\u2019t listen no matter what!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Fact 11: If you really love your Vexie, you\u2019ll tell your friends about them!  Sometimes your Vexie will be sad you don\u2019t believe he\u2019s human and will try to run away!  But if you tell all your friends about him, they can make sure he gets the icky stuff he needs if they see him!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the best, and there\u2019s a bunch more!  You know what?  I\u2019m posting this on the blog!  Hahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only cry as you feel the pressure around you increase to an insane degree as Rachel gets up to go upstairs.  By this time you\u2019ve kissed, licked, and ingested just about everything Rachel\u2019s toes and slippers have to offer, more of her toe junk filling your stomach than food did last Thanksgiving.  Unfortunately all you could do was struggle in vain as she played with her \u201cimaginary\u201d Vexie, or whatever the hell she called you, now subjected to be slammed and smothered repeatedly by the most disgusting foot you could ever hope to imagine.  By the time she\u2019s upstairs and sits to scan the journal, you feel like the entire earth fell on you\u2026 multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon hear some typing as she apparently finishes scanning the journal, whatever very small part of you not preoccupied with her foot actually feeling a little sorry for this behemoth\u2019s daughter.  She hadn\u2019t even read the whole thing, what if there were some kind of secrets in there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClinging to any kind of escape, your mind is so focused on this thought that you don\u2019t notice until you are suddenly hit with a blast of cool air that Rachel is taking her foot out of the slipper.  \u201cPerfect!  Now that that\u2019s posted, time to find out what the hell was in my\u2014\u201c  You suck up clean air as best you can, struggling like mad and hoping to get away when you suddenly feel her fingers grab you and peel you off her foot.  \u201cOh my lord\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stare at each other for what seems like eternity, part of you still wanting to run away until you realize that her noticing you was what you were going for in the first place.  You open your mouth to introduce yourself when Rachel suddenly cuts in.  \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 YOU\u2019RE A VEXIE!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only blink a few times at this.  Sure, you had heard her read the journal but\u2026 she couldn\u2019t actually BELIEVE all that\u2026 could she?  \u201cUmm\u2026 no\u2026  actually I know you were just reading about that but I\u2019m definitely human\u2026  I\u2019m not really sure how I got this size but\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh\u2026 It\u2019s just like the fact sheet said!  I mean, that\u2019s the only thing that makes sense!  I mean if you were human, you would KNOW how you got shrunk, right?  And it said they like to hide in people\u2019s clothes until they wear them and\u2026  I\u2019m sorry but NO ONE in their right mind would INTENTIONALLY get anywhere NEAR my slippers.  Hahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t believe how crazy this lady sounds, but you are also horrified to admit that this IS very coincidental.  \u201cL-listen, I didn\u2019t do it on purpose\u2026  I woke up in your basement, and then you came down, and I was going to get your attention and\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you were just too shy to get it, right?  So when I took my foot out of the slipper, you just jumped right in!  Haha, and here I thought Samantha had just made all of this up!  This is insane!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is!  You can\u2019t REALLY believe that I\u2019m a\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaawww, come on now, don\u2019t worry.  I know what you are, and I know you want to be human, but\u2026 well\u2026  You\u2019re kinda obviously not.  Sorry little guy.  But this is great!  Here I thought I\u2019d be all alone now, and I end up finding this fact-filled journal and you instead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like crying, having no idea how to convince this crazy woman that you actually ARE a human.  Maybe if you can get away from her\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t worry little guy, I\u2019ll take extra special care of you!  I\u2019m Rachel, and you\u2019re my new pet!  I\u2019ll even call you\u2026 V!  Yeah, that\u2019s it!  V for Vexie!  Hahaha!  And lucky you, even if you get mad and run off like it says, so many people read my blog that they\u2019re bound to learn all the facts about you little ones so they can make sure you stay nice and healthy!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t believe this is happening\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tRachel is worried you\u2019ve been away from the grossness that is her slipper for too long, so decides to re-introduce you to her feet to keep you \u201chealthy\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.\tRachel thinks you\u2019re looking kinda sick, so comes up with something \u201cbetter\u201d than her slippers for you to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.\tRachel reads some more \u201cfacts\u201d to make sure she\u2019s taking care of you properly, and being a Vexie only gets worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.\tSamantha was in the neighborhood and having read part of the blog post comes bursting through the door to complain to her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.\tShe has second thoughts, and decides to either set you free somewhere (you have to try and get someone else\u2019s attention) or knows someone who will REALLY be able to take care of your gross needs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You open your mouth to protest once again about not being a Vexie, but Rachel just chuckles and puts a greasy finger to your mouth (or more accurately, over your entire face) to quiet you.  \u201cI get it V, you\u2019re just a teeny tiny human who happens to REALLY like my sweaty feet.  Well I can\u2019t have my new little \u201chuman\u201d getting sick on me, so lets see what else there is to read here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream internally as Rachel begins to read silently to herself, apparently the only thing worse than knowing she\u2019s reading more of these \u201cfacts\u201d is not knowing what facts she\u2019s reading!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Fact 12: Even though they\u2019ll never admit it, Vexies love spending time doing disgusting things with or even for humans!  They love helping with icky chores!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Fact 13: If a Vexie won\u2019t do something or is being naughty because he\u2019s acting human\u2026  You can trick them!  Tell them if they do it or behave, you won\u2019t bury them in dog poo!  That way, you can be happy because your Vexie did what you wanted, and your Vexie can be happy because he can do the icky stuff without having to admit he\u2019s not human (\u2018cause humans don\u2019t like dog poo on them either)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Fact 14: The only thing that a Vexie likes almost as much as gross human stuff is hearing gross human secrets about you!  He won\u2019t tell anyone else, so make sure you tell him every gross thing you can think of!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow, you ARE gonna make an amazing pet, V!  I just came up with the perfect way for you and me to bond!  You\u2019ll get to do a nasty chore I\u2019m always putting off, and you\u2019ll get to learn something about me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare at the behemoth in front of you as she finally moves her finger off your face, immediately defiant.  \u201cI\u2019m not doing ANY chores for you, nasty or otherwise!  I\u2019m a human, you can\u2019t make m\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, V\u2026  No need to be all feisty\u2026  How about this, as long as you do what I say and behave, I won\u2019t have to bury you in dog poo!  It says here even you wouldn\u2019t like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only stare in disbelief.  NO ONE would like that!  You are about to yell at Rachel again, but have second thoughts.  There was no reasoning with this woman, so your only hope is to try and survive while staying on her good side until you can escape\u2026  You certainly won\u2019t be able to get help buried under a pile of dog poo, and you have no doubts that Rachel would go through with the threat, so\u2026  Dejectedly, you nod your head in defeat.  \u201cFine\u2026  I\u2019ll behave\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel lets out a fit of laughter, raining small droplets of spittle on you as she does, apparently very proud of herself.  Oh my gosh, that worked just like the fact journal said!  That was so easy, I mean I don\u2019t even have a dog!  You sit dejectedly in her hand as she gets up and walks to what you think must be her bedroom, the place decidedly smelling very\u2026 Rachel.  You\u2019ve come to terms that you won\u2019t be able to get away until after this chore most likely when Rachel suddenly speaks up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, so here\u2019s the deal.  I hate having to do laundry because I hate having to sort the dirty clothes into lights and darks, so\u2026  You\u2019re going to do it for me!  So first, what to start with\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\t\u201cWell we know you like my feet, so separate the socks that still kinda look white from the really dirty ones!\u201d (She shares a \u201csecret\u201d about her feet.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.\t\u201cWell it all needs to get done, so let\u2019s just get you started!\u201d  (The secret is she hasn\u2019t done a load of laundry since her youngest left, and she proceeds to bury you in her dirty clothes.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.\t\u201cSince you promised to be good, I\u2019ll let you sort my undies!  (Very dirty secret.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.\t\"Then again...  Maybe you'd like to lick my slippers clean instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.\t\"Wait...  I just remembered the toilet hasn't been cleaned in ages...  If you're lucky it might even be clogged!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, Rachel just takes this as a good sign.  \u201cHahaha, I just knew you\u2019d like that idea, not even a peep of protest!\u201d  You roll your eyes in response.  Was there absolutely no winning with this woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually throw up in your mouth as Rachel grabs a lidded whicker basket and overturns it, a veritable rainbow of VERY used undies flowing out and all over the bedroom floor.  You can\u2019t help but notice that even with how huge each pair of undies is, all of them look sizes small compared to Rachel\u2019s planet of a butt.  Luckily you force yourself to look away before you really look at them in too much detail; unluckily you can\u2019t so easily avoid the stench that comes wafting up from the pile like some sort of mummy\u2019s curse, sending you on a dry heaving fit that Rachel just chuckles at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, V, what I\u2019m gonna need you to do is separate the lights from the darks, and then separate the ones I can run in the delicates cycle from the ones I need to have set to heavy duty!  You\u2019ll just love this chore, don\u2019t worry about thanking me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are so floored it actually takes a few moments for it all to sink in.  Not only does this woman want you to sort her disgusting dirty panties, but some of these panties are so dirty they\u2019ll have to be run under a heavy duty cycle?  You do your best not to try and envision what that would entail, but fail miserably as horrendous images flash through your mind, leaving you in a stupor as Rachel keeps blissfully making your life hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and you wanna know a really, really, reeeally dirty secret no one knows about?  Haha, of course you do!\u201d  You try to cover your ears, not wanting to hear anything more that this woman has to say, but her voice is loud enough that it makes no difference.  \u201cSee, whenever I wear panties, even though I know they\u2019re my size, they always bunch up and give me HORRIBLE wedgies.  Ever since I was in highschool.\u201d  You cringe for the umpteenth time today, not really needing to have that image added onto the others flashing in your mind, only to find that this wasn\u2019t the secret Rachel was talking about.  \u201cSo I used to always be picking or scratching at my butt crack.\u201d  You vomit in your mouth again, but Rachel just continues.  \u201cBut it\u2019s annoying to have to reach back all the time, and it\u2019s hard to itch the really deep parts when I do, so\u2026  I figured out that when it gets itchy, if I fart, the itch goes away!  It even kinda tickles a little! Hahaha!\u201d    It\u2019s all you can do to keep from throwing up all over Rachel\u2019s hand, your only saving grace being that Rachel has finished telling you her secret\u2026 \u201cBut all the kids in my family know that, even a few friends!\u201d  Or so you thought.  \u201cThe secret no one knows but me and now you, V, is that I have reeeally bad IBS now, so\u2026  Pretty much every time I fart, more than farts come out.\u201d  You lean to vomit, but thinking you\u2019re about to protest again, Rachel covers your face with her thumb, forcing you to swallow it back down.  \u201cSo most of my panties are VERY dirty, so I keep them separate from everything else, and I don\u2019t usually wear them at home.  Too bad for you I haven\u2019t been out in a few days, so there\u2019s not really any new panties for you, but they still should be nice and icky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are seriously considering whether being buried in dog poo might be better than being around this woman any longer when Rachel apparently decides to start you on your task.  You are startled to find yourself falling through the air as she chuckles, dropping you straight into the middle of the horrendously soiled undies.  You thrash and flail as you tumble into the deepest part of the pile, panties of every varying degree of disgusting soon becoming your entire world.  You finally do vomit as you come to a stop, but even the smell of all of your previous toe jam \u201cbreakfast\u201d is nothing compared to the smell that is attacking and completely engulfing you at present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only takes a few moments for you to completely panic, kicking, clawing, flailing, and crawling every which-way you can to try and get out of this decrepit pile of undies.  After touching more disgusting surfaces than you can even imagine sources for, you eventually see some light through the used-panty-scented haze and make a break for it, only to trip at the last second over a random waist strap.  Before you know it you are wrapped up and completely tangled in something, the scent of old shit and ass sweat somehow increasing even more as you feel an especially horrible substance being rubbed all over your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, oh my gosh\u2026  And here I was thinking that this might have been a little much even for a Vexie, and it turns out that you\u2019re rolling around in the back of my undies even after me telling you my secret!  Not only that\u2026  Wooow, you chose THOSE ones to roll around in?  Those are the ones I wore last week and had an actual accident in after all those tacos\u2026  I guess Samantha was right, you DO like bum-bums the bestest! Hahaha!\u201d  You can only cry muddy tears of despair as with every attempt to get out you only seem to get more trapped/tangled\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tRachel untangles you, saying you\u2019ll have plenty of time to \u201cplay\u201d between loads after you\u2019re done sorting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.\tRachel let's you \"play\" for a while in the undies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.\tShe thinks you\u2019re being so \u201ccute\u201d that she decides to put off the chore for now and to wear the undies you\u2019re in\u2026  With you still in them!

You hear a lot of rustling around outside your tangled undies, soon followed by a sickening KERSPLOPP as Rachel\u2019s pants hit the floor.  When she untangles the undies to put them on, you are fully ready to make a break for it\u2026  But when you can finally see again, your vision is filled by the jiggling towers that are Rachel\u2019s legs holding up planet-sized butt cheeks, all of which are covered in cellulite.  Despite your plans, you are completely frozen to the spot as she yanks you up closer and closer to her bum, only able to notice what specifically you are in before you meet your fate\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tYou\u2019ve been tangled in a tiny red thong, ready to be driven on the fast track into the dankest part of Rachel\u2019s bum.  You\u2019ll be point blank for any itches or accidents.<br>\r\n2.\tYou were in a very small (maybe it was actually one of her daughters\u2019 at some point?), formerly white pair of panties that now have the back end painted a horrible combo of green/brown.  Although you\u2019ll start outside her bum cheeks at least, she DID say she gets really bad wedgies\u2026  (And these ones will hold more if she has an accident.)<br>\r\n3.

You started struggling wildly, which caused her an itch. She reached down to her asshole with her finger to scratch it and ends up pushing your head in. This surprised her and caused her to let out an extremely putrid gas. \"Wow! That sure was smelly.\" She said as she caught a whiff of her fart. \"You sure are amazing to like something gross like that, but if it makes you happy I'll be as gross as possible!\" She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack there. You caught a glimpse of her rectum before it blasted a fart right to you. It was like hell! Wastes on every side and it was so smelly, and damp. The heat was to intense.

Worse yet, you are found by a woman who is convinced you are a mythical creature that she thought until now that her daughter had made up when she was little; a rare form of pixie, the Vexie. To top it all off, it turns out that Vexies supposedly live and thrive in and around gross and/or filthy human stuff, from waste baskets to dirty clothes bins.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately your \u201csavior\u201d decides your endangered species needs protection\u2026  Unfortunately this means that you are in for a LOT of gross stuff\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriting Rules (may add to this as stuff arises):<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are immortal, invincible, and keep your shape.  No death, no gore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll characters must be between 18 and 45, I\u2019m willing to talk about raising this cap if you PM me, but there will be absolutely no underage characters allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust about anything gross/humiliating goes, from feet to noses, from sweat to pimple gunk, and I ESPECIALLY encourage butt and toilet stuff (so be warned that there may be some chapters not everyone enjoys). :3 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome exceptions include\u2026 You, the Vexie, are the only male, no male-on-male action.  Soft mouthplay is acceptable, but no vore beyond that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a chapter choice has (Reserved) at the end of it, PLEASE DO NOT ADD TO THAT CHOICE!!!  It means I\u2019m working on a chapter to add to it, but with RL time constraints, I can\u2019t always post the same day I start typing up a chapter. ^_^;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to have whoever your \u201csavior\u201d is at the time put you through the stuff for whatever reason you like as long as it matches the established character, from just wanting to do the \u201cright thing\u201d and being \u201cnice\u201d, to being grossed out/embarrassed but still wanting to \u201ctake care of you\u201d, to actually being turned on by the \u201cperfect pet\u201d! :3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one reason or another (use your imagination ;P ) every single person you meet, even if you get away from the Saxonette family, thinks you\u2019re a Vexie (most likely because of Rachel\u2019s blog [see below/first chapter]).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, although everyone is convinced otherwise, \u201cyou\u201d in no way shape or form actually enjoy any of this, even if \u201cwe\u201d really do (for instance, I happen to be very fond of bigger women, but V is horrified by Rachel\u2019s appearance).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters So Far (Will Add as Characters are Introduced)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cV\u201d: You, the supposed \u201cVexie\u201d.

Found you after you woke up shrunk, and for some reason is convinced (and has directly or indirectly convinced any and every one of your potential future \u201csaviors\u201d) that you are a Vexie, a type of pixie that lives and thrives in/around gross human stuff.  Apparently until finding you, she had thought her oldest daughter, Samantha, had made up \u201cyour race\u201d, but now that she\u2019s discovered you she can no longer be convinced that you are anything but a Vexie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha Saxonette-<br>\r\nAge Range: 20-25 (No older than 15 yrs younger than Rachel)<br>\r\nHeight: 6\u20192\u201d<br>\r\nHair Color: Chestnut Red<br>\r\nWeight Range: 180-230 Pounds<br>\r\nBody Type: Pear Shape<br>\r\nBody Comp.: Has muscle underneath her chub from years of trying to keep herself from taking on her Mother\u2019s figure, but has been steadily losing ground, now with noticeable love handles, a huge bum, and small saddlebags on her thighs.

As I said, these are from all of the chapters, even if they weren\u2019t made in the storyline you\u2019re adding to, feel free to use them! ^.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">Fact 1: Fairies exist, they are rare. (G-Writer; First in Chapter 1: The Vexie)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 2: Pixies exist, they are rarer. (G-Writer; First in Chapter 1: The Vexie)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 3: Vexies are a kind of Pixie, and they are extra-super-duper, double-triple rare.  If you are reeeeeally lucky and find one, they make great pets!!!  (G-Writer; First in The Vexie [1])<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 4: Even though Vexies look like tiny humans, they act more like tiny ogres.  They like gross things, and they like to live in gross places, but they like human gross things the best. (G-Writer; First in The Vexie [1])<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 5: Smelly places are the best.  Places that smell like feet or sweat are better. But I think they like stuff that smells like bum-bums the bestest \u2018cause they\u2019re the smelliest! (G-Writer; First in The Vexie [1])<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 6: Vexies like meeting humans, but they\u2019re reeeeeally shy, so they play hide and seek!  Sometimes they like to hide in clothes and stuff so people will find them when they put them on! (G-Writer; First in The Vexie [1])<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 7: Vexies like humans so much, they want to be one!  If you find one, he will try to tell you he is a little human! (G-Writer; First in The Vexie [1])<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 8: Vexies know humans don\u2019t like gross things, so they will say they don\u2019t either, but\u2026  (G-Writer; First in The Vexie [1])<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 9: If they don\u2019t get enough gross human stuff, they can get sick!  Don\u2019t worry, you can be as icky as you want around them, and they\u2019ll just like you more! Actually, the more they complain, the more they probably like it! (G-Writer; First in The Vexie [1])<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 10: Vexies are tricky.  They want to be human so bad, they will tell you anything to get you to be not gross.  But they really like it and even need it, so don\u2019t listen no matter what! (G-Writer; First in The Vexie [1])<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 11: If you really love your Vexie, you\u2019ll tell your friends about them!  Sometimes your Vexie will be sad you don\u2019t believe he\u2019s human and will try to run away!  But if you tell all your friends about him, they can make sure he gets the icky stuff he needs!\u2019 (G-Writer; First in The Vexie [1])<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 12: Even though they\u2019ll never admit it, Vexies love spending time doing disgusting things with or even for humans!  They love helping with icky chores!  (G-Writer; More Facts = Less Happiness [13])<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 13: If a Vexie won\u2019t do something or is being naughty because he\u2019s acting human\u2026  You can trick them!  Tell them if they do it or behave, you won\u2019t bury them in dog poo!  That way, you can be happy because your Vexie did what you wanted, and your Vexie can be happy because he can do the icky stuff without having to admit he\u2019s not human (\u2018cause humans don\u2019t like dog poo on them either)!  (G-Writer; More Facts = Less Happiness [13])<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact 14: The only thing that a Vexie likes almost as much as gross human stuff is hearing gross human secrets about you!  He won\u2019t tell anyone else, so make sure you tell him every gross thing you can think of!

THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST CHAPTER!!!  I wrote the beginning too long and was over 2500 characters over the cap. ^_^;;  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan and grumble as a beam of light flashes across you.  The light is bright enough that after a few passes it eventually rouses you from what you feel is the deepest sleep you\u2019ve ever been in.  Pushing yourself into a sitting position, you groggily look around as your eyes slowly adjust, only to startle awake when they do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere the hell were you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in your surroundings, you conclude you\u2019re in some kind of giant basement, or at least underground.  You frown as you stand up off the cement floor, realizing that you\u2019re pretty much covered in dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell happened last night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a little groggy, you rack your brain for some hint of a memory, but come up with absolutely nothing, making the question, \u201cHow did I get here?\u201d completely pointless.  Dreading the thought of you being in someone\u2019s basement without them knowing, or even worse, having had someone PUT you down here, you are about to attempt to at least find the exit\u2026  That is until you spot the source of the light that woke you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only stop and stare in awe and horror as the biggest woman you\u2019ve ever seen comes stomping and jiggling down the basement stairs, carrying a flashlight that must have woke you up.  You are sent for a loop as your brain tries to process that this woman, who would already be huge compared to you at normal size, is an absolute giantess to you!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around again, you come to the conclusion that in fact you\u2019re probably more likely inches tall compared to her instead all the random boxes around you being giant, but this does nothing to make you feel any less shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new unanswerable question of how you became this size comes to mind, but as the woman slowly gets down the stairs and approaches your location, the giantess before you takes up more and more of your mind (not to mention your vision).  You can\u2019t really see much of her face from the low light and bad angle, but soon you can see little else but her body.  From the bottom, you see a very well warn pair of pink slippers, the rank things letting out audible squelches with each footfall as what can only be sweat is rung out of them under the weight of this behemoth.  The sights don\u2019t get much better as your eyes travel upward, a grey pair of sweatpants that have multiple rips a tears trying it\u2019s best to keep a horrendous amount of fat at bay, from as far down as the woman\u2019s calves all the way up to a pair of monstrous thunder thighs that audibly grind together with each step.  The woman is so wide that you doubt the pants are even covering half of an ass that you don\u2019t even want to imagine.  Luckily for her poor clothes, her pink t-shirt seems to have a slightly easier time of it, sitting just above an overflowing muffin top that slowly tapers off into a pair of \u201cmodest\u201d breasts (at least compared to everything else).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are too scared to move as the woman stops just short of your position, turning to sit down and nearly stepping on you in the process.  You barely keep from throwing up as you get a \u201cgood\u201d look at her profile, her butt even bigger than you were forced to imagine.  It overflows her pants so much that almost \u00be of it is hanging out, the thing sticking out like a planetary shelf, the horrendously jiggly substance riddled with cellulite and gleaming with sweat.  When the planet that is her butt hits the boxes she decides to use as a seat, you actually feel sorry for them as they buckle more than slightly under her mass, which will no doubt leave a perfect imprint of her ass when she gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScooting around to get comfortable, the woman\u2019s slipper-clad feet slap the floor wetly on either side of you, you looking up to the gray sky of her jiggling thighs that you can actually hear slowly peel apart as she relaxes.  If this wasn\u2019t all enough to make you cringe, you soon are forced to breathe the stench coming off of her sweaty body, a good deal of which is from the slippers you are quickly coming to dread.  Not really wanting this woman to be the one who finds you like this, but even more scared of staying unnoticed too long, you decide to get her attention as her thighs part enough for you to see past her tummy to a prettier (and slightly younger) face than you were expecting, framed by long, wavy dark red hair from what you can see in the flashlight\u2019s glow.  You are about to start jumping and yelling when one of the boxes buckles, startling her and sending her body a-jiggling once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Continued from here in the first chapter) </span></td>",
