The colors of their eyes and hair have more possibilities, such as purple, white, and yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name is Silstes. She has light blue skin, long purple hair, and yellow eyes. She is 16. Some would call her a mad scientist. She is incredible smart, and loves to invent and experiment. After 1 too many massive failures, and complaints from her neighbors, she was forced to leave, if she wanted to continue her experiments. So she decided to leave her planet and head to a more isolated one, where she could do whatever she wanted without consequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few days in her small spaceship, that is capable of holding a few people.

She proceeds to give herself all of the proper records, IDs, and paperwork that is needed for her to blend in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilstes had decided to seclude herself from the city and the surrounding towns, at least until she knew more of their customs and how they behaved. A fairly large, and rundown, mansion was deep inside a forest not far from the city. She already owns it, she just had to fix it up. Of course, with her advance technology, it didn't take long, only a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished, a hole opens up in front of her house and she flies her ship into her underground lab. Parking it, she gets out and examines her lab, \"alright, that's everything\". She proceeds up to the house and begins to study these humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 month later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter extensive research. She decided she needs to interact with them, having isolated herself the past month. Having found the perfect place, she easily gives herself a teaching degree and heads to her first day teaching at a local school.</span></div></div>",

They were together, and no one else was around them. \"Oh, guess I will use them, they will be perfect\". Position her ship directy above them, she starts to prepare for their arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school had ended, the 2 girls had decided to have some fun before heading home.

They start to scream as they are lifted off the ground and are pulled towards the source of the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was the first to wake up. \"Uh, what happened?\". She tries to sit up, but finds herself unable to. She is naked, and strapped to a metal table, the only light in the entire room in on her. \"This cant be happening! I must still be asleep, thats right, this has to be a dream\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not\", a voice says. Sarah looks and sees someone in the dark. \"....Lilly? Is that you?

I'm the one that brought you here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this to us?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you could call it curiosity.

Your not making any sense\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gets a surprised/shocked look on her face as her teacher steps into the light. She still resembled a human, but her skin is blue, her eyes are yellow, and her hair is purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I lied to you and everyone else in class.

The strap holding her to the table then vanishes and her arms and legs are pulled to the corners of the table. Silstes then calmly walks up to Sarah then starts to circle her, examining the girl with her eyes, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah has been pleading with her to stop and to let her go the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop? Let you go? Sorry, but I cant do it. This is far too exciting. Its not everyday that one gets to examine something like you. But dont worry. This wont hurt a bit. Cant let my precious specimens get damaged, can I?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small metal ball then appears out of nowhere and is now hovering by Silstes. \"Ah, good, its here\". She starts to fiddle with it. \"Ok. Testing, Testing, 1 2 3\", she looks at Sarah, at least thats how you humans test a recording device, right?\". She does something to flying recorder and it plays what she just said back. \"Good. Good. Its working. I've got 2 healthy specimens here and a lot to do. Time to get started\". Sarah starts freaking out and begins to struggle as Silstes looks back onto her with a wicked smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien scientist gently places her small blue hand onto Sarah's stomach. The trapped girl shutters at her touch and starts to fidget as Silstes slowly drags her hand across her body. Then using both her hands, she proceeds to do a starting examination of the human girl with her hands. Examining her breasts, head, stomach, back, arms, legs, ass, and pussy. All the while talking to the recorder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starting the physical examination now. The subject is warm to the touch. Lets see. Her body is quite similar to those of us female Yulvins. With her skin color being the only obvious difference, so far. The subject seems to be having a ..... positive reaction to my tests. Her body temperature is increasing. Her nipples seem to have erected as well and her genitals, which I am guessing are at this time and by what I've read, is secreating some kind of liquid. Nothing else to report for now. They really do look a lot like us. Though this is just the outward appearance. I wont know how close they are or if they are compatable or not until I do a more thorough examination\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilstes stops the recording and starts to mess with it again. A blue screen appears next to the flying ball and she begins to watch and listen to what she had just recorded.</span></div></div>",

These strange machine now hang over both of them. Silstes then raises one hand and snaps her finges. One of the devices starts to descend and stops at one end of the table. A light blue glow started to emanate from the bottom of it and it started to move from one end of the table to the other and back. Once it reached where it started, it went back up into the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large screen then pops up on one of the walls in the room on the ship. It showed Sarah's entire body on it with multiple symbols and markings next to it. \"Good, the scanner worked. I know have all the information about your body. Definately looking forward to going over that later. But enough of that, time to get to the good part\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long slender piece of metal started to lower itself from the ceiling. It wasn't a solid piece of metal though, it was slowly twisting its way down towards them. It stopped next to Silstes and she put one hand on it. \"Ya know, I technically dont need to do anything else to you. That scanner is something I made a while ago. It gave me all the info I would ever need on you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-then why are you still doing this?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets a wicked smirk. \"Because its fun\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen with Sarah's picture and vitals on it starts to make noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Whats this? Getting nervous are we? Your heart has started beating faster!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes her way to the side of the table where Sarah's head was. \"Now, as I already said, I dont need to do anything else; however, whats the fun in that? This here is a different type of sensor that I made\", she points a finger at her mouth. \"It will enter through your mouth\", she trails her finger down her neck, past her breasts and to her stomach. \"go down your throat, to your stomach\". Her finger then travels down her stomach, goes over her pussy and stops at her little hole. \"Through your intestines and out your ass\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eyes widen and opened her mouth to say something, but the metal tentacle used this oportunity and invaded her mouth. \"Mmmpphh!\", was all that came out of her mouth. Silstes stands back and says, \"I hope you enjoy this as much as I will\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensor slowly made its way down her throat and landed in her stomach. It stayed there for a minute then proceeded down into her depths. It was then that Silstes noticed something as she watched the bulge her scanner made move thorught Sarah's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats this? Your all wet Sarah! Is this turning you on? Maybe I can help you\", she says, followed by her jamming a finger into Sarah's slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's body starts to involuntarily twitch and small beads of sweat appear all over herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensor is already in her intestines and has just about reached the end of its tour. Sarah's moans and twitching increases as it starts to press at the only way out. Silstes sees that its just about done and puts her head right next to her ass, while still doing her with one hand. \"looks like were almost done. I think it needs a little help though\". With her free hand, she begins to rub her other lower hole. \"Come on,come out!\". But Sarah still somehow manages to keep it inside. \"Your tougher than I though, but I know how to get it out\". She moves her face closer and starts to lick it. This did the trick. Silstes stops as the tip of the tentacle sensore slowly emerges. It comes out, and Sarah climaxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilstes steps back and admires the scene. Sarah was dripping with sweat, and a few other things, her body was still twitching, and her sensor, which has passed all the way thorugh her and is still attatched to the ceiling, is slowly moving throughtout the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen appears in front of her again and she checks something. \"Ok, that worked too. Got some more data. TIme to reel it back in\". The sensor then backtracks through Sarah's body and back up into the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what should I do?\".</span></div></div>",

She takes her time, collecting the info she needs and the fact that she is enjoying evey second of this. She eventually gets bored of this, and stops, she puts the dildo into postion and gets ready to penetrate her. The tip slowly begins to enter Sarah and her moans get louder. Unable to bear it anylonger, she screams as it completely enters her. Silstes starts to and continues to thrust it back and forth into her.

This will only make the data mean so much more!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah finally climaxes and the test ends. Silstes pulls the almost completely enveloped sensor out of Sarah and after checking the data, it floats back up and into the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAHH! This is so exciting! What next? What should I do to you or.....Lisa.....thats right, there are 2 of you. I was so fixated on you that I completely forgot about Lisa over there. Who is still sleeping? Huh, you think all of your moans and screams would of woke her up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks to the table with Lisa on it, \"2 sets of data are better than 1 and I can compare the 2...... Right! Its settled! Its Lisa's turn!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-leave her alone! You already got what you want from me!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe devices that were used on Sarah descend from the ceiling. Silstes looks at Sarah, \"yeah, I dont need to do this. But I dont care. This is too interseting!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hands on Lisa, she starts what she did to Sarah.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Drecaw are small, approximately ten inches tall from head to foot, and are roughly humanoid in body plan, though the individual features. Take a glance at one and you don't generally think 'Human'. They have two arms, two legs, single head with visual and auditory sensors on it, but other than that things are rather different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note, if you're bored by technical descriptions of biology skip down two paragraphs. I summarize :) )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir body is chitin coated shell, but flexible due to many overlapping ring plates that shift and allow movement. The torso looks more or less human shaped but is a little taller and thinner by proportion. The arms and legs are pure muscle, more like an elephants trunk in appearance than a tentacle. They each end in four thin extensions like having four muscular (no bones inside) thumbs on hands and feet, but with no 'pad' in the center of the hand either. This has limited their dexterity somewhat, though fine detail work with those fiddly little digits is relatively easy for them. The head is a short fleshy tube that extends up and points forwards with four eyes set around the opening. No teeth are visible and they don't talk or breath through this opening, just eat... and something else that will be covered later. The hear through long ridges down this tube that stop just before the shoulders. These 'ear ridges' are flat to the skin, but rather sensitive to touch and their clothing tends to have a rigid strut over this that doesn't block sound. This often makes a clothed Drecaw look sort of like a hooded snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head tube is not just for eating, though they do swallow food items that way. It is also for connecting to other life forms. Their brain is somewhat distributed, a thigh nerve bundle that wraps completely around that tube and reaches the end. This end, especially just inside the opening, has very little between the skin and the synapses of it's brain. Early in the Drecaw's evolution they learned to attatch to other mammals (yes, they are mammalian despite the chitinous body) and connect to that creatures nervous system. At first this just scared them away, but over long periods of time they evolved to literally connect to them completely, suborning the creatures consciousness with their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically Drecaws became thinking parasites, able to take over the bodies of other mammalian hosts by sucking onto the base of the brain stem (the base of the neck in humans) and the host would effectively go to sleep while the Drecaw took control of their body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had a vast civilization using many slave hosts, most of which were non-sapient, but not all. Eventually some rebelled and the empire collapsed from intense warfare. Nowadays most Drecaws are shot on site, but they still have a couple of colony worlds left. They are very much on the lookout for potential host worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat better place to test if humans are compatible hosts than a school. Take over a teacher and do varied tests, finding if all the students can be controlled or just some.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Sleedarans are an odd mix of pacifist and aggressive predator. Six foot tall with a completely boneless structure they are biologically like six limbed squids, but don't really look like squids. Four tentacles below take the place of legs, two to the sides act like arms. The head is sort of distinct from the torso, unlike in  squid, and they can rotate it almost 360 degrees! Surprisingly they only have one sex but their bodies faintly resemble a human female. It's close enough that with a braced rubber mask to hold themselves into the right shape they can pass as human (Or several other bipedal races in the galaxy). They even find human females attractive (if rather brittle).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey have never been accepted in galactic society and there is a very good reason. Sleedarans feel compelled to eat other sapients! Something about a creature knowing it is about to be devoured gets a Sleedaran tingling, almost unable to resist eating them. A few of them are even sexually excited by this and those few have given the race as a whole a bad name. They are, as I said, pacifists by nature. They never needed to hack, claw, bite any prey in their history. All they needed to do was catch it, open their mouths REAL wide, and swallow. They don't even constrict. This along with the fact they don't eat very often means they never really got much of an aggressive streak to their personality and when they evolved to be sapient this became exagerated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleedaran society is very strict especially about showing emotion to others. If you get too scared, or seem to panicy in front of one the reflexive eating tends to come out and... GLOM! This generally isn't fatal. Sleedaran digestion takes a long time and the thought of digesting conscious, sapient beings is generally disgusting to them... but it has happened. Their law doesn't regard 'swallowing' someone as an offence, but rather 'not throwing them up afterwards'. Of course there are always the psychopaths in any species!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Sleedaran could come to Earth and hide in a school, either just hiding away in a basement or actually pretending to be a student or teacher. None of their kind is accepted in the galaxy so a 'normal' Sleedaran might be interested in staying on a world where their race has never been heard of, just to be accepted for once. On the other hand a pervert Sleedaran might be interested in Earth for similar reasons. The Humans wouldn't know to look for them and they could get away with whatever they wanted... maybe.</span></div></div>",

Though they had made him too smart, when he came online, he was already fully aware, not under their control at all. When they realized that the experiment was a failure, they tried to dispose of him, and he fought back. During the fight, one of the reactors was damaged, resulting in a massive explosion that completely wiped out the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only survivor, he pulled himself out of the hole in the volcano just as it collapsed behind him. He made it to the town and disguised himself as a tall male in his early 20s with short black hair and black eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late as the snow continued to fall. He finally passes Selucius high school. He sees a help want sign on the gate, this prompts him to check the internet and got all the details.

Thought the entire area behind it was solid metal, except for one square hole with a small bottle in it, he is able to change his form and create countless things without limit. He pulls out the bottle, which was no bigger than his hand, and uncorks it and then throws it at Karen. It bounces a bit and spins, landing in front of her, with the top of the bottle facing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCowering against the wall, a strange feeling strange feeling begins to come over her. \"Wh-whats this?

Her head gets jammed inside the tiny bottle as she regains control of herself. She grabs the side and tries to pull herself out, but to no avail, the pull from it is just too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly gets pulled in, but with a twist, the bottle is completely ignoring her clothes, only sucking Karen herself inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing her breasts and arms, leaving only her waist and below outside of the bottle. Her hips and legs get easily sucked in, and she is now inside the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound disappears, leaving silence to fill the room again. Seth walks over to the bottle and picks it up. Holding it up, he peers into it at the smaller Karen sleeping inside. \"Hmm, must have passed out. Oh well, I'll deal with this later,\" he says as puts the cork back into the bottle and putting the bottle back into the hole in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closes his chest and the skin starts to reform back over it.

He raises his hand and it starts to glow a bright green, he then slams the ground with the same hand. The ground suddenly splits, revealing a hidden staircase. He then heads down, and after passing a few security checks that he installed, he enters a large metal room with many scientific devices inside.He walks over to a metal table and takes out the bottled Karen and places her on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth looks in the bottle and notices that Karen was asleep.

Where have you taken me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a lab that I set up beneath the school. There's no way that I could make a place like this at my apartment, and now, I brought you here. And before you ask why, its because no one will find you here\". She gets really worried by these words. \"I know that the second that I let you out, you will run and try to get \"help\". And like I said, I cannot afford to draw attention towards myself\". \"But what about my friends, huh? They WILL notice that I disappeared\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that would be a problem, but while you were sleeping, I came up with a great plan\". He goes over to a tall computer connected to a large metal tube. He types away and presses enter. The Machine and tube lights up as smoke starts to fill the tube and seeps out of the machine. He then walks over to the tube and looks at Karen. The door starts to slide open and Seth extends his right hand to the tube's door, he says, \"Karen, let me introduce you to, yourself,\" as a normal sized naked version of her exits the tube. \"W-what the hell is that?\" Karen yells, completely caught by surprise. The clone then kneels in front of Seth and speaks in Karen's own voice, \"what is your wish, master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth puts his hand on the clone's head and starts to speak, \"I took a strand of your hair and made a copy of you using this device,\" he goes over to the table and pulls out the clothes that Karen was wearing out of a basket there. He gives the clothes to the clone, \"ok, Karen, please get dressed.\" \"Yes, master,\" it puts on the clothes and Seth begins to speak again, \"this copy of you has all your memories, experiences, and can mimic you perfectly. She will take over your life, for now anyway. Karen, please head back to your room and continue your normal life,\" \"yes master,\" it says as she leaves the lab and heads outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks back over to the table, \"now all that's left is to decide on what I will do with you\".</span></div></div>",

The 2nd one was smaller and covered in a light orange fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up at Seth, who is also looking in at them. \"Please dont tell me that these 2....\".<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Just like you. I changed them into young cats\".<br>\r\n\"Why would I like something like this? I don't like being a cat, so why would I want this done to someone else?\".<br>\r\nSeth seems utterly stunned. \"I wasn't expecting this. I really though you would like this\".<br>\r\n\"Why?\".<br>\r\n\"Well, so you wouldn't be lonely. I though you could use the company\".<br>\r\n\"....\"<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\".<br>\r\n\"N-no.....You really are a robot. You don't understand at all, do you? Whatever, I guess you tried. Can you change them back? Just use me\".<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, its too late. They were awake when I changed them into cats, the only way out of it is if I messed with their minds. And I dont think you'd like that\".<br>\r\n\"No I wouldn't. How long are they going to be out?\".<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It could be minutes or hours\".<br>\r\n\".....So.....who are they?\".<br>\r\n\"You cant tell?\".<br>\r\n\"Of course not! Their cats!.....Wait.....dont tell me I know them?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes the black one is Jackie and the orange one is Megan, from class\".<br>\r\n\"Megan and Jackie!? Oh not them! The last 2 I would want this to happen to and of course its them! Why these 2?\".(Her 2 friends from earlier).<br>\r\n\"Their your closest friends. I though that they were best suited for keeping you company\".<br>\r\n\"Great\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth gets to his feet and over to Karen's cat bed and bowls. He makes 2 more bowls and makes the bed big enough for 3 cats. \"There. The bed is big enough for you 3 and you all can share the water dish\". He takes Jackie out first, puts a collar on her, then gently puts her on the cat bed. He does the same to Megan and then picks up Karen. He sits on couch and puts her on his lap. A hand gently glides though her fur as he starts to watch TV. \"I guess I'll wait untill those 2 wake up\".</span></div></div>",

Where am I?\". She gets to her feet, and after wondering why she was sleeping on a giant cushion, she sees the sleeping figure next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sleeping next to a cat? Wait.....thats a big cat! How did it get.....so.....\", she finally noticed that something was different, that, and she saw her paws. Freaking out, she looks behind her and sees black fur and a tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShes speechless, she doesnt know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats right, your a cat now\", someone tells her. She looks in front of her and sees a large pair of legs. Looking up, she gets another shock as she sees her teacher was looking down on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is he doing here? Wait.....! I remember! You did this to me and.....Megan!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie and Megan were at their dorm rooms, expecting Karen to be there, but she wasn't. \"Shouldn't she be here? Our teacher said she wasn't feeling ok, so he sent her home.....\".<br>\r\nMegan: \"Maybe she had something to do?\".<br>\r\nJackie: \"I guess.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren then enters the room.<br>\r\nJackie: \"Oh, there she is\".<br>\r\nMegan: \"See?\".<br>\r\nKaren clone: \"Is something wrong?\".<br>\r\nJackie: \"We were told you weren't feeling well, but it looks like your fine now\".<br>\r\nKaren clone: \"Yeah. I'm alright now, I just had something to do, so I left for a little bit\".<br>\r\nJackie: \"Well you shouldn't be up, go lay down, just in case\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth had already left, for the 2nd time. After finishing his leftover work, he winds up passing the dorms where the 3 girls live. \"I should check on the copy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe copy, meanwhile, was forced in Karen's bed, as her 2 friends watched over her. She gets a message from her master to meet him outside for a checkup. Of course she complies, but she must first come up with an excuse to leave. She sits up, \"look, I really appreciate this, but I'm fine now. So, I'm going to get some fresh air, I promise I'll take it easy and I'll be quick\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey let her leave and they meet behind the building. Seth pulls up a floating screen and the Karen clone removes her shirt. \"Everything looks good, how do you feel? Any problems?\".<br>\r\nKaren clone: \"None so far, master\".<br>\r\nSeth: \"Good. You can head back now.....great, they followed you\".<br>\r\nKaren clone: \".....sorry.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan and Jackie had followed the clone, thinking that she was acting odd. They had seen the whole thing, but they dont know that they've been spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth: \"Go, bring them here\".<br>\r\nKaren clone: \"Yes, master\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe vanishes and reappears behind the 2 girls. The copy immediately grabs them and takes them over to her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth: \"*Sigh* You 2 just had to follow her\".<br>\r\nMegan: \"O-of course! She's our friend! We we're worried about her!\".<br>\r\nJackie: \"What did you do to her? Why is she calling you master?\".<br>\r\nKaren copy: \"What should we do with them?\".<br>\r\nSeth: \".....I know, why don't we have them join Karen?\".<br>\r\nKaren copy: \"Oh, I like it. Good idea master\".<br>\r\nJackie: \"Join Karen? What the hell are you talking about? Shes right here!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dont answer, instead, the flesh on one of Seth's arms peels back and a familiar weapon is pointed at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey start to change. Fur sprouts all over their bodies, tails grow, they shrink, their ears are replaced with cat ears; however, unlike with Karen, they pass out before it finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth creates a cat carrier and they put them inside. Seth tells the clone to continue playing Karen's life until he says otherwise and heads back to the apartment.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth: \"She seems to be quite scared\".<br>\r\n\"Of course she is! Any normal person would!\", says another voice. But Jackie has heard this voice before. She looks in its direction and sees another cat looking down on her from the couch by the cat bed. The red cat jumps down and approaches her, \"I didn't want you 2 involved in this.....Since it can't be helped, you and Megan will have to get use to this. We won't be getting out of here until he says so\".</span></div></div>",

He locked the storage room doors from the inside without Ayumi's knowledge, who was still deep inside the room. From there, he ambushed her from behind and grabbed her quickly, surprising her. He made his first move by groping her soft legs, while his other hand got inside her shirt and began touching her breasts as well. She then begged her teacher to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, sir, don't do this.

By this time, Mr. Philips revealed his true form to her, that of a tentacle monster. It then began to use its tentacles to touch her pussy within her volleyball shorts. Noticing it was wet, it removed all of her clothing, leaving Ayumi wearing just her knee pads and shoes from her uniform. One of the tentacles reached her mouth and began playing with her tongue. Two more began to suck on her nipples as another one penetrates her pussy, making her feel a tremendous amount of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.....right......there.....don't.....stop.....\" was all Ayumi could say as moments later, the monster unleashed its massive load of cum inside her, more than enough to impregnate the pretty volleyball player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, Ayumi collapsed on the floor, both from tiredness and pleasure, as she laid on the floor with her pussy began oozing out the excess cum as her belly returns back to its normal size. The monster reverts back to Mr. Philips and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now be a good girl and give birth to my children soon. You will return to your life as a normal student but you will never tell this to anyone. From now on, you will be my slave, and you will always do what I say, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Philips,\", the dazed Ayumi said as she kissed her new master passionately.</span></div></div>",

She was thirty-nine years old but looked much younger, all of the mothers full of jealously thought she'd had plastic surgery. She used to go to this school, she had all ways been the shy geek with her nose in a book. After school she went to university and then flew off to some foreign country, to study in the jungle. She wasn't seen or heard from again, not even when her father died, but then two months ago she turned up back in her small home town. She managed to get a job as a cafeteria lady even though she was pregnant, she moved back into her mum's house and acted normally. Of course rumours flew, what colour was the baby, why was she so pale if she'd had been it the jungle, why does the shy girl now have a predator look in her eyes, Karen just ignore the rumours knowing they would all find out soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren's thoughts are interrupted by Alice entering the kitchens, even though it's after school she is still dressed in her cheerleading uniform. Alice shyly moves towards Karen, for the past few weeks she has been thinking Karen. At first only when she was bored, but over time she thought about her more and more, soon she couldn't keep the thoughts of Karen out of her head. Last few nights she had masturbated while thinking of Karen until she was exhausted and fell in to a deep sleep where she oddly dreamed of worms that were her friends. Today had been the last straw, during cheerleading practice she had opened her specially made gluten free lunch from the cafeteria and instead of the yummy tasting food she had been getting the past month there were two sealed plastic cups with a note say \"just for you\". She had previously been sharing her gluten free cakes and sweet with the other girls. \"Hey Alice, what have you got in the bag today?\". She looked up to see the whole cheerleading group waiting for her to past around the delicious treats. \"Uh... w-wrong bag\" she quickly ran off and hid in the toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the first cup and found it was full of a white milky liquid. \"This must be her breast milk\" she said to herself, she quickly drank it. It was the best thing she ever tasted, it tasted fatting but she didn't care, her mum had been living her life though Alice forcing to be a cheerleader. Alice didn't care about anything now, her mum could live though her younger sisters for all she cared, her life had only one important thing in it and that was Karen. Her hand moved under her skirt as she thought about Karen, her hand explored her vulva and clitoris, her pussy was sore after being so much in the past week but she knew Karen could kiss it better, she was about to go to Karen when she remembered the second cup. She opened it to find a clear sticky liquid, she quickly drank it down, the thick liquid made her body feel warm. Both her hand moved to her pussy and began vigorously rubbing her clit, it hurt but she didn't care \"this is for you Karen\" she said to herself as she pushed her fist inside her pussy. She felt a lot of pain as she ripped her hymen, she knew her body was ready, she just didn't know for what. She kept going until she had a orgasm and then fell in to a deep sleep full of worms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's legs were shaking before her stood Karen, completely naked, her long red hair covering her breasts and framing her large pale belly. \"Come closer Alice\" Karen called. Alice didn't need any more encouragement she ran up to Karen and kissed her red lips. As they kissed Alice could feel Karen using her skilful tongue to push her impossibly thick saliva down Alice's throat. Alice was in heaven but then it came crashing down. \"Alice! Alice! where are you?\" a shrill voice shouted out in the corridor, it was Alice's mother. Karen broke the embrace and moved in to the shadows. Does Alice's mum enter the kitchen or does she walk past?                                          </span></div></div>",

Her ambition is to create her own slaves out of all the most popular male students at the school and mate with them whenever she wanted to. Right now, she set her sights on three males who are all popular and good-looking in their own right, with each having a distinct personality that caught her attention. They are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Richard, a senior who is the school's star soccer player. Of the three, he is the tallest and has a well-toned body because of his status as an athlete. He also is the most outgoing, and a very friendly guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Paul, a sophomore who is the current head of the student body. He is a very strict person with an aura of coolness around him. Though he also possess the looks of a handsome young man due to being a former member of the basketball team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Akito, a freshman who is the rising star of the school's swimming team. Despite his popularity, he is an introvert and has a shy personality, though this doesn't stop her female fans from admiring him. Among his peers though, his figure is rather between skinny and average, due to his half-Asian roots.</span></div></div>",

Nicole then stood near him, as he tries to prevent himself from either staring or groping her legs, which are both within his reach. The young swimmer then said;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there. Mind if I sit next next to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, no problem.\" he said, as she sits beside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then began their conversation afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I see you're quite busy preparing for the meet next month, huh?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, to be honest, I'm quite nervous despite this being my second time. I did well last year, being third place, but I'm under a lot of pressure to be win this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's why you've been doing these solo practices after class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that way I can focus on my skills better if I practice alone, and, um, at least Rosie's not here.\" she said, as he noticed her voice shaking when she said her fellow swimmer's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie, the one whom Javar caught roping Nicole's legs a number of times during practice. He then pretended not knowing who she was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what about her?\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I put this, well, the red-haired member of our Swim Team kept on bullying me everytime we practice, but not verbally, in a way.....\", Nicole explained albeit very uncomfortably. Javar then asked her further about what she was trying to say, and then, after taking a deep breath, she confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosie kept on making advances on me. By then I realized that she's a lesbian. One time, we had a solo practice like this, because we're both qualified to compete for the Nationals last year. We had the pool all to ourselves. Then, she forced me to let her \"help\" me during my stretches. It started there, as I can feel her hands massaging my thighs in a weird way. Sometimes it goes all the way near \"there\", you know. It was a very uncomfortable day for me when I remember it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why didn't you tell anyone about this?\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you must know, her family pretty much owns this school, not to mention her relatives were powerful too. She kept reminding me that just so she can have her way with me, or any girl at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least she doesn't go any further than what you just told me. One day, she's going to answer for what she's doing,\" he assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're right.\" she smiled. \"Come to think of it, I caught you one time staring at me while Rosie groped me, right?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavar got caught off-guard and said, \"No, I promise I wasn't thinking of anything stupid! I got a little angry when she did that to you, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiled and said, \"How kind of you to think that way, but then again, maybe you're wishing that you were the one doing that to m- uuuumph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before Javar suddenly grabbed her and forcefully kissed her. Then, by just looking at her in the eye, the swimmer was caught in a trance, as she moans to the deep kiss the incubus was giving her. Having lost her will, Nicole was in a doll-like state as Javar continues to kiss her neck while his hands explored her body, which was still covered by her one-piece swimsuit. Javar then trails kisses on her legs, while simultaneously massaging them. Now with his prize, he ten decides either to continue there, or to take her somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your wearing a blue one piece robe with white and gold colored inscriptions and symbols on it, a blue full body cape, a wooden staff almost as tall as you, and a classic blue pointy mage's hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the point is NOT to stand out,\" you say to yourself. You spend the next several minutes watching the people pass by, to get an idea of what they are wearing. You back up a bit to make sure that no one is watching you. \"Ok, time for my first spell here,\" you say as you raise level out your arms.

With one swift movement, you place your hands on yourself and are completely encased in the glow that was on your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light dissipates, your now wearing a black blue shirt and a white skirt with white shoes. \"This should work,\" you say as you pick up your things and head out into the crowds of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of searching, you come across a house for sale that you like. It's a little ways out of the city, in a small urban area. It's an old dark brown house, it looks like those old, falling down houses in horror movies. The yard is overgrown and there's trash in it. It is 3 floors to it, but it's obviously in disrepair, though there are houses to the left, right, and across the street from the house. You think that this could be the perfect house for you, it just needs a little work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head for the place that is selling the house, and after everything is taken care of, thank god for magic documents you say to yourself, the house is now yours, for a lot less than it should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at your new house, you open the old creaky black gates and make along the overgrown path to the front door. You unlock the door and open it, the inside is also a mess. There are holes in the floor, wall, and ceiling. The furniture is all torn and unusable, and there is a fine layer of dust covering everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping your bag, you say, \"well, this should be bad, but this will be easy for someone like me, though I better not fix up everything at once, can't draw attention to myself\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, time to get started!\" you say as you drop yourself and pull out one of your books.</span></div></div>",

It didn't really work, but they still kept the school this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is now lunch time, one hour until the next class.

They only looked confused for a second, as their bodies suddenly jolt as the spell takes effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey aren't even able to speak as your spell has frozen them in place. \"You should not judge someone based on how they look,\" you say as you walk pass 2 of them and head for the one that was holding Jackie. \"I'll be taking that,\" you say as you remove his hands from her and carry her back to where you froze them, you are able to move them. You remove the ropes and gag and place her on the ground, she had been frozen as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head over to the \"leader\" and start to talk, \"What to do with you 3, trying to take whats mine? Well now I am going to have to punish you all. Though, I think that I will grant you some pleasure before pain\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look like that they are in college, maybe another high school, you think as you undress him and lay him on his back. \"It's been some time since I last had some \"fun\", so I am going to use you 3 to satisfy me before I deal with you all\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly strip yourself and squat over his legs. You then start stroking and playing with his member. With him now ready, you position yourself over him and lower yourself, guiding it inside of you. Moaning with pleasure as you move up and down along the his shaft. He suddenly cums, you get up as it drips out of you. \"Already? That was too fast. Guess I need to raise the intensity a bit\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back on him, you then wave your hand at the other 2 men. Their clothes suddenly vanish and start to move towards you. Their dicks had already hardened from watching you with their leader, so you guide them right away into the correct holes. You grab one of them and start to suck on it, while the other guy probes your back door until it gives way and it goes all the way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in a 4some with the 3 kidnappers, your having an amazing time. Sure, they have cumed a few times by now, but your magic will keep them going until your satisfied. You have them stop and you get up, you had noticed something. You walk over to Jackie and remove her skirt. She was wet. \"It seems that you 3 will get what you wanted\". You wave your hand once more, making her clothes vanish, but also making her able to move. \"Wh-what...\" she starts to say. You put your hand over her mouth, \"I will explain later. For now, just enjoy it\" you tell her while guiding her over to the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes pass as the 5 of you go through multiple positions. You and Jackie are now face to face, bodies together as the men are holding you up, moving back and forth. \"It's time to end it,\" you think, you ramp up the spell. They suddenly speed up and with final explosion, they release all over and inside you and Jackie. The 3 men, having long since recovered from being paralyzed, collapse, unconscious onto the ground. The 2 of you hit the ground as well, Jackie is completely exhausted, heavily panting and tongue hanging out of her mouth, she is unable to move. You get up and stretch, \"I feel better,\" you say as you finish stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step away from them and your hands start to glow. You raise them and shout, \"RESTORE\". Jackie and the 3 men are completely cleaned up. With one hand, you lift up Karen and lower her next to you. Moving the same hand back to the men, you cast another spell, \"WATERFALL\", a massive amount of water appears above them and hits them, waking them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, it is time to punish you 3 now for trying to take her\". \"Ok, time for a big spell,\" you think as you start to prepare. Your gathering the magical energy in the surrounding area into the clearing. The entire area fills with a light blue glow, as the 3 men, have terrified looks on their faces. You clasp your hands together as a massive complex magic circle appears. \"That's right, I haven't said what I am yet, you all probably want to know. I am a mage, or witch, sorceress, whatever you want to call me. I am able to use magic to do whatever It is I want\". You move your right hand to your side as your clothing transforms to your magic clothing and your staff appears in your outreached hand. The magic starts to grow more violent, the blue glow suddenly changes to black as it swirls all over the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground beneath them starts to shake. Numerous tentacles explode out of the ground beneath the men and ensnares them, lifting them into the air. A blackish red light emanates from the base of the tentacles and quickly climbs them. As soon as the light hits them, it's effect quickly takes place. They start to shrink, their hair gets longer, and their chests starts to grow. They immediately realize what's happening, they are turning into girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fully transformed, you start the last start of the spell. You gather a large amount of magic into your staff, and strike the ground as you say the spell. \"PORTAL APPEAR. TAKE THESE THREE THROUGH THE GATEWAY FOR THE PUNISHMENT THAT THEY DESERVE!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 large black boxes appear from the pits below them. They slowly open, revealing a red swirling portal. \"This was a pain to get, but I think that it was worth it. These portals will take you to a demon realm, where you \"girls\" will be raped for who knows how long, before returning here, have fun!\" you say as the boxes quickly lunge up, closing shut on the girls and vanishing back into the ground. The entire area starts to return to normal, the entire event now over.</span></div></div>",

You then sit her up and have her swallow one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light green glow surrounds Jackie, her face starts to look more energetic than it did a few minutes ago. She is suddenly able to move again, she gets up confused. \"H-how? I feel fine now? What are those things?\". \"There just simple restorative pills made from the oil of a giant toad\". With both a surprised and disgusted look, \"toad oil! I just ate the oil from a toad!\". \"Yeah, it's not that big of a deal, your fine now. Right?\". She couldn't argue with you, but she wasn't done. \"Ok, fine, whatever. But just what are you! All those things that you just did. No normal person could do that!\". \"Didn't I already answer that?\". \"You were serious! You can really use magic!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour about to continue further, but you hear people approaching. \"Must be Chris and Elane returning from help\". Jackie's face lights up, \"Gotta take care of this quick,\" you say. Thrusting your hand at Jackie, her clothes reappear on her. You then grab her by her shirt, \"listen, I could erase you memories right now, but I wont. Now, when they come, NOT A WORD on what happened here, just let me talk, okay?\" she nods, \"good\" you finish as the 2 girls and some police men enter the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god your safe!\" Christie says as she and Elane run up to Jackie and embrace her. \"It's good that no one was harmed,\" one of the offices says, \"but we need to know what happened to the men\". You start to tell them what happened. \"It really wasn't much. I caught up to them and they got nervous and took off in that direction. Guess they were just cowards\". They take off in the direction that you pointed, but not before having one of the officers escort you all back to the school. You casually make your way next to Jackie as your heading back, you slip her a piece of paper and say, \"head there after school, we will continue there\" and you step away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brief encounter with the kidnappers made a small commotion, as you all head back to class, but it ended pretty quickly, as did the rest of the day. With school now over, you quickly head home, to prepare for Jackie's visit.</span></div></div>",

She was sitting on her bed, watching TV when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer room shakes as an explosion goes off in the distance. \"What the hell was that?\", she says, after having fallen off of her bed. She quickly gets to her feet and looks out her window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was smoke rising from the city. \"I wonder what could of happened?\", just as she finished saying this, a few smaller explosions erupt from the city. But these explosions and smoke rising from these explosions were different colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blue, pink, red, purple, whats going on?\". She then grabs her remote and flips thorugh the channels. \"Maybe there is something on the news\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....MULTIPLE EXPLOSIONS HAVE ERUPTED THORUGHT THE CITY. THEIR CAUSE IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN AND WE.....WAIT ONE OF OUR REPORTERS HAS JUST ARRIVED AT WHERE THE EXPLOSIONS HAVE OCCURED\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture is fuzzy and there are people fleeing in terror and screaming as the occasional explosion goes off. \"PEOPLE ARE FLEEING IN TERROR. THE CAUSE SEEMS TO BE SOME LARGE CREATURE AND.......\", the screen went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST CONTACT WITH OUR REPORTER.....\", Megan stopped watching after this and is looking back out her window. \"Some large creature is causing this? But, how?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT IS WHO THEY ARE\", an echoing voice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whose there?\". No one answers. A glowing ball of light appears in the middle of her room and the voice reapears. \"WHO I AM DOESNT MATTER RIGHT NOW. ONLY YOU CAN HELP YOUR PEOPLE. TAKE WHAT IS IN FRONT OF YOU AND WE MAY MEET AFTERWARDS\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is in a state of panic. Looking around the room, fidgeting, and not sure of what to do, another huge explosion off in the distance snaps her out of it.<br>\r\n\"I-I guess I dont have a choice. I cant just sit back and watch. If I can help.....\". She gets to her feet and approaches the glowing ball of light.</span></div></div>",

What am I suppose to do with this?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PUT IT ON. IT WILL GIVE YOU THE POWER TO STOP THEM\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait just a minute.

She puts on the watch and heads into the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cuts through an alley and sees people fleeing pass the other sidie of it. She carefully peers around the corner. \"What the hell are those things?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are a lot of them. But she could only make out a few of them. They were the ones attacking the city. She can hear them talking to each other, but she can barely make out what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....leave the rest to you.....other places need our attention.....Yes sir I wont fail you.....\". Then most of them vanish, leaving one large green lizard like monster and several smaller black and brown dog like creatures with it. \"This city is almost ours. Just a little more\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOOD. THERE ARE ONLY A FEW LEFT. NOW, USE THE WATCH AND STOP THEM.....WAIT.....WHERE DID SHE GO?....HEY! GET BACK OVER HERE!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

NOW GET OUT THERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but.....Fine\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes back and peeps around the corner again. She blushes as she realizes somehting. \"This isn't going to be like the normal shows and books on this stuff, is it?\". \"NO.....ITS NOT\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature was issuing orders to the other ones, but that wasn't what surprised her. It was the fact that it wasn't wearing any clothes and she could see it dangling between its legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl then exits from one of the buildings and tries to run for it. The monsters notice her and the large one orders them to get her. One of the wolf/dog like creatures lunger at and rips her skirt and panties off with its teeth. She stumbles forward and tries to keep running, but a 2nd one had caught up and tackled her. She fell on her stomach and the monster then leaped on her. She was screaming and yelling and it then started to lick her face. It then jammed its dick into her and started to rape her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked on in shock and horror. \"YES. THATS THE KIND OF BEINGS THEY ARE. I'LL GIVER YOU A MORE INDEPTH EXPLANATION LATTER. THEY DO THIS KIND OF THING TO WHATEVER PLANET THEY GO TO. AND THAT ISN'T THE ONLY THING THEY USE THE POPULATION FOR. SURE, THEY USE THEM FOR FUN, OR TO CREATE MORE OF THEM, BUT THEY ALSO HAVE MANY OTHER REASONS. THIS IS WHY YOU MUST STOP THEM.

THAT BUTTON IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. THAT IS WHAT WILL TRANSFORM YOU\". \"Here goes nothing!\", and she presses the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe watch starts to glow. Then the clothing on her arm was ripped off of her and it spread all over her body leaving her naked. \"Ahh-ahhh-ahh\", she was too surprised to form words. She then feels a pusling sensation deep inside her. Her entire body started to get hot as it began to change. Her short brown hair started to grow and change to a deep blue color as her dark black eyes changed to a bright glistening blue. Her average breasts increased in size. Her ass plumped up and she gained a few inches in height. A white bra, pair of panties, and socks appeared on her followed by a short white top. A pair of blue shoes appeared on her feet and a blue vest with a single button in the middle appeared over the shirt, showing her stomach,  with 2 long sleaves and a short blue skirt went over her panties. The last thing that appeared was a white ribbon that was tied in her now long hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what happened to me? My breast and by butt! Their bigger! And these clothes! I dont want to wear anything like this!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT SHOULD BE FINE! GET OUT THERE!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell its fine!

NOW GO HELP THOSE PEOPLE!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud scream came from the girl as the monster wolf came inside her. It pulls its now limp member out of her and backs off of the heavily panting girl. With its cum dripping out of her, she can only watch as another one takes its place. Her face tenses as the 2nd monsters dick's tip starts to penetrate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange sound, and a small beam of blue light zips through the air and hits the wolf square in it's head. It's dick exits the girl as it falls over, dead. The remaining 4 wolf monsters and the lizard leader one turn towards the alley and see the new Megan standing there. \"Who The Hell Are You?\", the lead monster shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Uhhh...my name is.......Ah!....You dont need to know my name!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your going to die soon anyway!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Bitch!

BUT THEY SHOULD BE NO MATCH FOR YOU\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one reaches her, but she still was panicking a bit. It lunges at her, her eyes widen and mouth opens. Then her face tenses up, her eyes close, and her left fist hits the lunging wolf. It flies backwards, past the other wolves and lands at the feet of their leader. The wolves freeze in place and look at the dead monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was just surprised. She looked at her hand and the wolf over and over. \"D-did I do that?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader monster looks down at it in disbeliefe. He then looks at her and he looked pissed. \"How the hell can a human have that power? And what are you idiots looking at? Get her or I will kill you!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolves then start to growl at her and resume their attack. \"Uh.....I think I made them mad.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey attack as a group, and catch her off guard. One of them even manage a hit and tears the sleeve off of her right arm. But they didn't stand a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of the three falls to a kick to the face, the next one is slammed into a building, and the last one was smashed under a car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually did it! That was awesome!\". She was excited by her new found power. But the leader was just plain mad. His fists were clenched and you could see the veinds in his head. \"How could a mere human make such a fool out of me! No! I wont let this go any farther! She is dead! I'll kill her myself! We dont need someone as troublesome as her!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around only to see a fist which hits her square in her face. She was pushed back a bit, but nothing else happened. \"What?! Thats all it did?!\". It wouldn't accept it and kept attacking her. And she fought back. Multiple punches, kicks, and various throwing of each other and objects happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! I can tell. She is stronger than me. I've only lasted this long because she seems to be new at this.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt attacks again. She jumps and avoids it. Landing on the hood of a car, but looses her footing and falls. It take this chance. Grabbing a nearby piece of metal that broke off of something during the fight, he leaps at her and manages to grab her arms. He then bends the metal around her wrists. She had been captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-let me go you bastard!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. No way. With all the trouble you caused me\". He turns her around and brings her face lvl with his. \"Oh? Now that I've gotten a good look at you, your really hot. Maybe I will keep you alive\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe places her face up on the hood of a nearby car and looks her over. \"Yes. Your taller than most female humans. You have large breasts and seem to have wide hips. You are going to be a highly prized specimen!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not going to use me for anything!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much spirit..... This is too hard to resisit. I think I'll use you first\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt uses its free hand and rips off her vest, shirt, skirt, and panties. \"Such a great body you have. This is going to be good\". It doesn't bother with any foreplay or teasing or anything like that. It simply lifts up one of her legs then rams its massive dick into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying this are we? You can deny it all you want, but the sounds your making and your body is telling me otherwise\". It lets go of her hands and grabs her by the waist. Lifting her up it uses its hands to pump her up and down along its massive shaft. \"Just about done!\", it says, as it starts to push and pull her faster. He pushes down onto his dick as it rams upwards into her, releasing a huge load of cum into her. Her stomach bulges a bit as it continues to pour into her. \"You had better get use to this. Were going to have you replace those monsters you killed and then some!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired from the ordeal, she looks up at his grinning face. Placing her bound hands on his head, \"what could you possibly do now?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-your forgetting something\", she manages to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is that?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How I killed the first monster!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words slowly sink in. One of her fingers starts to glow. \"YOU BI-\", a blue beam of energy leaps from her hand and goes through the monsters head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey fall seperate ways. The monsterhits the ground, already dead, and Megan falls backwards and lands on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lays there for several minutes. Then she lifts her hands, managing to get a finger in the right position, fires another one of those beams and frees her hands. She gets to her feet and looks at the battle damaged section of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I did it!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES YOU DID. GOOD JOB\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD USE THE WATCH TO CHECK ON HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE CAPTURED AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. THEN YOUR SUPPOSE TO FIX THEM. BUT IT SEEMS THAT THAT ONE GIRL OVER THERE WAS THE ONLY ONE.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan goes over to the barely consciouls girl and after making sure she was alright, vanishes into the city.</span></div></div>",

Great, now I have to clean up his mess\". The voice belongs to the new lead monster sent to take the city. It was a huge purple female naga with a lighter purple stomach. She has large breasts, black eyes, and black hair. \"Who could of done this though? He should of been able to handle what little defences were here. So is something else responsible?\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake woman was holding onto something. It was a girl. As Megan makes her way towards her, she had already captured 4 nearby girls who were too curious. She had one, and the other 3 were having fun with the wolf monsters that she brought with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts up the frightened girl, \"now then, my tasty little morsel. All of this work has made me a little hungry, and I think you will hit the spot just nicely!\". Her long forked tongue then starts to lick the girl's face, her face cringing with every touch. Then, she hears something. And it sounds like its coming her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan leaps from the same alley and hits the ground and skids as she turns towards her second opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell is that? Wait, what she just did..... I see. It was you, wasn't it? The one that killed them\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That thing is the next one. And it has more of those wolves with her. Lets see, 6 of them. Ok, I can do this..... Get away from those girls now! This is your only chance!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are the one. Interesting. Keep holding onto them! The rest of you, get her! She will make an excellent addition to my collection!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 3 that weren't holding one of the girls rush her. \"Heh, I'm ready for you this time\". One leaps at her, she easily catches it and throws it into another, followed by her finger beam, killing the 2 of them instantly. The sight of her easily dispatching the other 2 wolves made the last one freeze in place. This briefe pause resulted in a double knee slam from Megan to it's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that was easy!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is good. No wonder he lost to her. But has let her guard down\", she points one hand at Megan, and uses her other to keep holding onto the girl. A strange sound fills the air, Megan looks at the naga and sees that she has a hand pointed at her. It starts to glow a dark purple, than a massibe blast of energy shoots out and is heading straight for her. \"Oh sh-\". The blast flies past and explodes into the side of a building. \"What a waste. But its over now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that was close!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan had barely avoided it. She was hanging from a street light, her skirt slightly singed. She climbs up onto the street light and points her fingers at the remainging wolves. Multiple blasts from her fingers strike each wolf. \"Nows your chance! Run!\", she yells at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your all thats left. Let her go, now!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it doesn't respond. She lifts up the girl and quickly drops her into her mouth and quickly swallows. \"I let her go\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats not what I meant!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont get so mad..... I'll send you to see her shortly!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan and the monster start shooting their energy attacks at each other. This goes on for several minutes, neither one able to get close enough to each other. \"This isn't good! I have to get to her before it digests her!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CALM DOWN. SHE WONT BE HARMED\". \"B-but\". \"EVEN IF SHE IS COMPLETELY DIGESTED, SHE WILL BE FINE\". \"H-how?\". \"THEIR TECHNOLOGY IS FAR MORE ADVANCED. THEY CAN EASILY CHANGE HER BACK. IT ATE HER SO SHE COULD FIGHT YOU AND NOT WORRY ABOUT HER ESCAPING\". \"B-but it IS digesting her, right?\". \"OF COURSE, SHE SHOULD ALREADY BE SOFTENING UP IN THERE. BUT YOU CAN CHANGE HER BACK AS WELL, AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE WATCH, YOU JUST HAVE TO GET HER OUT OF THERE\". \"Ok\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having to worry about her for the moment, Megan calms herself down and tries to think of a way to stop her. \"I got it!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother blast from her opponent is heading straight for her. Megan immediately starts her plan. She grabs a nearby car and throws it at erh enemy's attack. The car explodes upon impact. \"What?\". Megan dashes for her, the explosion and smoke shielding her from her adversary's sight. She leaps from the smoke and scores a direct hit to her face. It hits the ground hard. Megan leaps onto her and starts to hit her over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she forgot about her tail. It suddenly wraps around her. \"O-ow! That hurt! But it seems that you forgot about my tail!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-damnit!\".</span></div></div>",

Her mouth suddenly opens up and comes down on Megan's head, her face getting covered in saliva as her tongue goes back and forth across her prey's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit! I better think of something soon. Uhhh, just thinking about what could happen, no, I will get out of this...... Maybe....Will that work?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan suddenly stops struggling, \"What? Giving up already? Thats no fun!\". She clenches her right hand, \"concentrate\", and it starts to glow. \"Now! Take this!\", and slams her fist into the snake girl's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head shoots out of the creature's mouth and the creature herself is pushed back a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, \"that didn't work?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, Again! Man, that surprised me! That could of been dangerous. Looks like my meal saved me!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach swishes and sloshes as she grabs it. \"Her body was just barely holding itself together. She took your punch and her body fell apart. Heh, nice try though\". Her grip on Megan had loosened, and she was beginning to retighten it. \"No you don't!\", Her hands start to glow again and she grabs the alien's tail and frees herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't let go, she starts spinning her, then slams her against the pavement. Rushing over to her stunned opponent, she lifts her up with her left hand. \"Now I will get her out of you!\", her right fists hits her stomach at an upward angle and the contents of her stomach come flying out of her mouth. The trapped girl, now free, hits the steet with a splat, now almost a liquid. Megan then gives her another powered punch to her gut and sends her flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looks over to the girl, \"I'll fix you in a second\", then looks back, but the naga girl had vanished. \"Tch, she got away\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES, SHE ESCAPED. BUT THAT WAS A GOOD FIGHT. YOU EVEN GOT A NEW MOVE OUT OF IT. YOUR GETTING BETTER\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I'm actually beginning to enjoy this. Guess I should restore her now. And how do I do it?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OPEN UP THE WATCH. IT WILL DETECT HER AND SAY THAT SHE NEEDS TO BE RESTORE ON THE PANEL. IT WILL SHOW YOU WHERE SHE IS, THOUGH YOU ALREADY KNOW, IT WILL TELL YOU TO PRESS THE PANEL TO RESTORE HER\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens up, the screen appears and it does detect her, she goes over to the almost puddle girl, holds the watch over her, and presses it when told. The watch begins to glow and a bolt of white energy hits the puddle. The puddle begins to vibrate and slowly reforms back into a girl. She stares up at Megan, then passes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHE'LL BE FINE. BUT I SUGGEST YOU LEAVE\", he says, with sirens in the distance. \"Yeah, your right, lets go\". She leaves, transforms back, and heads for home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan is now in her PJs and is just about to go to bed. She slips under the covers, \"what a day. It still feels like I'm dreaming. *Yawn*, time to sleep, I have school tomorrow. \"Keep going about your daily lives\", huh?\", she says, remembering a news broadcast she heard a little earlier. She yawns again, then falls asleep.</span></div></div>",

Megan looks on in fascination as the the girls, including the 2 she knows, are being raped right in front of her. She watches as some of they yell, moan, and the monsters frequently move them around and cum inside and on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother snap from the plant girl and the monsters stop and drop them onto the floor. \"Oh? Looks like you ladies enjoyed that. Too bad its over, or is it?\".  One of the girl's starts to yell, \"Nn? M-my stomach? Something is moving in my stomach!\". One by one, each girl grabs their stomachs as they start to swell. \"Aahhh.....hhhhnnn....somethings....coming out...\". Her pussy opens up as the tip of whatever was in her slowly emerges. It suddenly pops out of her and hits the ground. It was a large green egg, and each girl gives birth to a few of these. They lay there, twitching, with glazed over looks in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ok, maybe I should of stopped that. But why didn't that happen to me? That monster came inside me as well. Was it because I transformed? Oh well, time to save them\". She raises both hands and points her index fingers into the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats a long enough break. Do it again!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's finger beams suddenly soar thorugh the chamber and strikes a lot of the female monster's underlings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-whos there!?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo\", Megan replies after revealing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter. All you need to know is that I'm here to stop you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe orders the remainder of her monsters to attack. Tentacles fly at her, she dodges most of them. But one manages to wrap around her left arm. Another one is heading straight for her. Megan quickly uses her free hand to grab and tear the tentacle that was on her off. She barely dodges the incoming tentacle, it takes off her skirt, and grabs it. She pulls this one in, just like the first one, and gives it a solid punch as it reaches her. She then throws it and it collides with another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more tentacles from 2 more creatures come at her. She dodges and jumps, but one gets her legs and slams her into the ground. More come at her. She blasts the tentacle off of her leg and rolls, barely avoiding the attacks and losing her vest and panties in the process. She gets to her knees and fires a few more shots at the monsters and takes a few more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne monster manages to surprise her. One of it's tentacles comes up behind her and thrusts itself up her bare ass. \"Aahh! You bastard!\". It starts to push deeper inside her and slows her down. She starts to make mistakes. More attacks make it through and she loses every piece of clothes, except for her shoes and the ribbon in her hair. The tentacle, now deep in her ass, releases its load deep inside her. Forced to one knee, \"NNGGHH? T-that wont stop me!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls onto her back, dodging another attack and then shooting the attacking monster. She lifts up her legs, \"I hope this works\". Clenching her ass shut, she concentrates, then pushes, the entire contents trapped inside by the tentacke, and the tentacle itself, come flying out. \"Whoa. Ugh. That...was different. Would that be a new ability? What a way to learn one\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing off the one responsible for that, she gets to her feet and looks around. The chamber, now in ruins, is littered with dead monsters. But, the lead one, and the eggs, were long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh*. Another one got away\". Walking over to the girls, who just stared at her, too exhausted to do anything, she looks them over, \"better check to see if their all right\". She opens the watch and the screen pops up. Pressing a few buttons, she has it check Lisa, Christie, and the rest of the girls. \"Looks like you girls will be allright, your just tired and need to rest\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around, hearing noises coming towards her from the tunnel she came from. She points the watch at it, \"some people are coming, guess someone heard me making a hole in the restroom floor\". Looking at the girl's, \"looks like its time for me to leave, later!\". She dashes into one of the other tunnels and away from the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to find a way out of here and back to class! What am I going to say?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finds a way out and leads her behind the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELCOME BACK, I GUESS YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL THEN?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, though it got away\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tells the voice what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COULDN'T BE HELPED. YOU SHOULD HURRY BACK TO CLASS NOW\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe transforms back and heads back to class.</span></div></div>",

Pulling up her pants, she turns around and looks into the toilet. \"....A-at least it was only one....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU SHOULD DESTROY THE EGG\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!!!!! Did....did you watch that?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....NO, OF COURSE NOT\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right..........And I know I should destroy it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT STATING THE OBVIOUS. THE STRENGTH OF A MONSTER DEPENDS ON WHAT IT CAME OUT OF. SINCE THAT ONE CAME FROM YOU AND WAS PUT IN YOU WHILE TRANSFORMED.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would make it a pretty strong one\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT THOUGH. I WANT YOU TO TRY TO DO YOUR FINGER BEAM WITHOUT TRANSFORMING\". \"What?\". \"JUST TRY IT\". \"Ok.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe points her right index finger and it does start to glow, though not as strong as when shes transformed. \"How? I havent transformed!\". \"YOU CAN ALREADY DRAW ON SOME OF ITS POWER\". \"Huh?\". THE POWER OF THE WATCH WILL EVENTUALLY BE YOURS. MEANING THAT YOU WONT HAVE TO TRANSFORM OR EVEN HAVE THE WATCH ON TO USE IT'S ABILITIES\". \"Really?\". \"YES, REALLY\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weakened beam fires from her fingertip and pierces the egg. Megan pushes the handle and flushes the broken egg. \"Time to get to class\", she says, leaving the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the classroom, \"Megan? Y-your alright!\". She gets swarmed by her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, why wouldn't I be?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you went to the bathroom! Haven't you heard?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....No.....Did something happen?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a loud sound from the bathroom and someone found a dead plant thing and a hole in one of the stalls that lead to a tunnel. Some people went down there and found dead creatures and Lisa,Christie, and 10 other girls down there\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, where were you? You told us you went there?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Ah! I went to a different one. I heard some strange sounds when I opened the door, so I decied to go to a different one, good thing, huh?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were gone for so long though?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....!!! My stomach was a little upset, so I was in there for a little bit\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well at least your safe\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more announcements and some time later......</span></div></div>",

Don't move\".<br>\r\nSarah: W-what are you going to do?\".<br>\r\nMegan just glances at them, and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks into the middle of the street and takes a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALRIGHT YOU INVADING BASTARDS! HERE I AM! OUT IN THE OPEN! COME GET ME FIRST! I DARE YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah&amp;Ellie: !!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monsters take the bait and focus on Megan; however, she didn't have the time to transform, as the first one was on her in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a wolf, it lunges at her. Megan manages to avoid it by stepping to her left, then, reacting quickly, hits the side of the wolf with a swift kick. It's sent flying a little bit, but not as far as if she was transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monsters, and her friends, were surprised. Using this chance, Megan dashes for the remaining wolf in front. She grabs it and throws it in the direction of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the moment that she was waiting for. Lifting her left arm, she presses in the center of the watch, rotates it counterclockwise twice, lifts the bottom up, and presses the button.....</span></div></div>",

She lived in the school dorms, alone since hers was the room left over, and she had a bed all to herself, a TV, and one desk. Her parents didn't really keep in touch - they loved her, and they loved each other, and she loved them, and they all knew they loved each other, but her parents just weren't at their happiest when they were together. They were always off doing their own thing - her father was a professional Chess player, and a fairly well-known one, and her mother was a professional scatologist. Over the dinner table, Dad would always talk about how close he was to winning the last game he played, or he'd recite an entire Chess game by rote, and Mom would always talk about how poop could be used to fuel the world's power supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody asked Megan how her day was. Nobody really cared. They enjoyed being together, but they loved their work even more. Which is why Megan ran away into the school dormitories. There, at least, she could be alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lazily turned the news on. It was a special on what she'd been doing over the past day... wait... those weren't her conquests! Somebody else had been doing the same thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Voice,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW. SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF, 'YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME GOAL.' RIGHT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you're not wrong, but... didn't you tell me that I was the only one who could do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I MAY HAVE EXAGGERATED A BIT. CERTAINLY, FINDING SOMEBODY WHO <i>CAN</i> DO SO IS LIKE SEARCHING FOR A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK. BUT YOU ARE NOT NECESSARILY UNIQUE. AND IT APPEARS YOU HAVE COLLEAGUES.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Megan said, smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s a load off my back. So, you went and gave somebody else a watch like mine, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHAT IS INCORRECT ON TWO COUNTS. FIRST, THEIR WATCH WILL NOT HAVE BEEN EXACTLY LIKE YOURS. AND SECONDLY, I CHOSE YOU AS MY CHAMPION. I CANNOT HAVE CHOSEN ANOTHER.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, there are\u2026 others like you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI HAD THOUGHT OTHERWISE. HOWEVER, IT APPEARS THAT IS CORRECT.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d Megan said, and was just about to relax again when there came a knock at the door. \u201cComing,\u201d she said loudly.</span></div></div>",

He wasn\u2019t really a violence person, and if he learned that she was fighting, for whatever reason\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI SEE. YOU LIKE HIM,\u201d the voice said, its monotone somehow managing to project amusement. Megan immediately blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2026 what about the recent, you know\u2026 invasions?\u201d Megan asked, just to hold a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s the other reason I came to you,\u201d Derek said. \u201cThere\u2019s been two girls running around beating the crap out of the aliens. Do you know who they are, by any chance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2026? No, I don\u2019t, how would I?\u201d Megan asked, her voice higher than normal. \u201cWell, if that\u2019s all, could you please leave? Like, now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOverstayed my welcome, have I? Fine, I\u2019ll go,\u201d Derek said. \u201cWell, if you find anything, you know who to tell. Thanks, and bye.\u201d He left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan released a breath she hadn\u2019t known she was holding. \u201cThat was close,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN CLOSER,\u201d the voice observed. \u201cAND THAT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY HAVE BEEN A BAD THING.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrying to play matchmaker, Voce?\u201d Megan asked tiredly. \u201cForget it. I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU MISTAKE MY IMPLICATION. I MEANT TO STATE THAT HE HAD UNCANNY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT OUR SITUATION, AND TIMING THINGS CLOSER COULD WELL HAVE REVEALED HIS SOURCE OF INFORMATION.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s himself,\u201d Megan said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been like that. Well, not <i>always</i> always, but you know what I mean. He\u2019s smart, observant, and he has a photographic memory. It\u2019s no wonder he suspects me of being one of the girls on the vanguard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHAT MAY BE SO,\u201d the Voice said. \u201cBUT HOW DID HE KNOW THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the Voice mentioned it, Megan did think it was suspicious. \u201cYeah, good point,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll ask him at school tomorrow.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You know, Ellie and Sarah? They said that a mysterious girl with an overall blue color scheme saved them from the monsters. Then my mom called and said she was saved from monsters by a girl with an overall yellow color scheme. Two and two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense.

She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, there are at least two more of them, maybe more,\u201d Derek concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least two more?\u201d Megan asked. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have blue and yellow,\u201d Derek said. \u201cSince this is starting to look like frickin\u2019 Power Rangers, we\u2019re missing a primary color.

I mean, one of them has blue hair. It\u2019d be kind of\u2026\u201d she trailed off, not even knowing what she was saying anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek said. \u201cThe blue hair actually supports my point. But tell me something, Megan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? What is it, Derek?\u201d Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCAREFUL\u2026\u201d the Voice warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was kind of suspicious about how you didn\u2019t immediately contest my point that there were two girls,\u201d Derek said. \u201cSo I did some snooping around. Megan, your schedule around the time of each incident provides you with a solid alibi, for lack of a better term. You stayed at home during the first such incident, you didn\u2019t go into the bathroom that eventually got the hole in it, and according to Ellie and Sarah, you weren\u2019t there when they were attacked. You can\u2019t have seen either girl. So tell me, how did you know that one of them has blue hair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201d Megan asked. \u201cYou said one of the girls had on a blue vest and had blue hair, and \u2013 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only said that she had an overall blue color scheme,\u201d Derek said. \u201cAnd while I\u2019m at it, how did you know that she was wearing a vest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Snap!</i> Went the snare trap in Megan\u2019s mind. She was caught, and she knew it. The cafeteria was crowded; a bunch of people would know if she said something like, \u201cI\u2019m actually the blue one.\u201d What to do\u2026</span></div></div>",

The men were still clothed, but the women weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a strange machine in the room. It sort of looked like a portal. The kind you'd see in sci fi movies. The monsters were herding the girls through the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was about to jump in to save as many as she could from going through the portal when something surprising happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men that were being held in the room were brought over to one of the lizard monsters. The monster then forces them onto a strange metal platform. It then goes over to a series of machines and starts to mess with them. Megan can't help notice the faces on the men. As if they knew what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machines start to make noise and come alive as the platform the men on start to vibrate and glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizard monster 1: And with this, all of the people here have finished being prepared.<br>\r\nLizard monster 2: Yes. The commander will be glad when these new supplies reach the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothing on the men just vanish, that was the trigger and what drew Megan's attention to them. She notices that they seem to be getting smaller. Confused at first, but then it hits her when most of their hair lengthens. (Oh my god! Their turning them into women!). Breasts erupt from their chests as their figures become more feminine. The last step that she saw was their dicks shrinking into them, leaving a familiar crevice in it's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan: .....<br>\r\n\"......\"(&lt;----Mysterious Voice)<br>\r\nMegan: ( And what the hell was that!?)<br>\r\n\"(I BELIEVE THEY WERE TURNED INTO WOMEN)<br>\r\nMegan: (No, really!? I meant why did they do that to them!?)<br>\r\n\"(WELL...I CANNOT SAY FOR CERTAIN, BUT I DO REMEMBER MENTIONING THIS TO YOU. THAT THEY ARE KNOW FOR THIS. FOR BREEDING OR BETTER ENTERTAINMENT. MOST PREFER WOMEN. THE MEN ARE OFTEN USED FOR LABOR. THOUGH I GUESS THIS TIME THEY WANTED WOMEN. IT IS THE START OF AN INVASION AFTER. THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR NUMBERS UP)<br>\r\nMegan blushes from this.<br>\r\n\"(BESIDES, NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR THIS. YOU MUST SAVE AS MANY AS YOU CAN. MOST OF THE STUDENTS IN THIS BUILDING HAVE PROBABLY ALREADY BEEN SHIPPED TO WHEREVER THAT PORTAL LEADS).<br>\r\nMegan: !!!! Thats right! I have to go!</span></div></div>",

He falls on her breasts, and she turns bright red. Instincively, she puts more pressure on her chest with her arms as she tries to cover them up even better than she already was. \"K-katie *cough* please calm down!

The paper clearly reads, \"Dear Alexander Grimwood, I am delighted to have such a bright young man such as yourself come to a academy like ours. So, to put it in simpler terms your application was excepted. You have received a full paid scholarship to come live with us through the rest of your academic career. Sincerely, the headmaster of Mythos Academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bus hits a huge bump in the road, causing the bus to bounce, along with the bag in a his lap. Suddenly Alexader's nerves get to him... and the panic switch in his head flips on. <i>Heck, even the air seems to be shaking with every bump, but it's probably my nerves. I'm the only one on this bus. Which is heading to a, extremely, prestigious school. One that is its own High school, College,... and its very own city-state. It even has its very own government, ran by the chairman of both schools and their student governments. What if I do something wrong!</i> He realizes he's overthinking it and take a deep breath, then continues. <i>Okay. Calm down. I'm the only survivor of a animal testing facility that got nuked. And I have a clean permanent record, along with not a single grade below a 99! Ms. Scrooge gave me a 99 when I deserved a 100, that old hag! But anyway. What am I worrying about, I should be perfectly fine. Maybe I'll even get put on the student council on my first day! Yeah, that's my goal.</i> Then he remembers about his \"special\" qualities. <i>Crap... If I join the student council... I'll probably be exposed... And seen as a freak... Then what is supposed to be the time of my life will turn into a living hell...</i> One of his thoughts escape his mind and flow out of his mouth. \"Why me!\" It bounces around the bus and reaches the bus driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The woman who is driving the bus pulls over and begins to make her way down the bus isle towards the only occupant. She looks like she is her mid twenties with a big pair of warm, chocolate eyes. Shoulder length, silky, brown hair. And a pair of... Well, Let's be frank. A HUGE pair of bouncy boobs somehow mounted onto a unbelievably attractive, and very feminine body. All of which was covered by a flattering green shirt with a long pencil skirt. She quietly sits in the seat next to the Alexander, and politely taps him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Alexander slowly looks in the direction of the woman, not wanting to face the world at the current moment. He looks her strait in the eyes and somehow is zoned out enough to not see the pair of melons less then a foot from his face. She begins the conversation by asking.<br>\r\n  \"Young man what is your name?\"<br>\r\n  \"Alexander Grimwood.\" He quietly says.<br>\r\n  \"What a unusual and cute name. Mine is Emilia Meadows.\" She begins to reach her hand out as she speaks.<br>\r\n  \"So Alex, what seems to be troubling you?\" She continues.<br>\r\n  \"Well... I *Mph!*\" He is cut short by Emilia grabbing the back of his head and pulling it into her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a second Alexander realized where his face was pressed into her very soft, comfortable Boobies. First his entire face turns scarlet red, then he struggles, quickly breaking free of her alluring grip. He quickly began to yell out of frustration and a hint of confused arousal. \"What the heck was that!\" She shrugs and calmly says. \"You seemed upset, so... I did something to make you feel better.\" He stops yelling and blinks a couple times, only for his embarrassment gets the better of him. He just stares, gawking at the unbelievably attractive woman. Her pleasant smile and calm demeanor finally gives and the blood rushes to her cheeks. She immediately looks down and stairs at ground, to ashamed by the thing she had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Alexander quickly realizes that she went out of her comfort zone to help him. He tries to think of something to do, but his body just moves. Alexander reaches and wraps his arms around her. He slowly embraces her, giving her a soft hug. Somehow he manages to say. \"Th...Th...Thank you, Emilia.\" His face turns even more red and he releases her. Emilia doesn't look up or say anything, she just motions towards the front of the bus. Alexander looks realizing that someone had gotten on the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A woman, who looks no older than Emilia, was standing there with a slightly sadistic grin on her face. She defiantly wasn't as well endowed as Emilia though, but she had a very mature feel to her. She has on a casual business suit, with a lavender button up shirt. Her silvery hair was tied in a bun. The thing that seemed strange about her was her icy blue eyes that seemed to be cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The woman standing at the front of the bus begins to talk. \"I see you've already made a friend Mr.Grimwood. Or maybe you got lucky and already have the student council president wrapped around your finger?\" Alexander looks back and forth from the woman to Emilia, then most of the blood getting pumped around his body flowed to his cheeks. The woman smirks and continues talking. \"Anyhow, I am the Headmaster of this academy. I gladly welcome you, the first ever male to come to this academy.

The woman walks forward and gets in Alexander's face with a almost blank expression except for a slight smirk. \"Thank you for the complement, but both me and Emilia are not human.

You are eighteen, though you've been told you look younger, now finally a free woman after a couple of years in rather awkward foster care, and you have a mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long time now you've been... different. When you were twelve you didn't know much different. You thought everyone was like you. I mean, you LOOKED like everyone else, but your mom always did insist you not talk about your eating habits. \"They wouldn't understand.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen disaster struck a couple of years ago. Your mom often disappeared for a day or so, but never explained why she left other than 'important work.' But one time she never returned. After a couple of days you called the police, and at first not a lot happened. You kind of felt no-one wanted to believe a sixteen year old girl! But thinking back on it now it may have been they were trying to protect you while they searched. They never found a trace of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were alone, and at first were placed with a foster parent. That guy though... he 'returned' you rather quickly. You couldn't understand why. It was only a small pig after all. No big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stuff and your mom's was in a storage shed and you'd gone back to check on stuff while they tried to find another person to take care of you until you were of age, and you stumbled across a note book that the police had missed in it's hiding place (you never liked that statue anyway. Oops!) As you read you began to see red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom was tracking down dangerous monsters. Monsters that were invading a local all girl school. And her last notes were that one of them had started hunting <i>her</i>. Her last departure was to try and lure it away so it couldn't track you down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that school. You'd passed it a lot in town, and your mom had considered sending you there a long time ago, then abruptly changed her mind. Now you knew why! But you knew whatever had tracked her down had killed her. You just knew it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided then you were going to hunt down these monsters. Hunt them down and eat them! They'd never hurt anyone ever again! They could hide themselves as women teachers all they wanted, but you'd unmask them! You'd find the one that killed your mother and make them pay! Unfortunately you'd had to wait through two awkward years of care under others till you could make it on your own, and finally realized the other girls didn't generally eat meals larger than their own body mass once a month. You'd managed to learn to like some 'normal' meals and could pass for the others. You suspected, given what you'd seen on TV, that you were like a snake, at least on the inside. Though oddly snakes showed their meals once eaten. You didn't. At least you didn't have to worry about dieting like other girls apparently did. You still hadn't figured out what was up with that 'no bulge' thing and why it had freaked that first foster dad so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well. At last, onto the school!</span></div></div>",

For so long it remained dormant there until the day when the basement was opened by faculty members looking to gather some old stuff for the school. This was the opportunity for it to come out of hiding and experience what its like on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few weeks since it began to observe the school and all the people there, it quickly learned a lot about them and started to use its powers of mimicry to poke fun at both the students and the staff at regular intervals. At first, it was enough to satisfy its boredom, but eventually it wanted more. It developed feelings of attraction with some of the good-looking students in the school. Because of this, it developed feelings of attraction and carnal urges similar to humans, and now plans to use its abilities to explore this newfound desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it started plans to shapeshift as either other students or staff in order to gain the opportunity to interact with its targets better.

Yes she is a robot, though she does have some organic parts.

This is a surprise, I knew they were big, but not this big. I'm surprised someone of your height has breasts as big as these,\" she says as she examines and plays with her breasts. \"I gave her numerous functions, too many to explain right now,\" she slides her hands down to Heather's panties. \"Though don't think of her as a slave, she IS my bodyguard, but she has freewill, she listens to me of her own will, she truly has artificial intelligence. And now I am going to test one of her features on you, but don't worry, It's not like you'll die\".

A sudden flash of light makes her look to her left. Amanda was taking pictures of her. \"I must document you before the experiment starts,\" she says, taking a few more pictures. She stashes it away and walks back up to Heather. Putting her hand back on her face, she wipes away a tear and says, \"you shouldn't be so upset. If my theories are right, and they always are, you will feel pleasure beyond anything that I can describe. It will not hurt at all. Katherine, do it,\" she says, taking a few steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine finally removes her hand from her mouth. She then grabs Heather by her waist and lifts her up off of the ground.

There is no longer anyone around, so scream all you want\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of horror appears on Heather's face as Katherine starts to open her mouth. \"Yep,\" Amanda says, \"you are going in there\". She shoves Heather head first into her mouth. She makes it past her shoulders with ease, despite Heather's pointless struggles, while Amanda is taking pictures every second. She passes the breasts and makes it to her waist. \"Stop for a second Katherine,\" Amanda says, \"I want to get a few pictures of this\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather's ass and legs are the only things sticking out of her mouth. Amanda spreads her legs and tells Katherine to hold them while she takes pictures and prods around. \"Ok, finish up,\" she says and Katherine continues to swallow her. Katherine makes it past her ass and quickly sucks up her legs. Amanda takes one final picture as Katherine pushes her feet into her mouth and swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a satisfied look on her face, Katherine starts to rub her swollen stomach. \"Well this is unlike you. Did she taste that good?\" \"Oh, yes mistress, she tasted and felt great.\" \"Good, that means that that works properly. So, how is your body holding up? Any problems?\" \"No, no errors detected\". \"Good, just keep her in there for now. We should be getting home, I still need to check your arm, and give you a once over to make sure that nothing happened while you swallowed her\". \"Understood,\" Katherine says as they both head home, though in Katherine's mind, she is thinking, \"I'll gladly hold her in here for now, she feels great\".</span></div></div>",

As she sprayed the board with a small bottle of cleaner and a overly used rag, she smiled. She had finished the lesson early. Even though her class was completely unresponsive and full of girls who refused to do anything productive. That's kinda what she got for deciding to be the fill in for the one class that required nearly no effort, classical women's literature. It pained her how lazy her class was, but she needed a paycheck.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay. That's all for today...\" She paused. The class had already started the stuff their binders and notebooks into their bags, so she patiently waited for the shuffling to die down and continued.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's all the work for today, but tomorrow is Halloween and we are having the festival as previously mentioned... Any ideas what our class should do?\" She looked around after seeing only one had go up, then she called on the volunteer.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, Um...\" She stopped. She had never seen this boy before and didn't know his name, but the boy continued to speak anyway.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe we should set up a haunted house in the older part of the school. You know, where all the report of a ghost are seen and base it around ghost or stuff of that nature.\" The class immediately responded with a some approving whispers. The teacher nodded, for once someone had actually came up with a semi-decent idea for their part of the festival. Though, she was slightly concerned about how she didn't recognize the student.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay then, I'll get permission be able to set up there...\" She paused and took a deep breath. \"But I still need some of the class to volunteer to ring some of the needed materials. Curtains, paint, costumes, props. You know, The stuff that makes a haunted house valid.\" She finished and the class had grown silent. They were all the laziest and most irresponsible kids she had had in her year and a half of teaching. Honestly, it was a bit depressing for her to endure these vegetating teenagers. But the kid who suggested the idea spoke up again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's fine, I'll cover for anyone who fails to bring their some stuff tomorrow.\" He smiled happily and the teacher just mirrored his expression. This was the first student this semester who had decided to even try. She didn't even care that she didn't know him or that he was the only guy in the room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay young man. I'll hold you to your word. As for the rest of you, just bring something.\" The teacher jumped as the bell rang and all the students rushed out. There was no boy among the crowd and a worried whisper slipped out of the teachers mouth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's like he was never here... Maybe he was a ghost.\"</span></div></div>",

She was tired of the constant moving and transferring of schools that followed their work. So she decided to find a school and live at a dorm there, that is what brought her here to Hollowfield and the all girls high school near her dorm, Marchell High.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is Sunday, the day before her first day and the start of a new term at her new school. She had finished packing the day before and planned on exploring town today. The city itself was not all that big, her dorm was just outside of it, located near the school, but she was able to walk to the center of town. The people here seemed to be nice as she walked around, checking out the shops and various sites located throughout the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours pass, and she is about ready to go home. She passes by an antique store, and she decides to go inside. Now she isn't big on antiques, this is the first antique store that she has ever been in, but for some reason, she felt like going inside. She starts to browse the small shop, until something catches her eye. It was an old lamp, like the ones from the old genie stories that she use to read when she was younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in a case laying on a red pillow with yellow tassels and a see through glass top. She knew she had to have it, it reminded her too much of her childhood. She asks the old lady at the counter how much it was. \"Oh, that old thing? I found that so long ago. It has been in my attic for so long that I had forgotten about it. Let's see, the lamp and case will be $50. After thinking it over, she gets it, she knew that it must be hers. With her new lamp and case, she carries it to her dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatelyn has a single room dorm. There are girls that share rooms, but she wanted one to herself. She has a basic bed, wall lamp and dresser, the stuff that came with the room. \"This will be good for now,\" she says as she places the case on top of the dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't wait any longer. She opens the case and carefully takes out the lamp. \"Heavier than it looks\", she says to herself as she examines it. \"It looks just like the lamps from my old books and tapes,\" she says in a  happy voice. She grabs an old cloth of hers, she wants to clean it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitates, she knows it's ridiculous, some powerful being that's able to grant wishes. She convinces herself that it won't happen as she starts to rub the lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lamp starts to shake. This surprises her and she falls backwards. The lamp doesn't follow, it is now hanging in mid air, still trembling. Katelyn stares in disbelief as smoke starts to pour out of it. She is now staring at a....</span></div></div>",

I wish for you to be under my absolute power, you will do whatever I say until I use up my 3rd wish. Katelyn, was it? Follow me\".

Get in\". \"What?\", and she gets in. He takes off his old shorts. \"We're going to bathe together\", and he gets in the opposite side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so great! It's been so long since I had a bath this good! What's wrong? Oh, your embarrassed. I know how to help you get over that\". He starts to lift into the air, exiting the water and floating. \"Now, wash me!\". She looks up, surprised and still flustered. She involuntarily grabs some soap and a towel and washes every part of his body. Regaining control, she quickly turns around, and stares straight down at the water. \"Heh, still shy? Well, we're not done. You washed me, now I will was you!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifts her up and has her float directly across from him. He then picks up the soap and towel and proceeds to wash every single spot on her. He finishes, and has both of them exit. Having her towel off both of them, they exit the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the main part. Get on the bed and lay down on your back\", and she does. He floats directly above her, \"I promise, I'll be gentle. Spread your legs\". \"What? Please! Don't!\", but he doesn't listen. He starts to prepare her by playing with her breasts and both rubbing and licking her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ready now\". He gently inserts his large dick into her pussy and starts to move back and forth. She is moaning with joy and she is gripping the bed with her hands. \"Enjoying this are we? Well, of course you are. I am not controlling you right now and your not resisting\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just about to finish up, but I won't cum in you, yet\". He increases his pace. Quickly pulling out, he grabs his cock and cums all over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then heads back into the bathroom and exits with a wet towel. Using the towel, he cleans her off and throws the towel into the bathroom. She manages to sit up. \"That was great, wasn't it?\", she looks down, embarrassed. He smiles and sits down next to her. Placing his arms around her, \"we can do it whenever you want, you just have to let me out of my lamp\". She looks up at him and lays her head onto his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stay like this for a while. She then looks at a clock and sees that it's getting late and she has her first day of school tomorrow. Alucard notices her staring at the clock. \"I see, It's getting late. Fine then, I'll finish up\". He kisses her and lays her back, they then go a 2nd round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll use my last wish now. I wish that whether I am granting wishes or have used them all up, I can have Katelyn enter or exit my lamp at my own choosing\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is my 3rd wish, just rub the lamp whenever you want me to come back out\", he is then sucked back into the lamp. She picks up the lamp, but she suddenly feels a pulling sensation from it, she then remembers his last wish, and she too is sucked into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up, she sees Alucard sitting on a couch. The inside is amazing, there are fancy pillows, bed, couches, chairs, even the rug floor looks expensive. \"Nice place, huh? Too bad I rarely have guests\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you bring me in here?\". \"We'll, I though you might like to spend the night in here, I'll let you out in the morning\". \"Are you making me do this?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I made it wear off when I used um my 3 wishes\". She thinks, then sits on the couch, next to him. \"Alright, I'll stay the night, but I do need to wake up early tomorrow\". He places an arm around her, \"alright\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a TV appear and they watch it for a while, then they go to bed, him on his back with her laying against him, his arms around her, and they fall asleep.</span></div></div>",
